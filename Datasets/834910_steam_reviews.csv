Open world, character creation, custom ships.   These ideas are great on paper.   Execution is really frustrating.
Character creation is ugly.  I always look strung out(Come on, sliders?  Look at FF14 character creation and take some notes)
The terrain is buggy (gaps and floating rocks, mountains that are turn invisible from the wrong angle.)
NPCs turn fat and old any time I put armor on them. (What even IS that)
Enemies are occasionally bullet proof (Shot him with a dozen shots, no damage.   Arrows worked though!)
The taming system is ridiculous (Ark did it better)
The melee combat is just CLUNKY!  If I can't snipe an enemy, I don't bother anymore.   
Gold for a shipyard?  Who am I giving this gold to?   I built it myself!
The towns are just EMPTY.  and all the same.   
One time I started a new game and cooked to death in minutes in the newbie area.
I've beaten the kracken twice now, but I almost always have to resort to console commands to get around a bug in the game and for a game that's been out this long, they should have a solid foundation of stable mechanics that they're adding too.   But instead, they just add new broken features every now and then.   I was gonna do a Youtube review, but its just not worth the headache.   I will be avoiding Grapeshot Games in the future.

after splitting map, you ruined it... this game was once amazing, even with the bugs, but now? screw it!
DONT BUY!

second review... the devs fixed quite a lot... they came up with some horrible things as well, but in the end, it worked out so far... it is getting better and better and it really is getting fun to play!
the next patch will help with the territory claims too, so reach out and find your home, if youre fast enough, i might say... because we all know how cheesy ppl are and start claiming everything everywhere...

i saw a lot of thiefs around too... using bugs to get into houses, so lock everything, put windows, better 2 doors and you should be fine... even ppl luring alphas to you to get you killed and loot your stuff... this tho, is no issue of the game, but furthermore stupid players... 

me and my pals, we still enjoy our game, love building ships and even the taming went well so far... now i dare to recomment this game... hope this wont change :P...

well, i really like the ideas they came up with... also the genre is epic and the ocean really looks amazing so far... but sadly thats it... the launch was the worst i've seen so far, the gameplay is poor, and the servers are a true nightmare... so i really cant recommend the game in its current state... ill gladly wait until this game is ""finished"" (honestly, if ever... we all remember ark and the devs working on dlcs, without ever getting the game fixed properly) and would love to change this review to a positiv one if everything is working fine some day...",1545617003,1708722000,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

- Early Access Game (5+ years).
- Almost no online.

A game about pirates, where you will spend 80% of playing time on the islands, where you will grind an endless amount of resources and hopelessly try to protect your buildings from cheaters and unbearable lags.

Developers release mega-updates with unnecessary animals, useless new weapons and add unnecessary new islands when the game has about 3k players max online, instead of improving balance, improving optimization and adding new PvE and PvP content.

Having devoted almost 3,000 hours to Atlas, my experience has been a mix of passion and frustration. The game truly shines when you're part of a core group, ideally comprising 10 to 20 players. In such a setting, it's a blast. Be prepared for intense battles against large groups, often exceeding 80 players. Advancing to the premium content demands not only a robust team but also a strategic approach to safeguard your harbors and resources. However, always keep in mind that there's always a more formidable opponent out there, ready to overpower you.

Having experienced Atlas as both a solo player and within mega groups, I've found neither to be particularly enjoyable. The real joy comes from playing with a close-knit group of friends, those you can rely on in challenging times. The game oscillates between phases of updates, alternating from dreadful to fantastic, then back to dreadful. Despite this, Atlas possesses tremendous potential. Unfortunately, it seems the developers are more focused on appeasing the demands of the mega groups, of which there are about 20, each wanting the game to move in a different direction. This focus often overlooks finding that perfect balance which could make the game truly outstanding for a broader range of players.

This is basically ark, but pirates.
But also completely abandoned by the devs.

Nothing will get fixed, nothing will be improved.
Such a cool concept too, but it's yet another eternally unfinished attempt that will never be worth playing.

I tried, I gave it my best. Few hundred hours should be enough to determine, right?

The ships:
The ships are wildly inconsistent in design and implementation. Some ships have to be built plank by plank, and they allow you to do whatever, but then other ships are ""modular"" which come pre-built, but with parts that can be swapped. Just trying to understand which part can go on what ship is a chore. Almost nothing is explained in-game, the wiki is outdated by 3 - 4 years, and there's no info anywhere else. You end up wasting tons of valuable resources early on making parts that don't actually fit on your ship even though they appear to be nearly identical.
Even amongst the modular ships, some are just dog-crap, and only one or two are worth building. Most of the ships can barely turn, meaning you need to drop sails, then slowly pivot while stopped since you can't turn while moving.  Only two of the modular ships can turn at all while sailing.

The tames:
Tames are animals in the wild you can tame and then use for various purposes. What is never explained is that tames are basically vehicles and are absolutely essential. Rhinos can mine rock, Bears can gather fiber, cows with carts can carry tons of stuff. Problem is they get stuck on every little twig and bump in the ground, and when it happens it's like you're locked into that spot. No matter how much you turn or run, you become rooted in place for seemingly no reason. The only thing to do is back up EXACTLY the way you came into that spot, then go around it and hope it doesn't literally teleport you back to that spot and get stuck again, 'cause that happens a lot. And that's if you ride tames. If you try to have them follow you somewhere, they will get lost, get stuck, or maybe just jump off an actual cliff and die. If you're lucky, maybe one of them will go aggro on some random wild animal and get itself killed even though it's set to be passive and never attack. Trying to consistently toggle between stop and follow commands just doesn't work most of the time.  And even if you try to walk past a tame, their collision is never even close to the model of the animal, so you bump into stuff that isn't there, or get trapped and have to kill yourself or the tame that's trapped you.

Then there's the overall balance: 
Every ship part, weapon, or item has a rarity value. Common, Fine, Journeyman, Masterwork, Legendary, and Mythical.
You can find limited-use blueprints to make better, higher tier versions of everything. It doesn't require much MORE resources, just more variety. So instead of 100 wood for common, it might be 55 x2 so you could use 55 Oak, and 55 Poplar to build a fine rarity item. Each tier adds one to the count, so Mythical is 6x. Meaning you need 6 different types of each material for each item you make. So that means you need to grind and get resources from all over, not just one spot.
The problem? If you don't have the best quality stuff, you WILL lose. It's not a matter of skill, a common plank will take nearly double damage from a mythical cannon just because it's higher quality. But a mythical cannon can have its own damage bonus of up to 260% so you could be looking at 4 - 5x damage incoming. And the reverse is true. If you shoot a mythical ship with common cannons, you'll do almost no damage. Meaning you literally cannot compete since you just can't do enough damage even if you have 30 cannons to their 8. 

And that means PvP is almost nothing about skill, but rather about who has the time to grind for literal weeks to find the rare blueprints and then grind the huge amount of resources to make anything. So unless you get picked up by one of the giant factions, you'll just get sunk and killed without even having a chance at a fair fight.

Ultimately, most of the core mechanics barely work. There's no documentation or info on anything. I learned from some long-time players, but even they just shrug when asked about why some things are the way they are. The devs are gone, no updates or communication in more than a year, I think.

And even with all that, the sailing and pirate stuff is still appealing, but to get even a chance at it, you need to grind and grind. I'm talking days, weeks even. Just to get a humble setup... and then your stuff will probably be blown up by some griefer while you're offline. Most players don't fight, they just run away and wait till you go to sleep. And the game makes that easy by telling everyone exactly where your ship is at all times and when you're on or offline.

So yeah, don't waste your time. You get no reward for your efforts.",1706304776,1706304776,False,38,0,0.74431312084197998,0,True,False,True

 - Greatly procedural and dynamic environment with everything you see is a potential resource.
 -Full of  content by the type of genre it is
 -Non-exhaustive possibilities, strategies, abilities for what and how you can do stuff.
 -Heavy and Sincere modding support with mods for anything and everything
 -A very open minded multiplayer and online as well as LAN support with mod server support 
    and private server rentals available easily.
 -Made by artistic Devs standing out of the crowd but set backed financially
   unlike big money mighty studios like XBOX Game Studios, EA, UBISOFT, etc. 

CONS:

-Uncontrolled experience and gameplay especially in online multiplayer, there should have 
 been an admin layer controlling the stuff.
-Missing quest system makes it so open world that people do what they want and get bored, if 
 they were bound by quests instead it would be more interesting and rewarding as well as 
 satisfying to achieve and accomplish.
-Too much freedom
-Optimisation is a very very magical tool yet to be used by Atlas Devs. Optimisation really 
 matters for eg. an F1 hypercar can run a few miles at 60 km/h after being out of fuel due to 
 its optimised aerodynamics and weight design alone, its REALITY so Devs plz OPTIMIZE it.
-It looks like a neglected son of a father of two, crying for attention.


Verdict: 
If the parent company changes from anything other than snail games or its accomplices/sister/subsidiaries the devs can work on it to fix optimisation and deliver regular content and QOL improvements. But its stuck with this company which just releases games to reserve patents and rghts as there are not much similar games out there, not even close.

[h3] PVP [/h3]
Probably the best pirate game around if you want survival and PVP, at least with a pirate theme. Some of my best PVP gaming memories are from Atlas, being placed under siege, chasing player ships, battles etc. The real issues arise when soloing. You can't really do it on a PVP server. If you don't have a lot of hours to spend during the week on this game, at least about 10, you won't make it on PVP alone and getting picked up by a larger company is your only real hope to get anywhere. Not that it's bad but you kinda lose your own identity in the process, you'll just spend a lot of time doing B*tch work or raiding smaller companies. From time to time, you may engage with large companies, but they tend to like keeping their hold on power as opposed to risking it against each other.

[h3] PVE [/h3]
The PVE community is very welcoming, and definitely the place to be if you can't dump a lot of hours into the game. If you want to do all the fun quests and such, fight the Kraken etc, this would be the place to do that. Don't think it'll be something you're going to breeze through however. It's rather difficult to accomplish and rarely done solo. The enemies you will have to beat will have extremely high levels so actually putting in the time for gear and a good ship alone will keep you busy for a while. You won't  really have that chance on PVP because you'll likely be raided multiple times in the process. If you have never PVPed before Atlas may not be the best place to start, I recommend PVE until you know how to play.

[h3] Single Player [/h3]
The Single player/local host experience is, at the moment, just very bad. You don't have the same things available as with officials, and travelling between zones with friends can be hit or miss. I wouldn't expect it to get better either, the issue being that the development has essentially just stopped. More on that...

[h3] Current Status [/h3]
The game is basically as ""done"" as we can expect. I remain hopeful that it will get some love eventually but the games community was basically shrunk when the ""ships for gold"" update came out. This crippled it beyond repair. You no longer pay for ships today, but you still have to pay for the shipyard, whereas before, you only needed to gather the resources and that was all there was to it. With slow updates, and very small team, the likelihood we see Atlas reach it's full potential is slim to none.

1: your tames will disappear for no reason on ships. I lost my only good bears all at once and devs will not locate them. I spent 14 hours searching C3 for them covering every square foot of the map. They apparently disappeared after logging out. 
2: your npc's will starve to death. The one thing they made, food larders, will no longer take preserving salt, so you need to log in every day to feed them all. I don't live in mommy's basement so I actually have a life outside this b.s. game.
3: you'll spend many hours working through all the problems this game has only to find when you need a group to do the big fights to rank up and complete the game progress after level 78 or something, nobody is ever online. They get on long enough to prevent structure decay so they own all the land and you're forced to live on the other side of the world if you want to build a hut and not be starved for metal , etc...

First off, it's $30 so right off the bat, it's worth it for the total game that you get.
I have been a vet to quite a few companies in pvp as well as pve, so i'll start small and work my way to the broader scale of things.
I will be mostly reviewing from a non-single player Pov.
Single-playing this game all the way to the endgame is going to take as much time as a ultimate ironman on OSRS.. unless mods and altering settings, then go ahead and enjoy.
have fun to your hearts content.

Atlas is a game of creativity, strategy, and teamwork.
You start off on a free port and level up, gaining points to a skill tree and grab a raft or a ramshackle off the port and start your adventure, either joining or already joined a company. (discord can help with that, too)
In my opinion, the game is beautiful; regardless of being a lot to take in.

Use the map to your advantage to chart a course to where you like to go.
Depending on which console you're playing on, there a site that helps with WHAT is on which island..

https://atlas.antihax.net <-- map with resources on islands (may contains spoilers)

People say that Atlas is just Pirate Ark, which they are entitled to their opinion.
I wouldn't know since I've never played Ark.
That being said, what Atlas brings is so many mechanics that many people simply can't adapt to.

You'll find that some people are either good on land..
    (Whether it be farming, taming, base building, production such as gathering resources, scouting for companies to raid or weak points in an enemy companies base, base combat/defense, treasure hunting, ship building, etc.)
AND TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE DAMN SHIPS
there's 2 general types of ships, legacy and modular
Legacy = you literally build them from the skeleton of the hull, hull pieces, mast, ect.
Modular = pre-build with a little bit of customization with those ships, but some have special features.
Hey, at least you have options, they could've thrown away the whole legacy ships out the damn window, but they didn't.

..and you'll also find those who excel on the waters.
   (Navigation, naval combat, shipwrecks, flotsam grappling, sailing, SOTD battling, Fishing.. whether that be with a pole or harpooning the larger fish if you dare doing in the ocean, or simply just enjoying the voyage and seeing where it takes you.)
..Probably to another damn island with either a base right where you park with 50 cannons pointed at you (pvp) or a player-made trading port (pve) which good luck stopping if your render distance is feeling like working with you..

You have so much at your fingertips, the hardest part is to simply take small bites and enjoy them.

Now, I love the survival aspect of it.
Hunger, thirst, vitamin management, hot/cold temp management, ect.
It adds to the challenge that you should always be prepared for what you're getting yourself in for on a journey.
A lot, and A lot of people will blame this game because of their own misfortune. Plan ahead, you'll have a much better time, trust me.

Another point many peers fail to realize about this game is that it is NOT a walk in the park and it TAKES TIME.
You're going to die, but you should learn from your mistakes, regardless of pve or pvp. 
You learn how to counter things, build properly, and be a better pirate.
Getting ganked by a shotgun brig with swivel guns that have flame shots and grape shots is never fun, but you can learn from it.. if you can't beat em, join em! lol
Unless moby spotted you, then, well.. GG.

Something I want to add, since we are getting to the meaty part of the review.
In case you weren't aware, most this community is VERY toxic. 
(should come as no surprise, honestly; but it felt like this needed to be said)
Most will say ""It's a pirate game"" which, yes, they are right.
In my experience, being a GREAT company, you do enough damage where you don't totally break your enemy's spirits, you leave them wanting more to fight and give them a drive to fight better next time.
That or they quit.
Then you complain that the game is dead content because there's either nobody to fight or you get ambushed by 4 different allied companies.
Some times, some things just aren't in your favor and that's okay.
We live and learn, Amiright?

The problem(s) I have with this game, No days off.
It was so stressful at times, bouncing between my work, family, and investing into this game that took a lot of my time because it lot happens in companies when you're lawless and 15 ships roll up.
yeah, sure, you can snag a controlled island, if you're lucky.
     Controlled isles have a peace time and war time, can only be set once, then you have to wait a week if you want to change the peace time, guess who found that out the hard way? :D
Which if you didn't know are set in U.K time zone... not the one you're in..
so for a week straight I was staying up from 6am to 2pm  defending my stupid island from invaders while i was working a job from 6-pm-5am.. mistakes were made. 
(pvp servers be like.. lol)
but again, we live and learn. It's just a game, after all. 
  Furthermore, Early access..
It's been some time now and i feel like too much was added too soon for the enjoyment of what the devs were trying to make. 
(not enough testing and too much bullying from the community because they weren't getting their way)
It's equivalent of ordering 15 pizzas on uber-eats during a hurricane and the only mode of transportation the poor fool has was a scooter.
The devs (in my opinion) were so focused on throwing content during these ""seasons"", they ended up not using half of the content they were showcasing. Deadlines never see past the reality that is error of testing and practice.
Rip, portals, I will miss you guys.
If the Atlas devs do happen to read this, you guys did a great job.
I hope you guys can keep doing on what your doing because this game made so many great memories and I really did have so much fun and plan on enjoying more as time goes on.
I can't really complain all that much about Atlas...
EXCEPT FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY OR UNHOLY, MAKE THE OPTION TO TURN OFF THE EAR RAPE HEARTBEAT WHEN I'M BELOW 20% HEALTH, PLEASE!!
That's all I want, I can deal with the flashing red screen. #MuteHeartBeat

Now buy the game and enjoy!
It's truly a wonder of a game as it is a nightmare.


p.s. when you build your shipwright, make sure there's actually enough clearance in the water.
You don't want to go through all that, and build the ship, only to drop the ship..
And the ship proceeds to jump 30 feet in the air, followed by doing somersaults along the shoreline until it capsized before you even give it a name..

If you've ever played Ark: Survival Evolved and found yourself thinking, ""What if we added ships to the mix?"" then ATLAS might be the game you've been waiting for. Developed by the creators of Ark, ATLAS offers a familiar survival experience but takes it to the next level by introducing an expansive open-world pirate adventure. While the concept is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired.

The first thing that strikes you about ATLAS is its breathtaking scale. The world is vast and filled with a variety of islands to explore, each with its own unique challenges and opportunities. The addition of ships brings a new dimension to the survival genre, allowing players to engage in epic naval battles, explore the high seas, and even build their own seafaring vessels.

However, the similarities to Ark are hard to ignore. The graphics, mechanics, and even some of the creatures feel like they've been lifted directly from Ark: Survival Evolved. While familiarity can be comforting, ATLAS struggles to establish its own identity and often feels like a mod or expansion rather than a standalone game.

The learning curve in ATLAS is steep, and the initial experience can be overwhelming for newcomers. The lack of proper tutorials or guidance may leave players feeling lost and frustrated, especially when dealing with the intricacies of ship management and navigation.

The game's performance has been a source of frustration for many players, with bugs, glitches, and optimization issues hampering the overall experience. Frequent updates have been released to address some of these issues, but the game still falls short of the polish one would expect from a title developed by experienced studios.

On a positive note, the multiplayer aspect of ATLAS can be a highlight for those seeking cooperative adventures. Forming alliances, engaging in sea battles, and building massive bases with your crew can be immensely satisfying, provided you can overcome the initial hurdles.

In conclusion, ATLAS has the potential to be an exciting and unique addition to the survival genre. However, its similarities to Ark: Survival Evolved and the technical challenges it faces prevent it from reaching its full potential. If you're a fan of Ark and yearn for a maritime twist, ATLAS might be worth a try, but be prepared for a rough voyage through uncharted waters.",1701857715,1701857715,False,32,1,0.747784316539764404,0,True,False,True

While there are still some noticeable bugs in the game, it has made very good efforts to correct the bugs that have been addressed. While a larger selection of ships would be great, the addition of the submarine is a nice addition, even though it is not without some bugs when attaching and detaching from a galleon.

It is a buggy mess, ladders throw you off, making building pieces attach can be a nightmare, hitboxes on NPCs can be weird basically it has all Ark's flaws except one critical one. This game respects your time more.

The claim system and setting a war/peace timer on your claimed island means you don't have to plan a rota to play this game, you set your timer to an 8 hour block (on official) or a 3 hour block (most unofficial)  and you can only be attacked within that period.

Some of the ship models are in dire need of an update, but the game is fun once you figure out how to reduce the grinding down to nothing (tames.... you need em even if you think you don't).

The level of freedom this game offers to fuck about and dick on people while avoiding being constantly offlined  is excellent. Official servers for PVP are only in US at present (stupid) so if you are EU expect 180 ping, but there are unofficial servers out there too with functioning communities and better moderation.

I love this game, I shouldn't, its full of bugs and some really annoying ones at that but avoiding the bugs becomes second nature after a while and you really do stop noticing them.

You can lie and steal and strap mounted machine guns to the back of your tamed warbears and with your mates do a halo warthog run on an enemy base, then there's ships, proper customisable ships with sails you can import your own designs to.

This game has everything except for much needed polish.

I hope it gets it, the devs have a habbit of going awol for months at a time then launching updates after people have long assumed they have abandoned the game and it would be nice to have a bigger community playing.

I hope for full servers again one day, gutted I missed its peak season but I was too addicted to Sea Of Thieves to even consider playing anything else long term. Well till I found this anyways.

The biggest issue is that they continuously pull devs off of Atlas to work on their next ARK project.  And now that Ark v2.0 is in Early Access and ARK 2 is allegedly in development, you can fully expect Atlas to get even less love than it already does - which hasn't been much (It's already been 6 months since the last actual update, which was just a small hot fix).

On a positive note, it is playable and enjoyable in its current state (obviously it could be so much better).  However, I would highly recommend waiting until it is on sale for at least 50% off or more (which is pretty frequent).  I bought it for $10 and with over 1500 hrs, I've certainly got my money worth.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

The gameplay in ATLAS is very similar to ARK with a lot of major bonuses. The taming system, in my opinion, requires the player to be more engaged with their potential tames and is more interactive. As is expected, the sailing system is much more advanced than ARK's; akin to Sea of Thieves, the wind speed and direction, the waves, and the ships themselves are a good mix between arcade and simulation. I really liked the island experience and the requirement to sail to different islands in order to find the tames or materials you're looking for.

[h3]Server Hosting[/h3]

Where I think ATLAS is weakest is for private dedicated server support. The dedicated server setup is completely community-run and even though the systems and tips provided by the community are really well thought out, there is not any official support or documentation I could find regarding this. 

After 70 hours of congruent gameplay, I can say that running a dedi is a nightmare. We've gotten every bug that's been reported with server hosting. The dedi wiped its own data at points, one of the servers would come out of sync, and we got the well-reported bug of joining the game and suddenly being required to make a new character.

We tried several different fixes, but when we have to roll back the server almost daily and chase bugs it makes the private server experience really dreadful. I've created and run servers before for games like Minecraft, Valheim, Ark, and a few others and this has been the worst experience I've had.",1699367955,1699368118,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It's pirate themed Ark-lite.

If you play other open-world survival titles and your looking for a change of pace though, Give this a look.
It is not as overwhelming as Ark can be to get into. The story is kind of fun when ya figure it out. The pirate themed battles on open water are very fun. The ship building and customization also very fun.

I'd say I have a good computer, not the best, but still pretty good. Ark was like this in the beggining and I had to have all of the settings on the lowest, but over time it got less laggy, and then had no lag. I'm hoping this is what will happen for this game, or the lag will just stop. Another problem with Atlas is the servers. My friend has a server hosted by Nitrado, and it almost always says ""Timed out"" when I try to join. I dont know if its a problem with Nitrado, Atlas, or my computer. Minus the game lag, and the server issues. I'd have to give Atlas an 8/10. For some pros: The chickens are cute, fun combat, cool animals, skills to unlock, cool design, looks a lot like ark. And thats only because i havent even left the first Island, the first hour and a half I spent on this game was trying to log into the server and fix lag. the cons: It actually takes up around 150 gigabytes, its confusing at first, a lot of lag, bad server connection, too many stats you have to keep up with, and keep at full, the audio can be glitchy at some times, new skill tree is confusing but I still like it, you cant have a bow and spear in your hot bar at once, the bow seems pretty disappointing, the graphics are bad at the lowest quality, I know, you'd never expect that. But despite all of the cons, I think if you have been looking at this game, you should try it out, if you dont like it, return it. I think I will enjoy this game, once the lag calms down. And if you think this game is bad for how glitchy it is, then just remember it was literally released a few days ago, and they're already working on fixing bugs. But if you hate this game because you're salty about the delay, think about it, would you rather have a jumble of mess that looks like it was made in Roblox. Or how it is now. Anyway, just check out this game, its pretty good besides the lag and stuff. Just try it out lol

U use ship cannons... fine ship cannons dont work on them. you stood on a platform out of reach and poked them with a stick as its the only way to kill them now? they can insta max heal with minimal cooldown if unable to hit you. 

now im no game designer but. as there ghost pirates why not rather than make them walking tanks with insta max hp and massive damage... Make them faster, give them a grapple, the ability to come out of the ground or thin air closer to you and make some special ones to counter new meta's.
Also when attempting to prematurely dig up the treasure have it summon all remaining guardians to you (Rather than leave them glitched threw the map screwing you over)

make some easier (Possible for solo new players)
make some medium (possible for elite solo players or small groups)
make some hard (For elite small groups or large clans)
and if you so please make some Elite treasure scroll's Requiring you to summon a portal, sail into a new dedicated server (To lower lag) where a full clan of 40-80+ people could lay siege to an island protected by ships and port's of the damned, getting to shore and fighting up the path with artillery from the ship's to assist as you slay beasts and pirates big and small. make your way threw the fortras gates and loot the treasury. yaknow all boss battle like force the players to band together.



as it stands though: 
things NPCs are immune to (non player owned ones yours get 100hp's and are squishy af)
Cannons
Ballistas
Any other placable weapon
Rifles
Pistols
Crossbows
Bow and arrows

Things npcs arent immune to
Fists
Sword
Bear's

You must get hit by an npc once every 30-50 seconds or they will get max health again... no dodging, oh and they do 50% your health per hit on the lower levels.

Current only way to kill npc's you ask? why tame a bear make a few shields, hold the shield up piss the npcs off let the bear eat them replace your broken shield and repeat... you will still die 3-4 times per low level chest but hey you only need :/ 50 of them to make a ship dock. and if you kill all the ones that spawn theres a 33% chance you get the loot as most the time 1 or more npcs spawns under the map and you cant dig up the chest as theres still gaurdians alivel",1545999171,1696597131,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

They release almost more bugs than fixes with every patch.  It's like they don't even test their patches before releasing them to the public.  Now the devs have disappeared again.  No updates, the community manager is gone.  We're back in purgatory again.

What this development company has done should be criminal.  They take people's money, then squander it away with bad decisions, buggy updates, then disappear for months.   They released the game on XBOX when the PC version was in poor shape to get an injection of money.  Because the game on XBOX crashed all the time, they removed most if not all the textures from the game making it look awful to look at.  No updates, no fixes for them.  I'd feel ripped off if I was an XBOX owner.

The only thing going for it is the concept of the game is super cool: base building, ship building, sailing, exploring, taming, breeding animals, trading, PVE, PvP.  It sits in a sub-genre without any competition which is another reason why we people play it despite all of the bugs.

Over half of my ""play"" time is just from basically standing around in-game while trying various possible performance solutions. For the first couple days it ran okay. Not great, not even good, but I could at least manage a basic play experience. I was certainly in a better situation than so many other people that couldn't even manage to connect to the game servers.

Then a patch introduced constant hitching, so bad as to make the game unplayable. Constant freezes every 3-5 seconds. After many hours of troubleshooting over several days, with absolutely no change to the hitching issue, I'm throwing in the towel and hoping for a refund. It's unlikely I think that I'll receive one but maybe, considering the reviews and all the similar and other issues people are having with Atlas that are rendering the game unplayable, this situation will be seen as a special circumstance.

I've bought and played many early access games. All of which I could actually play at some level from day one. Some of them successfully released, some are still in development, and some were abandoned by the developers. Compared to all of them Atlas is a real mess and was put into early access far too early in the development process. Hopefully the devs will be able to sort it all out eventually and make the game resemble something akin to their game trailer. Right now though I recommend staying away until Atlas has had at least a few more months to bake.

But don't buy this now. Especially for single player main Ocean map.
It has major bugs in that weren't in the game before.
Maybe this all started with the modular ships and new buildings?
And single player will have you losing whole grids and ships after putting in a huge time sink building them.
Before these major bugs I played through all of Blackwood and loved it. 

I  had two goes at playing Ocean single player.
The first Ocean game ended with a major map change which destroyed all my progress.
Other than wild pirate bases half buried in the sand and some pirates getting stuck underground I didn't see any major bugs with it.
I recently came back again to play Ocean single player and it ended in major bugs.
1) The Tropical location I setup my first major base had the entire Grid get corrupted and running at 10fps.
     Fast travelling into it crashed the game where on you could get back in after respawning.
     Sailing cross into it resulted in a crash killing my character and losing the whole ship.
     So I decided fast travel in and ship out  to relocate. Then later delete that grids save file to reset it.
     However I ran into bug 2 which was the final straw.
2) If you leave a ship in a grid and then come back there is a chance it will be corrupted.
    but that I mean pieces of the ship completely missing and the items inside floating in mid air.
    First time it happened The sails remained and you could actually sail it forward like some partial ghost ship.
    Second time was when I left my new base to relocate out of the corrupted grid.
    Came back to find my Carrack with a section of the middle hull missing on both side. With modular ships their is no 
    option to fill empty spots. Tried switching the empty spots to canons and it wouldn't let me place them,
    I could scuttle it, so I did so.
    And my gunship Tramp completely gone with the exception of the cannons and crew floating in mid air, the doors and
    the items I'd placed. With no remaining ship body I couldn't shuttle it. And there was no way to delete them.
    Maybe using a canon to destroy them might have worked. But ultimately it meant I had to use only one ship since
    any ship left in the grid when you left risked being corrupted.

Look the game is far from polished, but...it's cool to see the devs ARE still around and alive lol 
Recently I've felt an itch to play this game again and jumped in. And there IS fun to be had.
The game just has so much potential! I love how it's this massive open world where you can almost do anything you want! So yeah, I'm changing my review to Recommend it again. Just bear in mind it is not a polished game, but there is definitely fun to be had here (even in Single player, which at least isn't broken anymore). So I don't want to deny people a chance to experience the fun in this game.
Here's hoping that one day, Atlas will be the magnificent glorious game we want it to be!

---------------------------------------

Probably the Last Edit: 
I changed my review back to ""not recommended"" as unfortunately the devs have not fixed anything - and finished off their original game concept. Instead they've kept choosing to go into ""new/different"" directions. Why not just fix the bugs and server issues and put the finishing polish on a game that WAS REALLY GOOD!? Instead they keep changing the stuff that was working, and refusing to fix the broken stuff. Confusing and frustrating your player base. I was really hoping they would pull through. Now sadly I'll probably never install and play my old amazing Atlas ever again. Seriously, how you could F*ck up something that was so good? Anyway, going to stop wasting my time on this game now.
Good bye Atlas.


Edit:  I've decided to actually change my recommendation of this game to a ""yes"". Because it now seems it might one day come out of Early Access after all! 
As there is now an active dev team working on it and bringing out regular updates. 
Yes the game does still have issues and bugs, but it is still a great game and it's great to see devs actually interested in the game. Just know that it is still Early Access so Official servers might get wiped now and then, as new game core mechanics gets released, and you might experience lagging/bugs o official maps. 

But I've recently returned to the game and have been having a blast in Single player! I've also played a bit on Unofficial servers, and believe me you can have TONS of fun without the lagging and bugs from official! Also a note on the latest change of ships costing gold: I agree this (at least at the moment) seems not great, but you can add Mods in Single player and Unofficial servers that allows you to build all the ships without a gold cost. So this is in no way a ""deal breaking"" mechanic.

I'd say give it a go if you're thinking about it.  Simply because there is just a certain something in this game that keeps me wanting to play it. The worlds are so beautiful, the survival elements, the pirate theme's, the building, the adventure! I do recommend it because I think it's worth experiencing. I hope all the problems will be smoothed out one day, without changing the core dynamics of the game, as it is like a rough diamond, just waiting to be polished into brilliance!

---------------------------------------

Here follows my old reviews:

Edit: So after writing the below review I decided to give the game another go with the new map release (which btw wasn't a ""new"" map in the sense, just the old map re-arranged and made a lot smaller) etc.
Had some fun for about 2 weeks, then with the latest update (the farmhouse one) I just can't connect to the game anymore. Just no way. It just keeps freezing on the load screen and giving a time-out message. So I thought I'll give the single player a go, and it's broken! As in, instead of starting out on an island (like Single player used to be) the game just drops you into the middle of the Ocean, and you get eaten by sharks- or die from cold pretty quick!
So I adjusted the server settings and made the creature damage 0 and gave myself max resistance so that I can atleast swim to an island and get going from there (it's a big swim btw). But when I got to the location where the in-game map showed should be an island, there's just nothing! Just more ocean.
So Single Player is completely broken now. Searching for possible answers or fixes I came across posts on the official forums of people reporting this issue almost imediately after the new map (4th of July already) and there is no replies to it. It's not even been acknowledged in all this time!
Oh and btw there is still GLARING bugs and exploits and problems with the game, that the devs just aren't addressing, but they're releasing new buildings (which brought more bugs btw)?
Like, I know this is Early Access but shouldn't things be getting better over time? And it's been 2 years since it first came out, and it seems more broken now?? I don't know maybe they actually want to kill the game.
Btw you'll notice most of the recent recommendations of the game is from people who don't have a lot of hours on it yet. Sure the game is fun and seems awesome those first bunch of hours, but with enough time you'll see the wreck this is. So yeah, stay away. 
It's a shame because it could be such an awesome game, but rather don't invest time in this, until you actually see evidence of the devs fixing stuff and working towards getting out of Early Access.
-ps Btw don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on the game, I love this game! But it is a broken game atm and it is NOT being fixed :( Pls devs if you actually turn over a new leaf and fix this game I'll change this review to a recommendation instantly!



Here follows original review:

I'm giving this a thumbs down because it seems this game will never get out of Early Access. But it's a mixed bag. As you can see I have over 200 hours in the game, and to be honest: most of it I enjoyed. Yes some of it I didn't, but over all I think one can have great fun in this game! And so I would recommend the game to people who like Survival Open world and PVP, (as the pvp is strong in this one loll!) If that is your thing, you can definitely have some fun in this game, but even then there will be things that will eventually frustrate you (like bugs and unpolished game-play etc.) And I think this is ultimately why I do not want to recommend the game, as it is not a finished game. Now this would normally be fine under the Early Access flag, but I feel it's pretty clear by now the game will never be fixed/finished/polished and launched fully (and if it is, I feel certain it will be in the label only, i.e. it won't really be a finished product). And that's just sad. As I think this game has great potential, it's just sad it seems it will never get there :(

If you don't like pvp don't play this! (or just stay on pve server) and you will have fun (exploring, building crafting etc) but just know you will also encounter the same level of ""brokenness/bugs/unpolished'ness in the game.

So in conclusion: even though I do think this is a fun game, I cannot in a clear conscience recommend people to buy a product that is broken and I believe never will be fixed.
And the burden is on the devs to change our minds (and recommendations) we've definitely given them long enough to see what they will do with our trust, and as it stands now they've not respected it.

Firstly, I'm a day 1 player and i have 5000 Hours in atlas, Its fair to say i've had my moneys worth and have some great memories, Atlas promoted camaraderie on a level I've rarely seen in a game. I've also made some lasting friendships. Atlas will always hold a special place in my heart.

Can i recommend the Game however?  
That's unfortunately a big fat No!
It's no secret that Grapeshot games is an offshoot of Ark's studio wildcard, and many of arks assets and systems exist in Atlas. This unfortunately means that Atlas falls under the umbrella of Fail.. I mean... Snail Games and the drama that brings.

Atlas suffers from some of the most incredibly incompetent management of development i have ever seen.
The decisions made have been staggeringly short sighted and down right stupid.

Atlas had an incredibly shaky launch and the first season was rife with performance issues and exploits, but the developers did get on top if it, For me the game peaked around season 4. It was a gem in the rough, but give it a chance it was one worth playing.
Development on atlas went quiet for about a year while the dev team were transferred over to Ark to work on Genesis 2
Eventually a new development team was brought in, they seem inexperienced but i do give them props for their effort and some really good ideas. However this is where things went downhill.
When a new team tries to pick up where the old team left of, they have different ideas, different scope, different direction.
They did not understand the dream of what we were originally sold upon.
Aditionally, the design lead at the time was a real POS of a human being.

During the infamous Barrel Bomb patch, Barrel bombs were fireable from cannons, This had been hinted at before by the new devs but the community were quick to tell them it was tried in Season 1 and was a terrible idea, they however, did it anyway.
The community was in uproar! small and medium companies were literally wiped overnight, this forced many to quit.
despite the massive community backlash, the design leads response was literally ""Barrel bombs are here to stay""
Though they were eventually reballanced to a point where they were good for gameplay, it took way to long and the damage was done.

As the seasons have progressed, Atlas has drifted further away from the dream of an open world pirate game we were sold on.  To give you some examples of how the game changed for the worse..

In the early days, Discords were set up to promote trading of Blueprint materials, Cargo container for a cargo container, we even traded with our most hated enemies. It was an unintentionally interesting side effect of the resource systems in the game. That was all killed off with the introduction of the Market place and warehouse. theres now no reason to interact with other players other than to kill them.

Ships were replaced with Modular ships, this almost entirely removed any customisation or strategy in building them and reduced them to a generic design.

Ships are now viewable on the map removing any sort of stealth or the possibility of random or surprise encounters.

Lawless had a new system introduced called ""Claimable lawless"" which was rediculously exploitable, defences were pointless as they could be circumvented by attacking a claim tower. As such, Lawless lands are largely ghost towns as theres no point in doing anything there.

Although there has been a few good additions, they dont make up for everything the game has lost.
Its just a generic pvp slug fest now. Any sense of wonder and awe has been removed.

On a final note, the game has a development deficit of 16 Million dollars.
The writing is truly on the wall for Atlas, and its chances of Survival are slim.
I Hope they can pull it back as i really want to love Atlas again, but i doubt it.

They sell a game, that is far from ready for prime-time, they then focus more on adding new content that is just as broken and what already existed in the game, and they simply refuse to listen to the feedback.

I was a moderator for their official Discord channel but quickly learned that even the team there knows of the development teams incompetence but is obligated to put on a strong face and blow smoke up the communities rear about how they are working to fix the issues.

I found, and reported, some serious exploits in the game to the Dev team, and all that happened is the other moderators who were able to see my tickets began using the exploit - totally against what we were there for, instead of making the community stronger, they just made their crew/company stronger by sharing the details of how to replicate the exploit which I reported to try and prevent happening.  After that I lost faith and resigned my postilion as part of the team.

Added to this there is more corruption in the CoC Enforcement team.  There is a company by the name of 'Black Butterfly' that has family that is directly related to the owner of the game; as such this company gets to spawn items in as they need and they also get anyone that attacks them and is winning banned from the game.  yes, that's right, the same situation as with the 'Tea Co' in Ark (also owned by Snail Games).

So you'll buy the game, eventually get in a fight with Black Butterfly and lose, or you will win and then find you are banned the next time you sign onto the game.

A recent revisit of the game has left most of my friends and I frustrated. It's sad that things have seemingly stepped backwards quite a bit and not progressed any further. It also does seem like they don't care for creating a balanced world for PvE and PvP is their main focus. They've definitely turned their world on it's head when they shrunk the maps creating way too much lag due to people, boats, structures now being jammed in every nook and cranny of what's left for islands. There is certainly not enough places for people if you're not online and willing to spend a stupid amount of time trying to stake out a place the minute the server wipes. There are too many stipulations on the items that require them to be 'x' distance from other players items in place, or 'x' distance from the shore, and you will need another person for sure if you ever get lucky enough to get any automated things down to make sure they're in range of your warehouse to pick up the materials because you'll only be able to tell when  you get back to  your warehouse, then if it's not, you'll have to go destroy it to try again, or manually go unload it. The half baked market system provides some decent benefits to setting it up since there were limitations as to how far the market would trade. Allowing companies and people to place items across many islands is also not helpful in terms of resource and land hogging on PvE where they are not destroyed by player combat. You still cannot see your guild mates, but they have made it so you can see every ship of the damned and other players ships (adding to the lag fest that was already in place by tracking all this data real time), as well as the much detested fog of war that only clears if you remember to open your map while sailing in order for it to update. Some day they may actually do something to make this worthy of playing but as it stands now, you'll only tolerate the bugs/frustrations for so long.

This game has fallen flat on all the promises. You grind and grind in the hopes it will get better and yet...it never seems to.

Unfortunately Atlas will trick you in to dedicating hundreds of hours towards a new ship, or base, or breeding the perfect tames...and then due to how buggy it still is something - completely beyond your control - will wipe away all your hours and hours of grinding *poof* (this happens so often most admins won't even respond to your requests on a private servers)

Also given how much the player base has shrunk, would say most private servers have their normal players and it is really hit or miss finding a server to play on that is not stacked against you (pvp). That or there are in-game purchases that admins have added and you need to purchase stuff to get admin help (when the poof happens). The public servers are so grindy you will have to join a company to get anywhere...like trying to tame a decent level animal will take you hours and hours (and many more deaths)! :/

Haha at almost 3,000 hours you can see I tried to like the game, wipe after wipe, company after company, tame after tame, powerstone after powerstone island I've done it all a million times...stuck around hoping the devs would improve the game like they said they would...at this point won't even recommend this game to family and friends any more.

2023 EDIT: came back two years later, and guess what?? somehow even WORSE. PVE servers you all have to spawn in the same quadrant if you want to buy a ship, then takes about 30+minutes just to sail across each quadrant. you get 9 quadrants to pick from...but guess what? all islands are taken and theres no room for new players. got on, spent about 1-2 hours trying to spawn with my friend and get a boat going, and once we FINALLY DID, got bored after sailing across quadrant after quadrant with the game downscreened just looking for an island that wasn't completely packed with ships and tribes. wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy",1620326179,1693007037,False,1,0,0.497076034545898438,0,True,False,True

Because I would rather have devs that actually listen to the players and try to fix the issues rather than the ones we have in Atlas who just do whatever they want most of the time and break the game for a majority of the player population. 

It's not that this game is bad and buggy, it absolutely is. It's that over the 600 hours I've been playing the Devs have done nothing to fix the core issues with the game. In the meantime they keep adding in little features that are fun on the surface but it doesn't fix a game that is fundamentally janky.

It's honestly really sad, because there are parts of this game that are gorgeous, this is one of the few games that I love taking screenshots of because of the lighting and the way the water and islands look. The game has so much potential to be so so very good, but the Devs NEVER listen to the players.

834910,145006975,76561198043882735,0,19,1493,0,1489,1693501963,"So I picked this game up a very long time ago in preparation for a time when me and a couple of friends were going to play this game at some point. Would I recommend others to pick up this game? The short answer is simply no, and I will attempt to explain why in the below passages. What I can say, however, is that, for some reason, despite the fact that this game has serious issues that needs ironing out, in everything from poor optimisation to game mechanics, this game has managed to scramble together some brilliant communities that are out there which, if you join them, you can have a good time with despite the game's massive flaws.

Essentially, this game echoes the ideas of Sea of Thieves, but in the genre of survival exploration. You play as a pirate that has skills, which they can learn in order to craft gear, cook food, build buildings and construct mighty ships that can sail the seven seas. The idea is quite sound and enticing, and if you enjoy nitty-gritty survival mechanics, this game's got them. The graphics are dated but okay at high settings. What isn't okay is how incredibly bad this game runs at high settings, forcing me to scale down the graphics settings to the point of the game looking like a turd. A slightly polished turd, but nonetheless a turd. Animations range from laughable to fine, game mechanics range from laughable to fine, multiplayer connection issues are rampant, as well as bugs and some seriously long loading times if you do not put this game on an SSD. Considering this game takes up a whopping 130 gigs of storage space, this is a luxury some people cannot afford.

Do we have more flaws? Well, yes. Experience is gotten just by the act of playing the game. Stand still or run around and you gain experience. Eat a piece of meat, you gain experience. Kill a monster, you gain experience. There is no clear-cut mechanic of gaining experience, but if you lack any experience, which is the case in the start of the game, there is nothing there to teach you anything remotely useful for you to start off. Knowing nothing about the game, you will die and die again. There is a screen locked off three menus in that has some voiceover person tell you what you can do, but unfortunately none of that matters. I'm no stranger to games that expect you to figure things out, but those games tend to at least give the player hints on what to do, or subtly and masterfully guide your hand in the beginning. This game does not do this. It drops you in some random place, and as you run out and get maimed by wildlife, you will find that you cannot do anything without levelling up first. To get drinkable water, for some asinine reason you need to first find the crawl button on your keyboard, then, with nothing in your hands, you start digging for water as if it were an oil well. The first time I was told by other people in the community I was playing with that this is a game mechanic, I could not stop laughing at how bad it was.

Once you get to know the game, you can appreciate some things that have some amount of depth or are fun. Treasure maps are a fun little minigame, the quests you can do to defeat major enemies are fun, one can enjoy decking oneself out with new gear, and navigating harsh but vast seas, exploring new islands with different biomes can be quite fun. However, getting to that point is unlikely, and before the 2 hour refund limit is up, you may very likely find yourself in a place where you have just reached level 2, because this game has serious performance and loading time issues.

Something I have learned is that this game is developed by the same studio, or an offspring of people, that made the ARK Survival Evolved game. If you've played that game, I've heard you know what you'll get yourself into. I've heard this game described as a reskin of that game. Whether that is true or not, I cannot say, but if what I've heard is correct, I know what other game I will make sure to avoid from now on.",1692990009,1692990118,False,2,0,0.518263638019561768,0,True,False,True

Atlas, a game that aims for grandeur in its maritime survival adventure, presents a mixed bag of promising features intertwined with frustrating hurdles that can overshadow the experience. While it holds potential for those captivated by the idea of sailing the high seas, its design choices and mechanics often create barriers that can deter even the most determined of players.

Pros:

Visually Pleasing: Atlas boasts visually appealing graphics that contribute to the immersive seafaring atmosphere.

Thoughtful Crafting: Crafting is a complex endeavor, offering layers of depth that reward players who invest time and effort.

Navigational Ventures: Sailing across the expansive oceans can occasionally provide a sense of exploration and adventure.

Character Creation: The character creation process offers a decent level of customization, though some aspects might require improvement.

Cons:

Unrelenting Lag: Despite attempts to improve, persistent lag remains a significant issue, severely impacting gameplay quality.

Combat Frustrations: Engaging in combat often results in rubberbanding and unresponsive mechanics, taking away from the enjoyment.

Tedious Vitamin System: The addition of a vitamin system, while aiming for realism, becomes a burdensome chore, sapping the fun out of the survival experience.

Missing Tutorial: A lack of proper guidance leaves newcomers bewildered and struggling to grasp essential game mechanics.

Unbalanced Threats: The presence of high-level threats in initial areas can prove overwhelming for new players, causing undue frustration.

Aggressive AI Behavior: The unrealistic and punishing mob aggression can be off-putting, especially for those new to the game.

Curbed Progression: The decision to cap the starter island's level at 8 feels arbitrary, undermining the sense of progression.

Wonky Physics: Glitches and unpredictable physics, like rafts launching into the sky, negatively impact the overall gameplay experience.

Resource Overdemand: Excessive resource demands in various aspects of the game can lead to imbalance and frustration.

Cumbersome Combat: Ongoing lag-related sluggishness during combat cripples the responsiveness and joy of engaging foes.

Summary:
Atlas, a game set on vast seas, struggles to sail smoothly amid a sea of obstacles. While the allure of its visuals, crafting depth, and maritime explorations is evident, they're often overshadowed by the lingering specter of lag, problematic combat mechanics, and the perplexing vitamin system. A lack of tutorials, aggressive AI, and design choices that cater to hardcore survival enthusiasts make it a daunting endeavor for those with limited time. While fleeting moments of enjoyment can be found, the game's frustrations ultimately threaten to capsize the experience. Atlas holds potential, but until its issues are navigated and addressed, it's challenging to offer a resounding recommendation, particularly for those seeking a more accessible and enjoyable survival adventure.",1545942591,1692145448,False,1,2,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,True

I used to love this game for its vast and immersive open world, where I could explore the seas and fight other players in thrilling naval battles. But after taking a break from the game, I came back to find that the developers had shrunk the map to a tiny 3x3 grid, removed the story mode, and left the game riddled with glitches. It felt like I had sailed into a Bermuda Triangle of bad design choices.

The game is still a boat game, but that’s about the only positive thing I can say about it. The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is repetitive, and the fun factor is nonexistent. The game is so broken that even the boats can’t stay afloat. I joined a crew of four friends and we lost four boats in one day due to random flips and crashes. We all quit in frustration and vowed never to play this game again.

This game had so much potential, but it wasted it all by making unnecessary and detrimental changes. It’s like they took a beautiful ship and turned it into a sinking Titanic. And unlike Jack and Rose, there’s no room for anyone on this piece of driftwood. I can’t recommend this game in its current state.

[b]THE BAD[/b]
I could very easily shit on this game in multiple paragraphs for its insane number of bugs, poor development choices(Bad to the point of actively making the game worse with each balance change and new feature), High number of players who cheat or use exploits and not to mention the toxicity of the community who actively DOX each other, Review bomb businesses belonging to other players and create content and communities for the sole purpose of harassing other players but i'll leave it at that. This is not exclusive to Atlas, this problem is in many games like this but to me it seems especially vicious because of the small community.

[b]THE GOOD[/b]
Those of us who stuck around after the disaster of a launch and ignored all the issues listed above were rewarded for our time with a few incredible seasons where gaming communities were born, real friends were made and memories that have lasted for years were obtained.

What really sold the game for me was the level of logistics required to wage war with other company's.
Everything needed to be accounted for, Training, Supplies, Scouting, Spying, Traitors, Allies. The list goes on.
The whole game rewarded captains, pvpers and leaders who prepared for anything. Because of this some players could really make a name for themselves if they were highly skilled. 
To this day I can remember off the top of my head who the best captains and pvpers in 2019 (Season 3) were.

Back in the day, me and my company had the gaming time of our lives setting up raids, massive fleet battles, training nights or even just hanging out farming materials or building our island and ships.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Atlas is in a very bad state right now, The new direction the game has taken has really ruined it for a lot of us and the playerbase has shrunk to the point where its essentially the same 150 players each season and I don't foresee that changing until the game eventually closes. That being said, I must give this game a thumbs up if for nothing else, it entertained me for almost 5k hours, I met hundreds of other players, Built a successful gaming community centered around Atlas, Have made Dozens of real life friends and we are all still together reading the patch notes and frowning with disappointment every time. 

We still got the memories though

Yea call it EA  (Early Release) ... the new BS term for anything nowhere even close to ready to release.

Where have you seen a game in EA for year after year and still figuring out a direction.

Some fun things if you don't mind repeating the starter grind over and over and over and over....
3400 hours. What a waste!

Don't get me wrong. This game has some fun aspects. But this dev team and the direction in poison. And has wrecked this game.  

No question I used to love it.

What a waste of time.

Call me when the endless effort wipes are over.   In fact .... don't.

(Conclusion as last paragraph)

The game is still broken to the very core and unfortunately the developers treat this game like it'd be a polished product only pushing out minor content updates and pvp adjustments.

The core issues which get no attention at all are the following:
- Still very unstable servers, mostly you notice a rather acceptable ping yet when there's actually more than 3 players on a grid (server) the ping goes up heavily.
- Unoptimized resource consumption of your computer resulting in funky FPS
- Additionally to the lags there's a lot of rubberbanding which makes many moments in the game horrible like losing your tames at sea because they just slide off the ship
- They gave up on an NA/EU divide and just made a single official NA server. Seriously?
- They have annoying game breaking bugs which they're aware of yet never fix for literally years, every time I come back and try this game again I quit after 5 minutes again because I realise the game makes absolutely no progress in the bug fixing department, example: Tames cannot be moved onto your ship, results in a great pain of designing ramps whereever you go so you can run up those ramps and hope you shoot above them and land on your ship.
- They have no large-scale structures which means people actually spent like 20.000+ structures on a simple harbor for ship defenses, don't get me started on base design. This results in a massive drain on your hardware and leaving you on 3 FPS against hardcore players. Admittedly it is the best base defense if your opponents just crash trying to enter.

For singleplayer enjoyers, it has absolutely no content, the map doesn't work, your beds sometimes don't work resulting in you losing your ships and bases and whatever you spent time on getting. This game basically has no singleplayer, don't bother for that aspect.

In conclusion, Atlas can be fun if you like pirates and would love to see it mixed with an mmo/survival type genre because there's simply no other game like this and if you don't mind the rubberbanding and lags. Though I believe this game is already on the verge of death and will only continue to die further if the developers ignore the core issues with this game.

Yes the game is still in early development and you can expect the Pve/Pvp servers to be wiped and updated about every 3 months which is nice especially when they add more stuff to the game. its almost like a new game but most definitely expect a few bugs now and then.

finished my character up, actually having a lot of fun. Didn't realize the map is massive beyond the starting areas, also.. some new ships and items. Disappointed to see some stuff removed from skill tree? Would like musicianship tree back if possible, and martial arts? I was hoping to roleplay a bit and be kind of silly this season.

Anyway I stole a cog and booked it out of a players dock, lol. Having a blast. Glad to see the game is still going, going to give it a thumbs up just because they fixed the tiny dock thing and it seems like they are getting back to the games roots.

Hope it continues to get the dev time it deserves, still has some bugs.

Changing it back to unrecommended. Devs have again made it blatantly obvious that they continue to harass their playerbase, or are complicit in the harassment of their playerbase, by people using exploits/hacks and unfair game mechanics. New bugs, things that worked that no longer work, and decisions about things that create unfair barriers to new players like land-claim towers in lawless. After just starting back into the game, maybe 6-7 days in and just read the lovely message about a wipe in 7 days. ***edited for factual clarification, same grid size same map.

6-26-23 
Actually was about to give it a good review. Had been having a lot of fun, kind of fucking about. Then it became again, glaringly obvious the reason that I originally stopped playing, and that's that it's pretty much a handful of normal people getting griefed by an autistic hacker with no life. The populations die super fast each season because of a handful of terribles.

I watched the enemy boat basically teleport around the map, do completely impossible things, appeared out of absolutely nowhere and blipped onto the map directly in front of me on the Atlas, basically I just stopped on the zoneline to the freeport when I could have escaped, just to further elucidate the glaringly obvious hacking as he ones shotted me through the back of my boat structure when i was at the helm. It was so obvious, that I uninstalled the game.

really bad still, almost no security whatsoever, NOT SAFE TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER OR WITH BATTLEEYE, AT ALL. THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT AT SECURITY PROTOCOLS WITHIN THEIR PROGRAMS AT ALL. VERY UNSECURE. PLAY ONLINE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

6-28-23 new season, 13, got a company that invited me.. we'll see how it goes. Back into the unsecure abyss.

7-3-23 blatant hacking in ship fight, zoned into freeport and ship was teleported into a combat grid. It's pretty much 100% confirmed to be entirely bullshit nonsense. There isn't a single legitimate player or company in the entirety of the official servers.

At least put out a a way that people with modded servers can just work off one version of the game and Not MAKE them have to RECODE everything EVERYTIME a new update comes out. We have lost Great Modders out there because of this and its why the game has Mixed reviews.

I noticed only bug for moment when sailing sometimes your ship is going underwater by the waves but no gameplay consequences happily. This game plays a lot like ark with some interesting differences.
For example, if you eat same type of food for a long time you will get too much vitamine from one type and begin to get sick losing life...
Sailing is very fun and realistic: you can't move if the wind is against where you're going.
Very satisfying game, i recommend 100% especially if you can play with friends!

[u]edit:[/u] Uninstalled since developers decided to make ships (or shipyards) building paying a fee just to make a medium ship. You need now collect 500 gold to make a small shipyard which is a pain in the *** alone on pvp and boring anyway even on pve!!! Also you need 10 k gold for a bigger shipyard or 22 k gold just for the biggest ships alone!!!
On top of that you have to deal with turret rifles that one shot people just by npc that you hire! (on pvp of course)
[u]This game is becoming a pain only by developers silly decisions!!![/u]

[b]Because of all that, i recommend this game only for pvp if you play with friends or if you can join a guild. Or pve you can still go but you can be annoyed by all constructions of other players.[/b]

Unfortunately, it has been nearly abandoned by its developers, who invest their time in the far more popular (for reasons beyond me) game, Ark. This means that in the latest ""Season"", duping bugs were allowed to exist in the wild for literally months, ruining most of the game economy. I can handle some bugs and janky, quirky games generally -- but not exploits that make the long grind necessary to compete in the endgame essentially worthless. The developer's solution to this has been to issue blanket bans to companies (clans) that engaged in widespread use of such exploits. While that's something I support, it also destroys the population on a game that is already underpopulated.

Many games that are orphaned by their developers and underpopulated but loved by a small, yet dedicated core of players tend to form tight-nit communities around the game and particular server. Unfortunately, this is absolutely not the case with the (1) PvP server for Atlas. I am not new to online PvP communities, so general toxicity -- which is certainly in abundance due to a global chat system that shouldn't exist -- doesn't surprise me or affect me much beyond making me predictably roll my eyes. But in 25 years of online gaming, I've never experienced a small community in a game like this with a multi-month grind that has less loyalty, less caring about one's reputation, and less of a sense of fair play, than the swamp that is the community that surrounds this game.

So this is a Ark copy and paste and they just changed some stuff around but darn I liked it. It's really fun gathering exploring and building your own ship. The longer you play the more ghost pirates appear in the waters. I think this was a bug but still; at some point I didn't want to take my boat out to sea because of all the dangers. You'r only safe bet is to try and out run them.

If you play this with friends its a lot more forgiving. Rather than taking days to build a ship its only a hour or so and then you can afford to go after pirates and risk your ship. Treasure hunting was pretty fun too.
The game felt smooth and didn't feel like a copy paste work. The mechanics seem ok until you got to PVP and the server maps. 

Server map's now this is where it all wen't wrong. So each zone/section is its own cluster so the bigger and beefier your server is the more clusters you can put together and the larger the map can be. some times a cluster would crash and if you were on it you get kicked off and can't get back in until its restored. Managing a private server was a beast and it was a constant job keeping it updated and running smoothly. Lets just say that after a month we were all burned out on server management. 

The game is fun, and way better with friends. NPC's are easy enough and sailing really feels like your  going somewhere.
It's hard leaving your home land for long periods of time because nothing is near by that you can be back in 5 minutes. No you go out; your not coming back for a while. Take provisions

Now with even less content, less optimization, and more bugs!(didn't think that last part was possible, but hey) And no, they still haven't even changed the code references of the animal entities from ""dino"".

Wait till it's on sale for 80% off or 10 years to see if it's finished

Edit: Well It's been three years and what's changed?

A handful of new ""modular"" ships which aren't really customizable at all, had huge flaws and bugs on day 1, some of which are partially patched. But don't worry, more are planned! Ships, not fixes, that is. This is a continuation of the Devs removing as much customization (the problem isn't that you can stack large cannons on deck, but that you can have large cannons on deck at all, remember?) as possible without any real communication with the playerbase.

Speaking of playerbase the peak players is up(?) to ~2000, give or take 20%. Most of which are not playing on official servers, but rather small private communities and singleplayer, as official servers are still incredibly grindy, prone to random griefing, and fraught with Dev abuse.

Mods are still basically required unless you want to devote your life to the game in order to get to endgame, or can round up a crew of around a dozen people who can treat it as a part time job.

Content is just streaming in, as well as it can, since both this game and ARK are being worked on by all two of the developers. And speaking of ARK they really learned from that game because Atlas has all of the optimization, bugfixes, and content that ARK has. Which is to say, the absolute bare minimum, if you can even call it that.

The game's been out for 5ish years now and they've not really gone anywhere with it, just like all the other ARK clones they made. Let's see where it still is in another 5 years",1578170666,1684570165,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I made it off the starter island in a sloop, co-opping with a friend who kept the ship safe. I must say, I was a little shocked at the constant buckets of blood and wounds shown on both NPC pirates and creatures. Even changing some settings to try and lessen the ""slaughter"" didn't really help to be honest. I think the only way, some would really enjoy playing this game is by avoiding overpowered pirates, base building on safe island and gradually exploring and leveling up substantially before doing what I did on my first day. I just wanted to see what it would be like. I was mauled by a giant red tiger who seemed to be friends with the NPC pirates...and they were dressed the best armour and looked more like organised, medieval soldiers of some sort. Can I recommend this game? Well I would have to answer that it would strongly depend on what you are looking for in a game, whether it be PVP, PVE, survival, base building, grinding, private non-dedicated sessions with you're friends or just plain single-player. Certainly, a hardcore Ark Survival Evolved player would enjoy ATLAS a lot but it is definitely not for everyone. I personally found that this game really should be R rated because of how violent it is. I do enjoy this game a lot though, but the sailing is a bit challenging at first.

As for the single player experience it is completely shallow, bordering on void of content, there are a few boss fights but even ARK's early access was more stable and with more varied game play than this, which is no surprise considering the devs have stated that they're focousing on the multiplayer experience for the foreseeable future.

Atlas has the potential to be something beautiful if only the devs would actually address the issues instead of releasing new content that can only be enjoyed for five minutes before you have to start all over again due to the game's major and I mean MAJOR issues, my initial review of this title was pretty scathing and honestly I haven't seen any improvement which is a shame because I really want to love this game but in it's current state I just can't.

I imagine they are focused on releasing Ark 2. But it seems very bad to me that during the last 4 years you have not fixed ANYTHING.
For example, the elevators are still bugged half the time it pulls you out of them. I do NOT see that you have made any progress at all. You have only added some totems, which give some buffs in those quadrants. And with that, it gives the impression that it seems good to you.
The treatment you are giving to this early access is very sad. The game has no optimization. Nor has it improved in the last 4 years. I keep seeing exactly the same errors that I had at the time.
My advice is the following. There should be a lot more quests, a lot more npc to interact with. The world should be PVP AND PVE at the same time. That is, some maps where you cannot attack (PVE) and maps where you can. If you leave a friendly zone it takes an hour or 2 until you can attack (or be attacked, for example).
I see that the game had enormous potential. Being able to support franchises like pirates of the caribbean and having the possibility of creating an incredible game... ... you have done NOTHING.
The forum is dead. Most of the threads date back to 2019. This was supposed to be a game you were going to finish. I'm still waiting, 4 years later.

Are you there? Are you preparing something (apart from ark 2)?

I did take a break from it for a while, however, upon returning it is pretty much the same game crashing bugs that make it almost impossible to play. Even after you get past having to reload the game 20 times before you can login, if you are a new player you may as well forget about ever being able to build a base anywhere. I searched for about 3 hours on at least 11 different squares, not a single bit of unclaimed land to build on. Everyone has everything claimed with towers even if they aren't building on the land or even anywhere near it. They give way too many claim points so even a company of just one person can lay down enough lawless claim towers to claim half an island. To make the problem worse, they used to have two separate PvE servers, I guess they felt that there wasn't enough players cause now there is only one. So the problem of trying to find anywhere to build even the tiniest of bases is next to impossible. I'm pretty sure if you search for at least 6 hours you might have a 50/50 shot at being able to start a base somewhere decent. But that is 6 hours of your time completely wasted on nothing more than just trying to find a place to build a tiny house. Back when there was two PvE servers and it wasn't a 6+ hour endeavor to find a spot to build, the game wasn't that bad. Honestly, after my 3 hours of searching just now, I quickly hit ESC, Exit Game, right clicked on it in my Steam library, clicked manage, UNINSTALL. Not worth the hard drive space as it is right now, I wouldn't even think about spending any money on it.

*UPDATE*
Tried the game again in 2023, and all they have done is made it worse. The have made the single PVE server even smaller now. What used to be a 15x15 square map is now only a 6x6. So, what used to be 225 squares that had islands to build on and explore, now it is only 36 squares. All of this with the same amount of players that they had on a 225 square map. Every inch of every island that can be built on is still taken, with no available spots for anyone. And you would ask yourself, if they reduced the size of the map by 80%, they opened more PVE servers right? Nope, there is still only 1 PVE server. This is just getting worse and worse, can't even start a base anywhere if you wanted to. Do not buy this game.",1650147632,1683649606,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Graphically, it is quite beautiful at times but it is starting to look a bit dated already.  If you play at high rez / wide screen this is technically supported but the textures do not work so it looks terrible  The concept is great.  But executed so badly it is something to behold.  It has everything going for it.  But they crippled it.    I have never seen a game try hard to make you not like it.    

The claim system was always the low point for me.  I didn't have enough patience left to try that again.  Even now, it still feels less than half finished.  A good example of this would be the dead, empty feeling freeports.   Dead, empty, no life at all.   

The problem with this game are not technical. It always was, and still is some of the bad game design choices that make it absolute unenjoyable when it should be brilliant.  The no 1 issue in the main game. The claim mechanics were obviously never going to be sustainable and make it extremely frustrating.  

Several times I have been in big crews of up to 200 people. They nearly always collapsed following offline raiding.  It is so grindy to actually build and create anything, but so easy to lose it all.  Better defences would have been a good idea and npcs you could use to actively defend a town. 

Most people will come to it solo to begin with. Then get massively abused and will hate it,  I made that mistake initially. I could not keep a small crew to stay in the game out of sheer frustration at the grinding boredome of building.  Also, because it is really hard to start out on a pvp server if you try to play with just a few friends. You will just get driven off basically.  So you more or less have to join a bigger group.  Unfortunately, these also tend to collapse in the end for a variety of reasons. 

It might look like a big game.  But it really isn't when there is so little real estate to occupy.  It isnt exploration. Every inch is well known. 

The one thing is does well is sailing. Especially with a big ship and comrades but there is too little of this and too much grinding and frustration.",1545768431,1683369656,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is a survival game with pirate-themed elements, set in an open world environment. In Atlas, players start off as a stranded sailor, who must explore the vast world, gather resources, build ships, and form alliances with other players in order to survive.

    The game features a wide variety of biomes, ranging from ice-capped mountains to tropical beaches, all of which are teeming with wildlife and natural resources such as wood, ores, and food sources. Players must scavenge for these resources, craft items, and build structures in order to create a base and defend it against other players and the dangerous creatures that inhabit the world.

    Ships are also a crucial part of the gameplay in Atlas. Players can build a variety of vessels, from small rafts to massive galleons, which are used for exploration, transportation, and naval combat. The game features an advanced sailing system, which includes wind currents and weather patterns, and allows players to engage in realistic naval battles with other players or AI-controlled ships.

    In addition to the survival and crafting elements, Atlas also features a robust RPG progression system, which allows players to level up their characters, unlock new skills, and take on quests and challenges to further progress through the game.

    Overall, Atlas is a highly immersive and ambitious game that offers a unique blend of survival, pirate-themed action, and RPG elements. With its vast open world environment, advanced sailing mechanics, and engaging gameplay, it has been popular among players looking for a challenging and rewarding online multiplayer experience.

[b]Atlas[/b] is worse than it was years ago, all these updates haven't really brought anything good for the game to the table.

( we had the thingy that you can put on the front of your ships to prove it) so i saw most aspects of the game early on as well as not being entirely knew to atlas concepts since i have 9k hours in ark. it was most definitely a broken game on release
with countless game breaking bugs that could set you back hours days or weeks of progress. this is simply not the case anymore. losing everything to a bug will not happen in the latest patches( edit, i do consider knocking people out with horses and cuffing them broken and agree it should be removed though this is almost always avoidable and very few people do it, it is 100% broken to be able to knock someone and basically turn them into an npc, idc that its in ark remove it from both already). i put over 100 hours in so far on s12 solo and in company and have encountered VERY few MINOR NON GAME BREAKING bugs. everyones whole reason for not liking this game is that it was broken. everyone claims that they wouldve loved it and that it was ""the game"" if it wasnt so broken. so now that its not so broken... where is the playerbase? under the thumb of their favorite content creator or streamer who said bad game 3 years ago so they refuse to even look into it today. 
now for an actual review. Atlas is a pvp survival mmo with quite a few groundbreaking concepts. they have a 3d server browser for one. thats fucking awesome. ive always been a super huge fan of this. you can literally start in one server, sail west non stop and travel through enough servers to end up back on your own entering from the east side. whether or not you like atlas this is pretty crazy stuff in the game.
in atlas you can build boats, strap them with cannons and an npc crew, wage war on the open sea or take it on land with an invasion. its a brutal game but its supposed to be, its the very nature of the game. hence survival. you can sink boats and destroy your enemy in 100 different ways. mortars ballista catapults barrelbombs cannons, straight up ramming into them, fire gel... the list goes on. what can you do apart from battle swarthy midget pirates? you can tame animals, setup automated farms, build skyhigh bases, take over entire islands/servers, dig for treasure, dive for treasure, you can fight the army of the damned (npcs) on the sea and when you kill them they drop blueprints, gold, esccense, and a few free for 24 hours npc crew you can hire ( they will cost the normal gold amount after the 24 hours) you can do bossfights, quests, you can literally grow old and then visit the fountain of youth the become young again. you can fight the mighty kraken, or go harpooning for normal squids and whales. raid bases via boats, tames with cannon attached, cannons on land, bomb barrels and fire gel. aside from all of that you can make great friends or great enemies. you can have a terrible time here or the time of your life. your attitude is a massive part of your time here.

I enjoyed breeding/taming and i enjoyed ship building and role playing my character, meeting a lot of new people and interacting really made this game worth it to play. Now that they have completely removed VOIP, it is back to being absolutely unplayable, and not worth the time.

This game is broken...
Its still alpha, or beta, what ever there calling this game...so blah blah blah might change at full launch.
BS, this is how games are now, they call it alpha, or beta, or *early development*-but this game has launched, its an excuse to money farm, and to excuse bugs that should have been fixed long ago in development. 
So here goes why I give the game a bad review, and so avoid...
First of, it was an Ark x pac, that they decided to launch as a whole different game because all the season pass players would have got it for free. Its Ark, but its not.
I got almost no land claim, as the island i spawned was bugged for 18 hours with no way to jump else where, by the time it was fixed and i could move, most land was claimed, but I was still lucky to get any land at all.
If you join at this point, its join someone else, or get stuck living in a lawless zone.
Monsters are huge , but have hit boxes about the size of a coin.Most are hard to kill, then Alphas come by and you die automatically. Wolf and spiders teleport into you so you cant move or hit them, then you die.
The latest bug, is every time we sail off, at some point all the panels on the bottom of the boat explode for no reason, and the boat sinks. We lost 2 Brigs in 2 days, over 10 hours of work gone... no response from the devs... ever.... 
But, ThIs GaMe Is StIlL iN eArLy DeVeLoPmEnT!!!!
Its not, its an Ark re skin for da money. So if being Arks cancer again dosent ward you off, Ill say this,
The game has been very fun, the open pirate MMO was awesome. The limited land and the cancer roll trying to steal all the land for me crap-heads gets tedious, and the long un fixed bugs that were there on launch are making it unplayable. There dumping money into advertising, making streamer videos, but putting nothing into development except bells and whistles to attract more suckers, er, I mean customers. 

This is BS, and Steam needs to ban these scammers. They have turned early access into a money grabbing excuse to release a poor quality product, and then never finish it.
It has driven my team away, as their not fixing bugs that were there on day 1, and focusing on adding more content, more glitched and broken content....
every thing in this game is broke....

If you do try it, wait until you find out about the fountain of youth BS. Do not try this game unless you have hours every day to waste, and you like a brutally challenging game.

The newest update, they ban and silence anyone that makes the game look bad, went into the discord and got muted for asking how to contact a dev or report a bug. My whole crew is demanding a refund from steam, because a glitch took everything from us. I was hoping to save my company before everyone quit, but they rather mute me then try to satisfy a paying customer. 
This is a perfect pirate game, they stole our money, and now basically told us to F*** 0ff...

I regret that I can only give one thumbs down for Atlas. I tried to revisit it. Wanted to experiment with the new modular ships. I've now crashed six times around the same island trying to do a treasure map to get the gold for a larger shipyard. Oh, and using ship bottles to duplicate a ship, then trying to recover the ship crashes the game six times now, so while an interesting idea, it doesn't work. 

((Update 7 Jan, 2021))
Well, I tried single player again. It is still a buggy mess. 

My official experience was basically, you get offline raided and wiped, or people use exploits if you're on. 

The best experience I've had in Atlas was playing on the Darkside private RP server, which was modded. 

This is literally Ark with ships, and some slightly different taming mechanics. 


((Update 6))
Not enough text, so old information has been removed. 

I want to go into a long description of everything, but who will read it? The way Steam tweaks its review lists puts me at the bottom of the totem pole as it were. 

Single player: 

There are still a lot of crashes. As well as a lot of issues with the game. Single player is pretty difficult until you get some tames, and NPC crew for ships. I've only gotten a couple to handle sails so far. 

Multiplayer Official:

I've not played since initial release. It was horrid. Then, it got worse when large or mega companies found you. People use exploits, and will completely wipe you out while you are offline, ect. . . . just go read horror stories of Ark official. 

(I have to mention this, even though I shouldn't because the population is already so high)

Multi-Player Darkside private server:

This is what Atlas SHOULD be. But, its a role play private server. The rules are a little strict, especially if you join certain companies. The rules prevent a lot of meta-gaming and bring what goes on more in line with 1700's. If you're new to role playing don't be afraid, just role play yourself. But, it is a PRIVATE server, if you break rules you'll be dealt with one way or another. 

There is Roleplay which is the MAIN FOCUS. There is RPPvP as long as it is within rules. You can RPPvE but are subject to possible RPPvP according to rules of engagement. And possible get PvP'd by people who are breaking rules).

Here is the REEEEEE! Section for Darkside. There is a 2x2 area of the 15x15 world that is ""White List"" only. Its for streamers and tubers to create content with select people who will not break rules. The Royal Navy is also not limited by company member limits, ship limits, or tame limits.",1545549295,1680390326,False,5,0,0.507363736629486084,0,True,False,True

If you want an epic massive multiplayer experience, servers are very few and empty, with supposed balancing issues. I've hardly even bothered with it. 

If you want a singleplayer, or especially local multiplayer experience with some friends on a private host or server, and youre forgiving of flaws, than its honestly great. Beautiful graphics with the right settings, varied and flexible ship building and sailing mechanics, TONS of things to build allowing you to make an entire rudimentary civilization, decent amount of creatures/enemies, and an absolutely massive map with well designed islands. 

HOWEVER, the TONS of bugs (some worse than others), totally empty and dead towns with buildings you cant even enter, brain-dead AI, and very sluggish attack animations, among other things, pull the game down hard. 

You can sail the seas with friends in a fully rigged galleon run by your own crew, painted with custom sails and loaded with your own unique layout and an army of animals or soldiers as you build your own pirate kingdom, but you may have to do it with one eye closed and annoyed/dissapointed 25% of the time.

Pros
- Great crafting
- Great Graphics
- Difficult
- Customization on buildings is decent
- Customization of ships is great

Cons 
- Needs a lot of work, there are a bunch of bugs still. Ships are more like submarines.
- Battle and taming can be way too difficult
- Dedicated servers need more options like pirate camps
- Not a lot of melee weapon options, treasure hunting is a main aspect of the game and you barely do damage to some of these enemies

Boat didn't need gold, made sense considering how fast it could get destroyed and anyone could enjoy having any ship they wanted or been scared of losing it. Was hard for solo/small companies, but if you were part of a large one it was epic.

Then every few months or every wipe, they started messing up the game really bad, bringing back game breaking update like lawless claim, gold to build ship, fewer grid, explosive barrel usable from ship so you can 1 shot any other boat ( or get one shot without been able to realize the hell happened?) and now they try removing the ship you can customize yourself with new pre-built boring ship.

Also normally, after 2-3 years of early access there should be less and less bugs, instead i feel like there are more bugs then when i first started... new update and useless content bring more unfixed issues and unfortunately this company doesnt seem to set priority at the right place.

I wanna start off by explaining that I've been apart of following wild card since way back in 2015 when ARK was just a baby. The reason I mention that is because I've played both sides of the ""love them/hate them"" scale in that time. I went into this game with the idea that it wouldn't be as nice as it is in the trailers, that the gameplay would be awful, and that it would mostly be broken.

HOWEVER

I was pleasantly surprised, for as early access it is, the game itself is mostly stable, with hiccups here and there.
The combat is functional granted at times has its issues.
The sea life is easy to manage, though weather changes are a little too fast.
The housing situation leaves much to be desired, however I'm sure it'll even itself out eventually.

The pros for me very much outweigh the cons, and I'm still in shock. Having played ARK gave me an advantage, I knew how the system works for crafting, taming is effectively the same, and farming at its basics is the same. There are tons of changes and fun things to re-learn or just learn in general.

I do think the game needs a few things worked on though (at this present moment in time):
1. Claiming of land. In ATLAS land is hard to come by, and the problem is if you find a place to live you're either taxed to death by the owning tribe, or you're getting griefed because you managed to find an area.
2. PVE is not really PVE.... Players have found ways to kill and ruin the gameplay for people, and it's running wild. Jat has said his team is aware of the exploits, but a fix for that doesn't seem like top priority for them.
3. Hit boxes are all over the place. I have had issues where i'm fighting a snake and there's 30 arrows sticking out of him and he's only lost 2 hits worth of HP.

And that's pretty much it. Yes the game is frustrating when you die so easily to level one animals, yes things will spawn camp your house, and yes animals have crazy aggro range, but if you get mad just take a break... 

If you're debating on getting this game, I'd say wait. As much as I love it, unless you have the mindset to remember that you're in an early acess alpha testing phase, then this isn't for you. But 100% add it to your wishlist for when things get better!",1547267358,1678854189,True,5,0,0.473191648721694946,0,True,False,True

So because of the success of Ark survival  a lot of the developers resources are being taken by Ark leaving Atlas a little neglected. The irony of all that is that Atlas was at one point part of Ark before becoming its own game. So just be mindful of the fact before making a decision. This is still a very fun game with some really cool mechanics. Now I will say with again the bugs and neglect to fix them the price should be lowered but it’s still worth it’s money in gold as they would say.

Find the fountain of youth and battle your way through enormous creatures to reach it. Band together with allies to protect your sacred islands and start trading resources across the globe. Tame animals, and then level them up so you can breed them into a super species that can carry you into battle! Build incredible ships and level them up as you face off with the army of the damned and those who are your opponents,. May you never have to walk the plank, find yourself handcuffed in a guillotine or your head severed and mounted on an opponents wall. Keep yourself from ending up caged and at the mercy of an opposing company. 

Atlas holds many adventures as you not only face off against opposing players, you face many creatures great and small including the Kraken! (Which I have yet to face). Some of the finer points of the game, graphics, concept, and the endless possibilities, meeting other players from across the globe and learning many things you didn't know about gaming before. While there are many great people there also comes with it the more  toxic players, which can certainly be a downfall. Although, meeting with some of the kinder people, has certainly been enjoyable. So whether you are meeting an ally to take over some saucy pirates, or building your pirate empire, the game in itself, is quite enjoyable.  Although, with the great points of the game also come the not so great. Atlas is still in it's beta phase and there are many kinks that may need to be taken to a blacksmith to be flattened out....

Up until recently I would have certainly recommended the game to others. However, with recent updates came many more issues to contend with. At first those playing cross play, may have found themselves having to rescue their xbox counter parts, when specific structures placed on islands began to cause severe lag and disconnect coined DC for many players. An update was pushed through and an xbox only server set up, which squashed some of the existing companies that played cross play. Opening up servers to new settlers as the days have gone by. However, it appears that now many PC players including myself have not been able to play the game since this update. With latent optimisation comes many issues including a massive drop in FPS ( Frames per Second). rendering the game unplayable.  One can only hope that as new updates come, the team will remember the importance of optimising the games so that their fan and player base can grow. 

So even though the game's concept is quite enjoyable and it has been a great adventure meeting new player and learning through trial and error and from those helpful enough to teach you a thing or two, I wouldn't at this time recommend the game, for the reasons that a game in beta phase does come with many issues that need to be ironed out and that takes time. Atlas appears to not be within launch state as of yet and it may be a far reach for the team for a while. It just does not seem worth the headache and the disappointment of not being able to play because of something that is beyond your and your systems control. 

I do however, recommend that you stay tuned for when the team reaches launch stage, because Atlas in quite an enjoyable adventurous game. Where there is never lack of adrenaline filled battles and parts of this digital pirate world to explore! I believe that once the team has managed to banish the bugs that have been plaguing them and the game, that Atlas will be an enjoyable game for the masses.

Firstly to have a game in early access for more than two years should be illegal as its basically just robbing people of their money for something that will ultimately never be completed.
The GS Updates do more damage to the game than what they set out to fix. 
They say you can run this game on high graphics with a 970. That is just a outright lie. You need a minimum of a 3080 just to get 60 fps.
Singleplayer is broken, Official servers are broken. Unofficial are saving the day but should a customer have to create their own server just to have an enjoyable gaming experience. No they damn well shouldn't have too. To say im upset is an understatement. Countless hours spent trying to create my own server with no help from devs.

Look I could honestly go on and on and on about the problems so all ill say is STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME! The fact that they are charging £23.00 for this ""game"" is a daylight robbery! I wouldn't even download this for free let alone pay that price.

*Also don't bother to look for support. The staff are clueless and clearly barely communicate with each other. Bug reporting is just a game by this point*

Oh and just for fun. they recently rolled out a patch which in turn ruined more than it fixed (YET AGAIN) this patch ruined singleplayer even more. When I informed the staff on their discord I was told it was no broken and that if i came across a bug to file a report.

I was then told by the community that there is a list of known bugs... I kid you not (without counting) the list of bugs was probably in the thousands.

The game is set in a vast open-world environment where players take on the role of a pirate and sail the seas in search of treasure, power, and adventure.

The game features a vast world filled with different biomes, each offering its own set of challenges and opportunities. Players can build their own ships, recruit a crew, and set sail to explore the world, battle other pirates, and gather resources. The game also offers various land-based activities such as building and managing settlements, taming wild creatures, and engaging in battles with other players or NPC enemies.

The graphics in ""Atlas"" are impressive and the game's world is immersive, with dynamic weather and day-night cycles that add to the realism of the game. The combat system is intuitive and engaging, but can be a bit challenging at times, especially for players who are new to the game. The game also offers a deep crafting system, which allows players to create a wide range of items, weapons, and structures.

One of the standout features of ""Atlas"" is the ability to form companies with other players and work together to achieve common goals. This feature allows players to cooperate and collaborate on building settlements, gathering resources, and engaging in battles with other players.

Overall, ""Atlas"" is a fun and engaging pirate MMO that offers a lot of depth and variety. While the game is not without its flaws, such as performance issues and a steep learning curve, the game's world and gameplay mechanics are sure to keep players entertained for many hours.

Why they prefer to wipe servers without notice and make changes that 'had a bug' in order to run the remaining players off rather than just shutting the game down, I dont know. But this farce that its still in early access and that they actually believe this game will ever have player base above 3 digits is insanity.
I haven't played in years. I finally decide, with 2 friends, to rejoin the Atlas community. we found a server, Seagull's Beak. I checked everywhere I could to see if the server and game were stable and good. I found nothing saying otherwise other than the constant complaints about bugs. We'd been down this road before as players since the beginning of 'early access' and were willing to take the risk. So we log in, find a few nice people to play with, and begin our journey. We finally figured out the dumb module boat system and how to skirt that by buying shipyards to build our boat from scratch like God intended. (The fact that WC makes you spend gold to buy the shipyards to build boats from scratch, which was the best part of this whole game, is an indication of how out of touch they are with their fan base).
So we grab flotsam and dive for wreckage and finally get our 500 gold. (This was after trying a few treasure maps and having the guardians spawn nonstop the whole fight until we were overwhelmed and we gave up. They should not just keep spawning constantly). So my friends log off bc of how late it is but I press on bc I remembered how much I loved building my boat. I hand gather all of the mats I need to build a schooner from scratch. I log off at 3am. Next evening I continue my efforts and by 3am I had spent about 9 hours building this boat by myself, from scratch, with hand tools. It was beautiful and completely ready to sail. All the bells and whistles. It was awesome. I remembered why I loved this game so much back at the beginning.....then I go to log on tonight to play and I remember why 10's of thousands of people quit playing it. (Now a normal company who loved their game would've stopped this crap after the 2nd or 3rd wipe when they lost literally thousands of players). I can't find my server in the list. I go to several sites that all say the server is fine. I have my friends check and they can't find it on their list either. So I start digging online to see whats going on. Eventually after a frustrating hour of searching I find the answer in the following location: playatlas.com/ Home/ Forums/ ATLAS / Announcements/ Xbox and Small Company Servers. And there...there is the announcement for all to plainly see....(well, all who happened to stumble onto this buried page)....Posted at 1:45pm on friday Jan 27 that my server and 2 others were going to be wiped Jan 30. So after 2 years of refusing to touch this game bc of the constant bugs and wipes, I come back to it and waste about 20 hours of my life fighting bugs, only to get wiped again. No warning. No one else on the server said anything about it in the whole 20 hours I was talking to them. Obviously they didnt know either. WC couldn't even be bothered to set a pop up message of the day to let us know. How hard would that have been?
This is why their player base is about 400 people, down from 10's of thousands. So again I say, WC, if you want this game dead so badly, just pull the plug already. Its way more humane to just shoot the horse in the head than to stab it with a toothpick for years until it finally dies.",1675128314,1675128543,False,4,0,0.522308170795440674,0,True,False,True

This game will never get finished. It was never playable. You join a server, every inch of land is claimed. You can't build anything. You wander around for hours and find nothing to interact with. You scrape together a boat and find that even the oceans are claimed. You find a cool looking island but it's filled with nothing but locker storage next to impenetrable boats where all the guilds live on with 50 cannons and 20 layers of walls that you can't even damage with your primitive tools.

Finally you stop playing because what's the point. You will never get to build anything. You will never get to experience the game. You can even go make a private server (Which only allows you to host a SINGLE node! You can't even host a whole map) but find out very quickly the game is just reskinned ARK with nothing special added. If anything, it's a downgrade due to the lack of taming mechanics.

I can't recommend anyone play this game. It's been in perma-Access for over 4 years now and their latest update is to split the community up.

Some of the bugs with the most player impact have been ignored while adding content that feedback from the community clearly stated was unwanted. Reviewing after over 4000 hours of playtime through multiple seasons. The developers constantly ignore user feedback, dodge important questions during q&a and are very far out of touch with the player base that is supposed to be helping with feedback and they are also out of touch with the game they are making itself it feels like when playing at this point. This game has been handed off from one team to another a couple times in development and it shows in the content and its lack of unifying qualities. I would also like to point out that in no way should you expect a pve based story or game content. The focus of the developers is on pvp and that has been stated clearly. They just have pve servers available. As an edit I am playing the current season. The game has been broken on xbox for over a month they cannot even get logged in.

i stopped playing since they changed the map system. its so confusing now , and one of the things i used to enjoy was being able to cruise along the grids and enjoy the trip to my destination, with the portal system its just plain not enjoyable and confusing. so changing my review to do not recommend.

map system is an absolute dealbreaker, the portals are an eyesore, and its confusing how you get from point a to point b, where as the old system allowed you to literally navigate like a pirate across an actual map, accurately. The portal/new map system murdered my interest in this game.

* Difficulty scaling:
I have maximum settings for difficulty and forced maximum difficulty, but the tames I see are all lvl 12-40 at best. Meanwhile, the pirates I have encountered are lvl 400-860... I'm OK with pirates spawning as max lvl, but at least make the tames also spawn as max lvl. Or better yet, give me an option to set the lvl range of random tames.
I also have an issue with ships of the damned spawning in groups of 5-6. I managed to kill 1, but I cant loot it, because of the 2-3 Galleons that always spawns next to it..

*Upgraded recipes are really strangely designed. You have to gather 3-4 different resources of the same type to build a certain item. Why? I would kinda get it if it was easy to get 4 different resources, but at this point both palm trees and fir trees provide fir logs... That doesn't make sense and makes the whole idea kinda stupid.

* The cost of cannonballs are a bit too high for something that is such a vital part of the game.
* Pirates from pirate camps always hide in buildings and my tames cannot damage buildings... why not? At least make bigger creatures able to demolish buildings (War elephants, for example)

* Wind:
It's really annoying that the wind is almost always facing the wrong direction to where I need to go. In ARK at least you knew that your tames would always travel at the correct speed at all times. In Valheim they solved this same problem by allowing you to build an engine. Maybe that could be a thing here as well?

* Story: Is there a story in this game? Even if the story/goal of this game was to defeat all bosses, that would at least be something. The story in ARK kinda sucked and it was really poorly explained, but at least it had something.

*If you lose your ship, it's gone forever. Would it be possible to add a way to save a template of your ships? That way if you lose it, you won't have to spend hours rebuilding every single piece from scratch.

Summary:
I believe the devs have to go back to the drawing board and find clever ways of separating this game from ARK: survival evoled.
The idea behind it is good, but the execution is terrible.

Also just like in ARK, the real problem with ATLAS is the community. In ARK I refuse to play on Official servers and I'm happier for it. In ATLAS, I started out on an Official server and left for unofficial in less than an hour. Find an Unofficial server that has people you can get along with, and you'll have much more fun.

Solo is *possible*. It's not easy, not at all. I wouldn't want to do it on an Official server, TBH. I definitely suggest playing with friends. You don't need 100 company members, but a half-dozen or so can be a big help.

Overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes ARK-style games, as long as you are willing to deal with the fact that it is still in early access, and in a much more primitive state than ARK itself. Things will change, sometimes drastically. Sometimes you'll get hit by a bug and lose some progress. Sometimes a huge update will come through and you'll have to start over from scratch.

Edit: 2.5 years and 600+ hours later... Still playing, still avoiding official servers.

1) Ark is a good game. 
2) There is less proprietary nonsense to have to figure out. It still differs from Ark where it matters; enough to be a fresh experience.

Official PvP servers are trash on Ark ergo they are also trash here. Don't bother renting a dedicated server. Read other reviews to see why. I don't need to reiterate it. Instead, either play on a non-official server OR if you're just playing with one or two other friends just use the singleplayer non-dedicated hosting. Works way better here than it does on Ark.

There are skill trees that unlock more skills trees to unlock whole bundles of craftable items, instead of unlocking items individually per level tier. Lots of passive bonus skills to unlock. Seems like some of the dino benefits from Ark are obtained by the player directly through some of these skills.

Overall slightly quirky, but delightfully so. This just might replace Ark for me. I don't understand the hate this game is getting. If Ark still has some of its day-one bugs today, and this is running Ark's source, kinda stands to reason it's gonna have similar issues plus a handful of its own.

Atlas is one of those open world MMO games in which you are dropped in a sandbox environment and start from scratch to build a character. It has the same principle as games like Ark and Conan. Your goal is to become a scary and feared pirate and rule the seas with your crew of friends or random people. 

Because the game is a sandbox, you can collect almost anything from anywhere. Wood, stone, fibers, food, just collect it and build stuff. You can make fancy ships and weapons and set sail to blow up other players and become the strongest. There are different skill trees that let you build more stuff, make you tougher, let you use different weapons and to grant you some special abilities. 

It is hilarious when you play this game with friends and create a new character. You are free to choose any feature you like, and you can create some vile abominations as a playable character. You laugh your ass off for about twenty minutes but then the fun got sucked out of the game soon enough for me.

For me, Atlas is the fifth game that I played with exactly the same mechanics, skill trees and progression system. Normally, I would not mind too much, but the problem with Atlas is that it is just so unbelievably boring, broken and empty. 

You got some islands with almost nothing interesting on it, apart from a small town and some birds, and then you got the ocean. Hundreds of thousands of square feet of oceans. It is incredible how empty and boring you can make a game, and this one takes the crown. Of course, this kind of games are more fun with friends, but even then, it felt so pointless, repetitive and I did not feel any urge to continue playing. The most fun I had was just murdering my friends’ characters. 

In terms of graphics, the game offers nothing special. It got some sort of cartoon style look for the characters, which is nice to look at, but the environments and animals all look semi-realistic. This contrast makes it weird to look at. Also, the sea and land textures are really blend and lifeless. I know that you cannot make the sea anymore blend then it already is, but just add some jumping dolphins or something, while you waste away on your ship, traveling to the same-looking island as before. 
The sound and music offer nothing special and does not deserve any special attention.

The combat mechanics are poor, it feels inaccurate, stiff and any form of strategy is lacking in my opinion. When I want to throw a spear, it is pure luck if I will hit my target or not. 

If you thought that this game was stable and glitch free, think again. Ships clip through rocks, trees float in the air, you fall through the world and in an incident in which the ship was stuck on land, between rocks while trees where floating higher than the ship, made me think that I had some LSD accidentally. It was hilarious but very sad at the same time. 

Besides glitches, crashes, stuck loading screens and a ton of other issues plague the game, making it unplayable most of the time. Yes, it is early access, but if you want to charge twenty-five ducats for this mess, there is a basis of functionality that one can expect.

This is another one of those games in which the developers ship out an unfinished tech demo, cash in, and then fix the issues slowly and steady throughout the years. By the time the game is finished, nobody gives a sh!t anymore and so do the developers, because the dough is already in. It is games like this I hate the most.

In the end, there is not much more to say. Atlas is not the worst game, not by far, it is just too damn boring, and I could not force myself to play it any longer and become “a feared pirate”. I just buried myself in the endless ocean and never came out again.",1672245813,1672245813,False,28,2,0.684288203716278076,0,True,False,True

If you like to build stuff, this game has a ton of stuff for you to do. It's really the only game that I have ever come across that allows you to build and customize your own ship. There's a ton of different ways to create a ship that's unique and fits your play-style and creativity. I really enjoy the ship building. Also, there's a simple app that allows you to completely customize the sails and/or portraits in your base. You can put your own face on the sails if you wanted to. But the base building is incredible too. I have seen some truly amazing things that people have build. So I definitely recommend this game cuz it really is a hidden gem.

Welcome to the world of early access. The wipes do have their pros and cons and while having to rebuild everything is a drag, having a fresh start to try your residency on a different island is, in itself, an adventure.

Ok, with that out the way, let me talk about the game. This game is a survival game and is very meticulous about what you need to do to stay alive. There is a fair share of technical details about the game that truly separates the experienced captain and survivalist from the greenhorn land-lover. Personally, I enjoy the sailing aspect of the game, but snagging a flotsam with my grappling-hook while moving at full speed was not a skill that developed overnight. 

What I really like about this game is that you can find yourself in situations that really gets your adrenaline pumping (I.e: No one likes loosing a ship that took you many hours to build and customize, but knowing that any given naval battle could be your last time seeing your ship afloat does add a bit of anxiety to the battle). Again, skill and experience definitely plays a role, but this game has a planning aspect to it that definitely should not be ignored. However, there is plenty of room for YOLO in this game. 

While there is a sandbox-hobby element to the game - for those who want to suspend their reality and be stay-at-home farmers and enjoy the beautiful landscape, there is also numerous quests that players can embark on for those who enjoy the thrill of fighting crazy beasts, engaging enemy ships, or discovering new and uncharted landscapes.......all while trying to stay alive.

Again, in its current early-access state, this game will require some patience, but is still very enjoyable.",1671501144,1671501144,True,12,1,0.612151980400085449,0,True,False,True

Cons
-----------
* Its just a Mod for Ark in essence
* Bugs, Bugs and more Bugs
* Crashes galore
* Terrible animations
* Terrible sounds that lag and play out of sync
* Bad netcode. lots of desync and lag
* Fundamentally basic bugs 1 year into EA that should have been squashed by now
* Text overlaps other text in game making some things impossible to read
* Lots of unmappable keys, unlisted key mappings in controls
* Changing some options do nothing or the reverse of intended effect
* No percentage values next to sliders in the options menu for many settings such as FOV, Sensitivity, HUD scale etc
* Game play goes stale, especially as a new starter.
* Every piece of land taken, virtually impossible for a new solo or starter to survive
* AI movement and pathfinding is absolutely god awful, i mean Atari 1982 awful! Fish swimming in the air, parrots flying through the ground, Giraffes walking up vertical walls
* Third person and first person center of screen point does not match up at all
* Some character creation options do not work
* Ships clip into the water like a submarine
* Getting stuck on objects, scenery, animals etc very frequently
* Most of the issues you will face are absolutely hardcoded, they were and are the same in Ark, I fear this will never change
* YOU WONT GET OUT ONTO THE SEAS TO PLAY THE REAL GAME TILL YOU HIT LEVEL 8, THEN YOU CAN LEAVE THE FREEPORT AREA.
* Balance of resources is awful. Tons of types of thatch and slate on all islands until you release you cannot get more than 3 types globally.
* Next to no Metal nodes. Some islands have no pure metal nodes at all. Others have 2 or three on an island. Only found two types of metals Iron and Copper.
*This map feels rushed, as if the devs where desperate to get it out without balance testing.


Pros
-------------------
* Beautiful lighting at sunsets and sunrises
* Potential, lots of it for game play if MASSIVE changes are made and bugs are squashed
* First time out sailing is quite interesting
*The Building system and Ship Building System along with Ship Customization Option give this game good potential.

Positives:
1: I truly do enjoy the music in this game, the pirate Music helps portray the pirate Concept
2: The survival aspect have been rearranged to be tolerable now, so that's good
3: Fun with friends but you really have to be careful because if you move to a lawless island and you want a new friend to play, you will have to go back to the port island and then pick them up, its really annoying because one of my friends bought the game and wanted to play but he was so far away he just refunded the game, please change this because it would make it so much easier.
4: If your a ark player, this game might be for you as a lot of the issues presented with the game is similar to ark.
5: the skill tree is really good, that's the one part of the game that is really different to ark and that's what makes it unique in a way.
negatives:
1: very poorly optimised, i have 1050 ti, 16gb of ram and a 7th gen and running this game is a chore, I'm struggling to reach 60fps on low, and i even have seen a dude with a 1080 ti, 32gb of ram and a 9th gen and he is just reaching 50fps, they really need to fix this as this will turn a lot of people away from playing this game
2: the ping of there servers are not unbearable (I'm used to NA servers from ark, i live in the OC region), but its something to try and fix as it makes fighting animals and people a game of who's hits register, not to fun.
3:(cause i cant be f*cked to rewrite this section, I'm just gonna say the water issue is fixed, vitamins aren't as needing as they were)                                                                                                      

Final Verdict: tread carefully when buying this game, its a test of your patience and you WILL be grinding for days, you WILL get reset by other players  and you WILL not rival the big f*ck off Empires in this game unless you have insane skill, dedication and luck, but if its on sale and you really don't have anything better to do, go for it but at full price i honestly cant recommend it as you're better off getting ark as that game has fixed itself and it aint a bad game, but this game has way to much in common to ark to be a $40 game, but if you wait a little bit, this game might turn out to be decent, but unless that actually happens, i do not recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual, non tedious experience           1/12/2022                ~Famagatron",1545586834,1671240773,False,1,1,0,1,True,True,True

- distasteful and in some places downright broken UI (not fixed in all these years)
- lag, desync, wipes and other people ruining the immersion on multiplayer
- imagine the stupidest AI you've ever seen in a game and make it two times worse
- core game mechanics still broken after years, especially treasure maps which fail to give rewards 60% of the time and are not exactly easy to begin with
- combat is best described as a comedic knockback-fest of giant ball-shaped hitboxes
- in singleplayer you might get teleported 500km away on death, only to find your ship on the bottom of the ocean for no reason. Running LudovicLemaire/AtlasAutoSaver for periodic backups is a MUST

However it does have a few things that work, which taken for themselves already offer more features than some other fully fledged games. Specifically, it is downright the [b]best ""[i]pirate sailing exploration[/i]"" game[/b] out there. Just need to figure out what to avoid and disabling almost any and all HUD elements in the game options.

Sea of Thieves is not really a sailing or explaration game. It's a progressionless pirate themed PVP battle arena with a tiny world map and no sense of achievement outside of ruining other people's days.

Salt 2 has the right spirit, in terms of being singleplayer and offering an infinite ocean to explore. However even in its current state, ATLAS outshines Salt 2 in every aspect. In Salt 2 there is no wind and no need to ever adjust sails or to slighty change your course. There is no danger. Going to another island rarely takes more than 60 seconds. The islands follow 1 of ~4 blueprints and after 5 hours of play you have seen basically everything there is too know.

In ATLAS going to another island can take upwards of 15 minutes, the ocean is rough, there are creatures, ghost ships and natural dangers waiting for you. The islands are huge and varied and offer breathtaking views of forgotten monuments and natural formations. You have to adjust your sails according to the wind, which is really not hard to do but extremely satisfying. You can hire an NPC crew to help you out with handling the ship, at which point changing the sail direction becomes as simple as pressing shift+A or shift+D while you're at the ship's wheel.

If it wasn't for all the broken and unsolicited features of ATLAS, it would be a much better game. The ""gamey"" things about it like collecting power stones and beating world bosses is something I'll never do because it requires interacting with these broken systems, as well as playing in a large group or finding a way to cheese the enemies into getting stuck while you're poking at them for an hour. However I learned to ignore all of that and just use it as a singleplayer pirate sailing / exploration simulator. There is no alternative on the market that better scratches this specific itch.

That said, it's still not really worth buying. The bugs are just too pervasive, and the developers have really confused ""time wasting grind"" with ""challenge"". Everything they do seems to increase the amount of time it takes to DO anything, or get anything done. They seem to be catering solely to the people who can play 24/7, and have no life outside the game. 

Also, yet aqain, in a completely predictable development, the devs refuse to enforce their own code of conduct on their servers, making the game fun for the trolls, less so for everyone else. 

So no, can't recommend it in its current state, at least in vanilla without the usual large group of mods that make Ark bearable.  It doesn't seem like the devs have learned anything either. Other than how to extract money from people who should know better, but keep hoping.

additional: Also, their handing of mods is incredibly sub-standard. Ark works fine with mods on private servers.

Update December 2022: Mass banning companies and the players with no explanation because one player in the company was cheating/exploiting. Look into this, its kind of messed up. I only played single player anyways, but these devs have always been sketchy. IMO, when devs start doing this in their dying game, its sign of desperate cash grabbing. Ban players that have 4k+ hours in hopes they buy again. A common thing sh*tty devs do. Not being spiteful, I have no reason to be. I think I paid 3 dollars for this bug fest and was expecting exactly what I got. Garbage. I wouldn't be surprised if they follow up by abandoning this project to focus their resources on Ark 2.",1647920278,1670175445,False,4,1,0.391110718250274658,0,True,False,True

I’m going to list the issues I have been having and the problem I have found with this game. with a little back ground on myself first ive play 1 game for 15year and stop playing it to play atlas which thus far has been a complete waste of time. so, the problems:
the player base in this game is toxic, they are so toxic they themselves do not realize they are part of the problem: example do use galleon (biggest ship in the game) to sink sloops (smallest ship in the game) 
mega tribes(companies)raid smaller company none stop...i.e., lawless base raiding, 
this isn’t a PIRATE game this is BASE RAIDERS simulator. there is more land combat then sea bar none.
ask any player that has played this game for more than 3 season and they themselves will tell you that this game is dead, dying, or that this is ARK in pirate form. 
Developers DO NOT CARE about this GAME or YOU the gamers. I have submitted tickets that were instantly solved with no responses to what they did if anything. the discord is a joke they don’t keep people updated with when servers will be down or for how long the server will be down. when servers go down it could be for a few minutes or a few days.
this last season they have try to implement new and old idea to help with ""players out spoken thought"" about how the devs could improve them game, and yet everything they have done they still cannot fix simple thing like sail glitches or tames falling through the boat when using portals, or when swimming the map glitches to see under the ocean. I’m mean I could go on and on about the small stuff and so could a lot of the other players... 

over all I will not recommend this to other player and I will not continue to play this game since I feel like this is nothing but a toxic game that not only doesn’t care about its player base but doesn’t care about a health MMORPG environment. my recommendation for this game is to sell it to someone or a company that will do a better job with the performance.

do not spilt developer between 2 games so that both games can fail.
In closing there was some fun time and some cool people but the little bit of fun I had doesn’t out weights the absolute failure of this game and the short coming of the developers. This game has tremendous potential to be an amazing game but it’s at least 5-7 years from being a reliable and fun game and that’s me being modest about the developers abilities. 

update. season 11 
6x6 grid 
no freeport safety for solo player. 3 day into the new season and im already done with this game. 3 day of the same tribe coming in a wrecking shop. level 80 killing and wasting all my time. atlas when you figure out how to make this game not a complete waste of time, and a massive frustration let me know. 

everything i found that was either broken or didnt work:
quarries broken 
markets cant be place down unless completely flat and in the open.
tame house wont let you put tames in 
map broken. didn't display locations
atlas map has a weird bug that show multiple island that are not there, zooming into the atlas map make the island disappear. 

in closing if you have 3-4 friends or join a large tribe playing this game it can be alot of fun but if you are solo forget it

Initially I hesitated on purchasing this game since allot of the reviews were negative in regards to Solo Play however I am glad that I ignored them since the Solo Play is challenging, in depth and enjoyable. 
If your into a shooter style game then this is not the game for you since you have to build up your ships over time, get blown up and rebuild them again in order to be able to solo defeat the ships of the damned.    I am not a PVP style player so cannot comment on the PVP portion of this game.   

Couple of quick pointers
- build a bed on your ship as soon as you get it (learned this the hard way)
- for the ladder glitch, don't anchor in shallow water since the game is looking to place you on the bottom of the rope ladder to climb up into your ship.  Alternative is to build a wooden ladder on the side of your ship if you are stuck where you cannot use the rope ladder.
- there are plenty of mods available that add to the game play - special thanks to the players that have developed them.    
- have fun and enjoy the challenge!

It does not matter what XBOX you play on, you will more than likely crash in some rookie cove areas and many of the main map areas once you leave rookie cove. I only bought on PC to just finish this season since we were invested in it and also to help get us unstuck from the many crash loops XBOX players have to experience.
Is it a fun game?
yeah, if you're on pc then it is a more enjoyable experience but if you're on XBOX just do not buy this game, not until an actual fix comes through cause otherwise you won't be able to truly enjoy the game. It's upsetting and feels like the developers lied about the fix and the rendering is also horrendous on xbox. 

On PC you can enjoy travelling across the map and making progress but that's about it. If your company is small or if you came later than a week into the season, expect to live on your ship or a lawless area. You can eventually build a floating operating base but that's costly even to maintain along with a sea dock; problem with an fob is that you won't be able to place shipyards so you'll be stuck either begging another company for a spot to build on an island they may own or once again stuck in the lawless area in order to place your shipyards in case your only or last boat gets sunk. Leaving that land ownership to the players is just garbage, 90% of the time other companies do not want others on their land and when they do, they've hogged up the gathering structures with a 20% tax on top of that so 20% of whatever you harvest on their island, goes to their company bank.

Either make fob's cost a lot less to maintain or make it so that smaller companies don't get screwed over. Living in the lawless islands is stupid and even worse if you've reached that area late cause there goes the gathering structures. This game in it's current state is worth $9.99 at most.

Update Nov 21 2022: The game is still being worked on but there are still major issues from early on still in the game (Ship/wave desync, creatures falling off of boats) that have not been fixed. Also the shift from the original ships with great customisation to generic modular ships that don't have usable ladders at times is not great. 

I think the biggest issue at the moment is their focus on making PvP easier for people while degrading the core of what made the game fun in the first place for long term play. The auto resource gathering and gold generation makes it so you don't need to sail for stuff as long as you get some land to build on early. Not that you really want to sail early on as the modular ships can be buggy but have boosted capacity and lower over the original ships. Most of the end-game content can be done with basic crafted gear if skilled/experienced enough.

But why bother trying to stretch a season longer than a month or two when new content breaks the game and the servers need to be wiped. I think people want the long term persistent game-play similar to Ark and we are nowhere near that after many, many years of slow and seemingly unfocused development.",1574201903,1669097304,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Season before I lost a fully leveled character due to a bug on a update they put out and was told they could do nothing about it. Now this season globally banned because I was in a company of 75 people and several broke COC. How do you hood 75 people accountable for something maybe 5 people did. We were the 6th company this happened too so about 450 people have been banned for probably the violations 50-100 people did.

Myself anymore there is hope. They really must be trying to kill the game  only reason I could find to massively ban players that aren’t guilty of breaking COC and not care about losing them in your MMO.

A decent grindy survival game with decent pirate mechanics, but the glitches are ridiculous.

More recent review: Most that stuff is still a problem. Megacompanies have ridiculous advantage over everyone else and will crush you if and when they find you. You'll never really put a dent in them, but you might have fun sinking their ships and making them have to build and level more of them. 

I can't say I'm surprised after how they ruined and continue to ruin ARK. 


Even more recent: They've added cross-season buffs for the company that completes a wonder first. This means that megacompanies have a higher base level and max level than you, permanently. The impossible task of competing with these people has become even more impossible as they are inherently stronger than you. 

Game is still suffering from power creep and poor management. They added modular ships that ruined the creativity of shipbuilding and forced everyone into a simple meta. The more they add the more dull the game becomes, much in the way they ruined ARK.

It is still a shitshow of bugs and exploits, but now it also has poor design built into it's very core.

The game is dead, and will probably never return. Even if you are interested in PvE. Please read before purchasing. As a gaming community, the worst thing that can happen is to be abused and prevented from playing the game. This is EXACTLY what the developers have done. 

In the last two years. Many major companies in the game (groups of players) have been banned for unjustified reasons. Let me be clear, the majority of these banned players have never cheated, nor condoned it in their gameplay experience. Yet, they have been PERMA BANNED, without appeal, and sometimes without reason. 

Recently my ENTIRE group has been perma banned because one player decided to join us, secretly dupe items, and leave. There is only so much companies can do to enforce and prevent cheaters. Adhering to the advice from the Developers of kicking any cheater from the company, and reporting them and we would be fine. However, the opposite happened, and thus an additional 70 players are gone from the community. Two weeks before then, the SAME thing occurred, from the same malicious person causing 70+ other players to be banned. Additionally, the exploiter/cheater has YET to be banned.

No Appeal process, no justification, I have not logged in for months and yet somehow I am an affiliate to this? I have been playing since this game first released on steam and have never been involved in cheaters. I despise cheating in any MP game. The development of this game has been minuscule at best, and absolutely no clear effort to resolve glitches/bugs, latency, or even Frame issues.

This company is an insult to the gaming community, and this game will have no one in it soon. Broken promises and money stolen.
Fuck that. Fuck this company. Fuck these developers, and their spaghetti coded game and pea sized brain.

Unless you are playing Solo and living out of a Freeport you run the risk of being banned from the enforcement team for something that you had no part in or even had any idea was even happening.

-the hud ui design is terrible with all craftable items having some stupid background so you can't even tell what the item is without mousing over it for the text popup.
-melee combat against even a boar is bad (especially the spear. why is the attack button right click and the throw left click? The default attack is a swipe? spears are not slashing weapons. there is no quick stab and the stab they do have takes so long it feels like you're in an episode of Dragonball Z)

Here is my personal list of most of the sins they committed last year:

- banning big 70+ tribes without giving any reason besides ,,you broke our Code of Conduct"" (of course the code of conduct is written in a way that developers can interpret it as they please). Here are some examples: TBA (reason of ban unknown), Void (reason of ban unknown), Hellraisers (reason of ban unknown), SDC (reason of ban unknown), See you (reason of ban unknown).

- pushing an unfinished update that caused a full grid wipe for 1 of the last big companies left on the server. After that situation players asked devs for a public apology to clear their name since some of the player base thought that this company was cheating. Devs responded with a link to support ticket and never helped them in any other way, of course no apology from devs. (most of this company members uninstalled the game).

- pushing updates with KNOWN and reported major bugs. Here is an example: There was an update with ship duplication system (it's not a joke) and even though dozens of players told them about possibility of exploiting their system they still pushed it, destroyed pvp server because people duped everything worth of duping, and then after 1 day they disabled duping system (of course it was way too late).

- adding useless features that nobody ever wanted or asked for. Here are some examples: Modular ships, catapult barrels, ships duplication system, trade winds, teleports, tames with platforms, poisoned arrows, sea forts buff towers, temples, whole industrial package and many, many more.

- ignoring the fact that game is extremely unbalanced for years.

- destroying the beautiful and very enjoyable ship system made by original developers (brigantines, schooners, galleons) and adding broken, undeveloped, stupid, ugly, not fun and unbalanced modular ship system (broadsiders, ramming gallys, cogs, tramps, turtle ships)which literally nobody lied or wanted. Since the new ship system was very bad and everyone was using the old ,,legacy"" system (devs called It legacy to show that it's not supported anymore), developers forced us to use modular ships by making legacy ships totally unbalanced (slower, weaker and with less fire power). So, they dumped a very well-developed ship system, added a crappy one and then forced everyone to use their new bad system.

- deleting every single negative opinion about them (atlas developers) on official atlas discord, deleting players suggestions that devs didn't like etc.

- making dozens of feedback channels where they asked for player’s opinions and never including any of those opinions in the actual developing.

There's always some new bug around the corner to ruin things, there's just nothing to enjoy.

Hi everyone, I don't recommend this game to anyone. During my 4500 hours, I have seen a lot, but what new developers do is no longer within any limits, your level can be lowered at any time, even if you got it in a long and legal way. Even if you have raised the level after that, it may be cut off again. Small companies can't do anything here, and big companies can also wipe it out at any time, even if you didn't break anything. For an invisible nickname that was allowed for 3 seasons, now without any warning, they start to ban after 3-4 weeks from the start when everyone has already pumped and completed quests and create a new character is not an option. This is only a small part of the disadvantages of the game, even for developers at the moment.

UPDATE. 12.11.2021
After playing another 3300 hours, I can say that this is a game piece of the sh1t bug. But at the same time, I advise you to play it.

UPDATE 13.10.2022
I do not advise anyone to buy this game for my 9000 hours, I have seen a lot, but what is happening in the game now just crosses all boundaries, large companies of 75 people are simply banned by developers without explaining normal reasons, every player of the company is banned. If you just joined a large company on an ad, you can get a ban for 1 person and even without explaining the reasons. Over the past 4 months, about 4 companies have been banned, each of which had 75 people. Online at the moment in the game 300 people. I don't recommend this game to anyone.
I do not have a ban in this game, I just decided to warn you against buying it.

Custom exp rates were favorable for players who were looking for a more casual environment, and although there was a learning curve for a new player it wasn't awful.  I played with 40+ mods that increased the depth of the game and reduced the grind.   And I'm having a really great experience.

Game still buggy, laggy, and still nothing is documented or explained at all. No major progress seems to have been made.

Update: Early 2020
Atlas has improved its core game systems to feel much better. The game is mostly lacking in UI quality. At this point I would consider Atlas to be a neutral recommendation.

Update: Late 2022

So its been a while, figured id give the game another look. I can say they fixed a few issues with sp that make it mostly playable, the talent tree redesign has consolidated a few things to expedite progression threw the earlier parts of the game. Resource mills and warehouses allow players to gather constant rate of materials without direct farming but this is a slow process and not very good to supply an active ship build so players still want to temper their ships size to their personal needs, most people will probably find a schooner more than enough for most Solo Play as you can level ship stats and add better quality components.

Where the game still really suffers for solo players and small groups is the fact it is still being widely developed as a pvp mmo so alot of the more recent changes such as new maps, pve content, etc is only available online threw their pvp and pve servers which wipe constantly with each new ""Season"". In their recent QA they stated they had plans to eventually add map options for single player worlds.

Developers that claim they listen to the community and they do not. They have a grand vision for the game. Well if their vision was for it to be Dogshit then they accomplished that one. 

For 10 seasons of atlas and 2 accounts the game has gotten worse. With every patch or update it becomes a ""Let's see what they have broken this time"" scenario. And if they fixed the bugs in a timely manner that would not be an issue but it takes this company months.

Dev team Bans large companys without probable cause or if there is no notification on what the ban is for. the dev team is completely worthless and honestly have no idea what they are doing or where they are taking this game while claiming to being close to calling this finished and leaving early access. 

I would not recommend this game to anyone in the public unless you like disappointment and i would never give this company any more time or money so they can shut this horrible idea down and maybe sell it to some company that makes it better.

The game is in early access, thus full of bugs. Noone knows if some mechanics are intended or just a bug, because there is literally no communication except in a discord-channel that gets flooded by messages daily. As a player, you have literally no chance to check if what you do in this game (when it appears weird to you) is a bug or intended mechanic. 

Just one day ago (13.10.2022), about 200 players were banned, out of nowhere, no warning, no explanation, except the explanation ""Violation of Code of Conduct"", which can be literally ANYTHING, including calling someone else ""dumb"" in the ingame-chat.
Some of those players may have intentionally used bugs, but they banned the entire clan of those players. the 3 biggest clans were banned without any given reason. all of them would have to buy the game again, not knowing what caused the global ban of their account. So, if those players would buy a new copy of the game, they could just get banned again, still not knowing what for.

Its not uncommon that players have alt-accounts in this game. One clan had its alt-account company banned, which was literally only building RP-buildings, while the other 2 clans still have their alt-accounts.

Can not recommend the game in the current state. I can live with any sort of bugs, server crashes, performance issues (omg the performance is SO damn bad!) and whatnot, but getting banned for not doing anything shady, just because someone in the same clan did something illegal - nope. Thats not worth to throw away money for a new account. Over 9.000 hours of played time gone, from one minute to the next.

ITS A SCAM!

I can just warn to not buy this game. After 2 years of Early Access the game got still the same gamebreaking bugs and glitches like in the first days. There are several gamebreaking bugs which had been reported since 2 years but which are still not fixed yet.
Instead of fixing these needed issues the developer team just answer on tickets with copy paste messages no matter on what you request for. its always the same response.
Additional the that the server performances are horrible. Even with just 10 ppl in the grid and propper pvp builded base the server ping of the entire grid is on 250. no matter in which region u are located to. and additional to that the server crashes almost every day and gets back creating new bugs and gamebreaking stuff which have been abused by several pvp tribes to fight. 

the game overall is fun to play if u play for ur own. as soon as it goes competitive it is a nightmare. there are not just the mentioned bugs and performance issues, even the enforcement team is not objectiv or kinda understandable due to the reason they do not even communicate after banning any player for whatever reason given. 

To summarize:

I can just warn u to not waste ur money in a game like that. It got a nice engine and a nice concept, but the execution of it additional to the service provided by the devs are way too big negative points to play it. It is quite understandable that on the official pvp server are almost just around 500 player per day on a map which can include having 24000. The community and developing management managed the game into an almost dead game on multiplayer.

FUGrapeshot! I really hate you, and so does my dog... which is weird because he always loves everyone!

One final parting item of feedback for the developers --- that game mechanic where the pirates in camps mounted to cannons or guns aren't able to take any ranged damage is terrible! What genius came up with the idea of zero damage by any/all ranged weapons until a player lands a single melee attack? 

Sure, this prevents players from snipping with a rifle or bombing with mortars against those targets, but isn't that the point of having ranged weapons? To attack at range? 

It's just a cheaty and lazy method to force melee combat to clear pirate camps. This actually wouldn't be so bad, were it not for the fact that the melee combat mechanics are horrible and clunky. 

Not a fan.

Furthermore, it's dying, because even the die-hard fanboys can't cover up the indifference with which this game was cobbled together. The casuals mostly quit playing after the first couple of weeks. The free DLC, by ISO (who should know better) is now an old joke. The Blackwood reviews and play-throughs? That's just people in fly mode zipping around, spawning stuff in, cutting out after one or two episodes, and making wild, speculative statements that have no bearing on reality. Those Youtubers didn't do their job, either. What a fascinating modern world in which we live. So how to put it in a politically correct tone of voice taking into account accuracy and sensitivity...

IT'S A $10 INCONTINENT DOG.

There are simply too many crashes, horrible frame rates, bugs, out of date documentation, rarely posted patches that are potentially game-breaking in and of themselves. The progress towards modular ships is depressing because they are the most useless, ugly things I've ever seen. The little bits of delight are ruined by moments of rage-quitting frustration when you become stuck in the terrain, or your ship submarines, or you find out that your crew can't use weapons at all. Let's take the Blackwood DLC, for example. Missing textures, invisible objects to get tangled up in, terrain you can't see or move through, and vast, vast emptiness, or over-spawning to the point of cliche. One example would be that time a level 226 tiger spawned in Freetown (Should have been called empty town - almost empty of people), and ran through killing everything EXCEPT the NPC people. Starter game killer, right there. Another example, on the Blackwood map, there is the fact that fish are only found in some certain spots ON ISLANDS, despite being necessary to the (hideous) nutrition concept. In fact, I have yet to find a single fish on that ocean map. The underwater isn't detailed at all. Why was this map released in this state (yes, it's free, but it's really pretty meh)? 

Back to the main game, where the concept of subject research is apparently a foreign concept to the development team.How about the fact that none of the developers realized that what they are calling a ""figurehead"" is actually part of the sail system? LOL. Sure, the rigging keeps the masts in place from side to side, but what about the ""Stays,"" the part that keep the masts in place from the front and rear, and also gives even square-rigged ships a chance to hoist sails that can catch the wind at less-ideal angles? Why wasn't the nautical game more... well,,, nautical? What happened to my frame rates? What with the CTDs? Why is it trying to set up my graphics to a level THE GAME CAN'T RENDER? Why is your GUI so bad? Why is playing online so unpleasant? Why didn't you bother to listen to the community when they pointed all of this out even before day one? Easier to ban the people making a scene rather than fix the issues, right? 

I read back at the beginning of the year that the developers felt that players didn't share their ""vision."" ""Vision,"" as the devs described it, was the ability to see the end game. Unfortunately, that means that their three-step conceptual chart resembles the old South Park meme ""Steal underwear ....  profit."" 

Here's a helpful hint: vision means you can see the moves you need to perform to reach a certain end. What you have isn't vision, it's code-induced ""visions."" The kind that happen when you have one moderate success under your belt, but lack the rest of the team to realize that result again. To put it another way: you have a metaphorical couch stuck in your hallway which can be neither placed, nor removed. That is the current state of your game.  

In practice, that culminates in dithering, re-inventing the wheel, running into icebergs because you are only looking for the NYC docks, and in general being a collection of second-stringers. They should all wear bags on their heads out of fear of being recognized.

That said, I knew all this going in. It is true that there are parts which are fun. Curiously, they are the same bits that were fun in Ark, for the same reasons. But for every 10 minutes of fun, be prepared for hours of annoyance, as your server is down, a mod you like no longer works and the devs haven't released a mod API in forever, or because they've gone in with an excremental (Nitrado) server host who loves to thin out your already thinned virtual box. I bought the game for less than $10, which is likely its absolute value, since it is merely an Ark knock-off.

The pve is janky. The aggro range of animals is like a dome, if you enter the dome (even if you dont see the animal) you will be attacked. While that is annoying its not the end of the world.

The pvp. What a disgrace. WIldcard (or whatever they call themselves now) should be ashamed of themselves. I have over 1k hours in this game and around 4k hours on ark (spread across psn, xbox, and 2 steam accounts, long story non-relevant and no I wasnt banned just made a new acc). 

The pvp desync makes it so that sometimes (often) you will shoot a ranged weapon (fire arms are hitscan and bows are projectile) firearms will simply not register. This means that although you are a better shot, if you get unlucky, the enemy is essentially invulnerable. 

The problems continue. You can place puckles (think auto turret) in shrubs and puckle towers anywhere you desire. This means people spam them everywhere. Aside from that, this game has been plagued by hackers since its inception. All in all a bad game. NO NOT BUY.

I have played this game for over a thousand hours and I can't say it hasn't been exciting or entertaining. The problem comes when you look at the progression of the game: where it is, and where it was back when it was 'released'. There isn't a lot of substantial differences. They ALWAYS end their update posts emphasising that ""Atlas is still in Early Access"", but the game keeps going downwards. The game has two major issues that the vast majority of players wanted to be changed:
- Vitamin system
- The time you spend sailing doing absolutely nothing

None of these 'features' have been addressed. Additionally, new critical bugs have appeared. Apart from sailing, treasure maps are a key aspect of the game. These are events that basically consist of going to a specific island and dig up a treasure map with gold and blueprints. Before being able to dig it up, players must defeat a bunch of NPCs. These NPC's have worked fine until this season, in which they have been bugged so that they can't attack you and, consequently, they'll go back into the ground after a few seconds, entering an eternal loop of respawn-despawn as the system understands they are being glitched by players. This bug hasn't been fixed yet and the devs specifically said it wouldn't be fixed with the first 'hotfix' of the season.

I am changing my review from 'positive' to 'negative' today primarily due to the aforementioned reasons. Again, the game has been enjoyable despite all the bugs and glitches, but it has become repetitive and the fact that they are adding features nobody asked for instead of focusing on listening to the community that has spent so many hours playing this games is quite disappointing.

They really don't have any clue how to work with their community to set development goals and content, let alone actually prioritizing what bugs to fix. They do everything to a maximum of 70%. Everything lacks polish, everything is a work in progress. It's basically Early Access forever because they just don't know how to run an actual MMORPG off their ARK experiences.

It's a hardcore experience, there's a lot of reward for actually coming together with a solid group and making your mark on the map. The frequent wipes are often criticized by the alpha tribers from ARK that are used to just locking down a map and playing double dutch with eachother in their bases. The wipes are a good thing no matter how you look at it. The reason the wipes are good is because the game is inundated with vultures that have no interest in ""good fights"" or quality content. These supernerds are degens with single-digit IQ that wait around for however long it takes to break everything you've built once you go offline. Keeping these low-effort slimey people from hording things for years is absolutely crucial to maintain some semblance of balance in the game.

Lastly, this is not a game that will make good on its' potential. There just isn't enough money being made by ATLAS and the developers have long-since realized that they will make more money funneling it back into ARK instead. The amount of effort it would take for them to optimize ATLAS - despite how incredibly good it could be - would never hold a candle to the amount of money an equivalent ARK project could net. So it's all come down to the Whales... the people who spend big to own multiple accounts, who pay chinese farmers real life money for in game services and items, or the people who would lick the scum off the boot of anything ATLAS period because they are obsessed with griefing and they want this to go on forever just how it is.

And im not talking about 1 or 2, I'm talking about a mob of them where it becomes a game of dodge ball as in the balls are the enemy and if you get hit ur dead. Graphics are mediocre, and movement and combat animations are clunky and rigid. Sometimes you will punch or attack enemies and the game won't register the hit. Glitches in this game are vast and game breaking, there's even one that when lured by a mermaid u get stuck in animation even after leaving the mermaids range which doesn't allow u to interact with anything, so if on a ship and u crash, u loose that ship forever. Mermaids, can force you into the water using a lure skill that never disappears if caught in their range, so if your alone and your ship is sinking, u won't be able to repair because as long as ur inside the ship, and in her range, she won't stop luring you, your stuck inside the ship's bottom decks moving towards her even though ur held back by a wall/ hull. Even if you manage to escape the range of the siren, the game will bug out and you might not be able to steer the ship which might end up killing you and destroying your vessel. 

When moving to a different area, and therefore a different server, the game might crash. If too many players in the same area the game might crash. If too many objects in one area, the game might crash. If the game crashed, the game might crash... again. 

Gold is hard to come by when starting out, even the treasure maps lead to burried treasure guarded by high leveled npcs that will completely sweep the floor with you. They have the tendency to reset their health bar by going under ground. 

Update: Devs removed a bunch of islands and wiped player existing levels after saying they wouldn't do that anymore. At least they added resource collectors.

Update 2: Most ships now cost gold to build among the other regular resources to build (Used to only cost natural resources)

Ship focus has switched from complete customization to basically pre-designed ships called ""modular"". 

Update 3: Ship yards which are used to craft ships now also cost gold so anyone who isn't in a large team will be unable to sail even a sloop. Gold is a rare resource, extremely difficult to come by.

The game is still being updated, and it wipes to prevent large groups form becoming so OP that no one else wants to play it, which is a good thing. If you don't like it, go play single player. It is fairly balanced and there are ways you can solo or play with friends so its not exclusively multiplayer. The combat system takes a little getting used to, but its not hard to learn. The character customization is phenomenal in my opinion, and the gameplay itself is surprisingly engaging. There's nothing quite like the feeling of sailing by yourself and suddenly seeing a group of ships of the damned (which you then evade by the skin of your teeth), or finally finding that treasure you spent 4 hours searching for.   

my best advice for new players is don't bite off more than you can chew. Start off with a basic ship, don't go treasure hunting until you feel confident with your combat skills, and start off with low level stuff. Don't try to take on a high tier treasure by yourself at lvl 12. It wont end well.

Bottom line, It's still early access so don't expect perfection. That being said, this game is fun to play even solo and has a lot of really neat features.",1664135634,1664135776,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

It's not TOO populated where you're fighting people all the time, it is an exploration game, so quicker decay timers, which helps with ""pillaring"" a COMMON Ark problem, and the game is gorgeous and rewarding. It has much better tooltips and tutorials that help you play, it has a TON to do, and it's an absolute BLAST. My favorite thing compared to Ark, NO LAG SPIKES, can't say enough about this game, I've played hours already and feel like I've BARELY scratched the surface. To say it's a combination of Ark and Sea of Thieves is appropriate, except it takes the good aspects of Ark, and Sea of Thieves would be even MORE appropriate.

Also, when I say not overly populated, when joining public (yes, I LOVE public realms) it shows 0 players, and 1 realm which might scare you, but I've seen players on EVERY login, so it's just different in how it calculates, or it's wrong, but we've seen people on EVERY login.

When it came out there was ship building in that you had to build your ship by hand plank by plank. It felt good in my opinion. Now since it seems like a new group took over they changed the whole game away from how it used to be.

The game as it is now is not worth even playing and if I could even with near 300 hours played I would request a refund because the game as it is now is a completely different experiance. And its not better. Ships are now build fully just by placing them down. It doesn't feel like such and accomplishment to gather the resources anymore. The whole game has been shifted away from how it used to be and really I just can't enjoy it. They just have a mass of prebuilt structures now instead of building your own base up it feeels more like just placing fully built buildings down.

My suggestions for the Devs of this game is to sit down with someone who's never played Atlas, and watch them for a few hours.  If you can't get the first few hours of gameplay to a decent state, how do you ever expect this game to grow and be successful?

I watched several videos made when the game was released showing tons of bugs, and just clunky, awkward, bug ridden gameplay.  I ran into most of those same things in my first few hours.

Pros
-Beautiful game if your PC can handle it, if not the low level setting is still quite good.
-Great for long session gaming, but can be left at places by just stopping at an island nearby or even just anchoring the boat is a safe area.
-Relatively easy to use combat system with a section of the skill tree being just for techniques.
-Speaking of, the Skill Tree is split up into sections that can be unlocked relatively quickly and spread your way through them all, or you can focus your points into completing a few trees.
-Crafting system is well thought out and has clear progression, though is linked to a couple different sections of the skill tree.

Now, Cons:
-Sailing can be quite hard when first starting unless you're playing online with friends, this is until you can get some crew AI to control your ship through keyboard shortcuts. Otherwise you have to go control each part of your ship separately by going to it. Like the sails needing raised, lowered, or turned to the wind.
-Gold, the currency of the game, can only be found at sea, and only collected by a certain tool or by finding treasure from a map. Boxes floating at sea have to be collected by a throwing hook, which is a little far into the skill tree system, so you won't be doing that yet. The buried treasure maps are found in bottles that randomly spawn near shorelines of islands. Those, however, are guarded by enemies that are usually way out of your league in the beginning. So gold will be hard to come by for a while.
-Boredom, straight up. If you're not into grindy games, then this is not for you. This is a game you have to grind in to get to the raw materials needed to do anything. The amount needed for a ship capable of battle is immense and even then you will need literally several tons of metal to keep weapons repaired and stocked.
This game is not something you spend 10-15 hours to beat. Even 30 hours in I've only built a ship somewhere in the middle of the size range and it took significantly less time only because I had people to help get resources with. Mostly because you need a skill that is pretty costly to get in order to ride animals meant for gathering.

Pretty much ARK but slightly harder + more features - which is why I bought it, having being burnt out on hundreds of hours on ARK split-screen PS4
Won't recommend because it's unfinished, unpolished and not sure whether it will actually be supported with meaningful updates in the future. 

Things I like: 
+ It's ARK+ so all the features in ARK (build, tame and level things up) are here. 
+ New dedicated skill trees are really nice. 
+ There are now other NPC humans - including Crew Members you can hire, outfit, command and level up. Hostile pirates to be added soon too. EDIT: The hostile pirates where added and they're a good addition to help flesh out the world but they're bullet sponges FFS
+ Giant sea monsters + mythical beings! Undead, Krakens + Hydras! Awesome stuff. 
+ The depth of the ocean really scares me, but it's wonders are great and facing fears is awesome. 
+ You can build actual boats now, not just rafts. Redesigns of items already in ARK are neat too. 
+ The waves look great, graphics decent overall 
+ Character customization is improved, with more options to change and better looking characters. 

Things I don't like: 
- Still barely any way to gauge when you're ready to attack ""this"" creature or ""this"" objective. Often just turns into a slaughter + loss of past few hours of progress
- The lock-on combat system is absolute fucking garbage and is better without it. 
- I was fighting a pirate base and it seems they regen health at a distance for some reason. So I was endlessly sniping them. When I finally went in to melee, they all immediately agro'd and where way too hard to fight. What a waste of time
- The ARK grind is still there, even with single-player mode + settings tweaked. Must be worse online. 
- You have to be really accurate when climbing onto the boat's ladder. Often has you struggling in the sea, getting thrown off it every time a wave gets high enough. Deadly when there are sharks about. EDIT: They supposedly patched it to make it easier, but it's just as hard
- Whole thing is a lazy excuse for a game and proven to be ARK with a quick skin slapped on it.

ATLAS is what PIRATES OF THE BURNING SEA could have evolved to if it had ever had forward thinking devs.

ATLAS offers many things VALHEIM is lacking, and VALHEIM is a damn good game.  However, VALHEIM is lacking land AND sea content. You only get land with VALHEIM. Very little sea. Almost no sea. ATLAS gives you an official multiplayer server to play  with other people. It's very simplified. Just log on to  the server and everyone is there (However, the chat system only works for the quadrant that you're in. There are many quadrants.)  ATLAS gives you npc crew to help you sail your ship and fight hostile npcs while treasure hunting. As a solo player this npc crew feature is HUGE. You don't need any friends to join you on a Brigantine or Galleon or Schooner or Carrack to sail it competently. The only other game I've ever played with npc crew was STAR TREK ONLINE.  The npc crew is HUGE. You can outfit them with weapons, shields, and armor. You must pay them.  It's an awesome system.  ATLAS has a large variety of ships which you build yourself.  I've only been playing a week and I've lost two schooners already due to rookie mistakes. ATLAS has a HUGE variety of resources and the crafting system is HUGE.  You can build almost anything. Very similar to VALHEIM in this aspect, however VALHEIM doesn't offer any of the sea content. 

VALHEIM only has one advantage over ATLAS that I can see.  VALHEIM has terraforming while ATLAS does not.  Terraforming would be nice but ATLAS is still blowing away VALHEIM despite the fact. 

If you're thinking about buying ATLAS I would highly recommend this game IF you like pirate games and huge mmo type sandbox maps. HUGE map divided into many sectors.  Buy ATLAS if you love crafting games.  If you're an EVE or ALBION or NAVAL ACTION pvp type of player you can play on the official pvp server or the role playing server.  

Apparently ATLAS wipes the pve server about every four months as the game is still in early access. Considering you can build a galleon in less than a day once you know what you're doing I don't see much of an issue with this.

If you do decide to buy the game DO NOT EVER OVERLOAD YOUR SHIP WITH CREW.  It will sink quickly. And even a chicken or monkey counts as crew! lol 

BE SUPER CAREFUL TO NOT INADVERTENTLY DEMOLISH A PLANK ON YOUR SHIP. It will sink. I lost a schooner like this. 

Also, ATLAS has a myriad of animals you can tame. IF you love games that let you tame animals you should definitely buy ATLAS. I don't think there is any animal which cannot be tames. Did I mention there's a MYRIAD of animals. Yeah, that means a lot.   

As a long time pc gamer I highly recommend ATLAS.  It's not for everyone but as for myself and my kindred sea loving gamers it totally scratches that itch.",1662213276,1662213553,True,7,3,0.597170770168304443,0,True,False,True

This is quite the game. It really is. To understand the full chaos behind the game, you have to know the history of it. From the launch to the unfulfilled promises to the updates that started pushing it away from what we all hoped it would be, it's been a bizarre experience to say the least.

Make no mistake, I do enjoy ATLAS. As you can see it's one of just a few games that I have put over 2,000 hours into; however, the flaws far outweigh the enjoyable aspects of this game. Hopefully at some point it'll get over that hill, have the major flaws fixed, and have a re-release worthy of the hype it received at early access launch. Until then, your best bet is to get it on sale if you can, and I mean no more than $5.

Though, the skill trees are still pretty messed up, at least you can build thatch houses again... and no longer need to unlock a gate to leave grids. (That was the worst, especially in the tutorial area.) At least we don't need coins to build ships, we just need them to build the shipyards. (I don't know about the special ships, or the prefab ones. But meh.)

Combat feels a bit better now, but melee is still a little slow.
Weather is still slow, I think the game needs more rainstorms, since finding drinkable water can be a hassle at times.
I hope that crew don't need as much gold as they used to, but I'll have to check that myself.

This game is ALPHA, pre-release, and the bugs that cost you EVERYTHING you have earned are common and to-be-expected.  The developers admit that up front.  They say in very VERY bold letters that this is pre-release, and if you don't know what ""pre-release"" means, you will learn quickly.  THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION GAME.  This is a game that people are figuring out how to make fun.  If you bitch about this game being buggy you are admitting that you don't know jack about how to fucking read.

The concept is great.  The content creators have earned their pay.  I applaud every very flawed effort they have made to make this game real.  The code team is fucked.

Well, that's that. The Wonder update broke a bunch of stuff that caused wipes for every server. Naturally Nutshot Games didn't get the updated dev kit or map editor to the private servers and modders for literally weeks. But hey, we stuck it out and trooped on after and the Wonder stuff was actually kinda cool. 

Then the Industrial trash hit. I was excited for it when it was first announced. With tall ships still in service, most of us were certain that meant Industrial Revolution with its beautiful, bespoke machinery. Then  the update was released and they gave us, I shit you not, modern oil rigs and meth shacks roofed with corrugated metal and torn blue tarps. All rusted and modern, and looking like it was stolen from Rust. And, of course, no devkit updates. These guys sure know how snatch defeat right out of the jaws of victory.

5/15/2020

Friends conned me into coming back to try this game again. I was not interested, but they assured me that it was much more fun. I now have over 900 hours in this game, and I am utterly addicted. I highly recommend it. I am leaving my original review From a few weeks after the game was released to show how much it has improved.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Where to even begin? This game is extremely difficult and poorly statted. It's not challenging and it's not fun. This is the kind of game that attracts mouth-breathing neckbeards who roll twenty deep taking over entire servers, destroying people's stuff for fun and saying ""get gud nub.' 

You start out in noob town, but you can't progress very far there. In order to gain more levels you need to discover new places. You will need to do this in a rudderless raft with no oars. I spent hours sitting on mine with the wind blowing the wrong way. Not even a little bit fun. Oars would make this 1000% less boring because you would at least be getting somewhere. Instead you get to sit there watching the raft deteriorate as your food and water supplies dwindle. Don't try to swim for it because you'll be killed by sharks or jellyfish. If you try to go back for your stuff you'll find them camping your corpse, and in greater numbers each time you make the attempt.

If you do finally make it to an island you will find it has creatures that can one-shot you. Crocodiles are particularly nasty; not only do they stay on you for a much greater distance than seems reasonable, not only will they camp your corpse, but they will also destroy your base after they kill you. Seriously.

Your first set of tools will require wood, but there is no wood lying on the ground so you'll have to punch trees until you get enough for a pick. Food is plentiful, but you have to be careful because not enough vitamins will kill you, too many vitamins will kill you. Water is scarce and difficult to find. Cold will kill you fast, and the clothing you can make at first will not help at all.

Everything takes forever in this game except when something is killing you, that's pretty quick, and you might as well get used to starting over from zero because you will be doing more of that in Atlas than in any other survival game you have ever played. You will find some neat stuff, but you probably won't keep it long enough to use it.

I get that the game is still new and in beta, but this game makes me long for the days when any game that you had to pay for was as near to completely finished as possible.

Shortish Answer:
- What is this: Ark clone with no dinos and ships with normalish animals you probably wont use excerpt the bear. There are some cool creatures you can get but I do not want to spoil it if you make the mistake and buy this.
- Single player: Doesn't work right since 2018 do not do it.
- PVE: its alright. Better with friends but at that point rent a sever. 
- PVP: Top 3 most toxic digital worlds I have been in. That is saying something. 
- Grind: Yea it sucks
- Combat: its ark
- Building ships: building the larger ships solo will take forever. In group slightly less then forever. They break very easily as well. They are made of used tissue.
- Travel from island to island: its fun sailing for 2 minutes and when the wind goes away you would rather watch paint dry. 
- Mrs. Puff I think i'm cheating?: Cheaters are very present on official servers and they somehow get you banned if u do not cheat. Typing that out confused me and I am writing this. (if u don't understand the quote from the beginning of this you are to young to play this and go play runescape.
- Developers: Useless. There not human.

But I want to know more?... WHY?! Play something else!.... GO AWAY!... Fine beginning the diagnostic:

Steve Story time: 
- By the power of the digital spirit I present to you a game that I returned years ago on release when it was $3.70 (around that). Absorb that let that linger in your mind. I spawned in the middle of the ocean and actually saw the barriers of 3d walls in the water. Tried several times before the 2 hour mark, returned and moved on. I should of moved on and never tried it again. 
- Year later bought it again for $3.70, should of just bought the slice pizza. Tried single player to learn the ropes. I can confirm today 4 years later, single player still does not work correctly. you can take over islands by killing the terrible npc pirates. You can not kill them if they are on a cannon with ranged weapons .... (insert minion voice from despicable me) WHAAAAAAAAAAAT? Pirate ark clone wont let you shoot your pistol (that takes 14 seconds to reload) on an npc. You have to mele. Ok if I have to wack them with my sword whats the problem?... the devs built towers where you can not walk up making it impossible for you to slice and dice the npcs. -_- 

- Ship building: owning your own ship is really cool but will take you a full weekend to farm materials to make the bigger ships. I cheated in single player and still took a while to make the ship the way I wanted it to look. You build every single part of the ship. In single player your ship may or may not be able be able to kill the other npc ships. If you make a mistake and buy this do not play single player. you can get npc pirates to arm your cannons and clean your ship. They are no good in a fight. The mechanics of shooting the ships cannons actually wasn't that bad to get used to and you can build and put a lot of stuff on the ship. Making your ship your base would be a mistake. They are fragile and very easily destroyed once you know how to. You have limit of items you can put on the ship. That part is probably for the best to avoid a galleons looking like Godzilla, shooting cannons out of his mouth. 

- Traveling island to island and the islands themselves: Sailing is horrible after a few minutes. The map is huge with a lot of water in it. The clan leaders can tax you and you will have to give them a percentage of your goods to them if you settle on there island. Like wtf is this. If the flow of good old H20 is not flowing into your sails you will go slower then a heard of turtles stampeding through peanut butter.

- PVE: Most ppl are cool. Most ppl left. (Will get to that). There are RP players that think they are captain jack sparrow. Also a group of players that believe that they are dead men and women walking, spawning naked in a bed with a crowd of ppl doing some Salem witch chant. Saw that live on twitch more then once.

- PVP: if you are solo play a different game. Do not do it. If you do not have the patience of Jesus Christ do not do this. If you are easily pissed off and cant go without screaming in a Mario cart or get annoyed by the morons in call of duty making fun of your mom stay away. I have played in two different seasons. I will not name names or groups I was apart of.. but everyone was nuts and took this way to seriously. If you remember the knuckles ppl that took over that vr game? The Uganda ppl? I quote ""Do you know the way?"" The way is stay away from this but they all came here and in numbers. They ransacked your base like berserking raging lunatics and left nothing alive. From now what I have read they are replaced with hacking cheaters that somehow get you banned from official servers for looking at them. Great stuff solid 1/10.

- Devs: Talk about mammals that live on another planet. With one update they lost an entire community of ppl. (I am shortening this and making so you understand) The devs implemented a feature where you place down a flag object to claim your own land. Doesn't sound so bad? WRONG! They just threw that crap in and other players went to all the islands and claimed everyones gear and bases why normal ppl were working. I was present for this. My body spawned in the middle of the water again, (I actually do not understand why that happened) and some kid took over islands of ppl stuff. Players were outraged. The mass player base left and moved on and the creatures of the night remained. The last of the unsung heroes that remained with thousands of hours into this game are getting banned by devs not following up with any reports they are getting. Those exact players are asking steam to take this game off of steam. 

- Can you look passed the bad and explain any of the good?: no

- Conclusion: Here is the crazy thing about all of all this... I can not fit everything wrong with this game in this review. I will at some point hit the cap of characters.. I have recorded stuff on this and I find it difficult to make a review on this. Thats how crazy this digital clone of ark is. Stay the hell away from this. I wouldn't even consider this a game. This is a mental digital torture device with building ships and eating 4 types of different food to keep your character alive or he poops out and dies. Thats actually a thing! If you are thinking about returning to this to try and fight the jerks on the pvp server do not do it. Do not return. New players do not give them money. This will take years to fix and its been in early access since 2018. It will stay in early access till 2042. 

- Now if you actually got up to this point go buy yourself something nice, thats not this digital garbage and have a great day.",1659764376,1659764376,False,2,1,0.496083557605743408,0,True,False,True

1.  This is not a bad game.  It can even be considered a bit of a hidden gem considering some of the most fun I've ever had in gaming has been on here.  The feeling of jumping on a boat with your friends and heading out into the unknown is unparalleled.  The PvP and PvE ship combat, when done fairly, is exceptional and involves true teamwork among your crew.  You can build some incredible towns and design and build your own ships from the planks up.  It's a fantastic platform that is only improved by modding.

2.  It is a flawed game, and the flaws are most apparent on Official servers.  Avoid them (especially the PvP one where most of the dramatic reviews originate from) at all costs.  Every bad thing people say about ARK official servers is true here and more.  Unofficial servers with good administration and good communities do exist, and I encourage you to seek them out.

3.  The developers are bad and are actively making the game worse.  This is the kind of game where you dread patch day - Grapeshot essentially patches in numerous new bugs and problems every month, along with very little content worth noting.  Most new ""features"" they have rolled out in the past year or two have barely functioned, been poorly balanced, and contribute little to nothing positive to the game.  The game would be much better if the devs pushed it out of EA today, ended support, and turned it over to the modders (who are fantastic).

In a nutshell, find an unofficial, modded cluster to join with some friends and you will have a good time.  DarksideRP, when it is running, is an absolutely incredible experience and by far the most popular - but there are others out there to experience as well.",1659720425,1659720425,True,3,0,0.48151513934135437,0,True,False,True

I saw guys with 1k hours going, ""it's been falsely advertised for 5+ years!"" It was ""uh; it said word pirate in the description. You rob other players only if you PVP and do shit on boats. You chase pirate skeletons and dig up treasure, fight a Kraken and what not, none of that should be called piracy!"" Uh, the PVP bit should be ""well yeah, but they advertised it as..."" where ""uh well uh I can't sit anywhere they did but did you know this is like Ark on the water!"" Yeah, it's been sold as such since day one. ""Oh well, I had my head in the sand. I saw the word pirate and ignored everything else!"" For 1000 + hours, ""uh yeah...""

This game is, in fact, Ark on water. To be a ""pirate"" in this, you must do PVP sigh; it's just like the other MP games that use Pirate. If you are doing PVE, you are not a pirate; they never said it had PVE piracy sigh. And for those new to any survival game, PUBLIC SERVERS ARE CANCER! Find a private I've been on private since like 6 hours into this game; not even sure why I tried 6 hours on public, lol. Find a good one, like Supreme gaming is chill as hell with a vast map, using cluster servers and mods. PVP is dog shit on it, but hey, no issues with people cheating left and right going, ""well, so and so can cheat, why can't we! I mean, that is what half the new complaints are right now people with thousands of hours who cheated because they cheated and got banned.

Each dedicated unofficial server requires a customer map to be built, which has a customizable size (by running multiple ""servers"" on the same computer and managed by the island editor all in one place), which can also be linked with other people's maps so that they can all be shared. Having a skill tree and different teammates choosing different areas to focus on is something I've wanted in ARK since the beginning. While there are more materials, it is easier to keep track of (by common material type, like pelt and fur are alternative 'hide' materials). Don't want to focus on tames? Then don't choose Beastmastery like my son and be a builder/toolsmith/captian like me or a medic/cook/armorer like my wife. Let others learn how to tame by bowa and feeding them proper food, instead of how one has to feed them poison in ARK, keeping them so sedated that they don't know what's being done to them. (poor dinos) The majority of the game.ini\GameUserSettings.ini settings are the same as ARK, so it's not a whole different world. Learning how to put a server together was totally worth the time (and I enjoyed laying out the islands) because the game play is much more enjoyable to us than ARK.

Negatives: Larger Clans use toxic game play to almost systematically eliminate any new player from having an enriching experience.

Big clans play a completely different game that forces any casual players or company into a drastically unfair playing field. They complete the content in a few days to max level their characters, and literally commit the rest of the season to griefing new players who would require months to reach a comparable level, hence why the game is dead. Solution: Company limit set to 15 people. There are many merits to this, mainly people become responsible for completing the game themselves without using numbers as a crutch.

If you want a PVE Experience where all you do is survive mostly on a boat this might be up your alley. On the other hand. There isn't much to do. No interesting Npc's except the opening pirate. You can go try to hunt down strange creature, but the loot is insignificant and it feels like a grind rather than an adventure. The bolo taming takes a very long time and is frustrating to the entire community, and your tamed animals die if you so ,much as look at them wrong.
 Now lets move on to the absolute disaster that is PVP...   
This is NOT an early access game, as it's been out for an age and a day. This really shows up in the servers when fighting, but lets disregard that for a moment shall we? 
PVP....
The Development team truly made an enormous game-breaking error. They entered into the game world an autonomous sentry gun called a ""Puckle.""  As long as one of these is loaded it will one shot just about any high level player out there, plus they are very cheap to build and supply. You will find Every Single Island on the public severs is absolutely riddled with them like an bloody bug infestation.  A single toe onto any shore or landmass other than the starting harbors will have you met riddled with shot, from an away from keyboard player.
Speaking of players and puckles, lets talk about super-clans. There's no need for these massive clans to even worry about real base defense, as you can just set more automatic puckle guns to guard half the map. Did I mention that Puckles have about a 98% accuracy rating, and cannot be killed by traditional weapons? Hmmmmm.... So truth be told rather than ""Pirate and Explore the enchanting isles!,"" you will find just about any excuse NOT to make landfall to avoid immediate re-spawn. 
BTW just a side note... Your ships can randomly fall apart or explode due to day one glitches costing you hundreds of hours, any pets you gather will all be lost at sea with no tracker and the little buggers will won't even make an effort to swim a mere 5 ft to shore. 
Another first hand warning.⚠
If you are in a transition zone, two ships can actually spawn inside each other destroying both unfortunate parties with no hope of repair. (Another awful, painful glitch.) 
I started the game with 5 friends and every last one of them quit in absolute disgust. The pets and sheer lack of meaningful content are something I could've flown over in a pirate sailing game, but letting super-clans cover entire islands with automated sentries that never miss, was just a kill-shot to the core game mechanic, and blows away any chance at a happily growing player-base.
I'll check back with hope again in a month are two and have to change my review but I'm not holding my breath after reading all the comments here on Steam.

*
******Edit: So I now have over 700 hours in Atlas. I would like to think that is plenty of time to find all the redeeming qualities in the game. So here is what I have to say. 
 I am sorry to conclude that any redeeming qualities are tossed out the window immediately. The puckle system (AFK turrets) absolutely ruins the game in its entirety. You will die more by AFK guns than probably anything else in the game. Not players, not wildlife, or a dangerous enemy in an epic fight. Just a turret with an aimbot that one shots players even on spawn. The Puckle gun systems are immune to almost all damage and can be placed virtually anywhere.) It seriously breaks the game. No fun exploration on land exists when giant clans cover entire regions in Afk guns. It even discourages creativity in building a secure base. I have heard the Devs actively play and even run some server clans. If true, I feel they cater to their clan friends rather than helping players flourish and experience the game's content. Take Puckles out, and the game could be an absolute masterpiece. As it is, no amount of new content balances out not being able to wander, explore, or complete the game's questlines.
TLDR: ""Auto Aimbot Turrets break a promising game.""",1612424195,1658780588,False,37,0,0.741773545742034912,0,True,False,True

It is buggy as hell especially in solo play as enemy structures and enemy mobs reproduce at every reload both safe exit and crash to the state where you can have an enemy camp e reproduced ontop of itself 6-8 times. Probably wouldn't be to bad if that meant a heap of loot, but no only the original structure has any loot, the rest is just stuff you usually have to destroy to get to the loot.

**Edit
I'm like 7k+ hours in at this point and I've been banned. Not because of something I did but because the admins decided someone in my company must be cheating (they didn't specify who and didn't provide any information to any leadership) and they banned the entire company. I think there was 71 of us banned? It's pretty ridiculous they expect us to be hunting down cheaters in our company while playing in companys with 75+ members on a map that keeps getting bigger and bigger. At this point if you plan to play the game with a group of players that you can't physically watch you may need to have a dedicated person to be spectating every person in your group + going through the files on the computers of every member frequently checking for third party programs or else you are at risk of being banned because one of them may (they provide no information on why your company was banned so who knows if someone is actually guilty) cheated. 

I no longer recommend this game to anyone. It's boat combat is unmatched in any game but that is all it has going for it. I've spent the past year telling people they'll work out the problems, the bugs that aren't being fixed will be fixed on release, the new boats they are introducing will get balanced, the lag will get fixed, they'll stop increasing the map size despite losing players count, the list just goes on and on but at this point I no longer believe this game will get better. It's best days are behind it and the devs now are just looking to get it set for full release and then move on to another project. 

The one good thing about a ban from official is you can explore all the weird unofficial servers and still do boat pvp.",1559963309,1658279372,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,2,True,False,True

As we all know games still in dev are gonna be buggy, their are gonna be issues but you are the pioneers to get those issues worked out. im thankful for being a test dummy in this case as itll help the game in the long run when release comes. Atlas is an amazing pirate game with loads of content and nice graphics, game play is immersive and challenging, crafting is nice but has its flaws, the ships are great but the modular ships do need attention.

But, with the developers not knowing how to manage the game you will see that every patch something breaks terribly. Not even New World's exploits can match the amount of mediocrity that Grapeshot manages on a day to day basis. 

To make this worse, the lack of communication despite having a dedicated discord to their community is outstanding. Let me give you a preview of just my most recent struggle with this game. 

-New map is announced for next patch. 
-Guilds all prepare for this day by stocking up on land claiming equipment and sailing out to the entrance of this new land map. 
-The patch comes, only to be announced that ""The map isn't out yet, and will be ready after the following day's reset"" (The game does daily resets)
-The reset comes and we are all once again waiting at the entrance..... nothing. 
-For HOURS Grapeshot doesn't say anything about the issue.... will it be out? will it be postponed? Just leaving us there to wonder... but we dont want to leave because knowing them they will do a hotfix on the spot and not alert anyone. 
-The portal arrives, but OH NO! the server it leads to isnt functional! So many are left unable to play for hours, just waiting for the new map server to come back up. meanwhile, what they did do was ruin the stability of many other servers... so alot of the game was just unplayable. 
-Fast forward out of no where ""Its fixed! have fun!"" in the middle of the night. Those of us who are taking the South America Portal had to wait an extra 30 minutes to get into the new map unlike the ones who took the Africa Portal. So imagine... A new map that can be claimed with Mines and Mills, and out of chance one group of people is able to get a 30 minute head start. (Yes most of the good spots were taken by the time we were able to get in.)
(I dont want to assume anything, but the Africa portal is really close to the ""Big Companies"" side of the map... so i assume some favoritism had a role to play.)
-All in all, we got a nice spot and the only reason I haven't stopped playing myself is because I promised my crew we would finish the endgame content before I did. 

Under these reviews there's a box that says ""Check this box if you received this product for free?"" Well I may as well have because that's the quality this game gives you. 

Another instance that id like to share since its kind of up there. 
-You get a high quality shipyard as a small company and this is a big win for you! they are pretty rare and sought out by anyone with plans to have a great ship 
-Grapeshot breaks the shipyards by accidentally removing their blueprints. 
-They fixed it!! except you need to replace your already hard earned maxed out shipyard in order for the fix to take place. meaning if you dont have another Maxed out one.... then tough luck. 

They dont care about their community and are clearly understaffed. Save yourself the money and go play Sea of Thieves.

-the game is optimized

-huge maps so you don't gotta switch every hour and will actually take u an hour to travel to one island loll

-also the functions for the players are awesome especially for those into RP this game is perfect for that its truly a RP Pirate Time Ark

-the animations are quite better but combat is confusing a bit and gets easy once used a lot

-the boats are incredible and that's one thing ark left out a lot is the ocean and water transportation

-like i said before the game offers a lot of fun and new content which makes this game like a conversion update for ark which that's what it was a really famous conversion mod for ark that wildcard decided to turn into a game

-i recommend playing with people as the game has a lot of RP and player functions like hanging someone, various cages and other torture devices

so in all i think this game deserves a 9/10 because its a lot less buggy than ark and brings me nostalgia from when i use to think ark was not buggy and actually good.

massive issue with bugs that get left ignored by development team.

Devs that get mad at what people are complaining about? Is this game for you? Or is it for US. It's a thing your making for others to play. 

People who aren't sporting massively new computers with high end products can barely even play the game. It's not optimized AT ALL. Most pc's people have that I know can't even barely play the game while they can play just about EVERYTHING else out there with no problems. Why is that?. 

After five years of being in 'early release' when their site says 'no more then 2 years'. That's the time i would suspect a game would be in early. Not almost five years. Get a better team? Get folks that care? Listen to your player base (as you also promised you would do) Because when this game comes out of 'early access' whenever you do and you make it 'more expensive' as you said you would. nobody will buy it. Nobody wants to buy it at this price to play a industrial age out of character pirate game with no pirates, ugly as crap boats, and islands with no content? 

It's just cheaters and Admins abusing their powers. I know too many people who played on officials that got whales dropped on them with god powers and a lot of other crap. 

The whole team needs a wake up call and recheck what they were doing this for.  Your providing a service and it's terribly done. If it wasn't for folks who WORK HARD and make modded servers that people actually CAN play the game on (when the grapeshot devs aren't breaking it) there wouldn't be 'anyone' here. It would be a dead game.  All of you out of jobs. Don't think your high up on the totem poll. Blizzard thought they were untouchable, but they found out they weren't. Look at where their game is? Dying slowly.

The only reason why so many people buy this game at all is for private modded servers. And if you think that hurts. Maybe you should listen to your community more. We hate the game we were supposed to love. It aint out fault. 

Play your damn game how everyone else HAS plays it and see just how messed up it is. How ugly the prefab boats are. HOW HARD it is to make 250,000 gold just to make a dumb ship yard to craft a boat you were originally ALREADY able to use back before it was broken and switched around. NOBODY wanted that. 

Sometimes you think you know what people want.. and you really don't. Ask us. We will help you. But ignore our cries and you will be the one crying in the end. I know you don't care.

No way to suicide, or respawn.  Spend an hour travelling to a far away island to search for a treasure map, and arrive at the location, but the map is glitched.

Understandably it has its issues but the constant server wipes just to redo all the same achievements over and over is probably the lamest.  The dev team uses these wipes to continuously ""stall"" players, meaning while players are redoing for the hundredth time the same achievements they're focus on that instead of pushing game issues to the devs.  Some points that could potentially help with the game:
1:  Island claiming:  Allow ONE island claim per company and a company must have at least 10 players before they can claim an island
      1a: Circle claim method of old i think was much better than current ""entire"" island claim.  it allowed more players to own land.
      1b:  Reset taxation back to original:  Taxes were used to entice settlers, now its just used as free resources...ie: dumb
2:  Tower claims:  Either increase drastically points required to drop a tower or only allow 1 land claim/1 water claim per player to avoid the current tower spam across an island.  If in a company the ""company"" gets one extra claim tower per 5 members.
3:  Advanced shipyard ships:  Currently there's a HUGE spam in making these cheap ships then they are left all over the map blocking shorelines, building, etc.  Put a 7 day decay timer on all advanced ships to remove ""abandoned"" ships unless the owner interacts with them.
4:  Warehouses and farms:  Personally I think they negate the fun interaction with elephants, rhinos, etc for harvesting.  But if used, their ""claim radius"" needs to be drastically reduced to allow for other players to be able to put them down.  Warehouses should be island wide, not just within the circle and farms need to be placed only within a claim tower circle and its radius doesnt expand beyond the claim tower's.  Also either reduce a claim towers radius or create a ""Harvest Tower"" that a farm must be placed in with a greatly reduced radius.
4.   Remove portals, go back to original map design just allow 2-way travel in tradewinds and perhaps increase the number of tradewinds.
5.  Companies and alliances:  Set a maximum of 25 players and allow a maximum of 2 alliances (pvp servers only to reduce the meta zergs thats currently creating issues)
6.  In game griefing:  This one is simple, either have in game GMs to address issues on the spot or authorize certain players the ability to gather facts on a ""griefing,"" make a determination of it griefing occurred, then forward that determination to the devs for action if needed.
7.  Achievement and xp earned:  reinstate xp for Kraken and other events.  Just allow for a big xp boost on the first completion then moderate amount on any after.  Currently many players do Kraken 1 or 2 only once as there's nothing work repeating it for.  For kraken some players hover near the eye waiting for it to die so they can loot it, even if that player did NOTHING to help with killing it.  Perhaps allow each attending company to get a reward from the corpse not just the first one to loot?

I've been excited for this game since the announcement, avid long-time player of ARK on both PS4, and Steam. I expected and hoped for great things of ATLAS. Unfortunately, the company was far to quick to launch. They have a number of issues to figure out to make the game playable even on high-end PC's as the server's themselves cannot handle the load.

It's one thing to get a few videos and pictures using 20-30 people. It's another thing to run a hive of servers linking ""40,000"" players together. At this time, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, sadly.",1545555598,1654474031,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,True

This is a Total Joke Now .. Was a good Game, Not great .. But Fun.
But slowly they have been trying to turn into ARK and So Much is broken .. IN Good faith there is NO Way i could recommend this game anymore.
Just the Simple truth .. Maps have been totally wiped that players were using .. you log into game thinking all good _ Get a Black screen start a new game which you can not and if you get into game it drop's you in the middle of ocean.

Building and sailing ships is very well implemented and ship vs ship combat is exciting, nerve wracking, and nail biting just as it should be.  From someone who has spent a lot of time on the water in real life - the ocean, wave, and weather effects are very well done.

To start with, this is NOT a pirate game, if that's what you want go look somewhere else.  It was barely a pirate game back when this game was good.  Pirates LOOT and accumulate wealth.  It never made it that far, it was a sailing game where you could grief other players for no gain of any kind other than the joy of screwing people over.  Add LOTS of bugs were added that have not been fixed in 5 years to the point the game can be unplayable for some people. The game was fun however, and the game probably had the highest potential I had ever seen in a game back in like 2018.  I was telling everyone at work, showing them videos and pictures of what the game could do.  

Then the dev team ""went a new direction"" with it.

A game that was promised to be about pirates, pirating, shipbuilding and sailing, is now redesigned to be ARK on water but it doesn't work from a design standpoint.  They claimed the new changes were coming so people would ""spend more time on the ocean,"" which was supposed to encourage(force) more PVP on those who didn't want it, despite the fact those people wouldn't engage in PVP anyway, so people either left the game or stayed on land anyway.

They then removed the shipbuilding and forced you to use a prefab purchased model with the intent of ""directing""(gating) players to getting the bigger ships you used to be able to build solo with a NPC crew, just so you could compete with other large guilds on the water with enough time and effort.

Contradicting themselves about putting more players on water, they continued to add more gates on land through new prefab buildings which are now forced on players as well, which only led to LESS time on the water.

Finally, the most recent update REMOVED the concept of the 1500's age of sail and replaced it with 1700-1800's industrial buildings to try and save their sinking game from lack of players due to them alienating 85% of the player base which was either Singleplayer(which they broke), PVE(which they hate), or unofficial servers(which they constantly screw over.)

As the game is no longer what was advertised for the last 5+ years, I would consider a lawsuit for false advertising simply because no one has access to what we paid for.  A pirate~ish game in the age of sail.",1653586687,1653748945,False,114,7,0.85257256031036377,6,True,False,True

I can say its fucking disappointing, but it can still be fun.

Its a reskin of ARK, so expect all the bugs and frustrations, if you've had a chance to experience those.
Mem dumps and bad optimizations for all to enjoy.
As a mod, it needs ALOT of work. 
I personally think its really insultingly bad how much needs fixing, its been fucking years.

BUTT! ( | )
Ive got 300+ hours into it, sure its worth my wampum.
If you have played ARK, you have played this, just without the boats.
Its pretty nice to look at.
Its the best sailing pirate game out there right now IMO.
Building a ship to your liking is my favorite part. (Ive built massive galleons with indoor planters, gilded windows and filigree galore. It was beautiful and laggy.)
Exploration can be pretty fun.
I play solo, servers are generally bunk and laggy.

Overall i would give 'ARK: The Drunken Sailor' a 5/10 TBH, on the grounds it needs a ♥♥♥♥ ton of optimizations and they still have old ARK code in the files. Cant say im keen on supporting GrapeShit or their development practices.

However different from both games is that there are no dinosaurs to compete with and you actually can play single player (With AI to replace crew members). I really like the game despite the mix of negative and positive reviews. I'm not a critic of games all that much or make reviews but this deserves my attention. Id say the only thing this game really needs is a OPTIMIZATION of graphics as my GPU is a really recent model and pretty good as well(AMD 6600XT) and has a hard time getting to 60 fps in some load outs which shouldn't happen since in the menu it lists you need a minimum GTX 960 or higher to run at levels.

The dev team is honestly so completely disconnected from the player base and what's actually fun in gameplay that the direction of their ""early access"" program is damn near doomed to failure.

So... just for the sake of understanding here, you cannot, and i repeat, you cannot actually get a boat to make the gold to... make a boat. Like.. They removed the tiny shipyard, there's no way to make a raft without paying 500 gold. (Edit: If you start anywhere but a freeport. I started in lawless or what-have-you and it was actually not possible to progress in the game at this time. This has since been fixed, and tiny shipyards are in the game)

I am heavily into RP, and with some good mods and a good community, this is one of the most fun games.  It's by no means perfect, but can be tons of fun. 

Cons
The game can have quite a few bugs still, from mechanical issues, clipping issues, and more which can lead the experience occasionally with a sour taste in your mouth.
Combat is mediocre but passable. Better than Ark, anyway
The SOTD could use different spawn points. The amount of times we've had members change grids only to load right on top of a sotd and get sunk before they're even fully loaded in is kinda rediculus.
I hate animal taming in this game. I let other people tame animals for me. 
I wish islands had a bit more to them sometimes

Pros
The ship mechanics are really nice. I love the utilization of wind as a means of getting around
Building with mods can be a lot of fun
I love that there's a whisper/talk/shout voip option for communication. Makes RP very nice.
The visuals in this game can sometimes be very aesthetically pleasing.

This game is inexpensive And it's evolving. Recommended for those who like to take adventures to the vast seas. But this game takes time. If you play with friends, you're sure it's fun to never want to quit. For this game, take the points from me.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Keyword: had. 

ATLAS has gone through change after change after change, with the most recent bringing the adventure side of the game to an absolute stand-still. I don't know what happened recently but the design team switched gears without using the clutch.

ATLAS has stalled. It's not just dying, it's dead in the water. Flatlined. Finished. Deceased.

It hurts deeply to see such a great thing I once cherished die like a neglected animal, even more so to watch it die by direct abuse from its caretaker, but that is life, and that's what has happened here.

Farewell, ATLAS. It's almost over. May you rest in peace.

And whats more, I will be adding even more problems that I didn't experience before. Literally everything in this game is a fine example of good ideas executed with infuriating incompetence.

Taming: The animals are brain dead. For example wolves, tigers and lions. They have no thought process. Even if you were the one who attacked it for 5 minutes straight, if another animal comes along, your target tame may attack you or the wandering animal. Aggro is not a thing. This will sometimes result in your possible tame getting itself killed because it decided to attack a bear which will kill it with ease. Even though you were clearly the biggest threat to its life. And because Grapeshot is clearly no expert on wildlife, you will have this problem a lot. Because they think its realistic and normal to litter islands with all sorts of animals. In real life, you will RARELY see a wolf by itself and you will NEVER see a wolf attack a bear alone. You will also NEVER see a bunch of bears all along a coast.  There is no particular order or organization on where they spawn each animal. No particular spot to have that specific animal to exist. And that feels sloppy and mediocre.

Animations and Movements: Compare the character movements and combat fluidity to a game like Conan Exiles. Major difference. The running looks stiff, the jumping is stiff and exaggerated. The camera moves to the sides when you turn while running like you're playing a car racing game. Every time I experience The character movements I think to myself: This is so below-average. Grapeshot clearly has no idea how to produce smooth, fluid and REALISTIC movements. And its even more noticeable with the melee combat. Who punches that slowly? Who swings a sword like that? Utter garbage. The guns are fine. But I don't understand why the game forces you into first-person when you bring out your guns while riding a tame. It doesn't make sense to me. 

Ships: They recently added new ships but the ships still look cartoony and weird. I still see players outfitting sloops with a single big 2 masted speed sail. schooners with a big 3 masted speed sail. And large ships with nothing but turning sails. It looks bad and unrealistic. Wheres the rigging lines that connect the sails to each other? Wheres the jib and sprit masts that hang above and in front of the bow? Wheres the driver thats suppose to hand below the mizzen mast sail? Why even add realistic sailing mechanics? Why even make sailing a ship the key feature of the game if your ships are gonna be this underwhelming aesthetically? Smh, So poorly designed. 

BEWARE Sailing near islands: Omg once again ANOTHER fine example of incompetence. You actually have players building bobs on the ocean that indicate where boulders stick up in the ocean near the island. When you see it, its a clear eyesore. Yes, shallows exist in real life. But not 5 miles from the island you are trying to sail to. You will have all your masts down, going full speed while making your way to the island and then BAM, your ship starts taking massive dps faster than you can say oh-sh*t(Not an exaggeration). Simply because you weren't prepared to dodge the oddly placed boulder because its hidden JUST below the waterline and clearly doesn't fit aesthetically into the islands overall design. How many ships have I lost from these oddly placed boulders in the ocean? I don't even know anymore. Massive thanks to the players who were courteous enough to put bobs on the ocean to indicate the boulder locations.

The islands: Okay, there is a reason I placed this one last. Simply put, this was the one that literally made me stop, drop my jaw and just stare at what I was seeing on my screen. Everything else I mentioned was horrible, don't get me wrong. But this is simply a sick joke that is complete testament to what I'm saying about Grapeshot's competence at game development. 

I was strolling on an island near the mountains, and what do I see? I see mountain texture that isn't fully enclosed with the rest of the mountain texture. Picture in your mind a moment in game when your character accidentally falls through the wall or ground. And all you see below you is an open void as you fall to your death. I'm sure that glitch has happened to you at least once in a game you have played. This scenario is similar in what I saw. The mountain texture wasn't whole. You could literally see an open void behind the mountain AND walk into it and get stuck permanently. Then wait until you die and immediately purge all ideas of retrieving your gear. Smdh Jesus Christ and all that is holy...

I can tell Grapeshot doesn't study and learn from other games and companies. They are trapped in their own little bubble and have no intention on learning from their own mistakes or seeking to improve their skill and knowledge at game design. I know this is true. Because that is the case when you experience playing a game that literally seems to get WORSE as the years go on. 

2022 Edit: This will be my last update review for this game. These devs are literally adding new features that counter already existing features in the game. How in the world can you update your game and take steps backwards as a result of your newly released patches? Just play Atlas and you'll see. But no, don't play it. Its a massive waste of time and money.

--In a Nutshell--

--pros--
-Good graphics
-Sailing combat is fun but gets boring quickly

--Cons--
-Horrible character movements and animations
-Ships look like a cartoony insult to realistic ships
-Taming can be a nightmare if you don't kill everything near you
-Islands are unfinished(literally)
-All of the games content and features seem unfinished and unrefined

If I had to describe Atlas in just a handful of sentences I would say like this: 

Atlas is game which has plenty of content, but literally all of its content and features will feel half-baked and unrefined. Every single piece of content and every single feature you will experience will make you feel like this game was only developed for 6 months or less, even though it was - quote unquote - ""released"" in 2018, whilst still receiving updates into 2022. None of it is fine tuned, all of it just barely ""works"" the way it was visioned to work. This is mostly because Grapeshot, operate like children whom constantly changes their interests with each passing update, unable to stick with their initial vision of the game. They even changed their studio name because these devs are incapable of sticking with major decisions which impact the overall product. 

I will never recommend this game nor any product brought into this world by Grapeshot, or Studio Wildcard or Instinct Games or whatever they fancy calling themselves. Buyer beware.",1549975784,1650884929,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's made by the same group of people that made Ark, so I didn't even have my hopes up for this one with how buggy/broken Ark can be, yet they still managed to disappoint me in a huge way. There's not enough islands for a larger cluster population (singleplayer is more of a grind than a game like Runescape or pretty much any other MMORPG), there's TONS of bugs/issues, there's tons of game crashing problems, and much, much, much more than I really care to get into, I'd probably hit the character limit in this review if I did. 

Since this game was developed with EU4, you are required to have a separate server set up for EVERY grid you want to run instead of a single server for a 5x5 or 7x7 grid like you could do with UE5. That's anywhere from 25-49 servers you have to keep a constant eye on due to how much the grids crash. 

The food system is beyond annoying to manage, you will likely die quite frequently due to lack of 'vitamin balancing'. 

Any time this game gets any sort of game update, the devs break something else in the game in a major way, whether it be ships suddenly being beached, islands moving entirely to another grid or being removed from the game, mods being completely incompatible, or more game crashes that randomly happen. 

Oh, and let's not even get into the fact that you have to regularly literally clear your IRL schedule to progress in this game within a reasonable amount of time. It takes HOURS to sail just a couple of grids from your home island, and can take about 6 hours to go from say D1 to A7, then another 6 hours to go back to D1. God forbid you run into a Ship of the Damned on accident while sailing..... if that happens you could be stranded in the middle of nowhere for DAYS or WEEKS before you get the stuff needed to get back home. That gets very old very quickly for almost any player. 

This game has been in Early Access for almost 3 1/2 years now, and there are absolutely zero signs that it will ever leave Early Access. We'll see if they change enough to make me want to play this again, but I don't have my hopes up that they'll convince me to reinstall this game ever again. 

I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone that ever asks me about it. Atlas gets a 0/10 from me.",1650825290,1650825847,False,4,0,0.508749604225158691,0,True,False,True

Sadly turned out to be a disappointment. I ran a PC community virtually since day one of ATLAS, it's now pretty much dead as is the game itself it seems. More of the recent updates haven't made much sense, such as changing the item qualities. Lack of content. Worst of all you can't crossplay with Xbox players without paying the earth to... Nitrado. I own server hardware and find that greatly disappointing.

[b]Update 24/12/2018:[/b]
Developers are working night and day on getting stability and such improved and bug fixes underway. The launch didn't go well but things are improving a fair bit now, communication from Jat is excellent! They've also released the dedicated server files so people can dive in and setup their own unofficial servers, albeit not via Steam yet but at least it's something. Changing my review to positive as I see potential.

---

[b]First few days of launch:[/b]
Unplayable, can't even play single player (no option, well, hidden menu based on ARK but unusable).

Streamers however get priority, at least the real popular ones, by getting a private server in the meantime.

See https://twitter.com/MekkiTheGuy/status/1076652136577019904 (Jat retweeted this)

In the meantime there's no public info on how to setup your own unofficial server, you can't even order one from Nitrado as it's still preorder. I strongly suggest avoiding this game, especially as refunding will be difficult for some if you've played more than two hours by trying to join the non-functional official servers.",1545531151,1649797864,False,0,0,0.472041815519332886,0,True,False,True

Yeah so I spoke to soon, another update removed my ability to play. I'm just going to leave this as not recommended until a year goes by without being blocked from play.

A sub update allowed me to play again after a week. Hopefully players can play uniterupted from here on out.

Recommended you find some competient allies on the PvP servers.

The issue is I have logged about 3 weeks on this game and I cannot go one day without having to build a new ship. The land is all claimed, and everybody who sails past you is going to sink you. I cannot bring the spoils from my adventures anywhere, as all the land is claimed or somebody will literally take the hours it takes to destroy a storage unit just to destroy yours while your offline, as well as your ship will be sunk too. Even if you have nothing on it. There's nowhere to store it, and there's nowhere to store any of your treasures. You just kind of park somewhere and hope that while you were offline, nobody happened to go past your ship.

Edit: I'm glad my review was beneficial. Some have voiced concerns regarding my reasoning behind not playing by myself. the reason is 1 atlas server, keep in mind, every grid coordinate is it;s own server, costs an extra $15. So if you want to play on one island your whole life, you can for $15. If you're somebody who tends to get ""Cooped up"" and wants some more places, maybe some more resources, that would mean a private 2x2 grid would cost you $60,and a big 10x10 grid would cost you $1500.

Update: Tried again PvP solo, build a house, ship, this took 6-8 hours. Next day, house taken ship taken. Game lead developers should do something else. I delete this game forever, I have more fun working in the company, at least my work is not deleted after I sleep. No place for solo player in this game. PvE is boring and PvP is not possible for solo player.

Do not buy and play this game. Nothing happend since month regarding to less punishment, it is a game for non sleeping brutal kids. Now player can put you in a cage, there you cannot kill yourself, just watch it 1-2 hours until you starving. Why is the punishment too hard: Taming an elephant on another isle takes 3-4 hours, then you did it! You have an elephant and you can harvest lot of woods. Then you go to work, next day you are in the cage, elephant was killed, all tamed animals were killed, resources stolen, if not, then all the container destroyed to lose your resources, all in game work gone.

I would say that these developers are by far more ret**ded then the Elite Dangerous ones. Also the quality of the game reflects this, still sporadic crashes, bugs, stucking. They don't even care about this.

this game is a sports car held together with duct tape. promises a lot, looks shiny, uses ALL the resources, falls apart constantly. random glitches. falling out of the world. constant disconnects and app crashes and server-side crashes. i've logged over 20 hours in this game and 15 of them have easily been spent looking at the logo on the title screen, from all the times the server's been too full to join or i'm waiting for something to load or reinstall or whatever and it's so frustrating. and when you actually get into the game, the mechanics are so unforgiving that it's really not fun at all to roleplay or even just play casually. you die so often for nonsense reasons (like blue vitamin deficiency) and sometimes you respawn many servers away from where you were with all your progress gone. it's such a frustrating experience and the motivation to keep playing in my friend group stems from the dream of finally building a little pirate town and sustaining ourselves, but it's been a mountain of stress and basically nobody's having fun. i don't know. have you heard of The Legend Of Pirates Online? it's a fan revival of this old Pirates of the Caribbean MMO and it's way more fun than this sludge. and it'll run on basically anything. you need a beefy computer to run atlas. my recommendation: play a different pirate game",1648779551,1648779551,False,6,0,0.575634419918060303,0,True,False,True

- Everything you do has an utterly pointless quicktime event.

- Every island you land on is owned by a super-alliance, which means you'll spend about 99% of your time living on your boat.

- Every effort you make to try and eat food will be met with the realization that you will die because of vitamin system.

- You will spend far more time recovering from game crashes than from anything else in the game itself.

- Bugs and exploits never get fixed. And the only 'updates' the devteam provides is some jank novel garbage with the occasional ""We released a new modular ship"" thrown in.

- Because the game is designed to force you into playing with others, Single Player ends up being an impossible mess.

So, is this game worth it? Absolutely not. These people like to tout themselves as being ""The people who made the great and fantastic Ark!"" But don't let that fool you. Ark is a buggy mess plagued by greedy amateur devs ever since they released their first DLC while still in early access. This game is literally just them re-branding Ark and then selling it back to you.

In all honesty, there's so much in common with Ark and Atlas that they could have just made this a DLC to Ark rather than its own game. You're literally just buying the exact same game, but just far more unoptimized. In fact I'm almost entirely convinced that, beyond the here-and-there content release of ONE new thing, this game is just as abandoned by the devs as it is by the players.

You would think that with as much posturing as they do, they would have the funding to put their money where their mouths are.

""We made Ark! Ark is our flagship game! If you love Ark, you'll love this!""

So then why does it feel like such an under-budgeted mess? Hmm? Hmmmmm? Lets be real here. This game is just one more cash grab designed by devs who are selling you nothing except the idea that 'The people who made Ark made it.'

That's their only selling point. Not the game itself, but another game. ""Buy this game! Not because it's a pirate game! But because of Ark!"" That's literally it.

I wish I could suggest this game even if it was on sale, but I can't.

I've been in large companies, small groups and played solo. Value for the money? Definitely.  There was a lot of expectation around the announcement and release of the ore-release game, which definitively means there would be additional content, bugs, testing and fixes. There have been game breaking bugs, down times and frustration within the community, but its all worth it.  

There is ample to do in the Atlas world. First you have a skill tree and role play experience grinding, ship building and animal taming for travel. Ship building is amazing just for customization. Each of you own ships can be different and you can build a fleet (PvE for sure). Then you have exploring and discoveries that give additional character bonuses. There is a crafting experience that is elaborate, some items need difficult to get blueprints and resources such as Mythos.  In addition there is new content now coming out regularly some that I haven't even been able to figure out yet! There is PvE combat treasure hunting rewarded with crafting blueprints, experience and gold.

And for the over achievers there is an End game content progression that is amazing. It will most definitely leave you with a feeling of accomplishment and contentment afterwards.  

My suggestion is find a small group of friends, plan to go all the way to the end. Encourage each other through the frustrations of any obsticles to your goals, and you will certainly find value for your money.

Its a buggy spaghetti code mess even now 4 years later.  There has obviously been little to no attempt at all to fix the underlying stability problems, and if the base game ark is anything to judge by there never will be an attempt to stabilize this game by the developers.  Its a great concept, and I've had a lot of fun playing.  But I've also had hours worth of headaches just trying to get it to run, and when it does run, it hogs literally all the resources my system can provide.  I really, really want to recommend this game. But as a consumer I just cant.  it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up with totally new code, and probably a more modern engine.

I loved this game. It was a childhood game dream come true. We were all hopeful for what was to be the decisive ocean-fairing open world survival game and for a time it was. I spent days of my time just sailing from point a to point b loving every second. I enjoyed the harsh circumstances that forced tactical, patient, and intelligent decisions that would literally decide what would happen for the next few hours. You can choose a faster and smaller ship and only take two hours to build, or opt for a larger ship that'll carry more but will be slower and take 8-12 hours to farm the materials.

I played with two friends who like me dedicated night and day to progressing our little band of merry men. We built a raft and sat on it for hours until we finally got to another island, and boy it was a once in a lifetime memory. We built our first single mast sloop. We farmed and farmed and farmed. We made a base, got animal tames, cosmetics, and just loved the everloving hell out the game and what it had to offer. We finally progressed to the point where we built a frigate. This thing took days to farm materials and was the end-all-be-all for naval combat, travel, and quite literally everything. If you weren't at an island, your home was your vessel. We built the frigate and named it something that filled all of us with pride. We went to sleep anticipating another day of amazing gameplay. Then, the Chinese came. 

You see the problem with Atlas was not the game itself, but it was the players. We logged in to discover our frigate, which we spent days farming for, was gone. We also noticed other ships that we became familiar with seeing shared the same fate. The Chinese, because they're Chinese (no literally), decided to sink any non-Chinese ship. We were just one of countless victims. So much so, in fact, that there are probably historical documentaries about the Europe-America war against the Chinese players -- it got that bad. 

Then, in similar fashion, Atlas suffered a content dry up and ultimately started to change things. In less than a few months the game had more or less died from mediocre and ignorant decisions that effectively made the only reasonable way of playing the game to join MASSIVE clans that treated you as literal slaves to do their bidding in the hopes that you may do something other than collect resources (think rust). Players like me tried to flee to private servers to play the game on our terms, until we found out each grid in the game is ran by its own server. So, if you wanted to play with the full map (with all content mind you) you were looking at somewhere between 100-200 dollars a month just to run the servers. 

We saw what was coming far before reality came, but we were ever hopeful. That is until they de facto dropped development of Atlas to focus on Ark. Ark is better for it, but Atlas is now just a wasteland with no place for refugees like me to go. I last played Atlas almost two years ago but I still think about how good of a game it was and how good it could've been had the right decisions been made. After finishing games like Dying Light, Elden Ring, and Dark Souls, it makes me pine for Atlas. 

I think back to how defining of an experience Atlas was for me, and as much as I want to play it, I hold to principle and just wish for better days.

I DO NOT recommend this game. it has moments of ""Ok this is fun"" but quickly gets patches that crash the game or remove all land and leave you swimming in an ocean of sharks, log in deaths and lost spawn points. It ruins the hope you have for the game in a short amount of time.

☐ Enterprise Holodeck
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Drawn by AI
☐ Drawn by monkeys

My notes: Reasonably pretty but older engine and not super optimised, in a few spots it properly crosses the border into *beautiful* but this is rare and mostly a consequence of randomly interacting factors and clever player building, overall you'll need a average or better pc to get the most out of it, and i just don't recommend 4k unless your rocking the latest hardware.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Excellent
☐ Good
☑ Average
☐ Bad
☐ Painful inputs / tormenting mechanics
☐ Demonically inflicted mental and physical anguish for hours on end

My notes: Overall an average crafting survival game, the gathering and crafting are passable at best and the combat system is poor and missing features promised on launch, the ship and pvp systems are passable, but basic, overall somehow this can be fun and engaging, it makes no sense but objectively the whole is better than the sum of it's stitched together parts.

---{ Audio }---
☐ ASMR / Eargasm
☐ Very good is that a .flac i hear?
☐ Good
☑ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ Crunchy .wav's the way grandpa remembers.

My notes: Some audio choices, creature noises and others are odd, overall it fits with it's theme but don't expect greatness.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

My notes: No overly stressful themes for anyone, creatures and players sometimes die, might be distressing for the very young or those emotionally attached to tamed pets, creatures can appear from nowhere and might be startling, that's about it.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Post apocalypse scenarios of less than 1 volt. ( Mobile devices )
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ High end
☐ Only a twitch streamer can afford THIS much RGB!
☐ Ask IBM if they have a spare quantum super computer

My notes: As stated in the graphics section above, you will need a decent + pc to run this game in general, it is not the best optimised, you can lower settings ( specifically sky and distance settings as it does very little but eat resources ) anything lower than an i5-9600 or ryzen 3600 paired with a 2070 nvidia or 5700xt amd and a solid state drive may have some issues with high and epic settings at some times, however the game WILL run on very old hardware, although you will doubtless suffer hard texture popin and slowdowns in crowded areas and slideshow fps above low settings, resulting in performance and desync related bugs ontop of the regular ones, yes the code is that terrible at times.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Single button spam
☐ Easy
☐ Requires effort
☑ Requires much effort
☐ Truly difficult, and or deep learning required.
☐ Grade A* Genius only!

My notes: Not technically extremely difficult, however some questionable controls, allot of fiddly building inputs, inability to solo control a ship properly ( you need a second commander to fully utilise all controls ) and you WILL die ALOT unreasonable heat and cold waves will simply destroy you till you level to max and get huge fortitude, or craft exceptional gear, even indoors or in insulated areas, eg ships, diving suits or standing ontop of a fire, yes you can freeze to death standing in fire, because 400* flames don't counter a stiff breeze in this game, creatures will routinely 1-2 shot you, if you don't ride around on a tamed bear or elephant you're incredibly vulnerable to attack by any creature, a particularly vicious pig can 2 shot you, and glowing alpha creatures literally need artillery or kiting with guns and terrain to kill solo, Army of the damned are resistant to all known weapons and now immune to tamed creatures, making them a complete pain in the butt to kill, even with a full company of backup, overall just excessive stats balance against the player to kill them, not technical difficulty just high effort gameplay.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only collectables / ranks
☐ Some unlocks, or money system
☐ Moderate grind / forced crafting
☐ Heavy grind / o.m.g everything is a resource
☑ Worked to death in the mines!

My notes: Someone ( maybe you, maybe not ) has to grind the LITERAL MILLIONS of wood, thatch, fibre, flint, stone, hide, etc etc and it's 7 variants for rare patterns, this can take literal weeks or months depending on the structure, your luck or ability to find said resources, and general determination and skill, if you want to build a super base and all ships and get every achievement, be ready to hand over your soul, or hire some slaves.

---{ Story }---
☐ Deeper than real life
☐ Deep
☐ interesting
☐ Average
☐ Low effort
☑ Zero effort

Story? you're a pirate harry! that's.. literally it.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Blink and you missed it ( Rogue-Lite )
☐ on a coffee break ( 10-30 mins )
☐ Short ( 1-2 Hours )
☐ Average 4-6h
☐ Long / 10h+ JRPG
☑ Suddenly i have to shave... ( Weeks )
☑ To infinity and beyond! ( Months / years / MMO / Sandbox )

My notes: I have hundreds of hours played and hardly scratched the surface on the game, i expect thousands of hours played to fully complete it, there is a single quest line of incredibly hard achievements to complete, and many cosmetic items and decorative objects to gather, however if you are a content tourist and get hard carried by an established faction you could conceivably finish the game in a few weeks, or less if you pre-planned everything and speed run it.

---{ Value / Price }---
☐ I'm FREEEEEEEEE!
☐ Worth the price  / Day 1 fan
☑ If it's on sale / you really care
☐ Only If it's on DEEP sale
☐ Not recommended, but hey if you really want to...
☐ Only if our bank is on fire and you have to spend some money to put it out.

My notes: The game is not a ripoff, and can provide many hours of entertainment, and or incredible frustration, depending on your taste, and how buggy the thing you're doing that day is... however if you've played ark, atlas is basically a reskin with boats and islands instead of dinosaurs.

---{ Bugs / Issues }---
☐ No known bugs
☐ Minor bugs, effects the unlucky.
☐ Major bugs, effects most players.
☑ ARK: Bugs Evolved
☐ Bugthesda studios
☐ Holy crashes batman Is this thing just a virus?!?!

My notes: As this is prettymuch a reskin of Ark, you can expect identical bugs, and even more, new ones related to the ships, sea, de-sync on vehicles, physics ( floating players, objects, continual sliding ) etc etc, it would be literally impossible to list them all in a post, i would literally reach the text limit, no joke. however they are MOSTLY the work-around-able type, with only a few remaining hard crashes, for example i experience at least 1 bug, glitch defect or issue per 1-3 hours of gameplay depending on what i'm doing.

My notes: Despite my sarcasm and dumping on it at times, it's still a worthy game that can provide hours of entertainment, it's best enjoyed with friends in a company and on private servers, and let's be honest not all bugs are game breaking, some are just funny, like the time it took me 90 mins hours to install a grill and had 2 people watching me tear my hair out figuring out why a simple object refused to go in a simple space provided for it, THEY had great fun as they watched me glitch all over the place, So then, Overall Progression in the game is pretty fulfilling as you get skills and talents to Min-max, tamed creatures can be engaging as they have unique mechanics, ships are pretty fun to sail, but can sink unexpectedly on small rocks or shallows, this isn't a bug but can still be frustrating, combat is a cluster of ideas mixed together and does not end up being cohesive, So i can't really heavily recommend the game unless you really like the pirate aesthetic and free building mechanics and don't care about bugs and irrational decisions and controls so this is a vague recommend if you are in that camp, i have my moments and will doubtless one day complete the game, but this is not that day.",1545532352,1647800072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lets get the obvious out of the way: Yes it has the same engine of ARK No, its not at all like ARK. Of course there are clear ARK players that amass animals and try to attack everything they see, but they are not very successfull at it, because in this game tames are not the most vital thing. 

They completely nailed the tropical pirate theme with creatures, islands, freedom etc. 

Given the detail and enormous code for simply the weather and waves in the ocean, it comes off a bit glitchy sometimes when crossing into another server (grid) for the first 2 minutes. And there are the usual ark rubberband issues SOMETIMES with animals. 

If you like carving your own path, and actually having a chance to fight people ship to ship, or pistol to pistol, love the unexpected and don't mind learning with trial by fire, then this is the ultimate game for you. 

Just consider the fact that all servers are mushed together in a massive grid meaning: There is only 1 world... For everyone!! 

This game almost feels massive and uncontrollable, but amazing things go down in this game (gameplay wise) that could NEVER happen in ARK, where every animal just magnets towards you and kills you...

The servers are insanely unstable, my company has lost multiple ships and characters while transitioning from one area to another.

Your base might just randomly degrade on you for no reason.  Despite having a claim tower with a 10 day decay timer there are have multiple instances where my company or others have logged off one day and logged on the next and half our base is just gone even though for weeks there were no issues and even after rebuilding and double checking everything it will vanish again. 

The barrel roll bug is still in the game so you may be sailing along and all the sudden your ship decides its gonna start flying and barrel roll onto an island and explode... was kinda funny the first time it happen but not when its on a fully loaded galleon.

Portal camping from NPCs is a thing.  So multiple times ive seen Ships of the damned sailing around entry portals to zones and instantly start shooting players that just zoned in sinking them before they even have a chance to move and this should not be a thing.   

The Devs dont wanna hear about your complaints as when posting about them on their discord if you post in any publicly seen channel they instantly delete it because they dont want attention brought to the bugs,

I love the crafting, building part of the game. 
I don't like PVP and the sea part is too stressful, 
but the crafting is what keeps bringing me back. 
(months later)...
At this point I'm tired of over crowded islands that leave no room for anyone else to build. I found a tiny spot for a humble home. Spent 2 weeks gathering resources  only to have it all destroyed. I didn't pay this much money for that nonsense.

But the worst thing is the HEAT this game causes. I suspect, and have seen threads of other people saying the same thing, that this game may damage computers due to the heat. MAYBE that is the reason I had to send my computer back to the factory and have a capacitor replaced.  What I don't get, is even when I logged out of the game, but left it on the main menu, I came back the next morning and it was still super hot. WHY??? Something is wrong with the design to make the menu screen heat up a computer for 8 hours. 

There is a great structure in this game.  Heat needs to be fixed. More servers or more ""instances"" like in Everquest that only allows so many people. The island crowding is broken. There is not enough for a person who hates PVP.  Allow players to build cities to service ships/pirates. Allow communities.

It has its flaws to be sure, and I am hopeful that all the little annoyances will be fixed soon. My biggest gripe is since the game is still evolving, they occasionally (every few months or so with at least a week warning in Discord) wipe everything and you have to start over. Sometimes that is good as you can build things in a different way. Issues aside, this game is so immersive, and has so many different avenues of play that it could keep you hooked for years. I have played alongside my husband for several month, but watched him play for over 2 years. Where to begin. .. PVP vs PVE, if you want to fight PVP. If you are more of an adventurer then PVE (this is our choice). PVE is not much different than playing single player, but you have the option to meet others. If you don't wish to, no biggie, keep to yourself. If you like meeting people there are often Saturday night gatherings announced in Discord put together by other players. Meet at a certain grid and they have games raffles and such. Not technically part of the game but speaks to the community of players.  
You can build, structures, tame many different types of animals, build ships, find treasure maps, use your tamed animals to fight Soldiers of the Damned to get that treasure. You can breed animals to get better stats. This is what we do. Then we use them for better treasures and sell some.  There are quests if you are goal based too. 
The graphics are amazing and while on the ship you can almost close your eyes and feel the salty sea air hit your face. The sounds of the waves hitting the hull, the wind, sometimes the sound of a nearby shark. There are as many interesting things under the water as there are on land. Shipwrecks to find, and salvage the treasure from, sea horses, dolphins, squids and full underwater trenches filled with bright colorful corals. 
If you can put up with some small issues (and for XBox players this is currently more noticeable) you will love the game. If you want it closer to perfect (what game is ever perfect) - wait for the full release.",1646443536,1646443536,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Since I was stuck with it I decided to give it another go with a friend and now I'm enjoying the shit out of it. I mean yes of course there are bugs and it lags at times, but since the launch the devs have worked really hard and improved the experience by a ton.

It is clearly based on ARK, but despite having played hundreds of hours of ARK I still feel like I'm playing a new game with lots of new things to do, while being familiar with some aspects of the game. The sailing is a BIG part of the game and it's just completely awesome stuff.

I would recommend this game to you if:

- You enjoyed ARK
- Enjoy open world survival games with building aspects in general
- Know what early access means
- Like the idea of building and customizing your own ship and heading to the open seas to explore

I don't recommend playing alone. This game shines when you are enjoying it with a friend or a few of them.

But, well.. I cannot, under any circumstances, recommend this game. Because anything that you want here, was done better in Ark. Excluding the surface of the ocean (credit to Nvidia Waveworks 2.0 for that, Grapeshot Games changed literally nothing from the stock licensable content of Waveworks 2.0.)
The world is far too empty, relying entirely on players to create content by way of PvP. As with Ark, but much worse in this case, the PvP is unbalanced and designed with more ways to fight via exploits and loopholes than intentional mechanics. So don't expect to lose a ship battle or a raid, instead expect to log in to sunk ships, lose on crossing a server boundary (and, if you have 6k hours in Ark with an effective understanding of 10k hours, PLUS also work as an independant developer within Unreal Engine yourself, you can actually force the buggy Official servers to literally cough your Galleon back out of the aether after 14 hours, like I did when I last decided to stream this half-hearted clone of a former success.)
From there, content was only removed, scope was reduced, and bugs were squashed slower than they were introduced by a factor of about 3:1. It only got worse.
Look.. If you REALLY want this game and you're itching for it no matter what anyone says.. Buy Ark instead. If you just love the waves.. Get into game development, garner enough attention to get approved for a license with Nvidia GameWorks, and just make Garry's Mod with Waveworks 2.0, and you'll have outclassed Atlas in terms of meaningful content, plus you've got that beautiful ocean.
Seriously, don't buy this. It's a successor that forgot what made the original successful, left a massive world barren of meaningful content, forgot how it fixed most of the same bugs in the prior game, started with a reduced scope compared to Ark's initial early access release in 2015 and then only reduced the scope since (literally repealing and deleting features faster than adding them since launch) and for some reason, I PERSONALLY had to recommend fixes to the development team for major issues like the launch day debacle where everyone got 1-3 fps if they could even connect because someone though 20,000 sleeping players ought to be replicated when players connect to the same servers and the same spawn points in a world designed for that many people, and couldn't just realize ""hey, let's not replicate logged out players in an area we banned PvP in anyways. Does nothing but lags everyone out for no benefit.""

Bugs at every corner and I could not even achieve 1 full hour of game-play without it crashing AT LEAST once within the hour - Performance was otherwise somewhat acceptable, however the constant random crashes were a complete disaster.

User Interface is disgusting, over complicated and overlaps with other UI elements making some text unreadable as well as getting slammed with walls of text taking up 60% of the viewable area the moment you join a game.

Getting stuck on ship cannons having to re-log to fix the issue, expect your ship to be destroyed by the time you log back in.

Sometimes randomly unable to board ship in turn having to destroy and remake it, which only becomes more frustrating that you get no materials back for destroying bugged ships wasting hours of time gathering resources.

Some Islands are duplicated within the same region making treasure hunting a complete guessing game.

One uplifting quality is that the environment, models and textures etc all look really really nice, but unfortunately the way this was released seemingly untested and in such poor form completely makes the nice models and textures completely redundant and is hard to appreciate with the rest of the game being such garbage.

I could not be more disappointed in both this game and the developers, possibly even too the marketing team at completely over-hyping something that is FAR from a playable game, I feel as a paying customer I should NOT be the one doing your testing for you, seems like an attempt at a quick money grab trying to rush out a game in a genre that's a hot topic, WAY over-hyped and completely under-developed coming to public access far, far too early, I will find it very difficult to return back to this to give it another chance.",1575493473,1644302160,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,True

We must consider an ark style survival game that put size into context with sailing and allows pirating to be something to be loved and enjoyed. YES there are many features in the game that prehaps shouldn't be but not limited to:
1. Flying fish
2. exploding boats
3. Fatal error crashes between regions
4. Optimisation that helps you to know when to stop playing (Alt F4 restart glitch) 
5. sinking animals into the floor
6. 360 rotating no scoping boats
7. The ability to backflip your boat and fly into the sun uncontrollably.
8. Overheating to crash test your PC
9. The great snapping system. 
10. not being able to spawn back in (Game crashes 3 times before loading)
11. Poor rendering 
12. Server instability.

Edit @4100 hours played. This game will never be intended for small groups. I have played with so called ""MEGAS"" or really just a group of bitchy brats that cant survive on their own and that was not fun. I tried two different seasons and it is not fun. It literally takes everything away from the game. I think maybe 6 or 8 should be the limit. Have one ally if that. Its too easy for these companies to make alts and have 600 fkn people. It makes no sense. 

I have officially played my last time and will not be back.

I love the potential of the game. Taming is awesome and the building is pretty fun most of the time. Still a lot of optimization left to do but so much potential just pissed away.

 I think the changes to ships have improved but still things that need changed. Barrels are a joke. Crabs with barrels are a joke. I have yet to see the torpedo changes for tames but i can only imagine thats not a very good idea. You can't protect your base when building up high and that is the only protection you have as a small company. Crabs can maneuver just about anywhere and that makes no sense to have something that strong be able to do that.

PvP is awful most times but could be fun with the right fixes. PvE is what everyone will say i need to do but there is literally nothing in that. I like the chance for a boat fight or to have to defend my base or whatever it might be...but atleast make it where i can defend!

Well it was a waste of 2 years and 4000 hours of my life. Moving on! I hope someone reads this before they attempt to play this game and enjoy it.

Season 2 was fun when i first started but it became a fucking job after that.

There is way too much to do for solo play, though it is doable but it is ssssssssoooooooo much work just to get started or maybe I just still don't know what I'm doing yet, which there is a lot of truth in that, because there is so much to do. So the con to solo play is too much to do and it is very lonely and kind of boring. The Pro to solo play is that you can sail around for more than 5 minutes without something happening; cyclones, SoD, Fog, Whales and you can settle on any island you want.

playing on the servers is better in some ways, more people to interact with, less to do, etc. worse in others, harder to find a place to settle, so many more cyclones, so many bugs, etc

I do like the game. Met good people who are very chill, but I cannot recommend it. I have heard of a number of people who have left the game because once in a while they do a complete wipe, which puts everyone back to zero, so to speak. The people I normally play other games with will not even try this game because of that alone.

Another thing to add is how you have to guess at whether or not your lumberyards, farmhouses, etc will connect to your warehouse. its very frustrating because, as far as I can tell, you have to go to the warehouse to see if it is connected, which means your timer to be able to pick it up and place it some where else will run out and the range is not very far at all. you have to be very precise when putting your structures down an you may not get all 4 to connect to the warehouse. Have fun grinding and running back and forth between your structures.........
this game in solo play is very very annoying. It is an insane amount of work, to get started. You Have to Have a lot to take on pirate camps, even the smaller ones, can't really do any sword fighting because it is always like 4-8 or more on you.

For a game based on high seas and ships it takes way to long to even get a ship other than weaponless sloop from starting areas. To even build a small shipyard it take 500 gold which requires digging up treasure guarded by swarms of undead and these treasures are sometimes on the highest peaks of mountains. (Update: The first skill in shipbuilding costs 500 gold, a later skill does not cost any gold to build but shipyard can only build Cog type ship).

Travelling between islands is tedious at best and heaven forbid you step away for an instant or a giant undead ship blows your newbie sloop out of the water.

Assuming you even get far enough to slowly sail back to newbie town with your ship to hire a crew, to faster dig up treasure and handle the ships rigging so you do not have to run back and forth, the pathing of the crew goes nuts and they get stuck constantly. You literally have to keep looking back to see if they are still there.

Update prevents players from learning all the skills in the skill tree which on the surface sounds like a good idea but many skills are buried to deeply on the survival tree. Want to be able to heal? Well you need to learn to cook first. Want to make healers kit for healing? Well gotta learn how to make wooden buildings first.

Its trying to follow a producer/consumer model but unfortunately there just are not enough players. Players can respec but this is time consuming and costly.

UPDATE: FINAL STRAW... After wanting to like this game and playing 200 hours character just goes poof! not a wipe but do to server instability and exchanging character information between servers it seems that when I attempted to cross server boundaries it just ate my character.

I played on the Official PVE Server for a couple of days, I finally built the first ship, then got a 'Timeout error'. Got back in after 10 minutes and my ship was gone; and I had no food. This game is totally FFF'd, the dev's are liars and pretend to fix things. I'm unistalling forever.

First Review:
In Australia? Don't buy even if it is on sale. The official servers are in North America and Europe only, average ping is at a mega lag 130. I'm mid battle with a Damned ship and it freezes for 2 mins or so. 
Transitions when going through map borders are horrendous. 'sunny day' can turn into a 'cyclone at night' when you load into next grid, and the ship was tearing around so bad I was jutting around for around a min before you get control back.
Draw distance is set to stupidly close, buildings and ships become visible about 300m away,(which sucks when these things combine. Damned ship spawns in front of you as you enter  the next grid, with no ship control).
Some grids are less glitchy, some are really bad.
Players: Most are nice, helpful even, but I'm unable to get to treasures as entire islands are often walled off, with a message saying ""Keep sailing, we don't want neighbors"", or ""Don't build here, we purge every 12hrs"".
Discovery areas in the game are often cut off, special areas put in by the creators to boost XP for a time, much needed as it takes a long time to level up when your over level 40.
And lets not forget ""YoYo sails and twitching masts"", seem to common problems for a lot of people but no one mentions it.  The Yoyo sails constantly going up and down makes a sound like nails on a blackboard, while the mast twitching left/right has a repeating sound of the sails catching wind. Combine to create haedache, noisiest sailing ever, it also effects speed and handling.
This plays good in single player or with friends on your own non-dedicated game. I haven't tried making a dedicated server as I feel I'm being held to ransom just to have a game play properly with friends.
Others smaller bugs did appear but nothing game breaking.
And the Devs just went on a break, So I don't expect these to be fixed for a long time.

This review may not apply to people in other country's, Australia has slow internet as standard.",1573535751,1642942451,False,1,0,0.476878643035888672,0,True,False,True

So. Value for money? Hell yes!

I've had a blast playing this game, especially whilst playing on non official servers (That official grind hurts the soul) 
It's like Ark, Rust & Sea of Thieves rocked the boat a few times and Atlas washed up nine months later.

Atlas definitely ticks all of the boxes for me, from base building, fighting giant three headed creatures, chasing down other playing on the high seas or having the boat you spent 3 hours building to perfection sunk by a whale in a bad mood.

I'm only leaving due to the lack of populated servers in my region.

Bed's that don't work UNLESS a flag is placed, but NOTHING that tells you that, so get fucked if you die.

Pick up a box and the items IN the box do not get picked up OR DROPPED (like in ARK) and no warning about that either. Just fuck you and your stuff.

Will the dev's ever UNFUCK IT? Given that ARK still an optimized mess...probably not.

For a ""game"" that is basically an ARK MOD turned into a full game, with stolen/copied ARK GAME ASSETS, I would NOT recommend this.",1642107181,1642129573,False,2,0,0.469613254070281982,0,True,False,True

In essence this game has hardly changed since it was released, and development manifestos that have been published (which based on their track record will NOT come to fruition) point to a weakening of what few aspects of the game actually separated it from its sister title ARK.

What updates were made to the game since launch could overwhelmingly be confused for ARK updates, since everyone knows that when you make a game about sailing ships and taking islands what players really want are more mountable creatures and no expansions of the actual sailing content. Years later Grapeshot have only just recently started to add any kind of content related to sailing vessels into the game, but what's planned and added are new sailing vessels which represent the developer's vision of the game's future - taking the things that made the game interesting and chipping away their mechanics until the game becomes ARK with boat-like vehicles. The developers of ATLAS completely lost the plot on the game they spun off from ARK, and spent the last couple of years copying their homework.

The game is virtually dead in terms of playerbase, the official clusters having been all but abandoned not long after launch due to rampant instability, lack of optimization, nearly unchecked hacking (so much so that it was newsworthy,) and the game receiving basically no significant updates. ATLAS was from then on supported almost entirely by private server communities running modifications through Steam Workshop. Unfortunately, Grapeshot gave the same treatment to their development kit as they did their own game, leaving it to squander in the background with little to no support.

Furthermore, where Grapeshot had previously attempted to surreptitiously take ideas and content from the modding community without recognition, hirings, etc., they've recently gone the Blizzard Warcraft 3 Reforged route of outright claiming ownership over any modifications for ATLAS. As a result, what few communities remain are already packing up their operations and looking elsewhere.

Under no circumstances should you buy ATLAS, either full price or on sale. While the prospect of an ARK-like survival game themed around Age of Sail-meets-Fantasy themes may sound fantastic, your time and money would be better spent playing ARK with boat mods. You will not get to have the purported MMO-like experience due largely to this game already being dead, neither on official clusters or even on private servers. From the start, the sailing and ships in the game were only ever passable at best, and will only get worse based on what few content updates they've released and their development manifestos. At this point in time the train has already left the station and you're not on it - be thankful you dodged this disappointment and look for a different game.

- As of 2022 the developers currently tasked with maintaining ATLAS have taken it upon themselves to strip down the one genuinely good part of the game: The ship building. Rather than expanding and optimizing the ship building that was in the game already, they have instead decided to focus on forcing players to use what are essentially pre-built ships. Furthermore, they continue to make life difficult for those that stuck around to try and mod the game to be something worth playing.

Again I emphasize that under no circumstance should this game be purchased. With every patch released it gets worse. I'm not talking ""bitter early adopter"" worse, or ""angry vet"" worse here either, I mean worse period. Just get ARK and install a ship mod or something instead.",1618323182,1642128918,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game itself is great for the environment, the quests and missions. You can literately explore every inch of the terrain.  The oceans are so lifelike its amazing. but there is also frustration and disappointment of hours of playtime riddled by game crashes or just simply from bed travelling and ending up with your character floating in the middle of the ocean and having ships, gathered resources, tames and everything else that's on that ship just disappear from the map.

The trade winds (light blue path on the ocean surface) are not displayed in the correct locations on the map and sometimes are heading in the opposite direction of the wind in the ship's sails. Information on the map overlaps and when you zoom in for a better view that information just disappears. Information on the screen overlaps and makes things difficult to read. i.e. I was trying to fix a cannon but could not see the required materials because the cannon's info text (lvl, health, etc) was over it.

A major issue is with the skills tree and mods. Very difficult to integrate mods without interference with other mods or the skills tree as a whole. Some part of the tree get blocked by a mod (i.e. the Captaineering skills tree) or engrams disappear from the player or work bench (smithy) crafting menus. I noticed in the skills tree that a previously learned skill had a yellow frame around it with a white plus sign in the top left corner. I don't know if this is due to a game or mod update but it had to be re-learned to have access to those engrams again.

There are a lot of complaints about the lag in the servers or the delays, but that's not to be unexpected in an early access game. There are even complaints that they used the Ark engine, but who cares, do you know how many games use the same engine.

Here IS what is wrong with the game:
I signed up because I wanted to go on a glorious pirate adventure where I got to fight dragons while looking for treasure.. You know, like the trailers show. What I got instead is ARK ""a pirate modification"". This is supposed to be set in a time period where there is civilization, you start in a town with people and signs of people living in the town, so why the hell can I not go to the store and buy a pick ax. No, I have to go punch a tree, collect items and build all the tools to use. 

Using the ARK engine is fine, but make the game different and deliver what you advertise.. 

Also, take a look at other successful MMO's, what happens when people leave the game? Their bodies disappear, why is that, because when they are there it takes up processing power, so as you load up the game, you see the sleeping bodies of thousands or people who are logged out right now causing a lot of the lag you get when you first start the game

This game will get better, I know it will, but currently, it is not. It is not what is advertised. 

This said, I am still going to check it out and hope that it delivers better results. [/strike]

This previous review was written a while ago and I have to say, this has become one of my favorite games. The devs have done a great job building and expanding this world. They seem to have listened to complaints and faced the ones that they could. 
The game is not without issues, weird glitches, lag, some bad animation mishaps, but those can be chalked up to  growing pains and the demons of running an MMO. 

There are grand adventures in this game and a little something for everyone, I recommend this game to anyone who likes the pirate genre and real time travel sailing a vessel across a foreboding world.

You guys are absolute dogshit and this game deserves to die, such as it is. I can't list all the myriad of problems, because they are endless, but some big ones that are undoubtedly why this sack of shit is dying.

1. Offline raiding - IDGAF is it's ""lawless"". This is why you have shit population. Person tries new game. Person enjoys new game and spends hours/days getting into it. Person goes to bed like normal human being. Person comes back to hours of hard work gone because some anti-social retard got bullied in school too much. Person quits. If you're going for population control in your game, you're doing great.

2. Lawful region defenses - Please explain why it is ok for people who just happen to win a base race at server reset to block off an entire island while remaining invincible. No one ever thought up there in your stupid little brains ""Maybe if you can't be attacked you shouldn't be able to attack""? How fucking stupid are you guys? ""We're first, so we are invincible""! Yeah, great mentality. Whoever thought of this mechanic is the kid who ""had all the powers"" when he played superhero games on the kindergarten playground. I don't want to hear about ""dropping the gauntlet"". The timer makes it useless.

3. Vitamin deficiencies - You're aware everyone just dies to reset this garbage mechanic right? Please tell me how eating 3 pieces of filet mignon is supposed to kill me? This could be a good idea if it weren't implemented in the sloppiest fashion possible.

I realize 1 and 2 seem to contradict one another, but let's take a step back and think outside the box.

Lawful region would be fine if your defenses couldn't pelt anyone trying to dig up a treasure on the island or just sailing by. Maybe your defenses can only attack companies you are at war with? FUCKING DUH. 

Lawless would be fine if you couldn't be offlined. I'm sorry, but it's a dogshit mechanic. If even one person is online who could at least attempt to hop on a cannon, build some extra walls, run at his attackers with a sword or call his friends and say get the fuck on. Anything other than encouraging basement dwelling sweat-tards to stay up until 3 am just to grief someone because they are butthurt they lost a ship vs ship battle and they can't get a fucking date or they are 12 and it's summer vacation.

I have played this game off and on since release, putting in more than 3000 hours, I've played on PvP servers both official and private. Ensured I have played thoroughly after all new major content patches. My review is based on my experience playing on those types of servers. Here are my Pros & Cons.

Pros: 

-Atmosphere of the game is amazing, they nailed the theme of pirates out on the high seas
-Ship combat PvE (And at times PvP)
-Building and customizing shipsLand base building is great at times
-Exploring islands and doing treasure maps. 
-Searching NPC and real players shipwrecks. 
-Whale hunting
-Gathering structures so you spend less time gathering and allowing more time out at sea.
-Area Biomes (I love the Arctic)
-Riding around with tameable creatures
-Forming alliances with other players and trading
-Skill trees add a bit of variety on what you specialize your character in, but can still manage not to feel completely crippled. Allowing you to do most things just not mastering a skill tree.

Cons:

-Land PvP - You can build great defenses, have layers of walls, tons of Cannons & Puckles (Mounted Guns), build up high on cliffs, use natural terrain locations to help shield your base, and it can all be circumvented by one or two people abusing game mechanics.

-Ship PvP - This can be hit or miss depending on the person you come across. Some will fight like actual ship combat is supposed to be by maneuvering (like using a reef to possibly cripple the ship allowing you time to flee. Maneuver through NPC Undead ships that they can easily maneuver and the bigger ship might just have to take the hits) and broadside volleys. 
Others will abuse ship building structure placement so they place cannons clearly where they're not meant to be placed, and just try to kite you around (Higher up a cannon is the better range it'll have). Nothing is based on skill this way, just who is faster and who has more ammo.

-Offline raiding (Like many other similar games) Bear/Horse cart with a cannon. These players run around on the island just positioning it just right so it can hit your base/anchored ship out of range of all defenses. I wouldn't say this is complete abuse of game mechanics, just very annoying. And their range at least needs a small nerf (This is one of the major key issues allowing offline raiding. In my opinion they should make it do far less damage depending on the range it was shot from. Making it far more ammo intensive and/or so little damage).

-A lack of risk vs reward in base raiding. As stated in the comments above there is almost no risk to the aggressor.

-Wall/Pillar Towers - These are used in base raiding where you simply stack wall building parts on top of each other to the desired height and place a ceiling tile at the top, then placing a cannon. This gives them a height advantage allowing them to attack your defenses outside your range. I've seen these stack over 50 wall pieces high allowing almost no risk for the aggressor. (These can be semi countered if you're online and take control of your own cannon to destroy it before it gets too high).

-Ramp Towers - Similar to the previous towers these are used to place roof pieces in a spiral form going straight up. Allowing you to bring a ""Bear/Horse cart with a cannon"" to do the same strategy mentioned before.

-Toxic community, Don't get me wrong there are great and friendly players you run into but i'd have to say about 80% of the population is toxic. This is in-game, Forums, Reddit, and Chat rooms (Discord has the least toxic out of them all).

-Punishes solo or small company of players (Chances are you'll lose everything when not playing)

-Extremely buggy building a base after last major update (I've never had a real issue that I couldn't find a way to make it work till now)

I've left out the market system and gold cost of ships since in my opinion still too new/being smoothed out to determine the Pros & Cons of those systems. Developers have made great strides on key parts of the game and other times feel more like one step forward two steps back. Game has great potential but feels like at times the developers are unsure of what type/kind of pirate game they want to make. Overall since playing I feel like I'd recommend the game less and less. If it's your first time playing, I'd recommend playing on a private server. If you're still wanting to try the game I'd recommend buying it during a sale. I'll update this review if I've forgotten something or if things have changed making this review obsolete.

[b]New Addition:[/b]
I wish I could say my latest experience with the new ships and map are positive after playing some more... but nope.

New Ships: Yeah there cool looking and interesting design but utterly useless and expensive expect for the ""Cog"" which grew on me [b](Great little starting ship)[/b].

Portal System: Firstly the portals. They look like a cheaply made mod, utterly break the immersion from the game, take away the sense of exploration, and random encounters out on the sea whether from players or army of the dead. In my opinion if they made the portals look like an ocean whirlpool that popped you out of the ocean near another one you can take back the way you came. Then make some like the current portals that you cant take back, wouldn't really break the immersion as much. Or perhaps taking them have a chance to spawn army of the dead ships when coming out the other end. You want shorter travel time then have the risk of PvE ambush.  [i](I know the new map system couldn't really work with out the portals)[/i] 

New Map: At first I thought it was pretty interesting great way to filter parts of the map more towards certain biome even more so then before. But once again this is another thing that breaks the immersion, as it takes away the sense of exploration. Previously having to plan a route for long voyage by seeing who owns the area you travel through, are they known to be hostile, is there a current company war in the area, is the entire grid lawless, stocking up on supplies in case its to risky to stop in the area? Making the decision to risk it.

Misc:
The current system for building and/or claiming islands is awful, feels like this isn't a one step forward two steps back but more a giant leap back. It will be confusing and frustrating to new players. This alone I know will turn new players away, as it did once before.

I will continue to try and update my review after new major updates comes out and after testing them. But right now this ship is vastly sinking and without new players there just wont be enough crew to keep it afloat.",1621165065,1641164291,False,3,0,0.525800108909606934,0,True,False,True

*another year has passed so I checked it out again and I think it's even worse. All the same old bugs plus a few new ones and still very unbalanced. 

After over 600 hours spent playing ATLAS, I can't recommend it. If Steam rated with stars I might give it 3 stars out of 10. Obviously I wouldn't have played it for 600 hours if it wasn't fun in ways. But I don't feel like I can honestly recommend something that is so broken, and shows zero signs of improvement to the most important problems after a year in early access. 

Like ARK, the game is great in many ways, or at least the concepts are, even if the execution is not. The ship battle is fun. The building is fun. The map is beautiful. But all those things are tempered with frustration at all the broken dynamics in the game. I feel like they didn't even do the most basic testing before launching early release. I wouldn't even consider it a beta. For instance, the very last time I played it, after finally getting established and spending several days building a base and ship, I sailed 4 servers away and got a boatload of gems (a lot of work to pull off). On the way out, my schooner touched rock. Instead of damaging the 1 or 2 planks that hit the rock, my schooner bounced up in the air and bounced around on the rock like a hackey sack, knocking off around 8 planks and sinking it in seconds. It's broken stuff like that that make people quit. Why even play the game when all your work might be erased by buggy mechanics at any moment? Had a similar experience before when a whale knocked our boat across a server boundary and it made the game crash. Came back to a sunken boat of course. Not only do the devs not concern themselves with fixing the worst of the bugs, they have a record of coming up with perfectly idiotic solutions to ""fix"" them. For instance when there was a problem with weight raiding (people with high weight boarding your boat and sinking it) the ""solution"" wildcard came up with was to make you get stuck on any other player's raft that you might land on (it happens a lot in Freeports and Powerstone islands) so you are just stuck for an hour or however long it takes you to die. There is no way to commit suicide, so if it happens and you had several hours of gameplay in mind, too bad, better find something else to do that day. Truly idiotic. They also let you build shipyards, where the water isn't deep enough for a ship, so you work on it for days, finally finish it, release it into the water... and it explodes. Almost hard to believe they are not just torturing their customers for fun, like some monkey's paw scenario where the devs are like 'oh yeah we'll ""fix"" it for you, bwa ha ha'. bear in mind, none of these things are from the first week of early access, which would be excusable, these are ongoing after almost a year.

I also have beef with their incredibly misleading preview 'footage' which is nothing whatsoever like the actual game, and shows 10 times more content in it than the game actually has. 

There is simply not enough space for the players. They would need several instances of the entire map to make enough claimable land. If you didn't start playing this game when it came out, you can forget about actually owning land in the game, which is supposed to be a primary goal. 

The attention to detail is weak and they take it to annoying levels. For instance, they have a bunch of different models of plants, but they mix and match them, so they look the same but give different materials. On one island, a plant will give sugarcane, and on another, an identical plant will give fiber instead. The plant models do not in the least resemble their real life counterparts, and to make things more ridiculous, they use models of other plants to represent plants when they actually have the correct one. So for instance, they have both beets and onions in the game, and they have appropriate graphics for both.But on some islands they have made the beet plant look like an onion and visa versa. Why???? It's just soooo lazy and soooo stupid. 

Grapeshot has definitely proven that they don't know how to make a video game. I don't think I would buy a game from them again unless I saw a big turnaround, and I don't think I will. If anything, this game proves that they learned nothing from their experience making ARK, and not only didn't raise their standards, but used the popularity of ARK as justification to do things even worse. ATLAS is a shameless cash grab, and studios like this have ruined my faith in the early access model. Wildcard apparently thinks of it like a Ponzi scheme where they get to sell a product that they don't actually have and have no intention of finishing (and probably don't have the money to finish).",1545961789,1641084077,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Short Version: 

The interface and controls are clunky, character creation looks like something about of a bad 1980's porno film, water graphics flash when swimming in chop and single player spawns you into the ocean to be eaten by sharks after 10 minutes of holding W to swim to the nearest island. 


Full Version: 

At the time of this review I have played for 58 minutes. In that time I have succeeded in making a singleplayer character and dying multiple times to sharks because (for some reason) singleplayer spawns me out in the ocean, with islands on the horizon too far away to reach before being eaten by sharks. 

I then tried multiplayer on one of the 2 official servers. Yes, 2 servers. When I joined, I typed in global chat to be greeted by...you guessed it: silence. I spoke to a shipyard master and read the requirements to build a sloop, with no point of reference on how difficult that would be to acquire (I assumed pretty easy and I wasn't too far off). 

Then, I proceeded out of the starter town into the water, thinking I could salvage some wood from a wreck in the water. What I found, was that the wreck had no collision mechanics and was a fake graphic. I was then promptly bitten by a manta ray or something similar.

Going into the trees outside of town, I found the crafting to be similar to Rust, except that punching trees hurts you (I like that, personally, but to each their own).

I was soon bored with the silence and didn't want to put in work on an empty server, so I went back to main menu and searched for unofficial servers (of which there were plenty). However, with the bad interface, I can only apply 1 filter to the search results at a time, meaning I have to click each and every server to find out how many players they have. Moreover, when I filter by ping, I can't even see what each server's ping is to me without clicking on it. How in the world the developers messed up on making a server list, I'll never know. This is a design concept that's in every server based game for the last 20+ years. You put the PING on the line with a player count. We don't need to know build number, etc. 

Bottom Line: I may keep the game. I'm going to give it another 45 minutes and hopefully still be able to refund it if I can't stand it. If I do keep it and you decide to waste money and be stubborn and ignore my review, feel free to send me a friend invite on Steam and we can play together.

The game has cycled though a couple of Dev teams in the last few years but has now landed on Grapeshot Games to fix the mess that it was, and honestly, they are doing a wonderful job of it. There has been a lot of changes but also things still feel the same as when I first played it. Shipyards cost gold, but that's ok because gold is easy enough to come by, all you need is a couple of generic tamed bears and a couple of treasure maps to get set up.

The map finally feels logical and well thought out, you have dedicated areas based on climate zone, portals to travel between each climate, you have a dedicated grid you can visit for your freeport needs (need crew for your ship? Just take a little gold and head over to Tortuga.) The map is currently smaller than I would like, but there are plans to expand it from 11x11 to 13x13 which means there are plenty of islands to live on and plenty of space to sail for those of us who love to be on the open seas, be it in PVE or PVP.

A couple of the Devs are quite active in the Atlas discord and have been addressing issues, taking suggestions from the community, actually looking at bug reports and fixing them all while developing and creating new content. Sure there is a lot of work to do, but it's finally seeing some genuine TLC that it much needed.

If you are looking for an ARK adjacent survival / crafting game with a pirate theme then I highly suggest this game. Sure it's a little rough around the edges in places but each update is trying to fix what is broken and add / replace content where needed.

ATLAS is a good building and dino-breeding (yeah dino, not usual animals) game. But not a good sailing game. The ship mechanics used to be acceptable, the only problem is the masts system and game performance.
Modular ship system is a good try for both performance and modders indeed, but need to be polished too much. Terrible models, not capable with current buildings, you even couldn't put a single figure head on new ships, nor build small cases on tables. The new ships remain an unfinished, insincerely, no soul of a sail ship.
Anyway, I don't think the game is really dead. There's still hope on it. I always prepare to change my review.

old review:
游戏本意是不错， 极其难得罕见的一款航海游戏，哪怕是套着方舟的核。
然而一拖再拖的发布，卡成幻灯片的服务器，还满人，超时，掉线，好不容易能进去吧，走十步倒回来八步，所有人和动物都是神行者，卡楼梯，撞墙角拐不过去，各种瞬移回原地，造东西进度条不停地回溯...
不要说加速器，这游戏的上下行需求高，一般的加速器限速100kb会让你感受到什么叫小水管。
总而言之，目前这个游戏处于无法游玩阶段。
注意，连勉强能玩都算不上！差评挂一个月再说。
___________________________________________________
继续差评，服务器是光速修复了许多值得肯定，然而各种逻辑bug让这个游戏无法玩。
说好的PVE服，领地系统一团糟，新人没有位置老玩家抢占所有岛屿，船停在看似非常安全的港湾里睡一觉起来就沉在港里，公会记录里描述不清，就只有一条你的船被摧毁了。日肝一条船第二天睡一觉就沉，谁有命玩得起这种游戏？
任何资产没有任何下线保护机制，方舟的团队不适合做网游。
___________________________________________________
这么长时间过去了，虽然最近一直没玩，ATLAS总算有点航海探索游戏的样子了。差评可以改了。
目前游戏已经可以单机联机，不再需要去官方服务器上班，也不用和别的玩家抢地盘。PVE玩家终于可以安心聚焦于探索体验而非刷钱刷材料养动物养NPC船员。
不过还是想吐槽一个：哪有一条船上桅杆高度长一样的！强烈要求船帆可以缩放",1545541318,1640584084,False,0,0,0.862642645835876465,1,True,False,True

I would say don't buy game, 
atm you cant even play single playing without your ships disappearing on you for no reason.

for multiplayer atm, the server need work for being able to enjoy this game

atm the game looks amazing, it holds everything to be great.. but with these devs the game will die...they don't do much on the game anymore.. and i think that they should focus and work a lot more so the game can be stable. cause it ist stable at all...and the update are so useless..

DEVS PLZ do something about your game, it can be soo great.. but because you guys dont do anything about this game anymore.. its gonna die out soon if nothing happens
This was since 2018/2020

Update 12-2021:
Seems there are different devs on the game, and there extually doing some work it seems.
so who know there might still be hope left for this game

And they keep messing it up, now they finally removed the gold cost from ships but only TO ADD THEM TO SHIPYARDS, you heard that right ...
Furthermore, more ridiculous shit to tame in a pirate game ,,, dafuq is wrong with this dev, what pirate in the history of ever had a Bear/Giraffe/Tiger/ SEA HORSE tame
In addition ... they now have pyramids ... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK

Review Season 4
... Holy crap, i love farmhouses :3
No longer do i have to grind for days to put up a miserable stone hut
I build farmhous(es), they auto collect all the stuff nearby, I collect, craft and build, the fun stuff
Next week we get warehouses to increase the storage making them even better
I play solo, i finally have a 'safe' home on a lawless even. With safe i mean very hard to grief, not worth it to the standard troll ^^
for fun i made a schooner, armed to the teeth, big moment since before the max i can aspire to is a sloop. 
After i lost the schooner, 2 hours later due to my own fault xD, i did not even feel that devastated because i knew, my farmhouses are still going, my base is safe and i simply went home and started building my next project, no need for hours of grinding and hoarding.
In conclusion, hella excited, changing my review from negative to positive for the first time since release <3


For giggles the following are my negative reviews xD

Review at V22.2x
So its been a few months without a decent update, they announced a wipe and major update a month in advance killing the entire player base and then lose all credibility when they postpone the patch and wipe again,

Also instead of fixing the game issues they are splitting the game into 3 gametypes so we have even less players per server ...

Go fuck yourself grapeshit



Review at v19.52

And now ... 500+ hours spend on the game, they are getting along with bug fixes.
Met all of the big zergs, banded together with all of the small companys to avert these threaths.
It worked, even hackers IVANARMY and CHEMB leave us alone.
So why a bad review ?
This game is catered to mega companies, the 2 recent patches shudve resolved duping and intentional server crashes, does not really matter because 70% of the player base is wiped already?

Not me tho, defended my shit day and night.

Grapeshot/wildcard gets 80% feedback from megacompanies ... 
Devs are constantly in the discord with them asking what they can do for them to make the game more comfortable for mega companies, it is sickening that company mangement allows such a juvenile approach.

They allow rampant cheating and duping, ignore all QOL updates but oww boy were getting wooden leg skins ! Keep adding fantastic ideas but in essence lack the vision to turn this in an actual MMO, this is nothing more then COD with builder permits and you dont have to shoot even, get an NPC to do it for you.

Because if you do not recruit a virtual army of NPCs you will lose everything.
Guns are useless, need 3 headshots to kill anything.
Cannons are NPC controlled so no ship battles for you my friend, go repair below deck and miss literally everything, because why have a player control a cannon when an NPC can do it far better with 100% accuracy?

Fixes.
Remove the claim system
-- Owning land serves no purpose other then getting on the map and there is only megacompanies that care about that.
--- get people a personal storage for 1 or 2 ships, stop the need for offline raid protection
---- If people still want their own housing THEN INSTANCE SOMETHING.

remove all building
-- Pirates rented rooms and harbour space in a city or slept in their boat ... which pirate build himself a fortress ? Stop being a lazy dev and actually make something on the map except random giant statues.

remove fast travel
- You cannot expect the players to use boats when they can fast travel ... keep the focus on sailing and naval battle

remove NPCS
- Has no place in a pirate MMO, focus your direction please.

Im not even asking that you add something ... just remove these ridiculous ideas ...

TLDR; 
Atlas tries to be too much, has no focus and only listens to mega tribes for feedback because a bunch of unemployed fellows are a great way of knowing what your entire audience likes.

I wanted Atlas to be The pirate game, its hardly a pirate game. ""

My review at patch 5.0
''Been throught the entire patchy launch, camping my pc for a good 3 days now
It was horrible
BUT they are working like mad to fix it and patch 5.0 really fixed ALOT of the lag.
Don`t listen to people moaning its an ark clone, they said they would use ark as a base to grow from
and if you play it ull quickly see its the most complete alpha in the history of steam.

For me to start playing this game again or recommend to a friend, the Devs would need to have a look at a potential cool down period for inactivity, I relentlessly played this game everyday and when I logged off on a night, worked the next day to then log back on on an evening and have no ship or base was soul destroying, especially if you are single/small team and it wasn't just on occasion it was pretty much every night.

It took the Ark system and tried to make it work for a drastically different setting and it hurts as much as it helps. Starting out is horrid as you are likely to be hunted by bored players who have nothing better to do who have warships while you have a raft. The addition of Ark's animal taming system into a Pirate Age of Sail game is weird at best pants on head lunacy at worst, it pushes the same pet based combat that defines Ark over powder and steel that should define a game set in this era. I wasn't expecting super accurate age of sail naval combat and marine combat but I expected something reasonably derived from it instead of what this is.

It is drastically improved by modding in my opinion but I shouldn't have to mod a game for it to be any sort of fun. The limited nature of the islands means islands of any value are always claimed and heavily/max taxed. When in reality the company controls a singular cove but gets to tax the entire island, and you a pirate pay this tax automatically without the ability to refuse. Adding ability for one to refuse to pay taxes and the land owner having a station they check for if anyone has done so, not telling where they just when their last failure to pay taxes was. That puts the effort on companies to enforce their taxes and authority which would make mass flagging islands for free tax less viable.

To start off fighting pirate boats and pirate npcs is incredibly broken the hitboxes are completely off and there are so many bugs to this alone that by the time I've finished explaining how I didn't like this game I'd have written an essay about it. 

So fighting pirates is completely bugged which removes the remaining enjoyment in the game, also taming itself is incredibly annoying. For reasons outside my understanding Atlas and their infinite wisdom decided just bolaing a tame and force feeding it would work but never considered how if you got slightly too close you'd die by a single hit. 
I had to use cheats to make sure taming was possible which shouldn't even need to happen straight up, I would be a good meter or so away from taming a lion and I somehow get mysteriously killed in a bite.

To top this up there are almost no interesting tames available in the game unless you use mods, then the game is slighting more interesting and even with this you can't do much with them. By default you can't tame sharks (which makes no sense why!?) and sometimes npcs render way too close when I try to play the game so when I'm running all the sudden I'll see a lion run at me and snuff me in 2 hits.

I can go on forever about how I don't like this game and how uninspiring it really is. The layout to the HUD and the way you set up servers etc... is almost identical to Ark, you get taming and uploadable players just like what you see in Ark. The way all these are presented is almost what you'd see when playing Ark but the creators decided to tweak it to make it different than the game (I say tweak I mean make the game almost impossible to enjoy and heavily diluted.)

And to bring this up why is the map so bloody big!? It too me over an hour to travel across Atlas (with ship mods) completely straight ahead. So not only is the game painfully glitchy and boring but you just have to live with sailing across a stupidly big ocean like come on his is a videogame  you can at least make sailing less painful and long..",1639000546,1639000546,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

They tell you so each and every time they patch the game, because it's been Early Access since December 2018. In those three years, the game has gotten some flesh on it. But unfortunately, Grapeshot games are unwilling or unable to fix its bones, which I'll touch on later.

Atlas is built on the same concepts as ARK, easily seen in both the similarities of UI and the basic gameplay loop. The addition of ships is what differentiates it so from ARK, and makes it more appealing - at least to me - than ARK itself. There's just something about helming a ship across the waves and firing broadsides at Ships of the Damned that are oh so satisfying. More so than just getting that collection of tamed creatures to do your harvesting for you, or make short work of the treasure guarding Soldiers of the Damned.

Story-wise, Atlas has no more storyline than ARK honestly does, maybe even less so. Sure, there's the odd hand-wave in the direction _of_ a story, but it never really amounts to anything, and doesn't in any significant way affect the game world. But that ultimately isn't the point of Atlas either, any more than it was for its sibling.

If you enjoy base building, critter taming and the steady progress of going from a stone axe to glorious technological marvels... Go play ARK instead. Because ARK has reached a point of refinement for that gameplay that Atlas doesn't measure up to, because of the lingering inherent bugs in the engine.

Building a grand base only to have parts of it spontaneously fall apart because you destroyed an object somewhere nearby and the structural integrity check bugged out is insanely annoying. Having a claim DISAPPEAR spontaneously even while being careful to maintain it is a frustration I don't wish upon anyone. Because as mentioned before - Atlas is in early access, and any attempt to contact Customer Support is met by... nothing. Just a closed ticket, and a pointer to that ""Early access!"" disclaimer.

Atlas is fun, don't get me wrong. I've shoved more than enough hours into the game to pay for its cost, and at its heart, Atlas has an engaging gameplay loop that is enjoyable for anyone fond of tall ships and treasure hunts. But as you progress beyond the bare beginnings and start getting to the part of the gameplay that _should_ be the most enjoyable - it falls apart due to bugs that have been in play for YEARS, but gone unfixed. Early Access is, in my mind, not an excuse for leaving destructive, hugely interfering bugs unattended and uncompensated, especially while Grapeshot is clearly still very much actively developing the game. 

And that is what ultimately makes this a thumbs down. Not because the game is not actually fun to play, but because it will break your heart when you lose a significant investment of time and effort. Not to another player or a PvE event, but to a bug.",1638967802,1638967802,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

They can not fix ladders on the harrier ships you have to use a grapple and drag yourself aboard same as  the other the  mortar ship 

there only about purging and killing you they love killing you  over and over  they make it so you cross a map its just luck if your ship is not frozen while you are loading in  blowing up  

its a game not  worth buying if there only going to take the fun things away .

The galleon once a ship that could actually move is slow as big junk as it is  . any enemy ship you encounter can catch up to it .  also the turtle ship  same as the galleon  you have to pay  50k gold for the galleon .  it just sucks nothing like it once was they have totally ruined the fun this game once had . stick with the cogs at least there  fast.  even though the ladders are busted . Animals all fall off half time though the portal  meaning you have to  get them all back on your ship while sharks are killing them . if you do not have a normal ship the originals galleon and brig  FORGET IT your going to loose animals . good luck getting to the fountain of youth  although  the fountain does not move anymore.

The reason so many people are upset is because you're wiping after a month from the other wipe. I remember the player base of this game was super high when i first got the game. Seems like the developers are trying to make this game dead. Not sure why but this game has so much potential hence why so many people are upset because we all see the potential this game has. Sadly, the devs can't see it and add modal ships that no one wants and portals that no one wants. 
Although I like how they started to do polls and ask the community about further updates, but I think it’s far too late. They should've did this and asked the player base about a wipe to fix the bugs. Im sure we wouldn't have minded.
Game has a fantastic concept just needs new developers that listen to the community to make this game go forward.

Ark had a similar issue, but fortunately there are enough mods available to fix it since the devs wouldn't. Not everyone enjoy the multiplayer side of things and there needs to be options available for those people to still get just as much out of the game.

It's a buggy mess and feels like two or three games jammed in to one with disjointed mechanics all over the place... but it's strangely addictive and can be satisfying, as repetitive and frustrating as it is.

There's not much else that can be said. Even the graphics - at sea, coming in to land, landscapes... they're all surprisingly beautiful. Then you get the janky ass animations of literally everything and it's ...hilarious?

The mechanics - they're all incredible broken or buggy, yet, somehow you make them work. 

You could defend it by saying its early access but looking at Ark, it's not getting better, they'll just add more shit in that doesn't work and doesn't quite fit, then throw it out as completed.

Atlas is a fantastic game, full of content that gets you out there and playing. I am now playing on the Consortium server and also in a group called SBS or Short Bus Syndicate.

Ark's premise is to ride Dinos into battle, Guns become useless, only Dinos. In Atlas however, you choose your poison. Tame Dinos? Or use your weapons? The latter are actually useful (in vanilla lads, I'm talking about vanilla) and viable as hell. Plus there are many things that work better and are more optimized in Atlas than in Ark.

Sure, Atlas has its own hiccups, some old bugs and glitches that still aren't *fully* removed from the game. Yet I see there's been alot of optimization patches, I'd even say there are more *useful* patches for this game being released than for it's jurassic brother. All in all - yes. This game is a bit grindy and yes, you're sailing for a while here. But when buying a game which entire premise is about sailing the seas, I think people who complain here for long sailing times are pretty dense in the head. No offense, I myself am too not the brightest light in the shed.

""But what is there so exciting about these long travels then?"" you may ask. Well, good you ask. It's the ambience. Man you know how in Valheim you're just vibing to the music whilst sitting at your campfire? In Atlas, you're journeying, vibing to the waves rocking your ship side-to-side whilst you maintain your course, staring into the horizon, the light of the sun/moon mirroring in the water, being broken down by the waves or even at the rare case of calm tides, just the calm waters. The fog that disturbs your vision, keeping you at mildly alert, ready to divert the course if necessary in case you'll meet enemies, if they're players or environmental.

Sailing the ""oh so empty"" seas is a different type of content. Given, it may be an acquired taste for some and many don't even see this game as a sailing game but more as an Ark 2.0 because all they're really good at is taming and that's okay. But for me, there's a good reason why I play ATLAS and not Ark. It's the weapons, it's the fact that we don't have shitty expansions that cost you a fortune *cough* Genesis *cough* and it's the fact that I don't crash in the bloody server browser everytime I startup the game.

Yeah, these are maybe minor things to some but I don't enjoy Ark for these reasons and I enjoy Atlas for these and more reasons. Also - admit it, you're reading all this because you wanna make sure this game is not like Ark and not like Sea of Thieves, you wanna check how it really is and I tell you, realistically - it has some issues but the only alternatives to a game you have in this setting don't give you the freedom this game does. If you okay with that - cool. Keep looking and come back.
If not - bite in the sour apple. As said, it's an acquired taste. Who knows, maybe you end up loving it.

Food spoilage is fast just like ARK, however unlike ARK the preserving system requires salt which can only be found on certain islands.

Sailing is extremely slow. The wind system is cool and tackling is a requirement, but even when the wind is in your sails progress is...tedious. 

The majority of smaller islands I've sailed to are completely surrounded and blocked off by clans and unlandable. Couple this with the above two points and well...yeah. Prepare to starve on the seas. 

Respawn timers are pretty ignorant. Every death adding alot of time ensuring if you've stumbled on someones turret or tower you would not be retrieving those goods. 

The ocean water looks amazing until you get a boat on it and release how clunky it is. Boats tend to merge into the waves, which causes this strange glitch where your not above water or underwater, and you can see through pretty much everything. Very broken looking.

This game was a direct clone of ARK.  Not really any original mechanics put into the base of it.  It's strange to see a piracy game focus so heavily on animal taming.  The naval combat is interesting, but buggy and can be a total lag fest between two large ships.  Clearly there is very little programming expertise in Grapeshot, but that's not enough to make a bad review (after all, how many amazing indie games were made by people with minimal programming ability?)
No, what makes them idiots is their design decisions.  PvSleep is arguably the worst form of gaming available.  Attacking me while I'm at work is super fun and engaging and really adds to the game (/s).  Everything you do in this game is subject to being not only destroyed but completely disabled by someone who is playing while you are offline.  If your character is found, they can be put in handcuffs and lose their ability to take any action (including killing yourself).  Imagine logging into a game once every few days only to find you still can't play it because of a troll.  That is ATLAS, and not only that, this kind of behavior is encouraged by the devs.  I can't imagine what kind of fumes they huffed as kids, but it requires serious brain damage to think this is a fun way to play.

Don't buy it, for any reason, at any price.  It's not worth the 100+GB of hard drive space to store it.  The worst part of it all is that the game is a good concept and does actually contain fun elements, but until the handcuffs are removed from the game, there's just no point.  You can't access all the content alone, it needs a group, and it's designed to be played online, and it's designed with PvP in mind, but because of the implementation of the ""capture"" mechanics, the game is completely unplayable.  One bad player with a mild obsession on the game is all it takes to ruin the entire online world--and there are more than a few of them.

If that doesn't deter you, then go play Conan Exiles instead.  They have some of the same brutal mechanics, but at least they implemented them in a fun way that doesn't disable your ability to play the game.

Took them two years to sort it out but its a lot of fun now.  If you are a big fan of ARK and its game systems this is a no brainer to buy.  Looks good and game play is leagues better than it was just two years ago.



**Update 11-10-19  THE GAME STILL TIMES OUT ON LOG IN....There is no way this game should have those problems by now.  Typical from this developer group.  Avoid this game like the plague.

This is one of those situations where ""one day"" it will be a great game. It is early access in every sense of the word. Servers are constantly being restarted, which means rollbacks and lots of time and resources just lost.   Wildcard has a whole lot of work to do here and right now they are just in damage control mode (getting the servers and game to run somewhat smoothly).  Which in all fairness they have been doing 24/7 so far.  It will be quite a while until actual gameplay issues are going to be resolved.  How someone would play this game PvP is beyond me.  All the problems/exploits from ark have translated over to a game that just does not work quite right.  In PvE, what I played, the spawns are insane.  Its like the devs just threw a bunch of spawners on the levels, in no semblance of what makes sense geographically.  The spawn timers are set to ""ultra"". (I suppose to make sure there was plenty to kill for all the players they expected but who knows?) The spawns just keep comming and comming and comming.  I have traveled to at least 15 grids and there is little to no diversity in the islands.  There was never a ""oh thats cool"" moment like in ark. When I logged in today 12-29-18 and saw my ship and everything my and my buddy scraped together and my level 16 raft were gone.  Well that was just it.  You do not leave the world when you log out, you are ""asleep"" where ever you are standing when you log, so critters still attack you even when you are offline.  When the critters are trying to get to you, to kill you, they hit the boat and its contents destroying them.  DO NOT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND.  There is none withing five blocks of a freeport.  None that I could find.  So you can forget, at this point, getting some sweet area for a claim.  Some people resorted to putting down claims in the ocean.  There is just so much wrong with this game for it to be enjoyable right now.  At first it was exciting.  Then the cruel hammer of reality kicks in and  you realize that this game is in such a broken mess that it will take a year to get it to where it will be remotely close to what the trailers show it to be.",1546108472,1638141031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When we want to change to another grid, it used to be very smooth and barely any loading time. But now, it become a shit show that some of the community i know prefer to stay in land instead of sailing, and this is supposed to be a pirate game so you can tell how fcked the game is that the people doesn't even want to do their selling points, which is sailing in the sea. 

When we change grid, the game went into a loading screen and it ALWAYS break the game. For example, the creatures on board the ship or crew on the skip will fell through the boat as if there's no boat in the first place. Then, you sometime can't control the ship because the game bugged the ship itself making it like it has no sail whatsoever. The sail is there and your ship will move forward but you can't turn left or right until you relog.

If you're in a bad luck, there will be ghost ships waiting for you on the other side and you can say goodbye to your ship when it happens. They will sink your ship while you can only watch helplessly because of how retarded the game devs handling their game was.

For instance, some of the mid to late game PvE content is a ton of fun. Admittedly, I don't play PvP because I don't like it, so I can't speak for that side of things, but anyway.

Sailing around is great for the first hour that you do it, but once you've got an established base of operations, having to travel to and from islands to get one resource you don't have gets really tedious. 80% of your time in this game will be spent tabbed out watching Youtube videos while you wait for your ship to go from point A to point B. I get it, it's a game about sailing and exploration, but it's just a little *too* vast for my tastes.

There are also still a ton of bugs related to certain aspects of PvE content. For instance, going to a point indicated by a treasure map will cause Soldiers of the Damned to spawn. Totally normal, right? Well, on more than one occasion, some SOTDs will spawn inside a rock or a tree or even the ground and be unkillable, which means you can't dig up said treasure because you can't dig until all the guardians are dead.

Vanilla rates are *WAY* too slow. The only way to enjoy this game without dedicating every waking hour to this game (like with ARK) is to join an unofficial server with boosted rates for exp, gathering, and et cetera. However, it's really hard to find a server that's not inundated with crappy administration, pay-to-win island claiming, and overall bad management. While this isn't really a strike against the game itself, it's bound to be your experience if you, like me, don't have time to play on an official server.

Overall, this game has a lot of potential, but between the tedium of sailing around for several hours just to gather some resources for ten minutes before sailing back, the lack of decent PvE servers on unofficial, and overall bugginess in several places to this day, I can't recommend this game.

It put me in the wrong server. After i tried to connect 15 times and finally did get in, rubberbanding city. Had to stare at one equally confused idiot trying to punch me for 15 minutes while i tried to move.

None of the stuff from the trailer is there. There is NO bustling city. NO npc's in established cities around the map. All the cities are empty.

It's pretty, it's fun to play* and with a private community to avoid the toxic levels build up over the years from the wrongdoing of the devs, amazing and fun.

It is... however... full of bugs, without any sight of those ever being fixed. Arrogant devs who refuse to help people who are trying to improve on the game with mods and who ignore all feedback. No, all... feedback is ignored. They deploy enthusiasts to run their discords and take all the heat while hiding in the corner.

For legal reasons only, they are still pretending to be Early Access... yeah, since 2018... sure you are. Including a hilarious EULA that is blatantly in conflict with the most basic EU privacy laws, but hey... let's just add that as a startup screen after every update.

This game would benefit from no more development from the devs, have a selection option for a server (so you can select the most stable version of all the stuff they pushed into the game with all the subsequent bugs) and then make it run properly with mods. That way, this best game ever can be played with the least amount of worst additions from a dev team.

We had really enjoyable time playing the game). Would recommend.

After two years i came back to play the game. Haven't seen any improvements, for some reason boats now cost gold which is supper annoying and hard to get, servers laggy, experience trash, game is like skyrim except bugs are rather annoying than funny since they affect gameplay. Forts of pirates spawn inside the mesh including enemies, there is no way to finish these without using cheat commands in single player since how am i supposed to clear the fort if enemies are under mesh. Game has its fun moments but it feels awful most of the time. Same as the ark review i wrote, its a bit better but still if you plan on playing this game don't expect anything, only like that you wont be dissapointed. Make sure to expect weird things to happen during the play like if you die your boat unloads from the map and you cant respawn at its bed, so you have to go back to load that chunks in the middle of the sea. There is ton of annoying bugs but only when something important is happening in the game. There is significant frame drops when some event triggers which by the engine means code has bunch of compiling errors that won't break the code (most of the times) (sometimes game crashes) and game runs but they are reason for these frame drops. This is caused by game being updated to new versions of UE4 but code remained the same... i was expecting more from this game, it looked really good in early access, now... meh i don't think game can or will ever be fixed. Play without expectations and only if you are okay with losing progress at any given moment.

I Play PvE, and generally solo on an unofficial server with mods.  The mods fixed most of the short coming of the game so it was enjoyable.  Then comes the huge update, that was dropped on everyone with basically no warning. No beta test and actually very little testing done at all.  It was very broken and even the first 2 bandaid fixes did not repair it, then they took the weekend off and did not even fix anything until 6 days later, and that fix broken things even worse.  The modders and server owners were not given info to update until days later.  Blah blah blah, you get the idea.
The direction they are heading is toward large PVP clans.  If you don't want to play that pew-pew game, then time to move on, as I am.

I am 176 hours short of 3000 so I think its fair to say “I’ve given this game some thought”. I’ve certainly gotten my money’s worth; I can tell you that.

This game was my primary throughout the pandemic, though I definitely played quite a bit before then. My first experiences with Atlas were actually in single player. I really enjoyed the building aspects, exploration and parts of the combat though found it very challenging. Single player also felt incredibly lonely and empty, especially since this game was designed around the idea of a player-based economy. It was then that I started playing on the official servers. This was a challenge as I was still learning and, unlike many other Atlas players, I had never played Ark. Actually, I didn’t even know about Ark till I encountered other players in the world of Atlas. For those who are reading this and haven’t played Atlas, its nearly identical to Ark but pirate themed with ships and no flying tames. In fact, I didn’t even understand taming until I started playing on an unofficial server. Boy was that a harsh awakening. For context, I had built an entire village, multiple ships and a castle before learning about farming tames.
Building is probably my favorite part of this game, and most others I play. I love designing and creating environments, especially those that can tell a story. I also love the ocean, actual sailing and historical settings, so this game had a lot of pull for me. The game is quite stunning once you are in it and interacting with its various biomes/elements. The animals, water, sky, lighting and foliage are well designed.

The community though can be hit or miss. To clarify, these days, playing unofficial servers is pretty much the only way to enjoy Atlas. The maps are usually much smaller making travel to different resources far less time consuming (by the difference of literal hours), and you are more likely to encounter other people if you choose a populated server. Also, there are quite a few mods that make the game significantly better in terms of building options and quality of life. Many of the larger unofficial servers I’ve played on were actually hosted by people who developed their own mods which was nice because they’d be open to user input/suggestions. Like I said though, these can be hit or miss.
I’ve experienced many servers, some with really welcoming communities and some that are incredibly toxic. Some with high population and some without. In many cases population will start large, usually when a server begins after a reboot, and quickly die out. Most of my server switching have been a result of this which is the sad reality of playing a dying game. It mostly boils down to those who run the server and how they choose to manage it. In conclusion, it can be hard to find a good one and, these days, it can be even harder to feel welcome once a good one is found as most communities have been established for over a year now and like to do things their own way, unwelcoming of outsiders whom they believe may threaten change. It’s a challenging experience, especially with a game you want to enjoy. But, ignoring the social aspects of the game, there are many other issues I’d like to comment on around development.

The game has a crazy number of things to do and specialize in. There’s combat (ship, player and creature), animal taming/breeding, building, crafting, farming, cooking, gathering, exploration, PvP, trading and even lore progression just to name a few. And there is a LOT of depth and detail to each of these subjects. The issues I mentioned though aren’t with these but with how little the game guides you in learning how each of these works. The very fact that I played for months before even learning about farming tames (like elephants gathering wood faster) is insane. No game should require hundreds and thousands of hours of gameplay just to learn its most basic features. In Atlas, you are literally dropped into the world with nothing but a brief floating skeleton head talking up your ear with exposition vomit…and that’s it! Head disappears and you are left to figure literally everything out. Throw in some informational NPCs at the freeport or something! Literally anything would help. Informative NPCs would actually be quite nice as the freeports feel incredibly empty.
For those who don’t know, the freeport is where players begin their journey after character creation. It’s usually on a simple harmless island with a very small little port village that has 5 or 6 NPCs in it and about 5 buildings (none of which serve any purpose as they don’t even contain an indoor option). Of the NPCs that are there:
1)	you buy npc crew from to help you sail
2)	you can give basic resources to get your first ship
3)	you buy skins, dye, ship cosmetics and some late game nonsense
4)	a seeds salesman for easier farming (so you don't have to search throughout the world for literal irl days)
5)	a resource exchange guy
6)	a fast travel guy (which is not always there depending on the port and server).
None of these provide any details or information for the player. There’s level and skill progression but even the descriptions of these skills in each skill tree are incredibly limited. The things you can craft and build provide little to no information as well.

I’m like 2 pages of writing in and I haven’t even touched on the game’s bugs/glitches. I won’t touch on this too much as I feel like everyone talks about it at this point. Admittedly, these have come a long way in terms of fixes but it took far too long to see any real change. There are still some game breaking issues occurring like getting stuck in the floor or getting caught in server loops (which requires a literal server Admin to help you out of). I’m happy they fixed the issue with your character’s offline body crossing regions but it REALLY should have been fixed a long time ago. Crashes are still very frequent and lag spikes can become a very serious problem in some of the worst settings. It likely wouldn’t be so devastating if this weren’t a survival game where you often risk losing everything in an instant. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve crashed while sailing or crossing regions only to come back and find my ship was destroyed and I’ve lost countless hours of work in an instant. Like I said though, I won’t go into it too much. I’m sure many other reviews can be more detailed about it than me.

Overall, I’ve had a pretty great time with Atlas. I’ve experienced nearly every perspective one can have. I’ve been part of large companies and small. I’ve risen to Alpha status on servers and I’ve played as simple side characters. I’ve done PvP, RP and PvE. I’ve quite literally mastered every skill, feature and aspect to the game no matter how complex or in-depth. I’ve built entire cities, Arenas, armies, castles, fleets and kingdoms. I’ve made life-long friends and joined gaming communities big or small from all around the world. I’ve done it all and I’ve mostly enjoyed everything Atlas has to offer…but the game is definitely dying. I doubt it will ever be big and the direction it seems to be heading isn’t one I’ll enjoy. For this reason, and other negative reasons I’ve given, sadly I can’t recommend the game to anyone. Not as it is now. Maybe it’ll improve or change when it leaves “Early Access”. Who can say? If it does, maybe I’ll come back and recommend it then.

Updating my review as it was outdated.

Since single player and dedicated servers have been implemented I can recommend the game. 

My original criticism of this game never being possible as a true MMO stand. Until they allow for guaranteed piece of land where your hard work can be kept safe this game won't be viable as a multilayer game. Even in PVE other players can be griefers.

Right now my fear is that this game is abandoned by devs - but even then it can be enjoyed as a single player game or private server game. And I hope devs return soon.

Lots of problems still (endgame not possible alone, empty world, risk overwhelmingly higher than rewards, etc... )

But its lots of fun to build up ships explore islands and get treasures and have true progression.

In the end I recommend for solo or co-op play.",1546258273,1636047056,False,0,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,True

I have to say that the Dev Team is doing an AMAZING jon on this game and the progress has been steady. Yes, this game is in early access so it has bugs and problems but that is exactly what early access is so dont let that sway you from trying it out. Those that are complaining about it being a broken game dont understand what early access is, the devs will get to fixing the bugs but they have an absurd amount of work to do so be patient with them.

     They have taken many of the ark concepts and reinvented them in fantastic new ways including a complete building rework among many other mechanics. Even the taming has been streamlined. To top it off you build your ships panel by panel in a shipyard and customize it how you like including painting and custom flags. Once finished you release the ship and higher some crewmates to set out onto the high seas. Besides a plethora of large islands to explore with pirate out posts and treasure chests to dig for there are many hazards and monsters in the high seas giving hundreds of hours of game play.

    All in all the Dev Team needs a shout out for what will be an absolutely fantastic game upon full release and I hope they continue to push forward with their vision. WAY TO GO GRAPESHOT! If you like pirates and survival games then this is a must have.

I launched game and there WAS NO PATCH CONTENT AT ALL. Ok, i thought, maybe that was just some announce, or smth like that. Then come my friends, and one of them just fall through textures. Firstly he couldn't walk in freeport city, then he couldn't walk anywhere. We tried to reinstall the game, search for this problem... No results. Then we start to play in pair - me and another friend, who could play with us. That was... good, until we found A FUCKING PIRATE UNDER TEXTURES, WHICH WE COULDN'T KILL. After that, our asses were burnt to ashes and we deleted this game.

The problem isnt the game itself or Inbalancing ect. Its starting out. When you start out you start out at a free port can get to a max level of 8. When you get your first ship. You will spend Hours upon Hours looking for an island to claim. Problem is THERE IS NO LAND to claim what so ever. This is because of the same exact LAND CLAIM abuse that so many players from ark have done. ANd it mostly on Official Servers. And about the Official servers theres only two thats right ONLY 2. One NA ONE EUR. So tell me whos bright idea was it to make only two official servers. I want to play the game and experience a Pirates Life. But i cant due to being stuck at a free port. Cause of land claim abuse by the same Large Clans / Companys. Its rediculous. You need to establish Rules ONE LAND CLAIM for one island and your company only builds on that ISLAND. Dont hog the whole map just to compete with other Large companys. ANd then exploit the new commers. In closing what also sucks about this game. Is that your either forced to join such a large company. Or Ally just to get a start. Or you are forced to buy your own server. Some people cant affoard to buy there own server. And some folks want to do there own thing. You cant force people to play a specific way or join pre existing clans. It drives people away And Kills the Immersion. Honestly devs. Change this stop the land claim abuse. Create New Official Servers. And enforce having only 1 land claim per a company so they can only own 1 island. If they cant abide by that and have to have a larger island or two. Then the choice is eathier move to the larger island give up the old one.

[h1] ATLAS REVIEW [/h1]

[hr][/hr] [h1] [📖] Analysis [/h1] [hr][/hr] 
ATLAS is a pirate-themed survival adventure that many regard to be “ARK Survival Evolved but with pirates”, which is a pretty accurate description as the games share the same engine, gameplay mechanics (give or take the ships), graphics and UI menus. The game’s somewhat bearable when you’ve got friends by your side to entertain yourself with - you can make clans, work to make large ships and explore the open seas together. Alone? Unless you’ve got Spotify at the ready or Netflix on a second monitor, this game will be one long boring chore to play. Each game follows roughly the same process - spawn in, grind up to some tools, grind up to get a boat, sail to another island and repeat and repeat.

Talking about islands, the map feels like some sort of joke from the developers. There’s no exploration to be had - each sector is just the same island copied and pasted over and over again, albeit slightly rotated to give the illusion it’s a different place. The fun is really zapped out of the game when you dock on the same island for the 20th time, ready to “explore” it again. The game suffers from a multitude of different lag spikes and glitches - items and ships can be broken or deleted and the game is very poorly optimised.

With no real objective or meaning to gameplay, incentive to continue on, NPCs to interact with and reasons to buy, this game is one of the worst on my steam profile. The promotional material is so misleading that this game is borderline a scam; the trailers lie and the devs seem really scummy for even allowing this game to be on sale. Shame on them.

This is disappointing; it could have been such a great pirate sim, however, it has just spent years in a purgatory hell of bad management, lies and deception. Unless you really have a thing for chores or you have a small army of friends to help pad out this game’s monotony, steer well clear!

While it does have some issues still and had a rough start, the game itself is unique in giving you the experience of building a ship from nothing and exploring the seas in a truly fantastical and mythical world! A fun and unique survival experience even if it does reuse the Ark engine.

That's not to say the game doesn't have bugs and/or issues, but if you can bear with them you'll definitely be able to get an amazing experience! 

I rate the game 7/10 at this point in time, I look forward to it getting better!

Update 1st December 2020:

The game has sadly taken a bad direction since my last review.
Horrible immersion breaking design choices have been made, such as gold being required to build a ship, and not a small amount but a massive one. It is utterly immersion breaking for your shipyard to demand 5k gold for a ship you're building yourself.

Update 8th October 2021:

Ok I think I've given this game enough time. It's been over a year and while some neat features have been added like rideable spiders and tameable yetis... Almost all new updates relates to the stupid tower system or the stupid modular ships. Such wasted potential.",1593711870,1633707088,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Old review:

I like it. I'm not fussed about the ""ooh it's ARK reskinned"" - there are a great many games out there that are sequels and rehashes of the same game code, this has been going on since computer games were fooking invented lol.

It's a variation on the ARK thing with ships, islands and treasure. At this point it's not well optimised but my frames (i5 4690k with GTX970) are not far off what I get on ARK, 40-60fps. The graphics are improved marginally over ARK, the building system appears to be improved over ARK, the skill tree system is different from ARK but works well for me. Your first experience in a Freeport at character creation, particularly if you are an ARK veteran, is going to make you think ""uuuurrggh"" rather than ""cooool"". But stick with that and when you get out on the sea and go exploring in what are pretty cheap to build starter ships (folks whining about grind to build the first ships are just lightweights who don't like the work/risk/reward loop that ARK is based on), that's when you'll be thinking ""cooool"".

However, the MMO aspects are problematic - they need to rip out the existing land claim system (and I've only been playing few days now since mega update, but it still isn't right), and do something siege-related like they had in EVE. Simply sticking in a non-pvp daily time limit isn't going to do it - they need a system where an established settlement is permanently non-pvp within its borders, but can then be forced into a pvp state (and thus conquerable) through external actions like blockade running, pve victories within the settlement locale, espionage etc. I also, sadly, understand Wildcard to be a lazy, money grabbing and mostly incompetent company so we may wait some time before they figure this or something as useful out, if ever.

Anyways - I expect that stuff to be fixed somewhere down the line if they want this to work. As it stands, I'm recommending it, simply because, speaking as a solo player, building a ship and setting sale, interacting with established settlements, finding a quiet lawless island to put up a small shipyard (even if it will inevitably get wiped), is all cool. You still need to get to a certain level of skill before it gets to be real fun and less grindy than you like, but that's ARK/ATLAS. I picked it up on the mega-update sale for £11 and that'll do in terms for value for money. If you like ARK and tall ships, but can approach it with an open mind, give it a whirl.",1556096324,1633219093,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This game is always my go back to game when I get bored of all the other crap out there.
Atlas had a terrible start, but it's pretty damn amazing now, and the mods have a lot to do with it.

One of the many great things about this game is, it makes use of the whole map for resources and gameplay, not making the common mistake most games make where you start at the bottom and move up the map and never go back to previous locations for any reason, and then once you reach the top you are done.

My only real complaint about the game is the melee combat is crappy like Ark (cuz it is mostly Ark).
If they changed the melee combat in this game, it would destroy every other game out there in this genre!
Creatures knock you back and bounce you around way too much, and the time it takes to swing your weapons is slow and doesn't feel right.  Ranged is fine the way it is though.

Other then that, playing in a Private server with game improvement mods, and friends, against challenging wild pirates that setup camps all over the place, while you try to survive, building everything you use, and hunting or taming creatures, and battling bosses is fantastic!

The lazy convex collision on most of the terrain objects is unacceptable considering it would only take maybe 30s longer to make an accurate collision object.

Edit: 3 days after launch they have spent the entire time working on it and barring the known problems an alpha would experience during launch this game plays really well and has the pirate theme and gameplay in a way no other pirate game has yet to date...you really fee like a pirate with the struggle and fear of running into another pirate. Or you could run into a friendly trader, and make a few coins and get some resources. Basically this game feels like pirates.

Edit: Years after launch the game has barely improved. They add superfluous things like ""sea pylons"" and do nothing to prevent people from exploiting mechanics. The Community is the main problem, not the cut throat blood thirsty player base, That's what you want in a pirate game, no no I mean the rampant SJW trash that polices the discord and forums this game provides.

Starting off, I noticed this game, already having played ark and stuff I thought I knew what to expect. I gathered up my friends and we decided to have a nice game for ourselves, so we encountered the first wall, no dedicated servers.

After a brief discussion of possibilities and pros and cons, we decided to opt for a non-dedicated session. We wanted to have access to the whole map, didn't like the idea of playing with ping or having our stuff wiped, and a dedicated server for multiple sectors is expensive for our country. So we went with non-dedicated in spite of having a tether range of up to 3km (meaning we couldn't ever be in different islands).

And so off we start. Around 3 or 4 of us at first, we start at the first island with a few ups and downs, getting to know the vitamin system and other particular stuff exclusive to this game. We then noticed that the wiki's information is not consistent for single player mode (which is the mode used for non-dedicated servers). No biggie, we ain't pushovers so we can learn how to play. After a few hours of not finding metal we deduce that we have to buy a sloop at an npc and then we can set sail!

Boy oh boy did our opinion of the game skyrocket when we set sail. The open water is just beautiful, the waves, the movement of the boat and the different weathers, all stunning.

We got to a different island and gathered resources, we learnt about the skill system, we specialized in different branches and crafted our truly first ship. More friends joined, we easily reached 7 or 8 at all times and I was worried since the non-dedicated maximum players is 8.

We sailed across a few different islands, running from the army of the damned ships, trying to get sunken treasure and getting some coins for our next big boat, we were pretty excited here.

After a few treasures and pirate camps, we finally got to the first ship that costed gold coins. The quality of life skyrocketed and we were genuinely excited and having a lot of fun.

At this point we were noticing a few bugs. The diving attachment for the ship cutoff instead of tethering, the sleeping bodies of the afk players sometimes appeared at the feet of the host, beds were not always visible.

We got a few more gold coins and went to build the penultimate ship before the mighty galleon. We stopped at an island and started gathering resources and building the ship as we pleased. At this point we had noticed and repeatedly experienced the most infuriating bug yet. When a non-host player got attacked by a torpor-inducing attack (such as a snake's bite) and passed out, the game identified that as the player being offline. So the player experienced something akin to inexistence until they relogged twice.

We managed to push on and kept on building that brigantine, pouring a lot of time into getting for the finer details. We truly ended up with a really nice design and were all set to go into our last set of adventures today.

So, when I opened the game, I found myself floating in the middle of the ocean naked. Not a nice thing for someone struggling with thalassophobia mind you. But I was more enfuriated than scared, so I found out I was in an empty sector, with a map that didn't have even a single island, with my character but without any items, and the big 11x11 sectors map had become a single sector map.

So, in conclusion, do I recommend this game? No

A few thousand hours later and the game is broke more than before, we feel abandoned by the developers.  the last update broke the game further, Support tickets go unanswered and unresolved.  We heard from the devs regularly and now silence.

Tried the game since new devs took over, they turned a game with potential in to a sailing dumpster fire.  They still don't listen to their few remaining active players, gold for ships is about the dumbest idea they could come up with, and now with added modular ships that no one wants.  Islands are now plagued with mine, lumber, and stone collecting structures that leave no room for anyone to build a base let alone place these structures of their own.  Some beaches now have even more shipyards spammed to prevent anyone else from building.

I say trying because as a new player it it is not at all easy to progress, but not because the game is difficult, believe me it's not.  Atlas is a beautiful looking game just like Ark with the same game mechanics and why not it's the same company for both games.  At first I was excited to play a pirates style game with ships and building and exploration, but that's where it ends.... In the time I've been playing, I've seen nothing but empty servers with maybe 1 or 2 (sometimes 5) people on them.  There are also enough bugs in the game that it keeps crashing at least once or twice each time I've tried to play.  It's also very difficult for new players to explore and to treasure hunt because some players have figured out the spawn areas and place guns there to deter you from being on ""their"" island.  The first day I tried to play, I had to change my spawn region 8 times before I could find a place to get onto an island..... but then there are so many areas on the islands where hidden guns mow you down it's near impossible to have fun.  I know, people will say ""that's pvp"" but no that isn't.... nobody should be allowed to build their guns in an areas where people spawn at and nobody should be allowed to place guns in areas where treasure under the ground.  Even with few players on the servers there is a level of lag so I wonder how bad it would be if the servers were full.    PvE might be an option, but I don't enjoy a pve only game so for now this game is not recommended until some of the issues are taken care of.  The bugs, I can't explain as the text log is way to long.  The lack of players is probably due more to not only the bugs, but the game mechanics that turn new players away.... blocking spawn points should be illegal.",1629041204,1629041204,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The developers are focused solely on making this into a PVP game and ignoring what could have been a smash hit similar to Valheim.  A focus on exploration and PVE where you and your team sail the seas, explore interesting islands and build into better/bigger boats for your home base and combat could have been amazing.

To make matters worse, the private server model for this game is prohibitive.  to the cost of 1000s a month to replicate their 11x11 grid for PVE on public servers.  Some argue you can do a 2x2 grid and spend tons of time exploring, but this ignores a lot of what makes this game fun. questing, exploration and such.

You spend most of your time on this game farming resources and like such a small amount of time doing the fun shit with ships and taking into account how bad the launch was + how different the game is to what the trailer showed I can't recommend this game currently.

I thought to make a list of all the issues in the game that literally screw players which the players have constantly complained about but the dev's have not bothered to fix or acknowledge.

1: Bouys in the ocean completely stop resources spawning in it's radius (radius is very large)
2: Buildings stop rare resources spawning (such as metal gems etc) (once again within a certain radius) this results in on most islands were there are lots of claims and buildings having no resources.
3: Game optimization is terrible, I have a 1080ti with a i9-9900k and get 70-110 fps and sometimes drop below.
4: Game crashes quite often.
5: Animals especially the wolves, lions and crocodiles are completely over-powered and broken, they can kill you in a few hits, run way faster than you, have a shit ton of health and the lions can grab you and stop you moving which is death 95% of the time. The wolf and lions will stay near your body and have an agro rage of a couple of miles therefore you can't retrieve your loot most of the time.
6: Alpha animals despite being fun to try and kill shouldn't be so strong, especially the Alpha wolf/ Alpha lion for the reasons above with one shotting damage.
7: Animals such as the croc can hit you through walls/hit you while you are on your ship knocking you off despite you being like 5 metres above them.
8: Animals can glitch onto your boats.
9: Items sometimes vanish from inventory, randomly (items that don't decompose like food)
10: The dev's rollback the server mostly after every update which causes constant progress loss.
11: Ghost ships spawn way to frequent, despite the dev's stating they have reduce their spawn I have seen 7 in one area recently and basically they constantly destroy your ships and hard work. (They need severe restrictions)
12: Weapon damages are trash, 10 damage with a pistol against another player in PVP is stupid.
13: Melee weapons are near useless against animals that fight back making the majority of the skill tree for melee pointless.
14: The fucking Chinese are fucking retarded cunts that shouldn't play this game as all they do is spread like the damn plague claiming/destroying everything on NA/EU servers. This game was not supposed to have a Chinese player base however, like the plague, they spread into Western based games. On the bright side companies have banded together to get rid of the communists.
15: Freeport ping is high as hell.
16: Health of AI Animals is way to high, it shouldn't take 3 shots of a carbine rifle to kill a fucking crocodile. 
17: You spend hours maybe days building a galleon just to either have it destroyed in 20 mins either by the constantly spawning ghost ships or people offline raiding. The time to make/ time to destroy is really unbalanced.

Final major issue: My KEY issue is the game essentially just... stops with it's gameplay at a point. Once you sail the biggest ship (galleon) you sail to islands and engage in naval combat. Once the ship gets destroyed you have basically seen and done everything the game has to offer, nothing is left to do expect repeat the same things you have already done. If by some miracle your ship doesn't get sunk super quick you are just repeating the same things and going to new island which are basically copy and pastes of each other or just inverted.

Overall in it's current state this game is not what it was advertised to be + just to many issues to be fun/playable. You could see everything the game has to offer within 20 hours but with all the issues I have stated above it took me 77 hours.",1545555593,1628621482,False,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Worst game i've played in a long time.

Nothing really works. Can't dig up treasure because it always says the guardians you must kill first are still alive, though i kill them.

Game crashes a lot when loading into the next zone.

Beds rarely work, forcing you to Cheat Fly back to where you were.

Heat stoke kills you no matter how high your fortitude is or if your indoors or in the water, it just kills you.

drastic frame drops though my PC is so far above recommended specs. Lags on Ultra and lags on Low... (single player)

Guns don't hurt the pirates of the damned that guard treasure, forcing you to use only a crossbow...
The pirates will also sometimes burrow under ground as if you left the area though you didn't, you're still in mid combat with them, and fully heal themselves.

Sailing was an absolute joy for a few hours, until you have to literally spend 80% or more of the time you have to play today doing only that to get anywhere. Since it costs gold to build your own ship in order to go faster... WTF?

I am glad to get to be a part of this game's development. They finished ARK, and will finish this game as well. Not sure where all of these salt-miners came from, don't listen to them.

Edit 5/16/2021(Recommended): It's still got a very, very long ways to go. The community is generally disagreeable in my opinion, likely in large part because those who actually actively play it are understandably frustrated by the game's development progress: or rather significant lack thereof. It's incredibly slow, and there is considerable disagreement as to where it should actually be going, and PVE content is undoubtedly neglected. Keep in mind if you're thinking about buying this that the game has essentially morphed into a PVP-focused war on the seas between whichever tribes have the most people who can play the most amount of time. It sort of has the Rust problem, but exaggerated, since it's more of an MMO with official servers being the primary focus. I have yet to try community servers on this game though, however, they might offer different experiences and be decent- I don't know. In any case, if you're hoping to make it anywhere of note in this game with a group of friends- or god forbid as a solo player- don't bother at the moment. In it's current state, the game is heavily dominated- economically, landwise, and militarily- by Chinese-only mega-factions which play for the most amount of time and have the most active members, putting them on top. It's just the way it sort of is for the most part at the time being. I think this game still has a chance, but I recommend giving it time to cook further, have more updates and content, hopefully more balancing- for PVE/RP too- and a whole lot more fixes. After which, when the update cycle settles and the game has a more cohesive and less turbulent state, modded community servers might become a very interesting and viable environment to explore in the game.

Edit 8/2/2021(Not Recommended):
Updates have become incredibly slow- more sparse than before- with severely limited content, and what changes and additions are made are highly odd and questionable- things which seemingly nobody asked for, and which don't improve the game. None of the game's major, glaring, fundamental problems which have been present since launch- or that have been introduced since- have been fixed to any real degree. Currently, I would not recommend purchasing the game in its current state with its uncertain future. I am not as hopeful for this game's development as I was, only disappointed.",1545591688,1627959239,False,1,0,0.504950463771820068,1,True,False,True

1. There are some MAJOR bugs still, like every time you log off your shipyard disappears, and you have to rebuild it which takes many thousands of resources. You also get the rare crash which exacerbates the problem.
2. The vitamin system is a horrific idea, and makes the game almost unplayable. On top of a good food system like ARK, they've added a stupid vitamin system that is so tedious to manage that it's easier to literally eat crap and die whenever the vitamins get low than it is to try to manage them. This also completely invalidates the entire cooking system since nearly everyone takes this easier approach, as the game would be completely unenjoyable otherwise.

I play locally on a solo host where my family sometimes joins. I loved ARK, and likewise I love this game with the exception of the above mentioned problems. I can easily see myself dumping several hundred hours in the game just like I did with ARK.

Pros:
1. You get to be a pirate (or at least a freelancer if you're like me and play mostly solo)
2. The boats are quite enjoyable, and they are customizable
3. It's fun to search for treasure, or risk life and limb salvaging wrecks
4. Taming animals is great, just like ARK
5. The water physics are pretty cool, and it makes the ships much more immersible
6. You can hire crew to help man your sails, and manage your ship
7. You can setup automated resource gathering

Cons:
1. Bugs, bugs, bugs. Did I mention bugs? Losing your shipyard every time you log out is the worst in my opinion. I've almost rage quit because of this
2. The vitamin resource management system will literally make you want to kill yourself. Seriously, it's the worst idea I've ever seen in an MMO, and I actually like survival games. At least give us a way to turn it off! Oddly they do allow you to turn off the much better hunger / thirst mechanic that ARK has. I'd much rather just use that system.
3. Lack of official PVE servers is why I play solo. I have always disliked PVP as I don't like dealing with griefers
4. Related is a low player base, so there's not much interaction anyway. My sister plays on a public server and she says that she never runs into anyone so it's almost like being on a solo server, but with a little more lag",1627951906,1627951906,True,1,0,0.499624580144882202,0,True,False,True
834910,96834813,76561198121240641,0,1,1922,0,1922,1627233655,"TL;DR: Servers are the main downfall of this game. Either they're too crowded and therefore unplayable/unenjoyable or they gouge you for the whole game experience.

Was looking forward to this game as my friends and I are big fans of both Ark and Sea of Thieves. However, upon purchase we find that the game only has three main servers, 2 PvP and 1 PvE. The servers are PACKED. On the PvP server that we first tried, the spawn points are already taken over by enemy player bases. As in, you are INSIDE their base and can't get out. Sometimes, you are simply trapped within the floor or a wall itself and can do nothing until you die and respawn. There is no /stuck, /killself, or /respawn commands. You spawn in a bad spot, sucks to suck. 
The PvE server we tried spawning in one of the NPC starter town areas and we did well for ourselves until we reached the level cap of 8 or 9. The game won't let you level more until you ""get out and explore!"" which means by boat, which you can build or buy if you're buy a town. 
So, got a boat and went out to find a plot of land to call our own. Well.... good luck with that. Every island we came across hoping to be able to claim some spot to build a base has already been claimed by other groups, which is normal I guess but  they are packed so tightly together with so much stuff that the lag was immense even before we reached a landing spot. It lagged even the hardcore players' computers. The lower tier computer players couldn't even function and some had to even log out while we were around the island. Oh! Also, you can't anchor your ship in somebody else's territory so we had to anchor far out into the ocean and risk sharks and manta rays to reach shore to ""discover"" it. 
And here lies the problem... remember that level cap I mentioned before? A measly 8 or 9? well, you can't increase that cap unless you step foot on another island and thus ""discover"" it. Tough to do with lag and the crowededness. Since some of our players couldn't even keep logged in around the islands, they couldn't ever get on to them so they couldn't get an increase to their level cap. 
SO.... private server, right? Atlas's server page advertises a server rental site called Nitrado so we went there and purchased a server. Fairly cheap, like a little over 12 bucks or so. We start out on a little island and can right away start building our base and boat. .... until we hit the level cap again. No biggie, we'll just sail out and find all the islands we want since we have our own server. .... Except... Well, Atlas has a huge map. A HUGE map with only a slight loaded screen to move from one area to another. These ""areas"" are apparently servers and when we rented a server on Nitrado we rented ONE server. As in, one square of the huge map. For us, like one large(?) island and two smaller ones. 
We thought it had to be a mistake, but no, this is how they do it. To get access to the entire map you have to buy a server for each square of the map. When we looked it up, it was well over $200. A month. FOR A GAME YOU ALREADY PURCHASED!!!! 
So, you either deal with the crowded, unplayably-laggy main servers, or you give over you paycheck to be able to play it on your own.

Edit(almost after 5000 more hours:

What you see up is practically still same. Only thing that changed is that ppl are abusing META and its breaking gameplay. Players are leaving game there was couple of questionable updates that broke what was almost fine. 

Game can still be saved if they start listen to player who actually playing game and for change fix some stuff.

Current status:
Building - Amount of structures ppl are dropping to be safe on their island is causing disaster Lag

Land PVP - Cheese tactics making land PVP no fun (barrels, 1 hit knockouts, perma stun, 1 hit kills)

Sea PVP - Currently because of barrels its super easy to sink enemy boats so companies are afraid to sail out.

As I said before game can still be saved in some aspects, but definily wont reach ARK playerbase. Most of the stuff can be fixed just by changing values. Lets hope that they will start listening and do some decent changes.

I get that this game is more focused on sailing but it would be nice if there were continents as well as better land designs. Also travelling between islands can literally take hours on the larger map if you have far to go. Recommending this game because it delivers on the sailing/ship part which I feel is the main point.

Sadly, none of the numerous devs or community managers (who join the team and then left shortly after) actually play the game, and so they half ass develop the game blindly, making asinine changes that nobody wants, with the least possible effort. Would be to nice to recommend, but the community managers are non existent, and the so called devs are putting their fingers in their ears then saying ""blah blah blah can't hear you just gimme your money you stupid people"". 

There's been so many stupid updates that the community does not want, and only sometimes do these devs finally revert their stupid half assed changes after weeks and weeks of complaints. But then they make another stupid update.

Then hopefully the game dies just after some actually capable devs see what was possible and are actually capable to make a game that isn't just a concept, and these angel devs from another completely unrelated company make a game that is actually decent and give me back 5k hours of my life.

Dumpster fire of a game, and these crook ""devs"" just gonna keep scammin'

Even if not talking about the 'game', the servers that run the game are a joke. These ""devs"" pay as little money as possible to people who provide servers, which ofcourse makes your game llag, but they also make a game that will  lag on the most expensive servers on earth so it doesnt matter what servers they use.

After almost 60 hrs game play i got no glitches or crashes which is what any hard core gamer would expect from any game and this game has it ALL pirating, breeding, harvesting, building, ship battles, construction, fishing and much more this is a game you can truly get your teeth into as there is so many aspects to this game to keep you busy for months maybe years as it is a game you will become addicted too and you will be ending up with loss of sleep playing this game.

This game as a little like (Ark) but this game is a step above ark in my view i have played Ark for many months but i prefer this game for many reasons unlike ark the creatures in this game won't attack you unless you attack them first which i prefer as it allows you the ability to explore in safety some creatures will attack you on sight such as sharks and a few others so it's like 50/50 some will and some won't.

this game is still in early access so there maybe some DLC packs to look forward to in the future but this game has come a long way since it's launch and this game will be around for many years to come.

I only can see 5 downside issues to this game listed below

1/ The Developers needs to do something about dying because of heatwaves or intense heat and balance it more better so you have a better chance of surviving and not dying every time when a heat wave hits i am sure back in those days in real life they never always died because of the weather.

2/ I feel the devs should make it possible to sell items for gold to the NPCs (Traders) in port cities instead of the player having to throw many items away after you dig up a chest or sell resources you have harvested just another way of making gold.

3/ Would be nice to see people (NPCs) walking about the ports to give the game a more better look of life and look as if there is some kind of activity in the ports.

4/ A inn with (NPCs) inside drinking and eating and singing songs and a female dancer to give it some life and a inn that you the player can enter with rooms with a bed that you can rent from the inn keeper for the night for 1 or 2 pieces of eight meaning gold lol

5/ A (NPC) in ports that you can buy training skills from with gold to level up your player more easy and quickly and with every skill purchased the price increases.

These are just some of my own views but in no way makes this game less enjoyable to play

if i discover anything else i will amend my preview and update it but for now that's all i can find

we need to keep in mind this is still in early access and is being updated often with new things and improvements and i hope the devs will consider my views and hopefully implement them into this game as i am sure it would boost the sales of this wonderful game as when they add more npcs doing activity even just walking around the ports it will give a more human like to this game and not make you feel you are the only person on this planet ALONE.

- The game is buggy (hence why it's still in early access).
- It takes way too much gold to build ships, especially the bigger ones, which makes it very difficult to have fun when trying to play the game right to get all the gold necessary to build these ships. Would be  a lot easier with help from other people but I like to play solo.
- Once your ship gets damaged (which it will) it can be difficult to try and figure out what exactly is wrong with it especially if you play solo.
- Some game-play mechanics used just doesn't make any sense (maintaining a certain vitamin level when you eat, the mini-game you play when you reload, etc).
- Taming animals is more difficult than what it should be (just my own personal opinion, not sure others see it that way).

Pros:
- Playing with friends isn't necessary but it does help.
- You can build your own ships and add your own creative touch to them (to some extent)
- Giant map with lots of places to explore (I personally haven't even explored half the map, it is HUGE).
- Very similar to ARK so if you love that game then you should give this game a shot.
- There are many animals you can tame, but there could be more. 

Overall, the game isn't perfect by all means, but if you love pirates, ARK, and AC4 Black Flag, then you'll probably enjoy this game too. If you don't want to play a game with a lot of bugs (most are just annoying, some are game breaking) then you can save your money and wait for the full release of the game (if that ever happens).

What it doesnt mean is a game so incomplete that it is not really playable. Nearly three years after release when it is still not playable is a total failure of anyone who works on this game. Give up! You failed! You do not have the skills to produce an actual game! Please never release anything else and die 50 years from now with this game still being a complete failure! If Valve has any care for their customer base, please never allow this developer to put anything else on your market. If anyone from this developer goes somewhere else, they are also banned from the market. I understand the need for small developers to release games not quite done because of money issues. A garbage game three years after release that is completely unplayable, is a lifetime ban from the market for them and anyone who takes on anyone from this team. Get a hold of your market!

Stop with updates of new ships and other things when your base game does not function! Stop! Stop with the lies that one day it will. It wont! You failed so badly that giving up on life itself is really an option. Screw hiding on the internet. As a boss myself, I'd say this straight to their faces with no regret.

By June 2021.

edit: i know the devs laugh at my idea but they are in a downward spiral when it comes to their official servers the paying to build your own ship from your own shipyard is kinda stupid because that means you basically have to have  like 5-6 ramshackles to do anything and you can be sunk way too easily instead they could have made it where you could build ships and make it ai controlled to patrol around the zone you are in plus surrounding zones and  shoot enemy companies ship, hunt ships of the damn and, dive into ship wrecks",1555445848,1624539404,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,True

Official is rampant with cheaters dupers and chinese zergs. They invade your island at 4 am and you cant fight them because you have 300 ping. But the devs wouldnt know that because they don't pvp or play the game at all.

They never added new ships/weapons etc. The ones they did add are completely useless especially the ""ramming ship"" Since they added tradewinds its nicer but ships are still so very slow because they could care less about fixing speed sails which have been broken since the dawn of the game. Meta used to be mythic handling sails but they got nerfed into the ground because the devs again dont play the game and dont understand that it takes literal hours and hours to travel. For the casual playerbase its a killer.

The original agreement that I agreed to when I purchased the game is the only agreement they should be forcing me to make. To disable the game unless I make a new agreement seems like theft of my game!

first you cant play this game solo unless you install some third part software that gives you a map with the islands.. othervice you will just a world with only ocean.. that sucked..  thought the most important part of game development would be to get the world to actually be there for the player.. 

I would say that compared to ark the skilltrees were the highlight. combat, weapons and armor are just like ark.. one hit and you are dead.. unless you have the plate armor.. sure in ark its understanding if a Rex bites you but a pig? 

the pirate camps seemed way to hard for a few scrappy items.. 8 pirates with about 300+ health each.. some even spawn underground so you cant get to them.. managed to survive 2 shots from them before i died.. your melee weapons deals way to little damage..  

i looked forward for the revolver and once tested you get this expression in your face ""WTF?"" the damage sucked ofc.. 

tried to manage the ship solo.. that a pain in the assss.. run to the mast bring up the sail or adjust its rotation, run to the cannon hope you can shot once, oh shit need to steer more to the right, run to the rudder and adjust, oh crap need to adjust the sails again.. oh the cannon..  so yeah that sucked.. 

the halfway positive thing i can say about this game is the farmhouse, quarry, mine and lumberjack.. the buildings that collect stuff for you.. but yet again i was disappointed.. you need 200meters between the buildings or they wont place.. so my planed village was my house and a farmhouse.. and a few buildings scattered on the island.. so yeah that sucked.. 

i managed to get to lvl 51, with capped HP at 300 (yeah i know, that SUCKS) build some, get some treasure, get my ship sunk and more. i wonder if the devs has even tryed to play this game solo.. 

i mean where is the balance? because there is no such thing in this game.. 
i realy gave this game a try with 23hours of game time.. or pain time to be more accurate.. 

devs ffs, try this game solo and please try to get the biggest ship, and go out there and kick ass.. 
i bet they realize the agony and wont even try.. game sucks.. 
on a scale from 0 to 10 i would give this game a solid -9  yeah the skilltrees were nice..

After adding numerous hours of play to this game, I'd like to add a bit more detail to my review.

Given that this game is in early access, it's definitely expected for some zany or annoying glitches to happen, so those will be looked on with some leeway because I know the devs are working dilligently to patch and fix them as quickly as possible.

With that in mind, here are some pros and cons of the game that have made it either enjoyable or irritating:

Pros:

1) Great graphics 10/10 - A lot of the time, it looks like you're holding actual weapons or items in your hand. The devs did well with this. The graphics are outstanding and well beyond expected.

2) Building freedom 7/10 - This game allows for you to build and customize your base however you see fit with the only limitation being that it must fit around the surrounding terrain because terrain cannot be manipulated.

3) Sailing Accuracy 8/10 - This game has semi-realistic sailing animations and movement.

Cons:

1) Animal combat 2/10 - Animal combat against predator animals is exceptionally jarring and can be downright irritating at times. It is currently at the point where a level 1 wolf can kill a level 30 player if they manage to catch that player off guard when they attack. The animals attack too quickly and cause such jarring movements that it is difficult to react to them in time in order to save yourself from death.

2) Alpha Spawning 1/10 - Alpha can and will most often spawn in too high a number and too often. They take too little damage making them exceedingly difficult to kill, and can basically one-shot any player that they set their sights upon to attack. Even typically non-aggressive animal will become aggressive if they have an alpha tag attached to them causing them to just outright attack a player unexpectedly and without warrant or reason other than ""hurr durr, I'm am alpha, get rekt, kid. Lol.""

3) Ghost Ships 0/10 - Ghost ships spawn entirely too often and often in too high a number making avoiding them 99% improbable, especially when you sail into a new server and 3 of them spawn right on top of you. This makes it incredibly easy to lose an entire day's work put into building a ship just for it to end up getting destroyed. We get it, devs. The sea is haunted. Chill it the fuck out.

4) Storms 3/10 - The storm events are neat, don't get me wrong, but they're unrealistic. Storms should be considered isolated incidents, not server-wide fuckery. If you're out at sea and a storm spawn around it, it's highly unlikely that you and your sea-farring vessel are going to survive it as no matter which direction to attempt to go, more and more spouts/hurricanes will constantly spawn in front of you. Coupling this with the endless amount of ghost ships, and you get a combination that makes it almost impossible to survive at sea in what is supposed to be a game centered around sailing.",1545665495,1624222027,False,0,0,0.472330868244171143,0,True,False,True

  I purchased the game as a pre-order and dealt with the really rocky start that was launch.  After several days I was finally able to get into the game and I was amazed by the beauty of the world the developers had designed.  The colors were vibrant, the ocean effects were beautiful, and sailing was a true joy. I spent countless hours just sailing around the ocean enjoying the mechanics.  After several weeks, I found a few like-minded people people to play with and it really took off from there. We started a local trading company specializing in tames and deliveries for long hauls others didn't want to make. We helped out with supplies during a few of the first Kraken fights on the server, circling the area with a crew of repairmen, fishing others out of the sea and delivering sailors to ships still afloat as needed. Then ""season 1"" ended.

  Season, what a sad term.

  The first wipe came and our company disbanded, most lost interest on the game after losing nearly a year of progression. I then tried out a fairly large private server cluster, anchorbabies RIP, and had nearly another year of enjoyment, and then another ""season"" ended and caused or progression on private to wipe to implement new systems added to vanilla. After that I took a hiatus.  I came back for a bit to try out blackwood, and it was riddled with bugs and basic features, and it felt as if the map was added by one of the developers children just to show ""Hey, we can add maps."" This map is still to this day in the same state it was at release. 

  Soon after, the development shifted and the game lost track of what it wanted to be. They started adding piecemeal systems that made no contribution to the problems the community was reporting. Then they made quite a few rather questionable changes to core systems that weren't broken to begin with, when a simple numerical tweak over time to balance would have worked.  The map kept changing, season to season, into something that was more copy pasta than actual world building. Gone were the hours of discovery of finding new islands.  I admit that in the beginning they did reuse a bit of the islands, but recently nearly every grid i sailed to had at least one of the same islands as the previous, and then mirrored as you crossed the prime meridian. Then came added gold costs to ships, automated buildings, etc etc. 

I could go on and on about how the game started vs how it is now and where it is headed, but im sure many of you probably feel either the same way or look at this as ""omg book, cant read, oh look a tree....."" and i respect everyone's opinions just the same in that regard. I'm simply saying that I this game has lost its identity from when it was started, and the path it's headed down now doesn't feel right. Honestly I wish i could roll this game back to the first map and features and fix the foundation from there, because no matter how many ""features"" or ""innovations"" to game play you add, if the core is broken, the game is too.",1622472480,1624130077,False,252,3,0.930240809917449951,26,True,False,True

The game is less glitchy than at launch, yet there's one thing that really doesn't work, the combat. Lock on based combat with a list of moves on the side wasn't the best choice IMO. it's janky and even broken at time. I even explored to the endgame regions to know what I was missing, and it was just hundreds of undead ennemis waiting there in a, quite cool looking castle (that was sadly copy pasted on all 10 islands of the boss region). The bosses were unpolished and broken. 

Quick time events to load a gun, not very fun. Also the need to repair every individual piece of a ship, which can be from 2- ~100 is super tedious and unfun, especially that with the water damage system, it won't take long before you need to repair it again.

The realism is abit too strong on the game, but I was able to live with it


But now, for the reason why I disliked the game so much. The ship of the damned. I think that AI ships are a good idea, but 1-4 per square on the map is far too much. Those ships are always lurking around ready to kill every ship that isn't equipped with a row of cannons (basically any players under lv 50). It's comparable in Ark to Rexes spawning instead of raptors everywhere. You can kill them eventually, but it'll take you time and a lot of grind.

I enjoy many aspects of the game...the shipbuilding, resource system, discoveries, treasure hunting, to name a few. However, the travel time is simply too much. I'm not opposed to slower-paced games...hell, I played Naval Action and spent an entire weekend just going from Charleston down to Cartagena, but the time spent traveling in Atlas just EATS up the majority of my play experience to the detriment of actually feeling like I'm playing. You need to travel for different kinds (and different types within each kind) of resources. You need to travel to get certain species of animals. You need to travel for treasure maps. And in addition to all that, especially if you're on an official server because of nodes always being loaded in combined with base resource generation and decay, you're CONSTANTLY having to upkeep food and gold to keep what you've managed to acquire going. Between the upkeep tasks and traveling (in some cases 4+ quadrants, 8 round trip in a night), I barely got a chance to just play and explore and actually feel like I was making much progress. That ends up really running counter to the exploration many of those features were obviously meant to promote. 

I may go back to the game at some point on an unofficial server with value tweaks, but even then I'm not even sure ship speeds are something modifiable, and I really think the devs need to add in some sort of system to speed up travel (a minigame, maybe, involving the masts that would allow speed boosts and also give other players on board something to do other than try to hook flotsam?) Some great concepts, just not all there in execution, and the server is so huge that hosting a private server to tweak to your liking is cost prohibitive ($50/month for a 4x4 grid).

EDIT: 5/15/21

The tradewinds update has improved travel somewhat, but since they decided to make it a strategic feature rather than a convenience feature it's still very hit or miss whether it will actually help you get to where you're going quickly. As a result, a large portion of your in-game time stands to be boring time at sea between quadrants. The game is also still buggy as hell, some of which have been broken and known about for literally years. Issues with building superstructures on ships, crew pathing, crew limits, ships ladders, etc. Overall still a game I'd like a ""neutral"" rating for.

EDIT: 6/7/21

Got Atlas to join a few close friends but to check how it's running I first started Singleplayer.
Ended up in a literal ENDLESS OCEAN.

No land, no resources, instant death no matter which way you go.
I googled it, saw a lot of people have this problem recently because the map got reset to what it SHOULD be, which it obviously is not. Even Professional IT people who tried to game could not fix it, as restarting the world did not fix anything!

The entirely of Singleplayer is BROKEN AS IT CAN BE! No respawn places and I even Cheated in a Tamed Dolphin with maximum speed to SCOUT FOR LAND in a very rapid pace cheated at [cheat speed 5] or whatever it was called, after 10+ attempts of RESPAWN!

Then I went on Multiplayer which at Day 1 went relatively well, but afterwards with my Company things did not go well, I went offline inside of the ship, walled in at all sides and I woke up to sleep with the fishes upon rejoining! This I found out was just the beginning as in the end if your Company does not help you it means you will just pick your nose living on Atlas and DIE, the mining business I opened in my noseholes gave me more Gold Coins than anything else I could do on Atlas you are forced to rely on others which makes even PvE highly tedious, let alone PvP.

I admit going in it, slightly biased considering I have played ARK: Survival Evolved since the Diplodocus first came out (v241 or v242) and I remember the controversies, but in the end I came there to have fun with those I care about, and how is it FUN if your Raft build by your Company GLITCHES INTO THE MESH TURNING INACCESSIBLE BY ANYONE!

Ignoring the Lion and Tiger are just a Discount Sabertooth, ignoring an Elephant just is a Discount Mammoth, ignoring some promises made for ARK was never realized in ARK just in Atlas (Specific berries comming from specific plants as example) and even IGNORING copy pasted reused textures.

The major issues are, NO MAIN SINGLEPLAYER MAP, EASY MESHING EXPLOITS, GLITCHED OUT BOATS, I knew ARK could be buggy but holy f-cking sh!t! Atlas is a massive mess, and allowing comments for Wildcard F-ck boys to disagree with me if they please!

I loved the game ARK a ton, spend over 8,000 hours into that game despite the issues it has, so don't think I have no clue how to play Atlas either, I can Google, watch YouTube videos and Play games very well myself with ease! I just spend a -50% DISCOUNT on this game just to leave this damn review after playing it close to a full day!

My advice, don't bother buying this mess of a game, let me tell the a couple of names more suitable for it than ATLAS:

ARK: Glitching Evolved
ARK: Meshtastic DLC
ARK: Unpolished
ARK: Retextured
ARK: Resold

If you choose to give it a shot, embark yourself on a loving and carefree journey of losing your temper, your shits and your sanity unable to do ANYTHING without ANY help of others as well as knowing your age is ticking away as well in game as it is in game spending time wasting it which could be spend doing things that actually matter instead like giving your cat a compliment she'd be looking feline today.

Remember, while in game your age is ticking away..... you die, respawn losing your shit, in real life, your age too, is ticking away but there is no respawning there.

Make it count and tell your favorite people, pets, or internal cells you love them.

The ship building mechanic and the ship play its self is also a new feature and reflects how the game as moved away from creature based play. Some new survival features are in the game compared with Ark. Overall if you and a group can get past the learning curve its fairly fun. Does that mean you can't solo? No, but be prepaired for a slow start then. Even the ships can be solo'd if you get some gold and food for an AI crew.

2021 Edit Line: Above this line was a positive review, now it has become negative till the game shows improvement.

Dev Q&S 10:

""What are some strategies you're working on for long-term player retention?

Improving the game. Seriously. We are trying to build a game where you want to gather a bunch of friends and try to carve out your place in the world and compete against other companies. That's the sort of game you can play with people for years and still have fresh experiences.""

Cons:
       Would have been nice if you guys had been worried about this during the first 6-7 months of the game's life when the game had a lot of people on it and not actively shot the player base in the knee-caps constantly. Like making the seas LITERALLY unsailable for a week more then once! Or that time you all buffed the damage of a wolf bite when it was already a 2-3 bite kill to anyone with no/little armor to be basicly 1 bite 1 death! Making ships cost gold to build if your building the whole thing from scratch because you think people are spending too much time on islands and not enough time on the seas hunting gold! Not adding an Asia region Official server to avoid super large amounts of lagging players on either the NA or EU servers and give them an area to play lag free (Remember, this is the reason for not merging the EU and NA servers)! Changing the land claiming system to something a large part of the community showed displeasure at.. Making this game as more of a multi-game set base system for other games other then pirate/age of sail stuff (points at WWII tank assets that were spawned in during the Admin Password Leak that mostly ended the popular time the game had).

If you all ACTUALLY thought before throwing something into the game and listened to what the players want more of and had worked towards that at the start you would have not been in the place you had ended up in. Less making game you want to play and more about making a game the player base wants to actually play. This game at the start was pretty fun, the dev were SUPER active with working on the game, mostly to the chagrin of the player base. Now is seems like they are working slowly to do anything now that the player base is mostly chased off by them.

Now, the devs claim they have been working on mostly back end stuff to allow a whole new set of shipbuilding mechanics in a few months so they might be forgiven for lack of bug fixing if this new system is going to change so much back end stuff. However, the version of the game that follows that update MUST have fewer bugs then what the current Version has as a base line for this now Negative review to go back to positive.",1574623324,1622961575,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has its bugs and has plenty of them, thats a fact and some would say an under statement.

The game plays a lot like ark but with a much larger world. Official servers can be very toxic much like Ark.
I run my own server that is cross-play (xbox and PC) and we are non toxic.
The game offers more than ark in the sense of PvE.
Keep in mind how long Ark was in Early Access.
This game is much larger and likely experiences tons more bugs than its previous.
With that being said. 
On unofficial servers this game can be extremely fun and addicting. As long as the server owner knows what theyre doing with the server (adds all content etc..).
I play on my server Krakens Keep and truly enjoy the time with friends and the experience the game allows.
The bugs can get overwhelming on occasion but over all I would recommend the  game to others to simply make it better in the long haul.

Think ARK Survival, but with prehistoric animals as Macrauchenia and woolly rhinos. Same type of gamers that strategically build their forts making it impossible to actually explore... *sigh*

It won't let me play single player... unless I choose the Ocean world... where there's only water and lots of sharks that will kill you... Now my character swam like h*ll but it's no use - there's no land!

The official servers... well... Somehow... I keep spawning inside a box or under someone's floor or something that I can't get out of... And basically all other servers are PVP... 

The game launches about 50% of the time for me... When it does launch there's another 50% chance I can get on a server... and so on...

So when I finally get in the game... After it not launching - not letting me play - not letting me make a character... etc... well here's how it goes...

I barely get to live pass a few days... if I got into the water - something killed me. 
If I was in the sun - I died from that... 
If I didn't kill something to get hide for clothes - I would die from cold... 
If I killed a bird and accidentally swung the axe wrong direction and hit an other animal level 19 - yup I'd die... 
If I did manage to get clothes, a fireplace, food - I'd die from thirst....
Now If I'm still alive by this point - I get killed by the other players...

Like with Ark I don't play the official multiplayer maps, but the one thing that's bothering me is is after a update today (5/27/21), my single player game on the Ocean map was bugged forcing me to delete the data.  Every time I try to load up a new game in single player on the Ocean map there were no islands in sight and it did not give me the option to spawn on an island. Then I tried to play on the Blackwood map but the game didn't even bother loading it and sent me to the home screen.

It is basically ARK on ships. Taming, breeding and all that good sh** from ARK in the same package mixed with huge ships and a giant world to explore or well, actually just one world connected in a 11x11 grid, which means 121 regions (different servers on the same cluster) of the same size that you can travel between similar to ARK's server transfers except this happens much faster with less loading screens and less loss of character. 

ATLAS is a perfect game if you like either PVE or PVP, there's a lot of stuff to do in the world, either you can go for max exploration (visiting all of the 400 something islands) or you can do one of the two bosses on easy or hard, where easy is actually not so easy if we compare to ARK bosses which are basically not bosses if we compare in difficulty. I compare with ARK there because ARK is in the same category of genre, as well as being the official Big Brother of ATLAS because same engine, same devs behind the concept.

If you liked/.. loved ARK, but you feel like there isn't enough to entertain yourself in that game anymore, then ATLAS is most likely going to blow your mind as well. It is a fantastic game, time consuming like ARK so if you have the time, and the patience - ATLAS is going to feel like perfect for you. 

ATLAS is in Early Access, there is tons of bugs, glitches and what not but nothing that really stops you from playing. It can get kind of annoying if you lose your 50-100k gold ship due to a invisible rock or something so you lose a lot of planks and sink.. But it is repairable and not impossible - Been there, done that so to say. If you ever played DayZ, then the term ""get dayzed"" might be familiar to you, and we have that on ATLAS as well. There is things that will kill you, but there is also things that will make you laugh because of how broken or glitchy it is. 

All in all, a perfectly normal Early Access. I understand that there is people, people who think Early Access means perfectly ready for release or whatever.. Just read what Early Access means before you complain. The game has flaws, it isn't perfect but it is really fun to play, with every season I play I learn something new, or I just do something different and I expect different results.. Eh.. Yeah, I know, that's the description of insanity if we remember the famous quote from Far Cry 3 or whoever coined that term. I know it isn't what to be expecting of it, but I expect different results from every new fresh wipe season  I play because the game changes, there is game updates that break things, updates that surprisingly fixes things as well as content updates that completely changes the META and how you evolve with it.

The devs had some kind of quiet moment between 2019 and 2020, but I think they replaced the whole dev team squad.. Or something? I just know that lately, or well, since summer of 2020 - there has been an increasing amount of changes and updates to the game which tells a story of how Covid-19 can change stuff for the better even in darker times I suppose.. 
""Work at home, get stuff done?"" Seemingly is the only thing that makes sense here.. I don't know what changed, but the devs stepped up their game completely and I am happy for it, very happy. The community managers and what not seems to also step up their game, to bring news and such almost on par with ARK itself. Sure,there is flaws, but the devs seems to focus and get stuff done.

I got my moneys worth out of the game because i played early in beta. If i had purchased the game after the gold cost was added to ships i would have asked for a refund.

Addition:
To those who keep trying to blame all the problems they are having on explosive barrels, you should learn to defend against them and stop complaining to the devs. It's one of the last things in the artillery tech tree for a reason: it's supposed to be over powered. It's also a gold sink and can only be launched from catapults now due to your whining. Sadly, it's mainly the megas doing the whining too.


---- Original review below -----

I know it's in EA right now so I'm expecting a few issues and bugs in the game. My biggest issue is that you can freeze to death in a tropical area with several fires going around you, and the debuff will not go away--for any reason. I wasn't wet, my clothes weren't wet, and I had three fires going around me while I was trying to navigate a raft back to an island because I was tired of dying from freezing. Once I got close enough to drop anchor, I did, and immediately logged out. 

As I said, I get that there are bugs and issues, and the game has only been out a few weeks, but at some point, if this stuff isn't fixed then the game is just taking up space on my hard drive that I could use for other games. I'm giving you a few days before I log back in. Hopefully something is done to fix or mitigate my concerns. It has a lot of potential, and I want to see it become great.

Edit: After a few months of finally being able to play, I have found this to be a pretty good and engaging game. I'm looking forward to the upcoming changes post-wipe as well.",1546752055,1621304896,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Wild Rhino
Slick Daddy Club
Two Tailed Lions
Ancient Mariner
Hacienda

Game has legendary companies like this that give example to lost players of glory though they must learn themselves to become legend in time

The game has balanced it out good between different resources 
Gold 
Building materials 
Crafting materials 
Ship resources

But emerging imbalances in economy force to pay attention to time management and priorities which makes the game further interesting and exhiliarating for the resource manager types of players

Atlas relies on group effort as mentioned before the companies that work their legend forward together make it usually just work fine. You have to have designated or natural roles in companies to make things work. Specialization gives perfect excuses to not do the uninteresting parts for you in the game.

This game is something in which player is not hand held and must find out the route to perfection, be it resource management, player hostility, sportmanship, people skills, against environment content or main quest line to get buffs to everything else. Usually switching between ""profession"" over time to find the right order.

This game challenges you to play its content, to master its challenge, to find other players and treat them with what they deserve in your mind if at all. It also invites you to find your own way of playing the game most often times worst crimes in Atlas are politics and religion.

1. Bad Performance;

2. There's actually no ship fighting, everyone just using 1 type of ship that is really fast (schonner) with canons on the back and exploiting it. There's no realistic ship fighting, if you see any videos with it, it's most certainly scripted.

3. Are you a small group or just a new player? Forget this game, the only ship you will probably make is a sloop, and for some reason that small ship is slower than any other heavier ships in game. It really makes no sense.

4. ""Peace Time"" Islands are few in number, so instead of getting taken by people who need them, their taken by zergs who just use them to monopolize the whole game.

5. Deves are pretty much unreachable. K6 went down for over 48h, everyone in that island got massively punished by the downtime and several guilds wiped because of it. Deves did nothing about it.

This is going be that game you think is awesome, but will end up being abandon-ware in a week. Throw me a like if I helped you out.

If a Dev is reading this: This game is a game about Ships, Sea, Exploration. 80% of the ship mechanics you made, are not being used. Skills, Gunports, side-canons, etc... People are just spaming schoners with back canons. This game is a joke. : - )",1546234621,1620436372,False,0,0,0.520348846912384033,0,True,False,True

Inconsistent, and sometimes invincible enemies overshadow any enjoyment I find in the rest of the game. If you manage to raid the pirate camps of an island through sheer force of will (gunners are invincible until you hit them with a melee weapon, then they appear behind you and attack), you still won't be able to claim the island because 'there's a pirate ship nearby'. A pirate ship that won't go down, even when you cheat through the stat sliders. You cannot mount it with a grappling hook, so the best you can do is get your ship right next to it, jump off and start breaking the deck apart with a sword (with 1k damage multiplier). It will even let you pay off the captain if you manage to get close enough with a coin in the last slot, but not even that stops the enemy ship. It will continue to circle you, firing all cannons without a single crew member aboard. This is game breaking as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully they'll fix it, but as of right now, it's one of those 'anything can be fun with friends' kind of games.

Update: Came back to it almost a year later, lining up with the Trade Winds patch. I've managed to get some more playtime out of it, but none of the problems I had before have been fixed, except maybe the grappling other ships. I say maybe because I haven't bothered trying, as everything else is the same. I spent hours gathering materials to make a market to trade things only to find out I need a warehouse, which I spent even longer gathering materials for, to find out I can't place it because someone else has theirs in the area. I looked it up, and apparently only one warehouse, which is required for trading (and just huge btw) can be placed within a 2 kilometers range. This is so dumb. We want you to be able to trade resources, but only if you advanced fast enough to claim an island yourself, otherwise you don't get to utilize any of the skill points you just committed, and all the time and materials you used constructing the warehouse are WASTED. 270 alloy for the warehouse, I forget how much for the market, but it was close to that. All this on top of the warehouse being completely useless on single player, yet they will still let you waste the same points, time, and resources on it. I want to like this game so badly, and they clearly don't listen to anyone in the forums. It seems like they have no time for our feedback because they're too busy not fixing the game. Oh! I almost forgot, they added a gold fee to construction of any ship over a sloop. I believe it starts at 5,000 for a schooner and goes up from there. Yes, you need to throw 5k gold coins at the ship yard to create a ship, for what exactly? How does that make any sense? The defenders of this move like to argue that there are too many ships on the sea. Imagine that. You mean to tell me that everyone that bought the pirate game wants to be on a ship, and most of them want to make their own?! WOW! CRAZY! I've spent 80 hours in game now, and have seen maybe five other player ships that were out sailing, and one was a raft. Give me a break.",1593824617,1620416746,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The devs have no idea where they wanna take the game each update brings more and more things that no one asked and no one wants, there were some good updates, but somehow with just a few they completely destroyed the game. I think its easier to say where this game really let me down. 

when I bought this I fell in love with it, the game was a buggy mess but its mechanics where fun its concept was good. I loved building ships, customizing the interior, making rooms, captains quarters, crew quarters, trade goods storage all inside my ship, but then something happened, you no longer had the freedom to customize your ship interior, ships started requiring gold to be BUILT by your hands, with all the mats you had gathered (so who am I paying this gold to? if I had to build the fucking port as well?). That in itself killed game for me but then they started adding a lot of crazy magical and technological shit that does not match the theme of the game properly, it all just feels horribly off, on top of that they started to focus the game entirely on pvp.
 
What does that focus on pvp means? well it means that all those screenshots with towns and people and ship battles does not really exist in game by itself, its like those toy commercials where the toy flies, talks to you and what not, but in reality its just a piece of plastic that at max says some pre recorded lines. Yeah sure you can shoot some strange looking npc ""ships"" that are just hanging there for no other reason then to fuck you up when you let your ship sailing and go afk, but it gets really dull after the third time shooting them since you cannot even board it. The towns are non existent in game what you can find is a port with really few houses and even fewer things to do there, the towns depicted in the screenshots are player made and in a public server you will never go there unless you are part of the clan. 

Now you atlas player must be saying: ""what are you saying? In single player mode there are npcs villages to raid and you can customize some requirements for building ships."" My answer is: ""villages are composed of 2 or 3 small houses with a shit ton of bugged out npcs that has almost perfect accuracy and trash loot. And yeah sure maybe you can remove gold costs but can you customize your ship interior like when the game first appeared?""

The good thing I can say about it is somehow the devs have not given up on this shit fest, and they are really working hard to transform this into a game, which is estrange because after each update this looks less like a game and more like a nightmare

TL:DR - The game does not have a clear vision of what it wants to be, each update makes the game as a hole even more strange and off than before, the screenshots on steam page are kinda fake advertising, no real content aside from pvp on a public server, and bugs lots and lots of bugs (some even game breaking).

There is a lot of grinding involved and you can easily lose everything in a few minutes or even when you are offline. If you are looking for a chilled game and you are the type of person who will rage quit every time you loose your resources then don't play it. If you are like me and try and learn from your mistakes and really enjoy playing regardless of how many times you have to start over then go for it. The concept is great, it has a real pirate feel to it. The game has a real immersive feel to it when it comes to exploring, sailing, combat, digging up treasure, finding treasure on sunken ships etc. But it also has a lot of glitchyness to it so it is definitely not optimized like it should be. As an example, if you sail into or out of a storm through the barrier to go to the next tile of your map, your ship will not always be alligned with the top of the water which is a bitter pill to swallow. Your choices are either turn around and try again or bite your tongue while sailing like a half submarine until it fixes itself, normally after the storm. Another thing, big companies (clans/tribes) will completely annihilate the smaller ones so try and make friends where you can and either join them or alliance with them. Don't start a war with anyone unless you are prepared for the consequences. I can't make any comments on any ship bigger than a sloop, but for the beginning they work fine and are really easy to make. The game itself offers a lot from what I have experienced, but to get to it is not an easy task. Basically in conclusion if you want to be an actual pirate and go in with the mentality that you will die and loose everything a lot, don't mind starting over multiple times then go for it.

There are currently four elements to PVE. Animals, Ships of the damned, Hunting treasure chests and diving as far as i can see. None of which is more than an hours fun. 

If you want to sail an empty ocean for an hour to get to the next island this game is for you. 

My personal favourite is them bleating that when they did add PVE content it was exploited and its too hard to make so we'll go back to focusing on PVP. 

If you want to spend hours searching for an uninhabited or un-claimed island on PVE join the one official server. 

The recently added trade winds break when you change zone. Crossing a zone to find you're right next to a Galleon of the damned and becalmed absolutely awesome. 

The people i know who do PVP say it is fun for a while. But PVP alone in a survival type effort doesn't keep a game like this alive as Last Oasis has discovered. 

Yet i still come back and give it a go every now and again. 

Why i hear no one ask. 

Well underneath the broken mechanics and rage inducing bugs is a game which isn't just a reskin of Ark(totally is). It has deep crafting, punching trees and building your own ships is epic everything you could want in a survival game. Shame that actually using the ship mind numbingly boring for hours and exciting for a minute. 

I wonder how much fun the PVP actually is too. I have't tried it though as the prospect of sailing for an hour to lose my all my stuff being ganked by a crew unfortunately sits below colonic irrigation in my bucket list. 

To be fair if Ganking solo's and zerging is your thing I'd probably go with Last Oasis as at least the map isn't 99% uninhabited water nor is it reliant on actual wind direction which don't get me wrong is a wonderful idea for combat and realism but in reality is painfully boring and slows the massive journeys between actually doing gaming down even further. 

Got to go after ten minutes typing this up i've just spotted a flotsam crate so have something to do for five seconds.

A group of friends to share it with exponentially multiplies the fun, but one can always find a plethora of misadventures to occupy oneself alone. A few weeks back, I was sailing my raft, free diving for sunken treasure, and punching sharks, when a group of three battle ships pulled alongside me, I had sailed too close to their island and they slowly started to box my raft between their ships. I pulled out my rifle, and started to try to take out the people steering the ships, but soon found myself swamped in cannon fire. I looted my own ship and dived off, right before my raft was blown to pieces, grappled one of their vessels with my grappling hook and let them drag me back to their island where I've been secretly stockpiling loot I raid from their bases, and subjecting them to gorilla warfare on their entire island.",1619649562,1619662453,True,71,41,0.779597759246826172,0,True,False,True

Playing non-dedicated session with my partner on 2 powerful PC's RTX 3080 in one and 1080ti in the other. First of all things were OK, not a great experience, occasional bugs but it's early access so we can live with the bugs to a degree. Then after spending time building boats and taming a few animals on our starting island, a little hut where we have everything set we felt happy to start exploring. then the first major issue, ships of the damned spawn and wont despawn, they sit there and don't move, then more spawn and do the same, you can sail right passed them and they don't do anything except lag the screen with multiple groups of these damned ships and i'm talking 50 - 100. This happened anywhere we went, any grid the same thing. It forced us away from the game back in November last year and thought we would try to pick it up again now. Installed on both machines, works fine on 1 PC except the map now is completely blurred/pixelated so you can't make out the island which I read was down to missing jpeg files as others experienced this also. As for the 1080ti PC it crashes randomly every time giving a Kernelbase fatal error issue talking about files missing from D: drive, the machine doesn't even have a D: drive!!! 1 drive, C: and that's it, so unplayable! Tried everything from re-installing, checking steam directory, verified files but to no avail. Uninstalled again and will remain that way forever now as it's over 100gb which is definitely better off spent elsewhere. As for game play it had some potential but the islands we did get to in another grid were lacking to say the least, boring and pointless. I get why people say it's mainly for multiplayer because for single player or co-op it's a complete waste of time and plenty of better more fun games to play.

Such a shame.

I'm not going to lie. It's a buggy mess, especially if you try and host a dedicated server. 

However. This game is absolutely B e a Utifull. When its not buggy it runs very smooth and plays very well. The progression system has gotten better through the beta. It's exciting to build your first ship, explore the servers, find your home to be, or build 200 bases for respond points and farming. 

The public is very poisonous towards the developers. They were thrilled and exited for the new team to come in, and change things a while back. Since then the player base has gotten sour. I agree it does suck to restart over when you stumble upon a server bug or player bug, but please! keep in mind this game is in Beta. It's a work in progress. Expect some bugs. 

All that being said. I absolutely love direction of this game. It hits every pirate nerve in my body. Excited to see what the devs have in store for us. Please support the developers.

The NPC's render distance is so low that you will often be killed by a mounted gun that appeared to be unmounted until you walked into the agro range.

NPC's become immune to normal damage when mounted on a gun, if the mounted gun had any kind of gun shield this would make sense however being able to shoot an NPC in the face, see a blood spray from the NPC and yet do no damage is only one of the many ways the game does not make sense.

The NPC's pathing is horrible with most of this game's core being a copy and paste of ARK Survival Evolved its amazing that they got it this wrong.

There is almost no population on official servers at release they told PC Gamer that servers could hold 40k players. Each map segment has a hard limit of 150' players and there are 121 map segments so that's a server cap of 18,150 players half the number? It won't matter anyway during peak times official EU servers average ~12 players this is why servers no longer show you how many people are playing before you join.

The resource farming rates are too high its more over the top than a 50x Ark server as a result even if you put all of your attribute points into carrying weight you won't be able to farm more than a few trees or rocks before your unable to move faster than a slow walk.

As a result of this, the official EU server is covered in land claim spam and mounted NPC's with guns the tribes that own them long dead but there are enough resources stored in the upkeep storage to keep their buildings around forever.

Respawning to the ""you were killed"" screen due to this spam and having your respawn timer increase exponentially is honestly not fun!

The servers are wiped every ~6 months but when the wipe happens is mostly guesswork the dates are often changed leaving the hardcore player base unable to decide if they should be logged on farming or waiting for a wipe.

With an average player count on Steam of ~700 players per month down from its average of 2,200 in April of last year, I think it's fair to say the only interest left in this game comes from private server communities and based on the player count drops that the game doesn't have long left.

If you are looking for a game where you can chill on the official PVP servers and expect to make it to the top of the world by yourself and a couple of friends, I'm afraid this is not the game for you. However, if I had quit after the constant times I had been wiped on official over and over, I would never have discovered this game in its true art form, and to this day, with all my friends long gone, I meet new players season after season that all want this game to succeed so badly, because the success of ATLAS is largely driven by a high player base. All these negative reviews about our brain dead developers have some truth, but for a game driven by player interaction, we as players cannot always rely on the devs in order for us to seek out the content we are looking for and to have a fun time, whether you are getting sunk and getting your base blown into, or the contrary of sinking others and asserting dominance over the land and seas.

Win or Lose, when you play on the official PVP servers, there is always something to learn after every engagement because this is a sandbox game after all is said and done. In this game, not only can you rack up your hours in play time because of how indulged your mind becomes, but you can also become so addicted that the reason you play may not even be that ATLAS as a game is fun, but that the people you play with make every experience memorable.

Wanna build a ship? Experiment with different builds! Every time you get sunk there is always something to learn, whether you want to change your design up and see what works and what doesn't work. Like all games, there is a meta build for every ship that has proven to be most effective out on the waters, but I've come across many captains that have found success in unique off-meta ships as long as they have stuck to their strengths in combat.

Wanna squad up with your friends and land PVP? Every island is different, and every company has a different style of building defenses. The only way to push through the insane defensive meta at the moment is to learn how to raid efficiently and to progress in as little time as possible, as well as having a good team that covers each others backs in team fights.

There are so many niches that you could find in this game, even on the official server, but the main problem is that it is very hard to operate solo unless you are an expert in this game, but even then the tedious work and chores that you have to do in game make you want to group up with certain alliances or well-operated companies.

I tend to play on private servers with PVE so I do hope they will add more NPCs and NPC ships. Setting up the server was a bit of a challenge, in part due to the unique system the developers use for supporting large maps. Map regions are run as separate servers and as one leaves one map region to go to another they effectively leave one server and enter another. This presents a bug where information from the original server can be lost, and our characters were essentially deleted as we entered the second server of 2x2 private server. Since this game is early access and appears to be actively developed, this problem will probably repaired before final release.

I started to play when the game was released and I and my friends played this game for weeks straight, back then and there was a lot of grinding to build stuff such as ships and bases. we stopped playing the game because of the game balance at the time since the fact is one guy with oil jars and fire arrows could sink all our and our allies ships overnight when everyone was sleeping (50+ hours or grinding). We came back to the game a few years later to try it out and we had a lot of fun playing the game again since the changes made it so we could log off at night not worrying about our stuff being destroyed. We ended up joining one of the larger groups playing at the time which was fun since we were able to engage in more PVP and there was less to worry about since strength in numbers. We were in several larges companies, but in the last one we was in, it turned out there was a few amongst the 150+ players in the group was using exploits, and the developers decided the most logical thing to do was ban everyone who had been in the company within the last few weeks because of these guys, I tied to reach out to the developers about this ban but, I received no response from them about it. (For the record I had only been in the group for 1-2 days before the ban) And from what I have heard from guys who still play the game, recent changes have made the game worse and less engaging for those who want to do PVP.

Initial review: I've been playing 100% singleplayer just to test the game. I haven't encountered any crashes until I had installed a mod. Two times I wasn't sure why, probably cause I have graphics at max and it was loading all the hair from my pigs. They kind of jitter around a bit. Then the next time I crashed I had reset my skills and then spam clicked weight. So probably taxed the game a bit.

After uninstalling the mod, I played for about 6+ hours with no crashes. I get slow downs occasionally, but I probably should turn down the graphics. I have a 1080 so I like to run things on max.

I have to say, the game is beautiful. The water when out in the ocean is really pretty and the sailing is spectacular. You can man the small ships alone, but you can also HIRE CREW! or play with your friends. Its so cool building the ships, controlling the sails. With 3x XP the progression is pretty fast. The way the skill trees are set up is really advanced. You can just level up construction and ship building or you can go into taming.

People say this game has potential, but there is so much game in here already. I have enough fun taming, building ships and sailing around. The fact that the world is super massive sounds amazing. Though I probably will switch to the smaller map once its more completed.

I gave Ark so much crap for how stupid the mobs were, constantly running into things and getting stuck between trees. The AI pathing in this seem to be a bit better. More animals are passively tameable. You can use bolas instead of beating and drugging animals into submission.

The ship building is amazing. Depending on the class of ship, you can decide which kinds of sails to use. You can put role ladders on the crows nests, or not. You can add ladders to the sides of the ship, have a dingy attachment. There is just so much in this that makes me love it way more then Ark. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON THE ANIMALS! You can also ignore a lot of the skills, like farming. Just hit an island, fish, hunt and scavenge and your fine for a while.

I can't wait to get more into it. I am very excited. This is a great replacement for Sea of Thieves since I can pause whenever I need to. I can have a separate PVE and PVP server/character and make my own rules for my server.

Edit: So many people are saying its a reskin of ARK. Why is that a bad thing? The majority of the ARK engine is pretty good, especially for a survival RPG, which this game is. I didn't recommend it due to the poor AI, but I still had some good times in it. This game is vastly different from ARK where it matters. Its proper pirate fantasy. The skill trees are really well done. The ARK engine is good for the most part, and the AI in this is better.

ARK is still super popular. I can't imagine why so many people who likely enjoyed Ark are complaining about bugs in an EARLY ACCESS game. You guys are spoiled brats who like to cry that your computers suck.

Edit 2: I've read through so many negative reviews and very few have any clue about how EARLY ACCESS and game engines work. Taking an existing game and ""reskining"" it with completely new features, new maps, new animals, new everything, except the base game design is essentially a new game. No one cried this much when each Assassin's Creed sequel was essentially the game before it with some slight variations. People are so ignorant.

So many reviews are of how salty they are when their EARLY ACCESS game crashes or has errors. They say its UNACCEPTABLE! that an EARLY ACCESS game has bugs. Morons!",1564835758,1618671605,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

These same devs turned the AWESOME game that was launch Ark survival evolved, into the stressful, not at all fun, glitchy, low framerate, laggy cheap servers mess that Ark is today, those MANY 1,000s of Ark players are now a few 100 jerks, who keep playing with their' overbuilt forts their' clans built over the uber rare resource spawning areas, use hacks, glitches, & other means to grief ANY new players, & the devs RARELY do anything to stop them from doing any of it. 

THIS game is going to keep having everyone's islands, buildings, forts, etc. ""wiped"" every so often, & the players THEN have to login, & scramble to try to beat somebody to an island, so they can even progress past level 8, or build literally anything beyond the 3 starter boats... I checked the PvsE server today, & literally every single stinkin island is claimed by a different clan, & the players in the game are chatting about how even after the wipe, there's like 3x as many players as there is land to claim.

In every way that I can tell thus far (I also played in the single player map for about 5 hrs), this game is superior to Ark in pretty much EVERY way, except for everything I mentioned above.

So if You want a game that looks, runs, sounds, & plays great (so long as You turn the settings down, because almost nobody has a rig that'll run this decently maxed on graphics), but can only be played in single player offline, or You want to pay LOTS of money to RENT a server to play on with Your' friends, or strangers, then THIS is the game for You!",1618327428,1618327428,False,4,1,0.523237109184265137,0,True,False,True

The essential problem is one of direction. I'm not a PVPer (anymore) and so games with a hyper focus on PVP do not appeal to me. I'm not going to sit here and question their decision to go with PVP per se. It's a valid choice for game design and it has a dedicated fan base. And I hope the PVPers out there are having fun.

The problem with Atlas is that the developers (maybe inadvertently given their PVP focus) created the foundations for what could have been the best exploration, sailing, building, PvE MMO of all time. The game has *stupendous* potential. Playing Atlas I felt the same way I felt when I first played Sid Meier's Pirates and similar story games from the old days. It was deep. It was rich. It was immersive. It was huge.

Unfortunately, the developer felt the need to focus on its core piratical theme. And so this glorious foundation for a decade long obsession with sailing the oceans was chopped up and refactored as a PVP only experience. As an old Star Wars Galaxies fan, I felt all over again the incredible pain and disappointment of watching incredible potential be replaced by something considerably different.

I know the fact that I design games for a living (one of two jobs, anyway) doesn't make me an ""expert"". But it does mean I've spent thousands of hours since the 80s thinking about how to create incredible experiences for other people. It just sucks big time to see something so amazing fade and die.

So, this review isn't to bash the developers. It's not to bash PVP games or PVP players.(All gamers are awesome to me.)

The systems are more intricate and detailed that alot of those in Ark - game is by the same devs.~
Some of them are really cool, others are crap and will need sorting out.

- Land claim system is open to abuse (on PvE too) just as it was in Ark with pillars, now clans are claiming the whole map in PvE and PvP is full of zergs wiping anyone who dares leave their raft. Even more pointless to solo this game in PvP than in other survival games. PvE solo isn't as bad but grouping up is highly advised.

- The Vitamin system is a decent idea badly implimented. It should really be a system for buffs / debuffs and be more optional than it is. It can be really frustrating if you have no foothold on coastal land where you can farm up what you need. Also the rate at which your food and each vitamin depletes is really silly and need to be reigned in.

Alot of the negative reviews I think are from the pile-on that always happens when a new game comes out with bugs. It should level out a bit from mostly negative like it is right now to something more reflective of its quality after Xmas. 

If you are on the fence then hold out and keep an eye on streams while the game develops. It has alot of potential if handled right... but then Ark players are still waiting for these devs to give a S__t about balance etc in that game and its supposed to be finished. :)

The game has a few things in common with ark, which is a given, due to the fact that they share the same engine. However Grapeshot games has managed to make everything that was wrong with ark into something enjoyable - assuming you have the skill to play a survival game ^_^'

Pros
-Awesome graphics, better than its predecessor bar none
-rentable private servers through various hosts. You can even physically link all grids in your cluster together and travel between them freely with the same character. This makes zone transfer seamless, and the areas you can explore that much bigger
-a stunning and incredibly enjoyable building mechanic, both for ships and land structures. It is now fairly easy to make amazing builds, no more fumbling around with snap points that refuse to cooperate. I have built several stunning builds myself for server commisions.
-skill trees. rather than the drab and almost pointless skill system ark had, there are now skill trees for different things, such as building and mercantilism, shipbuilding, archery, artillary, firearms, etc. Taming also has its own skilltree called beastmastery - no more skilless noobs running around with a herd of gigas lagging and crashing the server
-land claim system - outside of lawless zones you now need to place down claim flags in order to build, which means people cannot simply spam foundations to keep others from building. this also means however that people are more likely to simply spam land claims, but these can be captured from players as well, allowing you to gain land even if you are new to a server
-npc crew. If you are a solo player this will be quite helpful. Npc crew are hireable crew that will fight beside you and man your ship if need be, for a price

there's plenty more pros, however I feel i should delve into the cons
-toxic community. The community for this game is by far the worst I have seen. Rust? CSGO? Ark? puppies by comparison. Valve plays lets pretend on the forums, and ignores the bigoted trolls, then tries to smack down anyone that stands up to them (nice try valve, hows that class action feel? lol) so the scum feel enabled to do whatever they want, and they generally get away with it. Harassment, hate speech, death threats. Big basket of nope.
-Griefers and cheats. Every online game has them in spades, some worse than others, but atlas is in this gray area where the game has them, but the devs simply don't care until it becomes a crisis. Best be prepared to combat them.
-official is laggy as hell, though it has seen vast improvements since launch.
-private server hosting is fairly expensive, though cheaper than it used to be as sites like Nitrado have found more cost effective ways to offer the same services. This is due to the fact that every server you host in a cluster has to be bought individually, and in order to have a large map you have to buy multiple servers, or create your own with the map editor tool.

All in all, the majority of these cons can be avoided by simply joining or hosting a private server. I have logged 155 hours in under a month, and I am usually fairly selective and reserved when it comes to early access titles. worth the buy at 30 usd, probably best to get it now rather than wait as it will be full price by full realease.",1547571740,1617368211,True,2,2,0.439425855875015259,1,True,False,True

edit. they made gathering and building a lot easier and the lag has improved significantly. also doing treasure maps and farming on the powerstone islands are alot of fun. if you like sailing and base building this is a good game for you.

as for game play, its like ark, machanics are a tad bit more fun, but kinda looses a lot of its bite once you get a good ship and base, the boss fights are way complicated to get to lost intrest before i got to them.
im not recommending this on the factors that you really cant get any where on public servers, and have to join, or create you own ( which from the admins i know who ran them, is a nightmare to set up, let alone fix when a new patch comes out ). should not have to factor all this in before playing the game.

It was getting good with some of the changes they added, but its going down hill fast. I get that this game is still in early access but they say this next wipe is the last one and then the release but this game still has way to many issues. The warehouse one is a major one for islands. Some islands only allow so many warehouses and then anyone else is sh*t out of luck to place one to try and get on the market part that they added. My company owned an Island on C9 and that island only let you have 1 warehouse for the whole island! it wasn't that small of an island either. We got so many complaints that others couldn't place a warehouse of their own. I've seen it on other islands as well. If you don't place that as your first thing your just screwed. There are still a lot of bugs they need to fix. They recently added a new tower claim system for lawless that turned into a giant Sh*t show over night. So many people lost their bases and boats. Even one of my friend went to play with them and took half of someones base and half of one of their boats. They got control of the back half which had the wheel, beds and resource box. Everything got raided and then Pop one plank out and bye bye boat! So many people raged over this. PVE turned into PVP over night in lawless zones. Its not even safe to park your boat on the shore over night because you might lose it with one of these towers. Those towers let you claim zones and no one can build in them, which on a fresh start ok I get would be cool, but if your company is big you can just spam a tone of the all over the island. They need to limit how many can be placed in lawless because it became a grid lock and there is no possible way for new players to build on those islands. The other thing that's annoying is they need to give island owners more control besides this 24 hour removal thing. They need to let them lock their island if they want so they can build or give them the option to remove stuff longer then 24 hours. Island owners have been having issues with spammers and if they miss something they are screwed and can't remove spammed stuff. On my island I share with company we want players to come build on our island but one company is causing us issues spamming in water and all over which we missed that 24 hour window and now new players can't come build on our island because of Jerks like them.

Old Review (from December 2, 2019): ATLAS is definitely not perfect. After a very rocky launch, it has it's fair pile of issues. However, it has a lot of potential to be something great, and have confidence it can reach that potential over the course of Early Access.

All you can do for a while is buy a raft and put some crap on it. Then hope the wind is in your favor. Ghost ships aren't rare at all. They are everywhere and I find that stupid. You get on most islands and there will be constant battling with snakes and crocs etc that are everywhere and super agressive. Then you can't get water very easily so you're constantly micromanaging that or dying from thirst. Wildlife movement is glitchy so good luck hitting animals as they teleport and fly and move around at warp speed.

The community is heavily toxic and the developers fail at pushing forth any real advancements worth a dam. Cheaters and exploiters around every corner, you spend days buildings and digging in only to have the same handful of companies cheat their way into your base to seal your items via means that are listed / labeled as exploitation yet even with video proof nothing is done to them. When punishment eventually is handed its far to little and far to late. 

The game would be better served with a way of turning off the crap-tastic chat box that is generally only filled with insults from grown adults behaving as if they were 12 year old children. But rather than give that option you get tamable dolphins. Yes, that is correct. Rather than fix well known and documented issues the game developers give you some fluff piece of shit n giggle item to appease the mass. By mass I refer to the 200-2,000 world wide player base across a multitude of servers depending upon what part of the season that particular session is in. 

Lets not forget, the developer wants you to know this is a boat combat game, so we'll throw in some outrageous gold costs associated with the fabrication of the boats that means any small company is not able to put boats in the water and protect them unless they ""no life"" store them in free port which requires daily repairs to keep them floating at a high material repair cost. Now, some will say that this gold cost can be easily offset via the newly introduced trade system, the trade system that is constantly being exploited and abused on the regular with reports, videos, screen shots being submitted as people are making a half million gold a day passively. How you might ask, well these buildings are only allowed to be placed so close together, however players have learned that should multiple people try to place them at the same time they can by pass the games prevention system and stack these buildings. I've personally found locations where 6 of these buildings were side by side at every possible location on an island. Yet... nothing has been done to correct this issue. (( a simple time stamp at placement with a back end radius check auto deleting secondary structures placed at a later time stamp) Just one of many possible fixes that have been partially coded and submitted for correction only to be ignored.) 

Oh, best yet... 0... none,... nodda testing done prior to launching a update / patch. Just a ""i've got this fix"" launch it straight to the server and watch as people loose entire islands to those who react the fastest to exploit what ever ""bug"" was just introduced into the system with 0 chance at a roll back or any replacement of lost items. Yes, this is a common occurrence, with the most enjoyable one being where players were stuck in what ever region they were in and unable to relocated. Thus allowing some companies to full clear entire grids of their enemies as no one could come to aid

So it boils down to, Want a toxic game, a hostile environment, dwindling player base of free loaders who only want you to put in days of effort so that they can just take it away from you with the ingame company ranking system. Then look no farther. This game has it all.

First the good parts:

The game is much like ARK but with wooden ship building and sea battles.

One of the best parts is the blueprint system. It's a definitive improvement over the ARK crafting system.  The skill trees are good. The shipbuilding is fun too.

The game inherited from ARK animal taming and breeding. Those are some of the best parts of ARK so they were good here too.

Now the game's weaknesses:

1. Bad ship models

Over the years they did not improve the ship models (which are meh) AT ALL and I am sure by now that they NEVER WILL. It is as if the people who designed the ships and sailing have not seen a wooden sailing ship in their life  and do not even understand the problem.

2. Bad sailing engine

The sailing engine is just bad.

- You can still sail straight into the wind. You should be in irons but aren't.

- And the sails angles still are weirdly off. The sails are pointing in the EXACT OPPOSITE WAY they should. Which looks sooo bad. In a sailing game the developers couldn't even set their sail angles correctly after 2 years? WTF ?! None of the devs seem to have sailed ever or the problem would jump out of the screen at them.

- There still are no working foresails. So the ships are still weirdly 'nude' up front. 

- Still no staysails.

- There still is no way to set the sails so that you can sail backwards, LIKE ON ANY REAL SAILING VESSEL!

(It is not like these are impossible expectations: In the game Naval Action both the wooden ships look great, the sail angles are correct, sailing backwards is possible and the sails on for- and after masts can be trimmed in different angles to assist in turning. Staysails exist too. But yeah, I guess a pirate game doesn't need even semi-realistic sailing?)

3. Bad NPC ships

The NPC ships still don't have sails but instead MOVE BY MOTOR??! and completely independent of the wind. WTF?

(Working NPC sailing ships are not an impossible expectation either as Naval Action proves. But players in a pirate sailing game don't need NPC sailing ship enemies?)

4. Too expensive ships

Recently they added a price in gold to building ships. The prices are so absurdly high that players have no real hope of getting anything other than a small sloop even after weeks of play. So instead of getting us onto the water the devs are getting us out of the water. Nice job.

5. Bad game development path

Instead of working on the above problems that ruin the core of the game the devs instead keep adding completely unrelated stuff that is - ah - questionable to say the least and arguably makes the game worse:

- A  'windmill' that is driven by a motor?! that needs fuel?! to turn its blades. Err - WHAT??? And makes  the farming animals you tamed and bred superfluous because the 'windmill' now farms stone, wood and even metal. 
The problem is that the animal taming and breeding system was a central and fun pillar of the game (one of ARK's strengths that had been translated into Atlas). But now this part of the game is meaningless.

- Instead of first improving the existing ugly ship models they entrench the problem by adding a new ship 
('ramming ship') which looks even worse! It is a galley,  (google if you don't know what it is) which in reality would be a sleek and beautiful vessel. In Atlas they managed to make it ugly as sin.

- And an 'amored dock'?! WTF? It is possible with the current building system do build harbours to protect ships and I did it. So why have an armored dock?
If you want us to build defenses easier give us easier-to-handle harbour parts. That might actually look cool. An armored dock though? gah.

In no other game could you build your own customized ship from the hull up with materials gathered by your own hands, stock that ship with provisions and crew, and sail that ship in any direction you choose across what once were vast open seas of varying winds and swells. In the two years since then, the ambition has been tamed, the promising concepts abandoned, and the the best parts of the original concept have been paved over with mechanics that arguably lay the groundwork for a MXT/pay-to-win structure while dumbing down the experience as a whole.

Update from the latest Q&A:
Will there be factions or AI? It would make PVE more interesting. What do you think of having PVP only at sea while land is PVE?
Our direction for Atlas is to make rich player interactions, whether that is through conflict or cooperation, and that is where we will spend most of our development effort. We have talked about factions and think those fit better with an MMORPG style game rather than a massively multiplayer sandbox game focused on PVP. [/quote]

Its sad to see they are not going in the same direction as their mother company WildCard. Ark might of had a rough start but at least they understood the power of getting the community involved in the development. Grapeshot on the other hand does not nor do they care to consider the entire player base. They only consider people that play in large groups (which is dying fast) and anyone else under that gets unherd.

Games like Sea Of Thieves do so well cuz in their testing branch called Insider (AKA Early Access) they actually take input from the Insider player base and make changes before it hits live AND you get free rewards for the live game just for playing the Insider. This is your Insider test branch and you need to take advantage of the people PAYING YOU for you game. 

Just cuz you put a single player mode in a massive online multiplayer game that doesnt make it balanced. When your community is telling you no for something you need to consider it. Instead you consider MORE server mergers for the dying player base. Why not have some real Q&A instead of picking questions you feel safe answering.....

It (barely yet somehow) reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean, it sounds funny, but any time that I think of pirates of the caribbean I correspond it to Atlas. I absolutely think this game is amazing, but I do not think that they are really giving it the full potential that it has. This game is amazing and definitely worth a try, and $30 seems pretty steep but it goes on sale usually for $5. I don't think price defines a game, but I definitely won't play any sort of $10-15 pirate game, this is the best one in my opinion. 

Why do I love this game?: This games' potential is insane, there is several bugs and glitches, and for a game to be in beta for over 2 years is crazy too. But they keep adding updates. Maybe just not the right ones. This game is essentially ARK; Survival Evolved, except, you are a Pirate in this instead of someone living among Dinosaurs.

Heres what I think they should do: They should remove the dinosaurs (Leatherwing, Razortooth, etc.) and try to focus more on the hitboxes for things that really need it. Most of the animals, army of the damned, and other creatures (not sure about pvp) take more than 1 shot to really register that you did damage to them. The manta ray is the best example I can give, when In water, shooting a bow&arrow at the manta ray, it takes me 5 shots and even more before getting 1 shot to register as a hit. There are more glitches but the hitboxes REALLY need improvement. 

They should make it so Puckles are two shot, rather than 1, the amount of loot and inventory I have lost from those puckles being placed in mysterious places has really been annoying.

They should also remove needing gold to build ships like the gally and brig, because it was so much easier to build those things when you didn't need 18k - 50k to build a ship. You already spend enough time getting the base materials (fibers,wood,thatch,metal,etc.) to build the skeleton of the ship, the planks, decks, and sails. Getting the gold is an extra process that I don't want to have to do, and I would think most, if not, some, players would think the same as me on that.

I think that this game is great, and the Devs are losing motivation to push out great updates like they used to because of the negative reviews, I see so much potential in this game and I absolutely love everything about it, I know people that have over 10k hours on this game and stopped playing due to the lack of updates, and optimization. This game needs some loving time put into it. With the consumers (players) minds put into the updates. If this game had better optimization, hitboxes, and did not glitch so much. This would be the perfect game. I hope that the Devs see this, to know that not everyone hates this game as much as they might think, and know that there are still players that want to see this game thrive. I know I do. And I hope they can make that happen in the near future. This is basically the only sandbox/pvp/survival game that I actually enjoy playing, and the only one I can get angry at, and come back to playing 10 minutes later. They need to get this game back to how it was in 2018, when everyone wanted to play.

Keep in mind this game has no offline damage protections and there's a good chance you will log on the next day with your ship having been sunk.

5k Gold may not sound like alot, but it actually is, and the next ship a Brig, costs 25k and the Galleon costs 50k. For the last 2 ships i can understand them being pricey, they are warships with lots of space and cannons and armor. But the schooner? It's a medium-small ship that can be specialized but is still fairly easily sunk. 

I am only writing a review because they wont let me thumbs down the game without one. If the devs actually work and improve the QoL for players i might change it, but as things are now. DO NOT BUY.

 I have currently taken a break from ATLAS due to large bugs in the game that have caused me to lose inventories worth of Legendary quality gear. I can think of four distinct times where the game just broke itself causing my items to either just disappear from my inventory, or be completely unrecoverable due to where my body landed, and or it disappearing for no reason other than the Ancients want it (trust me, I've played long enough to know how long my corpse has to despawn, and the bag with it).

 As much love as I have for this game, and wish to see it continue to grow. I found myself unbelievably aggravated at the perpetual issues within the community, and with the developers. The trends you will find is that each and every single update screws the game up even more than it was the last time you logged on. Within the community, the player base is so unbelievably toxic that in PVE, people will completely trap your bases, your ships, and tens of other things to make your life here MISERABLE. 

Fun game, enjoyed my time playing; until I didn't. Not sure if I'll be returning unless things are addressed and the Development team gets their stuff together. If you're gonna play this, embrace the suck. 


[ORIGINAL REVIEW, 12/21/20]

 Let me start off by saying that this is not a bad game by any means. I truly enjoy playing this game, and I've been playing it every day for at least a few hours for the past month or so. My only suggestion is to you as someone who is buying the game, is to make sure you actually enjoy games like this. There is A LOT of grinding; for not only resources, but for taming animals, and for getting gold so that you can actually progress in the shipbuilding. It is VERY time consuming, and if you can't commit time to this game, I suggest you simply don't buy it. 

For those of you who enjoy PvP, the development team is highly focused on that aspect of the game, and that player-base. For those of you who would rather a PvE only experience, unfortunately, you'll need to be prepared to be put on the back burner. The NA PVE server was recently taken down, so you will be playing on the EU PVE. Be ready for high ping at almost all times. 

 ATLAS uses the same UI, and is nearly virtually identical to ARK: Survival Evolved in game-play and mechanics. If you've played ARK, and enjoyed it, and you've played Sea of Thieves and enjoyed it. I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this game. But DO NOT purchase ATLAS if you are expecting it to be perfect with no issues. It is still EARLY ACCESS.",1608609507,1613919298,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While the game itself is a great concept, in my opinion it is poorly executed, and the devs priorities are seriously skewed. 
Rather than fixing the bugs and things that simply do not work, they pump out more and more content and put stupid hats on creatures, meanwhile the bugs add up and pile on. The game is still playable but it becomes more and more frustrating and you end up losing much more than you gain in the end. 
The ship costs on official are also pretty expensive, and seem to get more and more difficult to obtain, and given they are only slightly better than common quality, this seems like a straight up rip off.
They also really do not monitor their official servers, much like another game they created, ARK, the official servers are full of cheating and plenty of internet sellers, who breed animals just to sell them online. 
When they host Q&As they promise to fix things, and sometimes address the issues, but do nothing about it later on. 
This just further frustrates the player base and they lose players. i give props to the private server owners who do the best they can, with what difficult content they are given.  
So all in all i would suggest, if you want to play this game id wait until it is $5 on sale, because that is all this game is worth.",1613779499,1613779499,False,5,0,0.547661840915679932,0,True,False,True

You build your own ships and stuff, but it's like 20k players on one server. The Chinese players have banded together and it is basically China vs USA. We spent 10 hours building a ship yesterday. Went to destroy the ramp, accidently destroyed the entire deck with all the cannons. Was forced to walk the plank. Fixed the ship.

They spent about 4-6 hours sailing only to be attacked by monsoons, narrowly escaped while playing the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song and clog dancing. One person bravely was on the war drums the whole time. Unfortunately even after such a narrow escape 3 ghost ships came and sunk our ship with our 15 hours worth of gear and all 10 players peacefully sleeping below (one may have been hung on the noose)

Guess what I'm trying to say is 10/10 would recommend.

**** 2/18/2021 UPDATE ****

What happened to this game? This would have been my favorite game if you followed your original formula. A game where players could join massive clans and take over an entire map was intriguing. Being able to form a government and rules and regulations as a player base was insane. But then you reduced clan sizes, then you changed island claiming, and now you are making it so you can't even make your own ships? Wow, what a let down. In the games current state and development goals I cannot recommend this game to anyone.",1545943944,1613683845,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

They are introducing a new ship system that takes away the ability to build and customize your ship. They will say in one post we want everyone to be sailing around and then on the next patch do things that encourage players to not want to sail and risk their ships. Gold cost while a good idea from previous seasons has unfortunately made it very difficult for new players to get sailing on a decent ship. As of this last patch they have reduced loot drops in a way that makes replacing upgraded ships very difficult. So now we have 2 major issues that new players cant afford a ship and vets and large companies cant afford to replace ships they lose in battles.

1. The game has been in early access for over 2 years. Their business model is perpetual development, and taking your money with no responsibility to give you a working game.
2. The devs do not care about feedback. They do what they want to do, even if it is a terrible idea, and with Grapeshot, it nearly always is. I appreciate a hardcore survival game, I really do, but some of the design decisions in this game are downright sadistic and antagonistic. There's a big difference between that and making things challenging.
3. Setting up my own private server was both enlightening and infuriating to me. It allows you to see behind the scenes in the development, and I cannot list all the signs that the people making this game have no idea what they're doing. It took me nearly 6 weeks to get a server up and running and then they push changes that break everything. Again, I understand that it is an early access game, but the level of incompetence on the dev team is incredible.
4. The game forces you to install BattleEye to play on the official servers. BattleEye is an incredibly intrusive anti-cheat program that many consider to be malware. Ironically, cheating is an epidemic in the game.
5. It's impossible to play on the official servers. It's laggy as heck, and there are so many players there's NO free space for new players to settle.
6. Creating your own server is self-harm. They do not update dev tools. The community is the only thing that kept me going.

This game is never going to be finished, just like Ark has never been finished, but they will certainly take your money as if they're selling you something they have no intention of giving.

I'm heartbroken, not just because of the blood sweat and tears I put into getting a server running, but there is so much promise in this game. I love playing it, but the development team ruins everything. A great example of this is the ""new"" ship system. Currently you can build a ship and it's incredibly customizable.

As long as you don't play on the official servers You will enjoy this game, Official servers usually just throw you in at the deep end and hope you can swim. On Officials it's intended that players are to join a group to survive and many of the Mistakes are caused by inexperience and Miscommunication ( Like the fact that things decay quicker in freeports). 

Community servers are a whole different story, a LOT Less Toxic, and you'll probably find a group that isn't just to survive. Plus Admins, in my experience, actually exist and care. 

Single-player is single-player, Id suggest turning up some settings as you will be single and it can be a little grindy but it can be fun if you want to relax or just sail around.

Overall the game is a lot better when community ran, but you can easily play solo or on Official

- I bought this game 2 weeks after release, despite the negative reviews, so I knew more or less what to expect. I do not regret my purchase at all.
- I love 17th-18th century sailing vessels, so I might be a little biased.
- I briefly tried Pvp, got swarmed and killed everytime before I could build anything, so went to PvE. So I can't tell you much about Pvp.

The the game has 3 major issues that I think bother alot of people:
- Performance issues
- Connection loss (about once every 2 hours)
- Bugs (crew/tames disappearing and getting stuck, sometimes not being able to travel to another region, items disappearing)

These can be frustrating at times, but I believe these are to be expected in an early access game. I knew it was going to happen when i bought it. The bugs that I have experienced so far are far less bad than some that I have seen in videos prior to buying the game. If you're not willing to put up with these issues, then don't buy early access games. You have people saying ""I understand it's early acces but ..."" there's no but, it's early access. Seems you don't understand what early access means. It's unfinished. Broken. Has lots of issues that will be ironed out.

So alot of people wonder why so many people are playing this game while the majority of reviews are negative? Well because the game is extremely fun. And the reason there are more negative than positive reviews is probably because the people who like it like myself are too busy playing it to write a review. I am writing this now because they are implementing a major update.

The game is basically like ark with the advanced rafts mod, except the ships actually look like ships and the map is huge. I liked the shipmodels from that mod alot, but it was a pity they weren't editable or that you could not access their interior.

About the ark reskin allegations: so what? would it have made any difference if they had released it as an ark DLC for the same price? Sure the company used their own assets for their own new game, just like Rockstar used car models from GTA4 for GTA5. They also made a new huge map with a technology to connect 225 servers to eachother. They made a whole new shipbuilding functionallity, added new animals, changed the character design possibilities, added new items. And even if it was just Ark with only the shipbuilding from Atlas it would have already been great to me.

Another allegation in the reviews: ""Boats crash when even going close to shore."" No boats crash when you go into water that is too shallow, like they do in real life. Near the coast there are places where the water is too shallow and places where it is deep enough. Check depth and proceed with caution, just like IRL. Usually can't park an oiltanker a few meters off the beach.

So why do I like this game?

- You can sail your ship in first person.
- Map is huge.
- Customisable ships: you can choose between 4 ship sizes, customise the interior, choose how many masts (3 sizs and 3 types) you put on it (with a different maximum for each ship size), and even build structures on top of the deck, should you want to. The hulls themselves are not very customisable though: you can only choose the number of gunports, again depending on ship size.
- Building the ship is actually quite nicely done: You start with the skeleton and then put planks around it, add decks, then finish it by adding walls, ceilings, doors, masts, guns, containers ... Make sure the water is deep enough where u place your shipyard though.
- There are crewmembers that you can recruit and put on your ships and give them armor and weapons. They are basically human tames that need not just food but also gold coins.
- You actually have to rotate your sails depending on where the wind is coming from.
- You can walk around on your ship while it is moving, and even give orders to the npc helmsman to change the heading or speed of the ship. There is only one other (space)game where u can actually do that, afaik. Or you can ofcourse steer yourself. And you can even ride your horse or bear on a moving ship :)
- When you go on a long voyage, you actually have to prepare properly: have enough food, repair materials, some extra planks , ammo, water, clothes.
- It has this age of exploration feel that no other game really has, you have to travel to different parts of tha map with different climates to find resources or animals you want.
- In PvE players are actually trading resources, animals and even crew (that last one might sound a bit wrong, but you have to pay them, so they're not slaves :)


Things I dislike about the game :
- No singleplayer option. (has been added now)
- Can't pickup containers, some furniture and cannons once placed for more than 30 seconds. Have to demolish them.
- Ghostships, dragons, soldiers of the damned and others magical fantasy nonsense. I would have prefered a more realistic setting. 
- Too little landmass for the amount of players. When I started it was hard to find a spot to build even in lawless.
- In first person you when holding the steeringwheel, you cannot turn your head left or right more than 60 degrees, which feels very restrictive. You should be able to look around at least 300 degrees.
- You spend too much time gathering resources, until you have a bear, elephant and rhino. And even then it perhaps a bit too much. Perhaps they should automate it a little: make a logging camp, mine and quarry and put some crew in it that you have to pay gold. (they actually implemented this now and I love it :D )
- The galleon can have up to 6 large masts, it really makes me cringe to see so many 6 masted vessels. The galleon has 52 gunports, and you can can put a few extra guns on the top deck, so it is like a 3rd or 4th rate ship of the line. The largest pure sailing warships never had more than 3 masts. (HMS Caledonia, Nuestra senora, Brétange, all first rates, were all 3-masters). Sure you can put 3 masts on the galleon, which I did in Pve. But if you do that in pvp you have a serious disadvatage, whereas you should actually have an advantage. (Ships with more than 3 masts were difficult to handle). The 16/17th century heavily armed cargo vessels (galleons) did have 4 masts. But not 6. A few 19th century warships did have 5 masts, but these were ironclads, hybrid steamers and they were horrible to handle under sail, so most had their mast number reduced to 3 at some point.
- No headsail, staysail and no attachable gaff sail to another mast to have a proper brig rig or almost any proper rig at all.
- You can now sail against the wind, albeit slowly. Apparently when the game was released you could not sail against the wind at all. Tacking is still necesary though if you want to get anywhere soon.
- The rowboat is used facing forward like in a canoe, instead of backwards like in an actual rowboat. Archeage did that better.
- No fore and aft gunports on the galleon. You can place guns on the top deck facing fore and aft, but it'd look better with actual gunports.
- Gunports are too large imo
- Ships sink when they lose planks above the waterline, yet strangely enough with all those oversized gunports opened, they do not sink, ships should only sink when planks below the waterline are destroyed and perhaps very, very slowly when planks just above the waterline are destroyed, and perhaps also when gunports are openend during storms. But a hole far enough above the waterline should not have sinking as a result... same mistake as Blackwake.

So if you really love 15th to 18th century sailing and are willing to put up with all kinds of issues that can be expected in an early access game, then buy it. If you cannot handle the known issues then don't buy it. I personally feel the issues aren't that bad and that everyone should be able to handle them, so I will recommend the game. I'm still having fun (90% fun vs 10% frustration)",1548982339,1613003593,True,5,0,0.504351019859313965,0,True,False,True

amazing details in graphics.
Fun to play solo or with a company.
pretty straight forward.
community is decent, people are ususally friendly. one might sneak up on ya and voice chat and kinda surprise ya.
sailing is easier then it seems with crew or no crew. 

cons: 
hard to find any space to build on in lawless. 
People are very greedy with space on lawless, so if you are just passing by and ship crashes on a lawless well... chances are if you're new you are SoL.

I bought this game either the day it released or soon after and got to witness the beauty that was texture glitches, inability to spawn, large amounts of bugs, issues, and of course witnessed the sheer amount of harsh feedback the game received at its launch. It was funny, but at the same time a little sad.

Recently, jumping in, I found myself bored of the concept, finding it relatively easy to get a ship at the beginning but still buggy nonetheless. I'm sure it was something to do with either my ping or my internet, but goodness if I haven't been so easily driven towards bored gameplay before. The whole concept is great, I've always wanted a pirate game like this and for the most part, the concept is there and is flawless, kind of. 

Another problem I've had is graphical glitches, no matter what setting I put my game to it looks like 32 bit garbage. If there's a fix for this I haven't found it, but the screenshots do not serve the game justice. 

The game does a few things right, I've done a little bit of building and sailed a tiny bit, and it's not horrible, the building is quite nice and the whole ""build your own ship"" thing kind of works when it's not costing me an arm and a leg of my resources. 

I don't think the game is fantastic, neither is it necessarily something I'd play again just to say ""ooh I want to play a pirate game"" when I have sea of thieves, and for survival games there's quite a few out there. I don't think the game is worth 30 dollars. 20 is pushing it but would be acceptable.

ive just played PVE Due To Solo And Everyone Else Either Hating This Game or Cannot Run It   now to the list

when first playing its  bit of a punch in the face and can be like errr wtf do i do now sorta thing but once you arrive to a place for me i sank and got picked up and was brought to a island owned by a company not knowing all that complys well i build my base cuz it was allowed but the owners are abusive and will harress and insult you for hours then if you say or do anything they threaten to get you banned or delete your stuff the issue with this is on pve a company can own a whole island in pvp understandable cuz they cant keep it perma but on pve they can own 1 or more islands no issue like this one they own a island dont use it and only use it to threaten and assault ppl on pve cuz they can with no threat to them due to pve not pvp and simply get away with rule breaks and bribe a few ppl to make it look like there not doing such things but the issue is they can own 1-3 islands and have bases on 4-8 lawless and never use the island they own and restricting a big sector of the map causing the game play in some areas to very much inbalance   another was a guy who fully spam built on a island to own it then had farms on 7 other islands ive seen so far blocking people from making any and was not using or having his farms run theres no real ""removal"" in pve unless there inactive for 14-30days but players log in for 5mins to reset timer also causing issues alone   as example 4 full grids are almost unusable just due to 2 companys this is alot of the map for 2 companys in pve to mess up and dictate with no farm/warehouse/claim chunk cap for any company  if this was pvp most em would struggle to keep 1 thing they have to adjust pve for the insanity of abuse of the players who control things also believing they can threaten bully harres steal and frame people for bans just cuz they got ""power"" 
over all in current state id strongly recommend avoiding this game till issues fixed unless you purely want the pvp

- PROS 
Good Fun Over All Game Mostly Balanced

Good Scenery 

Decent Combat

The Tense Levels Can Give You a Need For Massage Cuz So Good Rush XD 

Good Ship Building But Holy Fk Is BP Crafting a Pain 

- CONS

Toxic Pve Island Owner Community

Lots Of Abuses And Unfair Play In Numbers And In General In Pve

Alot Of Time To Grind For Basic Materials

You'll Spend 100s Of Hours Solo To Get A Basic Decent Setup In A Galley Not Good Work Or Gf haha

Draining And Tiring 

Pve Griefing

PVE Scams

Pve Bug Abuses

Pve Untouchable Harresing 

Easily Offended Player Base That Gets Offended When Told Same Thing Back As They Said  (lol karens)

alot of pedos in there 40s-50s that are proper dicks and failures who will target you

This game was utter shit 2 years ago, but it showed promise. Since then the Devs have miraculously identified the major issues with the game.
> You spend 5x more time on land, than at sea.

They ""fixed"" this by adding in automated trading and trade routes. Except... they are buggy and broken... 

They added a GOLD COST for ships that means losing a ship can cost you up to 50k. 
Mind you, in PvE under PERFECT circumstances and AFK idling in game to force trading, you can make AT MOST 5k a day. PvP? Good fucking luck.

You'll likely need to spend weeks getting the gold for a ship that will be INSTA-SUNK by ""Ships of the Damned"" (NPC Pirate ships) at max level that are camping the map borders.

I spend 2 weeks gathering for a ship, and the moment I left my map grid and spawned in a new one, I died from a cluster of 6 ships. 2 of which were max level Galleons. 

To top it all off... the game is so buggy that its the ONLY GAME I OWN that manages to crash my PC so hard it shuts down.

Mostly because it has so much potential to be an interesting and engaging open world PVP/PVE game. The biggest problem is simply horrible game design. It's like you just want to sit down with the lead game designer and ask him/her WHY do you expect players to play your game in a way that is the opposite of fun.

On it's face the game world is stunningly beautiful. I've literally never seen waves look so good in a video game. Upon first play through the world really immerses you in a tropical pirate paradise and you are pumped to get in your first ship and start sailing the seas. My first reaction, sailing into the sunset with my friend on our first ship, this is my dream game.

Unfortunately, this lasts for about 1 hour if you're on a PVP server and maybe 8-10 hours if you're playing on single player or a PVE only server.

PVP - It simply is not balanced and it is NOT fun. At the top end PVP is played like a business. You've got people logging in shifts to repair and farm while others run around harassing the rest of the server. They utilize loopholes in the game mechanics for everything they do. Some of the worse (allowed by the game design mind you):

They will bypass the risk of off-line raiding by having their resources (and resource collecting tames) on rafts on the starter islands (where PVP is disabled). Now the game tries to discourage this sort of thing by degrading the rafts quickly if they sit at the starter islands. If you're a single player, it is impossible to play like this as it requires you log in twice a day at least. If you're part of a huge company it's the only way to play.

Ship building! It was one of the biggest draws for me. What could be more fun than designing my own floating base to explore from? Forget about it. PVP ships consist of a hollowed out ship (empty) except for a wall of cannons at the front and back of the ship. No design needed, in fact it is frowned upon. Why you might ask? Well because the more walls and decks you put on your ship the heavier it is and the slower it goes and PVPer's only goal is to chase you down, kill you with brute force, and then bring all your loot back to their fortified base or rafts on the starter islands that you cannot touch. Nobody lives off their ships on PVP because it's only a matter of time before it's sunk in a matter of minutes and days or even weeks of work go down with it. So the whole mechanic of ""designing"" your own ship is ignored. They even acknowledge this, instead of fixing the game mechanics, they've started just selling whole ships for gold. Great so now the big companies can just buy ships and don't even need to farm the mats.

Oh and how do you man these ships? Well again if you have a huge company you can have players man the cannons, repair the hull, drive. If you play solo or with small crew you are like a one man band, trying to steer, repair etc. all at the same time. You can hire NPC crew members (ok cool!?) but wait they cost gold per day. You guessed it, another mechanic requiring you to log in daily to grind just to keep what you already have.

So all things above considered, you say to hell with it. I'll just play single player. While this will keep you content for much longer to get through some of the content you'll quickly find that the game pushes you into the gold farming thing rather quickly. You can farm gold by taking on NPC (ships of the damned) at sea, which is rather fun for a while but quickly becomes repetitive, or doing treasure quests. These quests give you a map to an island where there is buried treasure, the kicker is you have to fight about 10-12 powerful damned pirates to dig it up. By yourself. Here again the game design rears it's ugly head. In order to even have a chance at taking this small army of NPC's will require you to tame animals from the islands to fight for you. Yes just like Ark, it's a tedious horrid grind to find the animal, trap them, and sit there for hours feeding it just for it to play parts of the game for you. To be fair I'm fine having animals that collect resources faster (at least you can do that yourself) but the fact I HAVE to tame things just to dig up treasure is just dumb. Scale it up or something. If the player is alone have me fight 2 or 3 of them fine...but 10?

To summarize; this game is like ""Ohhh cool, but wait I gotta what?, why can't I just?...well whats the point?""....and it's this over and over again. Which is really sad, I think with a few specific game design changes they could really turn it around but over the last year rather than fix them, they've doubled down and added things to make the lives of the mega guilds easier and more solo or small crew unfriendly.",1612102421,1612102421,False,6,1,0.567455649375915527,0,True,False,True

1. If you play PvP, it is nearly impossible to play competitively unless you're in a massive company. Devs need to implement a second set of servers with company size caps or something to keep it manageable to play with a few of your friends.
2. All of the unofficial servers are very small worlds and often do not have many players, if you want to enjoy the official servers and get your own island you basically need to start fresh the minute the servers wipe (which is rare) or be ready to try and take over someone elses island, which is generally impossible unless you have a huge group of people.
3. Recent update added a gold cost to building ships, the cheapest one being 5000. This is completely absurd to think that people can come up with 5k with only the shit starter ship. If you're on a PvP server your ships get destroyed right and left anyways so it makes the grind even more pointless.

I'm glad to see the devs working on the game still but their methods of dealing with problems in the game (ie adding gold cost for ships) are only making it more shit.

[b]“ATLAS is one of the most ambitious online worlds of all time and while everything we have listed in the feature section will be there around Early Access launch, we are going to need the feedback, insight, and creativity of the game players to build on that foundation and balance the game optimally over a period of time.”[/b]

HA!

Let me reword this for you: Because they want money for a copy and paste of Ark. The best aspect of this game is pirates. Otherwise it blows. If this game was designed with Pirates in mind (ONLY) this would be a competitive game with others like it. The fact that you get to sail on the ships, across various places in a vast wide open world, and build a ship (some that takes months) and wrangle a crew together is what makes this game interesting, and unique. Not even Sea of Thieves has this type of in-depth play.

Now, the reason this review is negative despite having a recommendation.

It's not just about Pirates. It's about the dead, which is cool when you hear it (but then when you realize you need something else to defeat them, that's when sh!t get's crappy; but the realization is, you need to Tame animals. Not just any animals, bears. You need to tame a bear, so you can use him to kill higher levels of the dead or you won't level up.

Which, is the ultimate goal; to progress further in the game.

With each level up you get skill points and those points are used to unlock engrams (skills) that are needed for specific things... like being able to craft a shitty cannon, only to find out after hundreds of hours later, you can find blueprints of higher level cannons and equipment--oh but wait, holy cow batman, you need 6 to 7 different pieces of wood, stone, metal, gems, fibers, etc, etc, etc,... which means, you gotta travel across 64 squares--which takes weeks. Literally WEEKS--all just to find these variations. That is if you don't die every 20 minutes from weather, animals, storms, cyclones, ghost ships, alien/skeleton ships (wth is that?).

... Or boost your vitamins, or increase percentage in hitpoints or running speeds, or whatever you're needing to progress... and in all reality after rigorous tests with a mate, we figured out most of those percentage engrams for weapons and etc, don't do jack sh!t. You'll need something called mythos to even be able to get such a high level weapon that would make all the difference. I'm getting off topic, so I digress...

The point is, it's not just about Pirates anymore. You are literally taming dinosaurs, creatures that belong in Ark, fighting alien-hybrid-ghosts, you need breed animals to get them stronger ones because there is a cap on certain animals, but to do that you need the best type of plants, and the perfect temperature/climate to incubate an egg---to do that you need highest level engrams, to do that... you need to craft, and after what seems to be a century of gathering resources you realize you are going nowhere still. There's no end. Even if you think you will have the advantage with the elephant, you won't. He harvests wood, sure, but his stamina drains so fast you might as well wrangle an entire family of elephants and line'em up at the trees and just hop from one to the other hitting trees. When one tires go to the next. It's boring, tedious and Ark all over again but worse.

Forget about going to any server other than Unofficial ones if you want to speed up the process. Whether you do PVE or PVP, go Unofficial that has high harvesting, high xp, high taming and you will enjoy the game and save yourself 800hrs of boredom. 800 hrs? You know how many languages I could have learned? I could learn to code, play a musical instrument, start a company, I could have finished school 5 times with 5 different degrees. Literally. 800hrs is low, compared to some of these yahoo's playing in the thousands. They'll waste their entire life playing and get no where.--- imagine all those hours and then suddenly, boom! Server wipe. You lose everything and the company says, ""We apologize, here is some x10 taming for a few days."" Gee... thanks.

That's Atlas in a nutshell.

But, if you're willing to lose your life... have at it. You'll develop blood clots by the time you finish the game. However, if you wanna play it for fun, here and there, it's great.

The good stuff:
- There is sooooo much to do
- way more cooler bosses and creatures than ark
- Very few crashes on my end
- Love the crafting system and resource collecting
- The game is very fun overall

Confirmed in lastest patch when I'm writing : ""Tameable Dolphins"", Atlas is primarily focused on having pets. (Tame them all ?)

Animal sizes quite often make them look like re-skinned dinosaurs, it feels so ridiculous. Some people like that, not me ^_^

You think PvE Ark is bad with the boxes, pillar and gatespam?
Well then you haven't seen Atlas... the pillar, gate, dock, box and billboard spam is to a whole new level.

The devs should really consider fixing the building exploits, there is no chance for a player to settle...
Along with companies owning more than 1 island is terrible, you don't need a lot of land!!! The sea is where you belong so please change this behavior.

[b]Some advice to devs (for PvE):[/b]
[list]
    [*]Limit maximum of docks placed to max 2-3 each player
    [*]Change land claim to quarter or half islands depending on size
    [*]Limit companies claiming to only 1 island
    [*]Change the pillar spam decay timer to super low (same for fence and gate spam) but not for bases made on those
    [*]Remove the huge gates and walls, or change them...
    [*]Remove the huge gates
    [*]Fix the building placements for example the lighthouse, its immersion breaking a lighthouse not placed right
    [*]Perma ban griefers (make some money out of them forcing them to buy a new license)
    [*]Add NPC pirates in PvE
[/list]

The lag caused by buildings is insane!

To you hoarders and greedy ""overlord"" players, this is a game at sea, not on land don't claim everything to be yours. You are the type of players that's killing PvE due to excessive griefing and greed, preventing griefers is also griefing.

The sea should become more important.
Griefing should be taken serious.

Don't forget the PvE community. PvE seems to be dying in survival games... only Conan Exiles does it somewhat right (I'm talking about real games not the cartoony trash out there).

Fun with friends if you are able to survive.
Tried PvP and PvE servers.
+ If you die you keep your lvl and skills. 
+ & - You can get the equipment back from your corpse if you die (outside of freeports/starting areas)
+ Easy to learn

- Way to easy to die, a turtle can kill you even if you are higher lvl.
- VITAMINS!?!? for real, this is just stupid in a game like this. Most of the time you search for food, a real drag if you are a solo player! Keep the food meter, remove the vitamins or atleast make it easy to keep it up. Eating 200 ""food"" every hour is just stupid.
- You just run around harvesting..
- Make it easier for solo players to enjoy the game. This is clearly a game for multiple people playing together.
- You should not have to spend hours in a starting area just to get to lvl 8 and then move on. But since you are 2 hits from death by a ostrich even at lvl 8 and for some reason they attack even if you dont hit them.. its just stupid.

+ 3
- 5 (for now...)

What to say?
First off, this game is not finished as of this writing, so it's still in development, so expect to see bugs.
This game is a survival game, first and foremost, so get ready to do a lot of stuff besides 'sailing the seven seas'.
You will need shelter from the weather, you'll need fresh water and food. You'll need to gather resources to make everything that you'll need to survive.
You'll then need to gather more resources to build your first decent ship.
You'll need gold to hire crew and to build bigger, better ships. This will require you to sail to, and explore other nearby islands in search of treasure. You will also need to take animals for buffs (monkey buffs health, as an example) and to use as 'pack animals' to haul resources from your farmhouses, lumber mills, mines, etc.
While this game is a challenge on solo players, I find it most enjoyable with friends. Not only can they help build up a settlement, or home base, if you will, but can help you sail your ship, search for buried treasure and fight off other pirates.
I do not recommend playing on the various 'official servers' as they have a real griefing problem right now.
Other players typically attack your settlement and/or ship and crew, while you are offline, forcing you to basically start over with nothing. If you want to play online, I highly recommend finding a good private server, with admins and moderators that actually do their jobs and keep the griefing to a minimum.
If you just want to play with friends, you can host a 'non-dedicated' session where just you and your friends can fight off AI threats and play in peace, far away from the spoiled brats that seem to permeate these kinds of games.
However you choose to play, I feel that if you are into pirates and sailing the seas looking for buried treasure, then this is just what the doctor ordered.
I recommend this game to anyone with a love of the old days of wooden sailing ships and high seas adventure.

The world is the biggest I've ever played and you feel it in your bones.

The Discord community is a lot of fun and very helpful. In the PvP and PvE environments, there are great groups of people to help you get started.

We set up our own servers as well. We have Blackwood server that's a lot of fun for a small number of players, and we set up a 2x2 server that gives us a lot of the feel of the full world without the ""dangerous"" interactions with other players which is a great environment for my younger kids.

There's something fundamentally wrong with this game, here's what I got.

1. We were lied to from the very beginning. A lot of the features and bragging points they sold us were off from jump. Server populations to the land masses themselves. Just watch the original trailer, pick four selling points and roll a d4. It was probably a lie or fluffed up. 

2. It's an ARK MOD. No joke. There was even a hidden menu (patched out pretty quickly) that brought you to solo play options, with other Ark maps. There are plenty of Ark resources used, just re-skinned. This, in itself, wouldn't be terrible, but it's not the game a lot of us hoped it would be. There are those out there that said this is what it would be, but a lot of us didn't listen. I'm sorry, you were right.

3. Dino taming... err... Animal taming is a must... in a game about piracy. This wouldn't be so much of problem but when it becomes a necessity to have good tames to do really high end stuff.. I'm done, I'll just play Ark for that bs, it's a better game anyways.

4. Solo play is terrible. While not impossible, it's just not fun and on official servers have fun finding any  land that you can claim on your own.

I think the game is beautiful and there is some fun to be had with a group of friends just sailing around and exploring together. There is a some potential for this game to, one day, be a half decent game but I don't see that happening in the foreseeable future. I'll try it again later and if the game takes a turn for the better, I will change my opinion and give a better review. Until then, save your money and find a better pirate game, if that's what you're looking for because this is just an Ark survival mod with sailing.

Hey devs please fix I installed my old card 2080 ti  and runs again  9900k 5.1 390 msi meg ace 32 gb gskill b-die 4k 45 ish fps .. Now on to the game I have over 400 hrs great game !! Many things to do if you like building adventure treasure exploring .. The fighting could use some work  but has gotten better still needs some polishing . The biggest complaint is also telling you how much better the game could be if a few changes were made .. like 1.. people should not be able to own more than one island they can build on more but let others enjoy the game . WHICH LEADS TO MY BIGGEST SUGGESTION  everyone puts up post or squares xmas trees or something to block others from having a farmhouse and warehouse around all islands  which is a cool part of game so if you have option when we see random squares  to report it as spam which can be reviewed  and taken down I see they all can be traced so take all there blocks down and give them a warning and if they keep doing it ban them would fix that issue and keep more players in the game . If you did not start when they did you can travel everywhere and you can get lucky with some things but i still cant get warehouse up crazy..  after all that ranting I still play the game hoping they will fix it because it is really fun!!,1610582874,1610582874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

No, don't buy this game. While it's fun when you're in, there's a game breaking bug that is STILL there 2 years later. UE4shootergame crash error. This happens randomly in game, but mainly while in the server browser. This has happened on my old computer (while old, it was more than capable of running Atlas), my wife's computer, and my new computer. All 3 have had this issue and it's still not fixed. If you google 'UE4shootergame Atlas', you'll see many with this issue. The Devs refuse to fix it.

Original review below:

I honestly don't remember ever reviewing a game before. I always felt the reviews accurately reflected the product. However, in this case I don't, which is why I am  writing a positive review for this game. I hesitantly purchased Atlas after reading all the negative reviews, but also after watching Youtube gameplay. The gameplay I watched looked incredibly entertaining. After downloading Atlas, and trying several times to get into a server, I finally did. I must say it's the most fun I've had in a game since Rust. I joine a public server (highly recommend) because while I love survival games, Atlas is incredibly grind filled. A 5x community server seems like a great balance. Community servers are also far less cancerous and they usually have active admins. I'd highly suggest this if your experience wasn't good.

Anyway, the amount of content is overwhelming. It's been extremely fun just learning what to do and how to do things. Sailing is a great experience. The mechanics are tight. Crafting, exploring, building, treasure hunting, raiding, sailing, farming, manning cannons....there's just so much to do. Of course there are issues. It's EA after all. Some of them can be frustrating such as AI enemy ghost ship spawns and multiplying water spouts at sea. Some animals are far too aggressive, but over all my connectivity beyond the first couple days of playing has been dependable. 

I honestly would base your decision to purchase Atlas on whether or not you think the gameplay on Youtube looks fun and not on the overwhelming negative reviews that came in the first couple days when the launch had some major issue. Those seem to be ironed out.",1546484202,1610080263,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It was challenging and often frustrating, but was gripping.  Unfortunately, if you've ever played an ARK official server, you're better off just playing that.  It's golden compared to this shit show.  Every update I hope they'd find a better balance in PvP.  Playing with a small group of friends (or solo) required a decent amount of grinding of resources to build a base and ship, only to log off and be raided.  Now that actually doesn't bother me, it is PvP.  You learn to adapt to that or quit, however the current state of the game is pointless.  With mass automation, there's no satisfaction of completing you first brig. And now you log off and return your base is not only destroyed but is surrounded with walls because warehouses generate so many resources hostile players have all the resources right there.  But hey, on the plus side, you don't have to feel that fiery rage of logging on to find some dick blew out a plank and it sunk. Ok, ok, I can even deal with that too, but now in order to build a ship larger than a sloop, you are required to grind out 5000 gold (schooner).  I have a life and can't sit online for 24 hours to guard a boat.  I haven't even revisited the NPCs, but I'm sure they are still shit for automated defenses.  Fact is this, if you're looking for a MMO and planning to play solo or with a small group of friends on official serves, just forget about this game.  If you can join a large tribe, maybe it's fun, but all I have found are asses that will lure you in to destroy you. I wish they would just revert back to the original format and force tribes to join default factions.  At least then not every ship would be hostile and perhaps actually encourage solo/small tribes to defend each other.  These developers are missing the largest demographic and focusing on large crews.  Armored dock, a brilliant idea... ooooh nope you have to have 10,000 gold to build that... yeah, a solo player is going to hammer that out... ahhh never.  Not because it's not doable if left alone, but you'll never keep a ship floating longer than 48 hours and your certainly not going to lock it in a base.  Sure you can hide a storage box, but if I'm just hiding a crate at the bottom on the ocean WHAT'S THE POINT in even building anything. To date, they have completely FUBAR'd this game. I'm actually surprised they don't make you spend real money to build a boat... That'll probably be next season. Perhaps someday they'll reverse course and focus on the individuals rather than the group of players that don't need anymore assistance.

The Development team do not have a clue how to progress the game and keep making random changes at whim without consideration of the game play balance or the stability of the games environment. I cannot be sure of the actual stats but as a player I feel like the player base has dramatically reduced over the last two to three weeks to the point where seven or eight zones which previously would have had a healthy three or four players, now are empty.

Despite being early access for two years now and all the glitches and patches, this game is still a great bit of fun. My easiest pieces of advice for playing this game are to 1.) Buy on a sale (I got it for less than $5 and totally worth it) 2.) don’t get attatched to your progress 3.) Don’t get mad at the issues WHEN you encounter them!

So good things first! The game is super immersive and a great sandbox craft survival pirate simulator. Being able to build your own ships from scratch and customize the layout is just phenomenal (I’ll get to the negative sides of this). Running a ship is really cool when it comes to hiring a crew and having them operate parts of the ship from cannons to sails and even just repairs. The map is as it says, massive with a ridiculous amount of unique, well designed and still even in themselves huge islands. The skill trees are an interesting design which allows you to purchase one perk that unlocks different craftables instead of specing each and every individual item. The combat system can be pretty fun, giving you different attacks with melee weapons, skill checks to reload ranged weapons faster, and even special attack abilities. There are a TON of items in game to make you feel like a pirate such as grappling hooks, throwing knives, arming yourself with a bunch of flintlock pistols to avoid reloading, sea shanties and of course GROG! There are a number of great design concepts being implemented constantly such as server wide trading systems. The game has a great role-play to it with handcuffing, imprisoning and even executing other players. All and all you WILL have fun playing this game, until you run into some of the following issues….

So for starters this game has been out for early access for two years and I feel there’s still a long road ahead before it’s ever finished. Let’s talk about the content and things to do which include some main story quests, killing ships at sea, taking over pirate camps, and hunting buried treasure. When it comes to quest content and pirate camps, mobs are a big problem. The difficulty level of everything is, IMO, way out of proportion and even after turning the difficulty down we still ran into mobs 2-3 times our levels (at 40hrs in we’ve yet to even get one part of the main story done, but have taken over some pirate camps). The pirate camps were still doable but took ridiculous amounts of resources and time and TBH without admin commands wouldn’t have been possible since there are mobs inside buildings that you can’t get into (without hacking at the door for a millennia). Then Sadly after taking over a pirate camp you have nothing to show for it besides a few buildings and crafting stations, I.e. no loot at all (like wtf are pirates doing held up with no loot?). Killing ships out at sea once you have a boat is super fun, but again unrewarding when you only get like 50-100 gold per ship…. Speaking of having your ship, building your own ship at your custom made shipyard makes you pay gold and the first “real” ship you’ll have, the schooner, will cost you 5k (the next ship after that 15k) gold and a butt load of resources. So, the last thing on the stuff to do list, treasure hunting, ends up being the only way to actually make money. Granted it is fun to find random maps and painstakingly track down the island its on, but then you show up and undead soldiers spawn. Usually they aren’t a problem and when you get better with combat they can be pretty easy, but they can sometimes glitch and go back to full hp or worse yet, you go far away enough from the loot that when you come back into radius is spawns more… Then there’s all the little nuances out there that occur that just make life hell right down to servers crashing and save files being corrupted and having to restart everything.

To summarize this all up; you will have a lot of fun playing this game especially if you got it on a super sale. I hope that it will be finished one day, cause when that day comes it will be a truly amazing",1609211132,1609211132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 the only method of obtaining gold thats even remotley worth it is sunken chests and thoes get forced spawned sharks and whales... the ships move so slow it literally takes hours to go from zone to zone.

there is no safe spaces to store your gold. islands are owned by mega tribes and some islands cant even be built on or claimed. the next best ship from the start piece of garbage is 5000 gold and youd be lucky to spend 8 hours to obtain 400 gold that uou will most likley loose.

all the company's are toxic and its clear this game has been nefariouslyb designed by devs who clearly hate new players coming into the game.

full of bugs and glitches this game makes ark survival evolved look like a polished project. 
their latest update has sent players running and im glad it only cost me 5 dollars to find out why.

what an insult to player everwhere. this game is pay to play and the devs insult all of us with this poorly designed, buggy, exploit filled joke of a game. 

what an extremely toxic time sink.

Sketchup pro , and Blender when the double faces are removed using the Large Ship Yard in the program. 971 faces removed for the Noobs that dont know MSH, MDL, and INI files.

Reduce the cost for ships or turn up the rates of gold and if you dont want to do that bring it back to season 3 with gold rates and ways to get gold.

The positives of this game are, plenty of content, building boats and sailing and be a pirate are a lot of fun, claiming lands and getting a tax from others make the grind a bit better, and there is really no survival MMO like  it. While the dev team is working on adding some new content what this game actually needs is a complete revamp. Here are the negative things that have basically killed the player base. The devs rewarded the massive companies and made it impossible for a solo or even small company to play and progress. If you joined a big company or allied with a big company then you would have a better chance at progression. The game is massive so plan on spending most of your time just traveling on a boat in the water, I would say 2 hours of traveling gets you about 30 minutes worth of real content. The worst part is the devs are doubling down on keeping this game for big companies and only adding content to help instead of revamping the game for small companies. I more than likely will not play this game as I believe the devs will never fix they game breaking bugs and they will never cater to both small and large companies.

I never bothered with the quests because we were a small guild and didn't stand a chance - but that was fine, too.
However, since the new map was released i find this game is no longer playable. Large guilds keep hogging all of the lawless regions which causes the servers to lag. Players who just start out their journeys or small guilds that cannot afford their own islands cannot build bigger ships there or live there - there is simply no room and it lags too much.

They're excuse is 'well 2 weeks of getting fucked with.'

The game is pretty much split into a handful of big blob companies that control massive parts of the game. If you want to be Robinson Crusoe look elsewhere as being solo in this game is nigh impossible, I tried. These big zerg companies are all fitted out with mythic ships and the best mounts in the game, so you're already behind the curve as a new player. 

If you join a company with stuffed you already built, and eventually later down the road you decide to leave, all your shit belongs to the company. You better hope they let you off with your stuff. 

So what do people do in Atlas? I was in a medium sized blob with increasing numbers in size but inactivity. It was every person for themselves, except for the breeder. If the breeder/tamer left, people left the guild as well. So this game is like Farmville except you steal people's stuff and the other half you're complaining about not enough people on.


Would I play this game as heavily as I once did? No, I didn't even bother laying reviews about the bugs. Just talking about the (lackof) community.

PvE is unplayable at this moment. Doesn't matter what grid you're in, you will lag. Every 6 steps forward is 8 steps back. Check the official forums to see other players complaining, Wildcard/Grapeshot is doing their best to get rid of PvE to force everyone into PvP.

PvP is still another barrel tossing fest where Mega Companies will wipe the floor of you.

PVE is dead. I bought this game because it was showcased, tagged, and described as a MMO with a sandbox style map w/PVP features. Now, it is a horrible MOBA/PVP at sea and keeps getting worse. As well as them adding in features to monetize and add micro-transactions later on in the future. This is not what we paid for and you can't just say it's EA every patch update to make it sound like you didn't rip off the majority of the player base by gutting the PVE elements and making it impossible for small groups to play. Just take the MMO and PVE tags out of the description. You can't even play this single player anymore either. 

Original: They ruined this game. It is just becoming a carbon copy of Sea of Thieves with better graphics. I am a fan of PVP, but the game is completely unbalanced by eliminating all PVE elements in a MMORPG pirating game. They have stopped updating the PVE servers, broken most of the features in the game, and rarely respond to the community in forums when they have questions about the direction of the game. Had started playing this game as it had the elements Sea of Thieves has been lacking. It was fantastic until I realized they were trying to phase out all PVE elements in favor of the PVP features. Initially, the gameplay was more balanced between both PVE and PVP elements making it fun to play as an MMO in both public and private servers. The last few months have made me regret investing into this game early access as the developers do not care about their community base to the point that their patches would wipe all of your save data every few weeks.

(2020 Review update) After a good while of playing Atlas and after many changes made by the dev team.like merging console and pc servers.seeing so many players leave the game so quickly you have to wonder why?

Bad decisions and choices by the devs,Maybe content was slow to come out and then suddenly we have lots of updates and new things to do. but for me this games early successes are far behind them and the new content tho nice does not change much really and not enough for me to insatll and return to the game.Over all ark is the better game imo 7.8K hours on there tells that story. though im not going to beet up on this game i love the building and taming,skill trees are great the sailing the oceans is alot of fun if youve never played it i would pick it up in the sales.if like me you have seen and played enough to know whats what.you really have not lost much /)",1546662281,1608846171,True,1,1,0.33943861722946167,0,True,False,True

Now I am angrier than I have been in a very long time. They have decided to implement a very stupid system. The trading system. They claim it is meant to be your main source of gold income. However, after toying around with it, I have found that you are forced to trade resources between players, even if you do not need or want them. On top of that, the gold produced by this system is a pittance. With several trade routes you make around 100 gold per hour.

Alright, fine. Maybe you don't want to partake in such a system? Maybe you want to be a pirate as this game advertised? Unfortunately, they have made it so that in order to build the SMALLEST practical shop you NEED to pay 5000 gold. That means waiting for fifty hours for the market to produce the gold needed to build the SMALLEST ship. A ship that can be lost in a matter of moments in PVP.

So, your choice is now to float around in an impractical ship that has no weapons trying to farm up gold (most of which they have removed in order to FORCE players into using their stupid market system) or sit around and wait for 50 hours to get your first real ship that you're likely to lose in less than a day. This is one of the dumbest choices for a game development team to make. You don't force players to use your new systems.

On top of this they have shrunk the map from 25x25 (the original map laid out like an actual globe, with polar regions at the top and bottom, the region types getting warmer as you head to the middle where the equatorial regions laid) to 11x11 where the region types are now laid out in quartered regions which MAKES NO SENSE. This dev team appears to be purposefully trying to kill their own game.

It has so many amazing gameplay features, but until they get the lag issues worked out I can't recommend it.  This is a visually stunning, extremely engaging game that is absolutely ruined by poor technical execution.  It's not very fun to spend days building a ship only to have it demolished by the NPC pirates because while your ship is lagged out and not moving they get to unload volley after volley of cannons on you, but you say to yourself ""That was probably a 1 time occurrence since you've played almost 100 hours and that's the first time it happened.""  Only to spend an entire day rebuilding the ship and have it destroyed in the exact same manor on it's very first voyage out...  Possibly more frustrating, is that this game seems to be bipolar between working really well one session and being absolute garbage another.  The lag problems also affect player motion, so you run to the front of your ship and then get teleported back to where you were 10 seconds ago but now you are sprinting and run off the side of your ship/building/mountain.

When I first saw it on the steam store I loved the concept of it, but the reviews scared me a little bit. I ended up trying it out and obviously loved it. Honestly, the best game I've ever played. I'm giving this game a 5-star rating because I think the other reviews don't give it a fair shake. I believe most of the other reviews are based on the multiplayer servers, which I have not even tried, and they totally miss the quality of the single player game mode. That explains my rating; however, if the reviews weren't unfair as they are, I would give the rating I believe the game deserves, 4.5 stars. Regardless, this game is certainly worth a buy if you like the concept presented in the trailer at all, even if it cost 2 times as much to play as I paid for it. I would give it a rating of 4.5 stars because what you can do in the game is absolutely what I expected from the trailer but even better. What takes it down from a 5 star rating is their are still some bugs I've experienced that result in me not being able to spawn on my ship even when it has a bed on it, and it won't even show up on the map like it is gone, but it will still be there. Outside of that the issue is mostly just that its a harder game to play than I expected, but for the most part that actually makes me value the ships I build, and the progress I make  much more, giving me a better experience. Although because of that, I can see how losing your progress to something unfair would be infuriating, but that hasn't happened to me. With that, on single player maps you can change the difficulty by messing with the settings and such to customize the difficulty how you see fit. The only actual feature of the game that I don't love is the heat waves/ dying from heat or cold. I like what it tries to do, but I think it just makes gameplay overall less enjoyable for the few minutes heat waves last because, at least in my experience, I will die during a heat wave unless i swim like 20 feet under water and stop moving except to get air for the duration of the heat wave. It just sucks to kill a bunch of pirates and be fine and then die from a heat wave. Its not the struggle I wanted to go against in the game and honestly its taken to a degree that's just unrealistically difficult; I understand extreme temperatures can be lethal in real life but come on, I should not die from overheating if I'm doing no work prone in water with no clothes on, at the worst it would just be uncomfortable. Luckily the heat waves aren't too frequent and you can move to cooler climates so it's not really a big issue for me. If I wanted to cover how fantastic literally everything else is this review would be a book so you'll just have to take my word for it. Give the game a try, and for the developers my only request is to make some type of settings slider for temperature damage or something that allows me to have less trouble with heat waves, and to keep working on fixing the bugs in the game.

Base and Ship building are awesome as well as the battles on sea. Game don't focus on hard resource gathering since it got a farmhouse which farm for players but you will have to give a lot of time on sea voyage. Recommendation is reduce the numbers of Ship of the dammed on each location lol too many of them spawning everywhere. If possible add some neutral ships like npc ships where you can fight and take loot during your sea adventure makes me feel like a real pirate. Add like npc/board quest maybe on free ports which give like basic missions not sure if there are mods like this one though. There are some bugs but if you can handle it then overall game is for you.

    Gameplay is just like ARK in almost every way. Level, skill up. That’s it. 

DIFFICULTY: 

    Difficulty is what you make it. If you only build it’ll be easy. If you combat it can be difficult depending on what you’re doing 

LAG: 

    Official is not the way to go. You will have days it’s good in your sector but others may be rubbish. Private is where it’s at. The game is enhanced way more by your private servers of 5x5 or more. Any less and you have shit. Just being honest. Less than 5 x 5 has virtually no exploration, no events, and generally not enough for every biome unless the private server host is smart. Even then that’s cutting it small. 

CONTENT: 

    Content is what you make of it just like ARK. There are end boss’ and such but the real game is what you make of it. Survive and trade with other people. Do wars, etc. This game is open to a lot of things, it doesn’t hold your hand though. You do what you want and if you’re board, it’s your own fault, you haven’t expanded enough to make things to do for yourself. 

NAVY: 

    SoTD (Ships of the Damned) will depend on your private server. On Official they are a joke. On Privates you will get the jokes and luckily you have a good admin that adds more. Winters Haven is good for this. The server Owner creates mods and has multiple play fields with multiple grids. Server is boosted but the enemies in the end game are also boosted for balancing. This is rare but this particular owner also has multiple play fields with multiple grids. 

PROGRESSION: 

    This game in official definitely has a sense of accomplishment. Private servers it depends but a good admin (most) will make sure the end game is where it’s at and not the initial BS of just leveling. Leveling even on official could max out in 3 days (did it, tested, not difficult) but it’s the end game that will keep you coming back. Kraken etc. 

CUSTOMIZATION: 

    It’s ARK on steroids. 

    If you’re not familiar with ARK, it’s customizable down to what you can construct with your imagination. I won’t go further, just if you imagine it and it doesn’t happen, it’s your own skills holding you back. Watch videos, you can make some epic things for yourself. Only thing holding you back here is you. 

    CHARACTER: In caps because I know want to know this. It’s not advanced. Typical character creation, no more or less then say ES: Skyrim or Mass Effect. You will likely look like any other settler with minor changes. If you are only looking at character creation this game isn’t for you. This game is more for base building, ship building, and creativity outside your main character. 

 

BEYOND LEVEL PROGRESSION: 

    This game is not entirely built on just leveling your character. Your character level, as it were, means nothing. 

    Blueprints for equipment means more than level, if you can use it, a cloth set say master can help you out more than metal if the blueprint allows it. 

    Powerstones are a thing, it’s “endgame” but not the most difficult, there is more past that but it’s a part of it. They give you boosts in things. 

CRAFTERS:  

    This is your dream, like ARK. If you can imagine it, the only failure is yourself. If something isn’t working right, it’s likely that you haven’t thought of the work around. * Want half wall shelves, you haven’t thought to use half wall walls instead of full walls first*. The game is very much customizable on buildings. 

    SHIPS: Be creative based on what you’re trying to do. You can make a warship but if you’re trying to make it “pretty” it’ll likely fail. Think armor for warships, think pretty for transport. This game allows customization, think impact not look when doing some things. 

Emersion:  

    It has it but it depends what you think of it. Story wise, no. Very few quests, not what this game is designed for. This is a open world, players run everything type of game. No storyboard minus tutorial. Trading, market (if anyone even has it) are all run by players. Most trade is done just in chat, no vendors really for this. Players can create vendors but it requires someone to know where you are and check it. You’re better off advertising if this is what you’re doing. Even then, it’s slim unless you have what someone else needs. (Bank on laziness, not what’s easy.) 

MISC: 

    There is taming just like ARK, it’s different, but it’s a thing. More active than ARK. No knock outs, animals can still attack while being tamed here. MOST tames that mean something here require an aggressive trap and feed tactic where they can still hit you even after trapping. 

    The game requires more survival. It’s not just food and water, it’s also evening out vitamins. You can’t just eat 100% one food here, you need herbs, fruits, fish type/or milk, and meats. You can kill yourself literally by just eating one type of vitamin. 

SUMMARY: 

    Good for people that want to craft things. 

    Not good for those wanting just call of duty or something with just killing. 

    Typical gameplay not a thing here. 

    PvP requires thought, not just running, killing, respawn, repeat. 

    PvE requires virtually nothing, mostly just aesthetics. 

 

ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY: 

    I have to add this as I have this. This game should be avoided if you have an addictive personality. Not because it’s not good but because it will consume you. This game has so much with it that you’ll figure you have to do everything. It’s not the case but if you have this type of attitude, you know that’s not how we work. I’m already addicted and not leaving but as a far warning, that’s what it will do. The game is about efficiency and organization in our minds, it doesn’t end. The game is great but it’ll take a toll. Just a fair warning for those that know what I’m talking about. In two weeks, I’m at 200+ hours, mostly reorganizing things.",1607759940,1607759940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Survival was the focus, and climbing up from struggling to feed yourself was a glorious feeling.  Taking to the open ocean felt AMAZING, even on a small raft.  It was visceral and enjoyable and the scenery and sounds were beautiful, and with the open ocean it felt like you could sit back and enjoy the quiet hours, punctuated by pulse pounding encounters with other players.

Then they added Ship of the damned.  You literally can't sail in a straight line for more than 2 minutes without having to weave between endless hordes of death ships that respawn so quickly that you'll never encounter a zone not absolutely clogged with them.  It ruined the aesthetic of the game, it ruined the experience of exploring the open ocean, and it made it an absolute nightmare for anyone without a full crew to even do trade runs from point A to point B.  The point of the game was player driven interactions, instead we get this mess.

However, I was also there in the beginning.  I didn't get this game for its PVP aspect or the fact its online.  I got this game to play with family and friends locally.  It has delivered on everything I've asked for and not just due to it being an early access game.  Many features are here and the fact I can create my own server for free and play online with friends and family make the game very enjoyable.  I also play its big brother ARK in this manner.

We've built ships, leveled up our characters, leveled our skills, tamed animals, rode those animals, made farms, explored only a small portion of the vast ocean and even encountered some island dwellers(AI).  (Who were not impressed by our presence.)  We'll go back to them once our weapons improve. =)

Does the game crash and burn at times?  I'm not sure as it hasn't on us.  Does the game need some optimization?  Sure.  Is the UI a bit clunky? Yeah.  Does the game work and offer a fun experience?  Heck yes it does! Building our first raft and putting a couple (game) days worth of supplies on it and and exploring the islands felt like a real adventure.  The wife, kids and I have had a positive and enjoyable experience in this game.  We don't get to fight others in a PVP setting, but that's not why we got this game.  Instead we wanted that escape of being pirates and exploring different islands all while building, crafting and leveling up characters and skills.  I remember our first time encountering other ships on the vast ocean! Scary! Exciting!

We all have enjoyed the game and really have no complaints.  Maybe that's because we aren't playing online against others.  Is this or does this remind me of an ARK reskin and repackage?

Here you spend literally days or weeks of work grinding to get gold and resources for a decent ship which you pour you're heart into and then you sail into another zone and by the time you've loaded the boat is sank and everything is lost because a fleet of npc damned ships was just across the border that there is no possible way you could see or avoid. It was bad enough before but since the high end ships now cost insane amounts of gold and as every island is covered in farms making it impossible to set up your own markets and trade routes which is supposed to be the new focus of a lot of the game it's just not worth the time to play.

Sure the game has things it needs fixing but if it didn't it wouldn't be in early access. It really is DLC for Ark that they sold as a stand alone and they should be caned for that. They probably didn't want to have to rebalance everything in Ark to match it or try to work it into the story line. It really isn't a game for solo'ers but on PvE it is doable. For those that don't want weeks of hard work squashed/stolen in minutes then PvP isn't for you (as it isn't for me-I don't like breaking other people's things so I'm not leaving mine out to be broken). With the new claim system, it seems to have addressed the available land issue, at least on the server I'm on (official PvE now). The map is vast and although they do recycle the islands a lot there is still a ton of variety. I can't speak for PvP servers but in my experience, nearly everyone I've ran into is a positive experience, not negative. I do get the occasional arsehole but they are few and far between in my experience...so far...

EDIT: They released Atlas on xbox  now PC and xbox players can play together. On my server (NA PVE) and probably the other officials too, the population has exploded, pre xbox release, I had 15 people in my grid MAX at one time, now the grid has 25 on an average day and I've seen 50 a few times. Def a breath of life back into the game after wipes.

Edit after marketplace patch: There are currently three types of PvE player: ""Type 1"" got a warehouse and farms down on day 1 and has full access to trading. ""Type 2"" Is in a company that has market place, warehouse and farms but not personally their's. This player either relies on the charity of the Type 1's in the company to fund ship building, they can try to contribute by hand gathering and adding their drop of resources to the ocean of stores in the warehouse. Should they not rely on the charity of their company they are just like ""Type 3"": The Sloop Lord, This player didn't get the core buildings down on day 1 and now there is nowhere to put one at all ever again this season. They must tame bears to do maps from their sloops and/or do shipwrecks until they can afford a better boat.

Still recommend game but they are really trying my patience. At every turn they make the game more unplayable especially for the PvEers.

Played Conan Exile really did not like the non AI.

Played Atlas, and I like Atlas just increase gravity players bounce too much (ytou can fall off a mountain and it does not kill you, but your ship collision something at 10 miles an hour and it sinks) 
Also some tames are ridiculous, there should be a version without tames, like at most the one you can carry, horses and that's it, no elephants and bears, not very realistic. Be fun to have a version with the earth map and only real thing no myth no bonuses etc...

The boats need a total remake, you guys should buy Naval Action and put the boats in the game, boats are like totally unbalanced, second take off the ramming that is completely ridiculous boats ramming at 10 knots would not do damage if there out at sea they would bounce not stick to each other... if they are anchored or pressed against a structure then that would do damage.

I will probably post additional reviews with time but if you liked Ark, you will absolutely love this game!! As for MMO I have no idea and don't intend to try it. I personally don't like getting looted or having my base wiped, that is unfortunately what you sign up for when playing MMO, there is no need to judge a game on MMO when most titles offer you that PVP experience.

This is going to be an extensive positive review for those adventurous souls who are considering joining the ATLAS. It is sad to see off course experienced players leaving ATLAS with bitterness after playing hundreds of hours. I hope your comments and reasons for leaving will guide developers in their creation and we will see you back at the helm of your ships again.
The game is still in the early access stage. On PVP servers along with bugs ATLAS also attracts individuals of a certain type (I would call them ‘true pirates’) who make life of ‘wannabe good pirates’ miserable. I have being playing PVE Ocean only so far and therefore cannot comment about PVP experience. PVE however is not a truly pirate game it is actually a survivor game.
Your journey becomes significantly thorny and dangerous as soon as you leave a Freeport on a ramshackle sloop or a raft. Aggressive AI characters and hostile environment attack you everywhere you sail. Those ventures are not for everyone though. Some players will readily sheath their swords right there (see negative comments with less than 50 playing hours) proclaiming ATLAS on forums and YouTube the ‘worst game ever’. Others after first shocks will collect themselves, tame animals, earn some gold and hire NFCs to help with the basic survival and goals’ achievements. Every time you overcome a challenge your confidence, experience and game enjoyment will grow. In your endeavours you will admire the stunning scenery of ATLAS: sunsets and sunrises, ocean and forest, giant ancient statues and mysterious ghost towns, even tropical heatwaves and periodical cyclones - I love all of it. New players just look at some of the published screenshots. You are going to experience it yourself. 
There is so much freedom in ATLAS to live your pirate life in your own way from your unique ship and base configuration to taming animals’ strategies, conquering AI pirate camps, fighting ships of the damned and treasure guards. It is impossible to squeeze everything ATLAS offers in a few paragraphs. How about the massive rich subaquatic world which is also waiting for you to be explored with a submarine in a later game? 
As many negative reviewers complained about I also lost my advances during the Maelstrom update. It happened when I finally solo built a galleon (experienced players would appreciate the amount of work) on a legendary shipyard with five different types of resources collected (experienced players would appreciate the amount of travel) and painted it. What a beauty she was!  I do not enable cheats or use cheat-like mods and that’s why everything I owned was earned with my own virtual blood and sweat.
Nowadays I live on a schooner with ever helpful monkey, four loyal pigs, five dumb-and-dumber crew and am looking for a place to settle down. It may take a while. No regrets though. Bring me that horizon. I wish everyone in the ATLAS community to have wind in your sails and a hand's breadth of water under your keel. 

Ahoy Path... (or should we now be called merchants and fur traders lost in a pirate game?)
Let's use our pathfinding skills to search for disappearing farmhouses, outhouses, warehouses and whatever else our developing fathers are going to introduce and then hide from us in the future. By the way placing the Jolly Roger on the wall doesn't induce the wind mill with the pirate spirit.
Despite Grapeshot's new vision and relentless attempts to divert the game from its original roots to some sort of Hudson's Bug Trading Company, I have to confess, I love the game very much. I can only hope that someday the full potential will be released and the game will be finally developed. Below I will be referring to the SP Ocean experience and thoughts.
Take abandoned buildings and ancient ruins and give them a life. Put treasure chests there, guard them with spiders, ants, snakes, rats and let us enjoy exploring those sites that are already in the game.
Gold spending problem. There are means of earning the gold. Gold for ships? No problem. With a schooner players can get 25-50K without much hustle, but give them a choice to build or to buy the ship from the Freeport.
How about NFCs? Can they have special abilities? Hiring sailor cost 5G. Fine. Sailor-range unit-10G. Sailor-melee-10G. sailor-ranged-melee-20G. Their hourly wages should be also higher. Sailor-ranged unit will have different mentality, trying to target the enemy from the distance contrary to the current state when crossbowman rushes upfront to receive a devastating blow from the high level heavily armed enemy pikeman.
Would it be nice to use NFCs for some tasks on the shore when the ship is anchored? How about sailor-carpenter who may lower the amount of building materials or sailor-musician for instance. Presently I have installed the mod which uses NFCs to gather resources. And guess what-it does not require a wipe.
Now it's my dream: having NFC to captain the ship. Imagine hiring the captain from the Freeport for 100G who can take over the second and third ships of your fleet to transport goods and sell them at the ports. What a nice additional source of income.
Wild pirates camps. This one requires serious effort-reward balancing. There is a miserable reward for capturing the flag of the pirate camp. Player needs to make a plan how to approach the camp and use their available forces wise. It is hard to compare the efforts on defeating the fortified camp (including the ship in the open sea) to the simple beating up a disorganised gang of the treasure guards. After clearing my island from the pirates I am not compelled anymore to fight them elsewhere. Simply no point.
New ships. People were asking for them since the game was launched. Beware of what you are wishing for. developers just demonstrated what you are going to get: non-customisable trough that should be nominated for the ugliest ship of all times. Present game has four ship platforms: sloop, schooner, brigantine and galleon. On each of these platforms player can build exploration ship, fighting ship, transport, etc. All ships that you build are unique and suite your particular needs and style of play. One's imagination is a limit in shipbuilding here. Let's keep it this way at least for now. There are so many issues to address before that.
Enough wishful thinking. Happy sailing friends!

Atlas could take some tips from Conan Exiles building system. Locking ships behind collecting gold seems like an unnecessary bottle neck. It just doesn't feel much like a pirate game. Real game mechanic, ""You have to beat up that parrot to 20% health before you can bola it and try to tame it"".

Over the past couple years they have done very little in the way of significant updates, bug fixes and balancing. During this time, they've added in shitty unbalanced and buggy additions, removed them and then readded them back in months or years later with all of the original balance problems and bugs still intact. 

This absolutely is not a pirate game. Instead of fighting at sea with ships, 99% of your fights take place on islands using janky melee combat, guns and tames. Creature taming is way out of balance and creates incredibly overpowered critters that can rip apart players by the dozens. 

The devs also have absolutely no respect for players time or life balance on the official servers. If you claim an island, then your combat window is 9 hours long and you need people online throughout the duration to successfully defend your claim from any competent players because the automated defenses have been nerfed until they are useless. A single horse or bear with a cannon cart can level an entire island no matter how well defended by npcs. If you want to try breeding, then I hope you have a long weekend with nothing planned except playing this game. You'll need to set alarms for every few hours over the next couple of days to log in to feed and imprint newborns. You can't even have guild members do that part for you.

its buggy af, but its an early access, and its what you sign up for when you buy it
me and my friends made a private server just for us to mess around in, amazing times, lots of fun
im a real big fan of boats, and making my own ships is amazing, i would really recommend this to anyone who has played sea of thieves. boat physics are less good, and interacting with the ship overall is different from SOT, but building your own ship and making stupid shit on it makes it worth the hiccups.
unlike SOT, the commitement to the game is a bit more long term, you wont get very far in a one hour session, and if your base is unprotected, it could get sent to oblivion, so if you are the type to play games for a quick round of PVP, this isnt what you are looking for.

the latest content of the farms, market system too are not complete or functioning properly.  

players are now required to pay gold to construct any ships above the sloop, 5000 gold for a schooner, 25000 for a brig and 50000 for a galleon.  with the current state of performance of the servers, too much risk of losing that investment and the devs wont do anything to return lost items because there is no support.  There are more broken systems in game like treasure maps.

You will probably think i am far too new at this game with my 20 hours in it to complain but...

After building a nice base, taming a good group of pigs and bears for around 20 hours, i saw far away an Alpha lion tearing down his way on the opposite beach, then it swam directly to my place and killed every tame i had in less time than i took to write it, teared my base down and killed me like i was an ant...

In those 20 hours i also got good pigs stuck in pirate buildings, with the impossibility to get them out, i have had 2 or 3 crashes and died countless times of overheating in heat waves with no way to escape it even in the water...

I really wanted to love this game since i am a real fan of Ark, where i have over 2000 hours of game time but i realize how poorly balanced this ""mod"" is.

And yes, i will call it a mod, not a game, but just a badly made mod out of ark.

I am very, very, very disappointed.

Game Overall: 2/10
Atlas used to be a pirating game where ships where sailed and land was claimed, but everything could be lost just as fast as it was acquired. Now it's first come, first serve with very little chance of claiming land from another player and sailing is a distant dream if you don't play with a mega company.

Gathering resources: 1/10
This game is very resource heavy because everything in the game takes resources to make. It used to be that you had to physically gather all the resources on an island either by hand or with a mount, both of which took time to sail to said island, gather the material, haul it back to your ship, and sail back. Now you have a building collect it all for you nonstop, it transfers the material to another building for storage, and you have a third building that automatically buys/trades what you don't want for something that you do. It will also automatically sail a ship to pick it up and drop it off as long as you have one available. To me a game that is resource heavy should require gathering but not an excessive amount, and should give you a way to make it easier to gather said resources (which is what the mounts did).

Map Size and Population: 2/10
The map has taken a major hit in size and island count. It used to be a 15x15 grid with island types dispersed relatively evenly. Now it's an 11x11 with claimable (main game) islands on the outside, and the lawless islands (unclaimable beginning islands) making a ring around the golden age ruins (early endgame islands). The center of the grid has no island and is where the Kraken spawns (endgame). The devs also decided to combine the European PvE server with the North American PvE serve. This combined with the smaller map in general made the PvE server way overcrowded.

Ship Building and Sailing: 3/10
Ship building has always been a joke when it came to customization. You have a standard frame and pieces that you can't change for every size of ship, and everything has a predesignated spot where it snaps into place. The only things you can customize are where you add on parts that aren't part of the hull (which weighs down the ship), the design on the sails, and you can also purchase figure heads and different sail shapes from an NPC in town for gold. Hiring or picking up crew is basically a necessity to sail anything bigger than a sloop, but having a crew costs gold and consumes food over time. Both of which are hard to maintain in decent amounts of you aren't part of a company. 

Skills and Crafting: 5/10
The only good thing I can say about this game is the skill tree and crafting mechanics actually make sense. You need to learn how tame an animal before you can ride said animal. You have to learn how to make stone tools before making metal ones. Bows and throwing weapons before guns and explosives. That being said the skill point/experience earning system is way out of wack and it's a complete grind to get the last 10 or so levels

Game Connectivity: 0/10
The lag in this game is absolutely unreal, with some grids getting so bad they became a ""no mans land"" because you couldn't go into them without your computer completely freezing up and booting you from the game. The cause for this kind of extreme lag is do to players building ridiculously large bases that had 1000's upon 1000's of pieces to them, each piece needing to be loaded in when you go into the grid. Every floor, wall, ceiling, and roof piece, everything that you placed on the floor inside and out of the base. Everything needed to load before you could continue sailing, and god forbid you had to land at any of the islands.",1605367617,1605367617,False,3,0,0.528059720993041992,0,True,False,True

ATLAS is the ONLY game that has these crash issues. Devs broke Atlas imho. Using Windows 10 Business with latest updates, nvidia latest drivers, 1080 Ti. Game is unplayable. Same error every time. D3D device lost. Line 201!  

4/2/2020: I switched my review to a thumbs up BUT please read through this review so you don't go in blind. Its fun but many parts are super broken. LAG and countless wasted man hours being the top 2. Cheers! Stay safe, be smart!  

You've been warned. 

Cons: 
1) Constantly changing! One week things work this way and the next they work differently often costing you dozens of man hours. *NO ONE likes their time wasted!  
2) Mega orgs ruined the mega patch with collonies by breaking themselves up and raiding smaller orgs with <=50 players. Massive workaround exploit that ruined the entire official pvp experience. 
3) VERY limited ships available: sloop, schooner, brig, galleon. 
4) massively imbalanced official pvp server. huge waste of time for anyone not in a large org. 
5) smaller characters have smaller hit boxes or no hit boxes it seems. Ive shot video recording how hard they are to hit their hit boxes including not hit feedback at all after several rounds that were dead on. 
6) a small org can spend 200, 300, 400, 500+ man hours and it can all be wiped over night if they arent online, which requires logging in 7 days a week for 9 hours a day. So goodbye life for several org members.  
7) Semi poor frame-rates on a 9900k @ 5.125Ghz, 1080 Ti @ 2050Ghz, 32GB 3200Mhz ram.
8) Horrible server lag during pvp encounters.
9) Taming is broken. One day it works the next it doesn't. Animals wont eat and they clip through walls getting in the way of other tames or projects, etc. 
10) Try to play single player and at default things are OP as all heck. Couple bites insta-kills ya taming. Sotd constantly spawning dead in front of you. Like could it break immersion anymore?!
11) The ""predator"" faction all run around next to each other and dont attack each other. so broken. Cobras and tigers and lions etc move all around each other without a care in the world. Broke!      
12) Logged in to find my last brig, a galleons worth of expense brig gone because I forgot to climb onto it across a couple weeks because I was busy building and hunting. EPIC FAIL DEVS! One more example of wasted time.
 13) This bug has existed for over a year and still not fixed. Sometimes when you empty a tames inventory it moves SUPER slow and it wont fix unless you put anything back into its inventory. 
14) Pistol draw has gotten really slow. I use to be able to press 2 keys at the same time and draw dual pistols and fire away. Now I'm lucky if even 1 pistol draws and fires. Has greatly hindered combat.
15) Night and day are too short. If you blink you probably just missed a full night or day cycle. 
16) Characters age far too fast. Seems like every several days its back to the fountain of youth death runs. Which btw fountains of youth need heavily balanced.
17) In single player on the world map the location for your ship vs the location of your red arrow do not match half the time. Many times my ship symbol is being shown in a far off grid, not even close to where I am at.
18) SEVERAL single player game crashes to desktop when transitioning from one area to another. Log back in and dead with no ship, no tames, no equipment, and forced to respawn back at a bed somewhere. HOURS of sailing lost trying to get around the world and no quick way to get back to where you were. Several times I sailed back to find my ship and its nowhere to be found. Literally lost a few hundred hours of game progress because of full mythical ship builds and equipment with high end tames GONE... FOREVER! Gaming experiences do not get worst than this!
19) Temperatures are all over the place. Crazy high highs in cold climates and crazy low lows in warm climates. Temps hit 145F insta-killing you even in water, high end fortitude, correct armor, and high health!! Its designed to make players fail vs have fun and be CHALLENGING! A challenge doesn't mean imminent failure. It means to provide resistance/obstacle that must be overcome through intelligence and/or performance. When you make it so that the resistance/obstacle automatically = failure you rob the player of fun, potentially rewarding experiences and a negative experience is remembered vs a fun one. Essentially as developers you shoot yourselves in the foot regarding the player base. Think of auto lose situations as being critical in a relationship. They wound, damage, cause suffering, aren't fun and leave the player base greatly disappointed or down right ticked off.
20) Rain showers don't put out camp fires or open cooking pot fires (Grills excluded because they're semi-covered)! :O
21) Resource Silo on lawless islands is not feeding and paying crew.
22) Single player game crashes and now treasure map collecting doesnt work. Endless bugs!
23) I die on a powerstone island. Respawn to over 100+ animals spawned in on the shore. Whole island was swarming with animals and caused MASSIVE lag. Yet another bug! Endless bugs!
24) Official NA-pvp/pve & single player all take far too long to breed tames. 24+ hours straight. CRAZY!
25) Auto fire (V) on ships is horrible now. It use to be good but not it works so poorly its not even worth using. Wasted function. Countless times my ship turned right past a sotd and not a single top deck cannon crewman fired a cannon when all were 100% ready to go. Even in single player they dont fire correctly. Sometimes a few fire but the rest don't and all had clear shots. It isnt just an online official server lag issue. Its at least a part code issue.     
                 
 
- I gave the game months to improve yet it still kept the same flaws: huge balance issues and a crippling work/reward element.  

Pros: 
1) Base building was a ton of fun.
2) Ship building, pre large cannon placement nerf, was a ton of fun.  
2) Taming was a ton of fun. 
3) Sailing was a ton of fun. 
4) Ships of the damn hunting was fun. 
5) Hunting in the wild was fun though kinda lack luster.  
6) Loved the hand gliding pre-encumberance nerf. 
7) Love the mountain climbing. Mad fun!
8) Great graphics IF you can max them, otherwise looks horrid, imo. 

Otherwise I wish the players within and the development team the best. I truly hope they find their vision and that it is successful. Cheers. D.C.

9/28/2019 post NA/PvP wipe: install size 116 GB!! Fresh review update with this latest wipe will be coming which will include the latest updates to the game and the new Xbox cross-play implementation on Oct 8th, 2019.

2/28/2020, Killing time waiting for the Coronavirus to pass. Games still broken. Left for Christmas break and when the wife and I got back around New Years a few hundred hours of work was gone (NA-PvE). If people cant take vacations for holidays games busted. You have to live on the game to provide enough food for your tames, specially meat eaters. Even in the Tundra and colder meat spoils super fast in A FREEZER environment. It's mind blowing. Still an interesting game to tinker with if ya like to build and mess around a little but end game and general game balance is still broken.

3/8/2020 Stopped playing official due to constant lag issues and obtaining enough gold as a single/small org player became too time consuming. Kept losing crew to not being paid. Tired of chasing down more crew every few days. Whales are too far away to get gold from them, or the treasure maps I find give me chump change for the time involved. Playing local and private servers now where rates have been slightly increased to be more worth my time.

Worth $15 but massively broken end game issues. Parts of the game are still fun but the broken elements are destroying this title.",1560558212,1605221073,True,0,0,0.501173853874206543,0,True,False,True

Other than that, though, this is really just a complete clone of ARK: Survival Evolved with a few minor changes and worse taming. Sailing is fun if you have a few other people with you, but a nightmare alone. Resource management is incredibly difficult, especially since on of the most important materials in the game, metal, is somewhat rare and can only be harvested by hand. The vitamin system feels shoehorned in and doesn't add anything but frustration to the game and I havent found any way to disable it except by using the infinte stats cheat, which makes it so that hunger, thirst, and health can never go down, making the vitamin system obsolete. There are a few improvements from its predecessor, however, including the skill tree in replacement of the weird engram system featured in ARK.

 - ship building mechanics are great, building large vessels takes time and feels like an accomplishment
 - The world is vast, and you can spend hours and hours just exploring
 - some people tend to hate tames being in this game, but not me!
 - visuals are pretty great

The game does have it's flaws. To name a few;
 - each grid is a server, so there will always be this laggy moment when you sail into a new grid. 
 - Not much opportunity for a solo player to play PVP and actually make a difference in any way
 - End game content requires a lot of grind work, and as far as I can tell is nearly impossible as a solo player

-when travelling around the map the amount of ( Ships of the damned ) is RIDICULOUS!! AND OP AS F***
-when going from 1 square to another there is a good chance the game will crash and youll lose everything. even a possibility of the game uninstalling itself ( ive already lost my process from game crashes more then 4 times and after all the time i wasted to get there im really not impressed, especially with the devs not fixing these problems )
-when going onto an island that is run by pirates it doesn't matter if you run in like a crazy person or hide and slowly make your way to them. there gonna see you and start firing even if your hidden behind a mountain. 
- a lot of the NPC's in the game are OP even at a low low level.

those are the only things i can really say that are game stoppers for me. the Devs dont answer there messages even if you report bugs. they just clearly don't care. i love this game but because of these reasons i dont recommend you buy it until the devs do there job ( not holding my breath ) plus sea of thives is only $20 more and they actually care about there players. all in all the game is very buggy and way behind on game mechanics considering it seems like they copied and pasted most of mechanics from Ark.... its a little less motivating to want to play considering you can lose all your stuff at any time.",1604857515,1604857515,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Since ARK's launch, it's always been true that you need to be careful who you associate with. If people didn't follow that solid advice, and got banned because they didn't stop their company from being a bunch of cheating nobodies, then that's on them.

Moving on to the important stuff... The game itself. I was a long-time player of ark, and came into atlas knowing full well that it was just a reskin. What I did not know, however, was how WELL they did said reskin. Atlas, though it looked and played exactly like ark, did not cause the same levels of burnout that i'd get every time I got on ark. Even after burning out on ark, i was able to dedicate several hours a day into this game, happily, without ever feeling like it was becoming a chore. In fact, the ONLY reason I'm saying all of this in past-tense is because I have a massive library of games that are calling my name, and I go through phases. I would gladly go back to atlas and devote another 469 hours, if I wasn't so caught up in the current phase.

The game is buggy, yes, but so is ark, and ark still has a massive following. This game has potential to be amazing, if we could just do away with the people who whine because they got banned for doing shady stuff, the people who whine because they were attacked by a player while trying to treat PvP servers like a PvE game, etc. Many of the reviews for this game have nothing to do with the game itself, and are moreso a way for the idiots to whine about something. The population won't pick up if people keep posting their sob stories about stuff that has nothing to do with the game itself, but even with the current population, there is a lot of fun to be had in this game, and the bugs really aren't as bad as people are claiming. It isn't the unplayable mess that these whiney kids are making it out to be. For 30 dollars, you really can't go wrong with this game. You'll get your money's worth out of it, if you're not a weak little dirtbag. And hell, if you don't like it, skip 3 trips to McDonald's and you're right back on track. Unless you're dirt poor, there's no reason not to drop 30 dollars to at least try the game out.

I just love sailing off into the sunset, exploring new islands and biomes, building a little settlement with a port, lighthouse and all the things I need. The PVE side is pretty cool too, hunting down buried treasure, clearing out pirate bases, ship to ship combat and discovering the world. For me it's more fun that Ark with less emphasis on taming and more on living the pirate life.

The ship combat is uncanny, the capability to tame and breed animals and beasts and bring them into the fight, and the building aspect of this game presents a very distinct taste in siege-style content. 

-HOWEVER- with this game and all it's endless possibilities, the developers have done nothing in the past year to show us this is the game we imagined when we clicked 'install'. The trailers do nothing for this game as far as showing what it really is. In fact, the trailers present a game that is good-looking, smooth, fluid, and capable. This isn't the case. Despite that this game is not good-looking, smooth, fluid, or capable, this game in and of itself could be a masterpiece. A game with endless PVP content and an amazing amount of PvE as well. Alas, the developers have so far failed us in bringing the appropriate balances, fixes, and updates. They fail to listen to their community and instead ban people with adverse opinions without giving a reason (on all platforms). 

If you're looking for a game that's your money's worth, yes, 10000000% buy this game and play the hell out of it. 

If you're looking for a long-term game that you intend on dedicating yourself to, to make it to the top, to reach all possible content, to win whole and complete, don't get this game. 

One of the best examples of these developers failing us is the fact that -getting onto a ship's ladder from the water- was something that was broken when the game came out, and it took them well over a year to fix (and it's still not completely fixed.)
I'll say it's not a fair accusation because I'm not a developer, so who knows how difficult it actually was to fix, but from my outside perspective, it doesn't seem like it'd be that complicated. Entire worlds can be developed in 2-3 years or less, it shouldn't take over a year to get a player to properly climb up a ladder. 

All in all, it's a game with promise, but a broken one. It was a cash grab that went -too well-, which is why little effort has been put into it.

-All tames besides the small ""shoulder pets"" and horses need to go. Differentiate this game from Ark. The reason this game is almost dead is because it's just Ark with ships, and Ark does the tame/gather loop better. You even added a tamable T-rex for christ's sake. Just stop. Make large creatures non-tamable or only temporary. Do something new with boats and hired NPCs.

-Add the ability to have hired crew gather resources. The farmhouses seem like a really low-effort implementation of automation. However, anything is better than going the zero-effort route of just copying Ark's tame/gather gameplay.

-Minimize the need for land-based structures. Make living almost entirely at-sea possible for anyone who wants that play style. Focus on the ships as the central game mechanic. Add more robust options for gathering resources away from land.

-Add a larger diversity of things to do and see on and under the ocean. More PVE content. NPCs moving around and doing things. NPC ships to raid/pirate.

-Add some form of offline protection in PVP. Maybe safe harbor towns scattered around (or at freeports), drawing some amount of gold per hour or day from the ship's chest to enable PVP protection.",1546790191,1603914538,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They added farms that auto gather and warehouse that sorta collect from a few farms.  They hardly limit people from plopping down too many farms spamming the area. Helped with all the wasted time gather.  Use to gather 90% of the time then build or have fun for 10% of the time.

This is still true, however the game has become more playable again in the last couple of weeks. Meaning you can log in and play and not crash every 15 min or server crossing.
Previously in this review i also wrote about the developers not playing the game and that it shows. That is also still a thing. The upside is that they are there and are making themselves known once a week again. The downside is they don;t seem to be fixing a lot of common issues that effect the game now and instead are coming out with content that they say the community asked for, however it seems most the community is ready to shank them in an alley every time they come out with this content.
My personal opinion is that they should focus on the issues at hand while creating events for the holidays to keep the game interesting and THEN come out with new content. They also should listen to different community members maybe?
Any rate i gave my thumbs up back because atlas is something you need to experience if you haven't yet and are a survival game player with a love for pirates like i am.

First things first, this is AN EARLY ACCESS game. Now that might cause some people to turn away but let me explain why its important. With early access on a game like this its important that the Devs are getting real time responses from the people that play the game. this will help them find any and all bugs in such game and address them as they appear. Now that seems all well and good while it does seem that the dev team kind of abbandoned the game, they are working hard at trying to make this the next massive gamethat comes from them. With the success of ARK they tried to recreate it and with a wonderful concept in mind. (pirates are awesome) 
Now while i did end up returning the game it wasnt because of anything that i found wrong with the game itself. The game is wonderful and has an incredible concept. Where i messed up was i thought that my PC (at its early state) would be able to run this game at a decent frame rate. Sadly i was mistaken.

The game is a grand idea and deserves all the support of the fans and people who are interested in games like this.

Atlas - So the official will always offer the best content wayyyyy before it hits the unofficial servers which is disappointing. The official is plagued with issues and will be a long way off before anything ever resolves itself. Setting up your own server is your best bet and with a large selection of different hosts to choose from, be sure to do your research before choosing any of them, I found support was pretty much useless on a lot of them and just remember that for each grid that is one extra server required.

The game does have potential but with every single update that continues to come out, something else just breaks and makes the game completely useless just like when the SOTD all became frozen, look how long we waited for an update to fix that issue.

When I first played Atlas, the idea of building a ship, sailing, hunting pirates, hunting in general and building my own base sounded wonderful, what a let down when there were no pirate ships if you made your own server.

I've since closed our server down and stopped playing this game until the game is atleast updated to a stage where one can enjoy being hunted by pirate ships or hunting pirate ships. SOTD and the ghost ship after awhile gets boring.

In its current state of Alpha and being in Alpha for a considerable amount of time and probably a year or two before it heads to 1.0 then maybe I will play again.

stop the rogue devs, they are supposed to act in a professional manner. If they're going to wipe companies out of spite and kick players without reason, WHY are they allowing players to watch hundreds of hours of their progress get looted.

Details

Survival

Not as refined a survival experience as, say, Conan Exiles. That said, this game is deeper in both content and skill tree than Conan. While Conan's world is almost entirely empty aside from some animals, this world teems with NPC characters both as merchants/townsfolk/crew, as well as enemy pirates that roam the seas. The survival aspects are also deeper. There are far more intricate aspects to staying alive in this game--so if a harder core survival experience is your bag, this will be right up your alley.

Combat

While Conan's combat mechanics and animations, on the surface, seem more polished, Atlas has a combat skill tree that allows you to refine your combat tactics as you level up. The former relies on real-world combat game play improvement to get better at fighting enemies (and some hardier stats), while the latter, involves more RPG mechanics and point spend to improve your combat.

Overall

If you are looking for an open world pirate game. Buy this. If you are looking for an open world survival game, buy this (though, there's likely more ""contained"" survival experiences out there better than this). If you are looking for an open world survival pirate game--there's none other like this. Buy it.

It's a great game as is, but a no-brainer while on sale.

This game had one of the worst Early Access launches in the last decade and the season 4 launch was not great either. 

I have been in 7 different companies of different crew sizes and i have had a lot of pvp ship, land and air battles! yes, airforce is a thing in this pirate game -_-

Okay, what is this game about. In it's core it is a survival game where you either become a emperor, navy captain or a traveling hobo!

Season 4 had a new dev team handling the game and they did improve a lot of stuff but did make mistakes when doing patches. Improvement has been really slow and the focus has not been great. They are now at least listening to the community and fixing stuff.

The game is now less time consuming when it comes to gathering but base building is still way to time consuming and creates too much lag in game.

Ship building and ship costemersation is still not great and really time intensive. Naval combat is a lot of fun both in pvp and pve but Ships of the dammed/npc ships look like s***.

The melee combat and land combat in general is really bad right now. When the answer is always an explosive barrel, it get's really sad really fast! You need a directional combat system if you are doing a survival game with melee combat in it!

There is so much fun stuff to do in this game and you feel like your are in a big world. However, the game is in a messy state and core mechanics need to be refined/fixed or replaced!

Is the game worth it now? Yes it differently is in my opinion. However, i recommend finding a big company fast with 20+ active people. It is possible to find new people, so you can start alone but playing as a small group or solo right now is really bad.

Note: Don't ever stream this game on the pvp server. If you live stream on the pvp server you can be sure that 30+ bad people will stream snipe you until you leave the server/game!

Update 7-28-2020: After the recent, second rollback of levels within a week, I can no longer recommend this game. A lot of people, myself included, put a lot of time into the game to LEGITIMATELY gain back our levels after the first rollback, and we're being punished because the devs can't balance their own game.

If you really want to be a pirate and you think you've got what it takes, this is the game for you. Be forewarned, there are no soft edges or hand-holding in this game. Being a pirate is tough, and this game will kill you and sink your ship in the best of times. Get used to it. It's not for everyone, and there's a steep learning curve, but if you've always yearned for a grand scale, hardcore, high-risk / high-reward pirate adventure game, this is it.",1556752513,1602409297,False,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,True

Performance is horrible and god-forbid you get any support. The game is currently in its 4th season and nothing has improved. The game is on its 2nd set of devs who know nothing about the game mechanics. 

Unfortunately, this game is full of toxicity which runs into the public discord. The community managers rarely, if at all, address any issues brought up in discord. The ticket system for the game is broken. As soon as you submit a ticket it is immediately marked as solved. What's sad is I have yet to receive a response to any of my tickets from the beginning of release until now. These tickets include everything from bug reports, game exploits/issues, and code of conduct concerns. 

Players and whole companies have been banned from the game with little to no explanation. The population of the game is steadily declining because of this and soon there will be no one left to play. In a way, it feels as if the studio is trying to kill the game.

My suggestion is to stay far away from this game and anything the studio develops.

Could this be the end ? only time will tell.

day2 logged in went sailing around rubber-banding less but returned after around 30 minutes then 5.0 was released they restarted the servers and logged back in. no issues for a few minutes but then i chose to fight a elephant with my fists cause my spear broke and i died. tried to re-spawn back on my raft bed but did not allow me to re-spawn.  tried to spawn back home with no success. tried to change my home server and still no luck spawning in. overall day 2 was a little better but still would not recommend buying the game.
  
    Next Few days i set sail after completing my schooner and find that all the land is being claimed by a few tribes just because they can they aren't using the space so i have to keep moving the game has turned into a raft simulator, now i'm finding that resources are spawning a lot slower or have stop spawning inside these claim zones making it hard to get resources. i'm currently trying to live in my ship cause i cant find some land that has resources to harvest to advance. so i would say the game is too congested with land claims. i do still do not recommend this game as of yet. does not support the players they are trying to support. fix the resources.

Year or so later game is alright they have added a few cool features but still not exactly a solo game on pub servers, but private is nice. lots of grinding survival content the kracken is  tough to beat by yourself on a single ship buddies would help.

You change zones (can't not do it to play) and it crashes, can delete your ship, can cost you your ship.

You change zones (can't not do it to play) and it crashes, can delete your ship, can cost you your ship.

(Btw this is what i have sent to Every aspect of Atlas, including their Big brother Devs)


So apparently I was Global Banned,
A: for no reason at all, was never explained to me nor was I ever given a warning for Anything.
B: I have barely logged into the game in the past few months let alone haven’t played in over a week.
C: apparently the company that I was in, had attacked another company in game, Black Butterfly, which apparently has financial connections to grapeshot, so they became super salty, (butt hurt) (an angry and ill tempered individual) and bused their power and abilities and deleted all of my items and fellow company items.
D: Code of conduct states “We never take our decisions and actions regarding potential malicious player behaviour lightly. Suspensions, wipes and/or bans are only issued after careful review of all internal and external evidence.

Hacking
Exploiting

Etc, are ways to be banned…

E: So explain to me what code of conduct I violated to warrant being banned without warning, reasoning, or evening logging into the GAME for over a week?

Atlas is a brilliant game and I absolutely love it, which is why I keep coming back to it. I've seen others build some magnificent structures and I love travelling to different islands to see what other companies have built. However, Atlas does soak up a lot of your spare time because other companies (on PvP servers) will visit your island to destroy everything! I have yet to try out the PvE servers but from what I've heard in the community, your buildings tend to be a lot safer.

The developers have released new content and fixed a lot of the bugs. There are a few very minor things like the sea water rises over your ship at sea (doesn't cause damage,) they managed to fix it last time so I'm sure they can do it again. As a little note of feedback to the developers, it would be great if you could speed up the overall production time for ships. The sea battles are incredible and exciting, I just wish they'd happen more often.

There is simply no content in this game.
* You can battle the exact same ship over and over at spawn points in the ocean with the same exact tactic every time for hours.
* You can take out pirate camps on each island with the exact same tactic every time on single player
* Or you can just float around in PvP and battle other players boats, or siege their islands.

There is one or boss monster you fight for one quest and a bonus to your character, but it is a pretty lame fight.

Downside is, I took a semi-lengthy break and came back to find my character had been deleted in the server changeover. So, yaknow, apparently the time I put in for something I paid for isn't of much value to the people creating the game. Kinda sad I wasted my money now.

It's in Beta.
Game is plagued with issues and glitches.
They recently released a patch 20 days ago to fix some features. Said patch made you lose all your stash of arrows and crossbow bolts and also making it so that you cannot craft any more. In addition to that, you cannot craft doors.. so you can make a house but without doors, there is no way to keep unwanted people out. 
There were many other things broken by this fix, but the issue is, here we are 20 days later with no word of any fix. 

Here is what was the final straw for me... I spent way too much time gathering wood, metal, and other materials to make a nice ship. spent weeks upon weeks working on this! Made a nice brig and spent weeks leveling it up so I could use it as I intended.
One nice day, I go for a joy ride, sink a few enemy ships and am forced to dock because of the dozens upon dozens of water spots that form whenever it rains. It is beyond stupid how many you have to doge to try to drop your anchor near an island so you do not get hit by one. 
I still have my crew on fire at will. They begin to fire at fish in the water and I glitch into the steering wheel while running by repairing my deck from the previous battle. Now my ship is somehow getting damaged because my crew is somehow hitting the hull of my ship while I am trapped inside the steering wheel unable to use it and tell them to stop.
I use commands to put them all on passive with no luck. I log out and log back in and am still stuck.
Needless to say, my ship sinks because the hull is destroyed by my crew shooting at fish. Mutiny.",1600735248,1600735248,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was not thrilled with Ark and yes this is the exact same start...but building a ship and taking it out where it rolls on waves and you bob up and down.  Come on this deserves a thumbs up alone.

Hardly a review but in the first 2-seconds I noticed the water...I have never seen a water effect that good before.

Basically it's the mutant love child of ARK and Sid Misers Pirates.

With absolutely stunning water....and a skill tree design from the late 80's.

Edit:  
Played a lot more and have to say I am very much liking it even if there is a bit of a learning curve.  Building is so far well done (Q and T reshape and place).  Resource gathering is a titch on the high side but I've played way worse.

Ships:  I just bought and names my first Sloop...now to hire a couple crew and see how fast I can unintenionally sink it.

Edit:  150-hours in.  Guess that alone tells you something.  This is a survival game and perhaps the most frustraiting part is when ever you swim too deep,  lose a ship it's 99% of the time your own fault for how and why that happened.

My only real complaint is 'heat waves'  They kill you and can and will kill you multiple times in a row until it passes.  No idea why this is actually in game other than to encourage people to swim deep and explore instead of dying on the surface.  

There is a LOT underwater...and the ocean is a dangerous place.

So far I've spent all this time focused on the ships.  Only thing I have not done is a Galleon and that in and of itself is a huge undertaking.  Now though I'm going to see how building goes. 

There are several specific building you can use to automate things, such as farming (for the record s of now I have never planted a single seed).  Tax collection, warehouses, and the reguar custom building you can do in various elements.

One neat touch is the dye you can use in dozens of colors that can be used on almost anything from armor to sails, to wooden structures.  

All in all there is noting new in this game but they bring it all together in a way that truly does make this, in my opinion, a far more deserving title than the reviews have given it.  Play 60-minutes and you'll not understand.  

Build your first ship, fin your first naval battle, tweak out your crew, armor, colors, buildings, conquor islands...

While still in early access, the company has removed (entirely at one point) their devs, replacing them with new ones. There has been very little added content since initial launch, despite being almost two years old. Bugs from day 1 still exist, and bugs are multiplying.

Servers remain extermely unstable, unable to support even a few people with major lag/rubberbanding. Transitions between grids remain a constant issue, with disconnects, loss of tames on ships, running into enemy ships while loading (it is possible to lose your ship before you even load in, in some instances)

There has been little interaction with the new devs, including a failure to explain their ""new"" vision for this game. As such population continues to dwindle, with only receiving bumps during the begining of a new ""season"" (a season is when the map and all progress is wiped and restarted fresh.)

PvE devolpment has been abandoned completely, whereas PvP is a clusterf of griefing and base wiping, with 0 balance.

The survival aspect is good, though the vitamins are a little annoying. Taking your vitamin L or drowning yourself is easier than trying to manage your vitamins a lot of the time. In order to manage it you need to get to the higher levels of cooking to get proper nutrition food which makes it easier. Problem is...that requires too much effort...just easier to bypass the system and kill yourself to reset the vitamins. Players bypassing a game mechanic is the sign of a badly implemented system.

The ships of the damned have their pain points, such as appearing just as you cross a server border. They always in groups of 4. They are rather easy to attack even at low levels if you know what you are doing. AI is rather dumb and just not that challenging. I would like to see them vary the group sizes more, give them smarter AI.

I would also like to see them introduce the AI pirates that admins can spawn in the game right now. Their AI is smarter and more of a challenge. The NPC camps which are in single player need to come to dedicated servers too to give more challenge to land combat.

They don't appear to have any idea how to make a proper end game for the game.

Unofficial server support is atrocious. I admined (and made maps for) an unofficial server that went from a 3x3 to 5x8 (maps that aren't square are not supported, so the map appears squished) to 7x7. The last major update forced a rework of our map because 26 islands were deleted...all because they weren't using them in the official map. Multiple times I was forced to wipe our map and start fresh because of island changes. One Powerstone island got wiped of all content at one point, forcing us to swap out the island (no reason given).

The Dev Kit for modding rarely gets updated which means mods break and take a while to be fixed BECAUSE OF THE DEVS not releasing the dev kit. The mods have been keeping people interested in the game on unofficial servers, but they can't be bothered to keep the kit updated to support those efforts. Several mod developers have said they are thinking about stopping support of the game.

There are features broken for empire mode (the original mode the official servers used before they switched to colony mode) because they can't be bothered to support the game modes they ""support"".

Then there's the current pvp focus. PVE players lost an unofficial server (1 of 2) because they needed it to be a test server for the PVP servers (2 official pvp servers exist). Telling part of your userbase they aren't the focus is a good way to lose players.

It cost £10 on sale...its still not worth it.**


Atlas is a boring, buggy reskin that brings nothing new to the table, if anything it takes stuff off the table compared to Wildcard's prdocessore ARK.

I would like to state that I am playing on PvE so my experience my differ from PvP

First, not that it needs to be said, the game is a buggy unoptimized mess just like ARK before it and since ARK was in Early Access for two years, has been out for over a year and is still a buggy and unoptimized mess. I don’t hold up much hope for Atlas being any different, that being said. I could be wrong...I dought it.

Second, is it really a reskin? I want to say yes and no, It looks exactly like ARK. Sounds exactly like are, and if I had to guess, probably smells exactly like ARK. It offers a few tweaks and changes such as how blueprints work, taming has been completely redone and building has been made a lot nicer with things like triangle foundations, stackable foundations and such. Engrams have been changed into a Skill Tree, which offers some variety, I'm playing with some friends and we have each spec'd into different tress so we all have a job to do. But these tweaks don’t separate it from ARK enough. To me Atlas is nothing more then a Total Conversion of ARK. That all being said they have actually removed things that where added to ARK, small things but things none the less, the “Use last pincode” when opening Pin Coded storage is one of these small things that where nice to have but has been taken out. Why? Fuck if I know.

Third. The game is just.....boring. And I'm playing with friends! And as we all know, everything is better with friends. We have grinded Mats, build a base, built several ships, hunted treasure, which is far to easy, take a strong bear and you have won treasure hunting. (Also a very good way to level up) We have hinted Ships of the Damned which is....meh and is actually more fun to do solo with an NCP crew which oddly makes it even easier. The only thing I think we haven’t done yet is look for the Stones of Power, which I'm hoping will be somewhat fun but like the last two things I feel will be lacklustered.

Sailing, one of the pinnacle points in being a Pirate, is the most, boring things I have ever done, I would rather hammer nails into my ball sack then sail, and I enjoy sailing in game. When out on the sea you have Ship of the Damned to dodge which after the 18th hundred just becomes an annoyance. Crates to pull out the ocean which aren’t worth slowing down for and Storms which when the game first came out where fun to navigate....then they changed them to just be unfare by having cyclones spawn literally all around you and enclose you in, basically artificial difficulty. Apart from these things there is nothing to do on the sea, nothing. The other day I sailed 2 hours from an island back home and In that 2 hours I had one storm to deal with, I ended up just putting my feet up and reading a book, which funnaly enough made me crash into a SoD and have to escape it while taking on water. That moment of entertainment, was made, because I wasn’t playing the game, when I got back I said to my mate who was with me, “That was uneventful, we could have put on the first Lord Of The Rings and watched that while doing this” This review I'm writing right now, I'm typing on my second monitor while I'm sailing straight north, I'm not even at the helm, I put an NPC on it. Just miserable.

Will there be new stuff added later? More then likily, but still then, I find myself asking “Why am I even bothering” and what is the end game? I get to fly a dragon from ARK which every ARK player has already done? I'm also on PvE, what good is a dragon? I can use it on metal runs for 3 hours?

Finally, the devs, Wildcard, or Grapeshot or whatever they call themselves these days for the sake of the review I'll call a fish a fish and refer to the devs as Wildcard because....its the same team. Wildcard have proven with things like Paid DLC in an unreleased game, their last game being over 3 years old and still being a mess and the changes they are adding to Atlas already that they are still incompetent developers that have no idea how to make a stable game, will break everything to fix something and all in all dont care. The launch of this game shows how little they care. The fact they rather suck off streamers to make sales then put out a good game, shows they don't care. This company just doesn’t care or simply don’t have a clue, or both. On PvE we have had issues with people overloading peoples ships so they sink. Since its PvE all you can do is sit and watch as your work just falls into the sea. How would you fix this? Make it so people can't get on your ship? Make it so when a ship is overloaded it simply doesn’t move? Give player an option to “Kick” others of their ships? NOPE they make it so when you jump on a ship, or a raft, you get stuck hovering on it, sliding around like its ice. Do you fall off when you reach the side? Nope, “Get fucked” your stuck there, hope you didn’t have anything valuable on you. And the funny thing.....it didn’t stop grifers overloading ships. OH and another thing. Wildcard said they have learnt from ARK, however they have new content planned for the end of February, so once again, adding content on top of a broken foundation with will become so buried under new content that it will never be able to get fixed without breaking 7 other thing.

So there you have it. The game is a mess. The game is boring. The company behind it still have no idea or don't care. Avoid like the god damn plague.",1548790194,1600419198,False,3,0,0.529165089130401611,0,True,False,True

Saw this game on steam store literally for forever and avoided it because of the misleading negative steam reviews which couldn't have been more wrong because this game is amazing. When cross play with xbox one players was introduced recently, my friend invited me over because he had two consoles & the game was super fun so I went and bought it at home on steam later that night & I play with all my friends while they are on xbox which is awesome.

I guess the game might appear as not very fun at the beginning especially if you start out in a pvp world like I did and increasingly moreso if you don't have anyone playing with you because there is a LOT to learn about this game regarding survival, collecting resources, construction, skill trees, etc. But fortunately I'm not someone that gives up easily at a, ""difficult game,"" and instead of claiming that it just sucks to hide the fact that I was a low level and just didn't understand the game yet, I kept playing and this game is SO REWARDING especially moreso once you get your levels up a bunch.

This game is basically a giant open world like No Man's Sky(not the gameplay, just the open world) where you can sail to & from every island and explore all the space or the ocean in between. You can build just about anywhere. All of the resources constantly respawn after an amount of time and there are different resources on every island which makes for a bit more of a challenge in a fun way. PVP worlds are especially fun and you can get attacked at virtually any moment.

I enjoy this game significantly moreso than Sea of Thieves, which gives me a, 'fortnite-of-pirate-games,' kind of vibe that I don't like.

Honestly this game is absolutely destroying my life right now. 10/10 recommend

Taming is buggy as hell, sometimes it works fine and you can tame things, others it lets you knock out the creature but not feed, and sometimes it gives you the ""press E to feed"" option, and when you press E nothing happens.
Travel Times are very long and made more difficult due to the Ships of the Damned (NPCs on the ocean) that only render in around 150m away. Storms that only render in 100m away. 
Treasure chests are a pain in the ass at higher levels, the mobs it spawns bury themselves and heal to full health every 30s or so, which makes killing the high levels hard without multiple people or a bunch of tames.

There are an incredible amount of cons to the game as it stands right now. Everything I write in this review is from a PvE solo viewpoint. Your milage may vary. 

[olist]
    [*] It is not solo friendly. There are a lot of content that you simply cannot do by yourself, unless you tame several high level creatures. Which by the way, is also very difficult. 

    [*] The developers encourage exploring, and the game enforces this by capping levels. The only way to raise above a certain level, is by make discoveries. This means, you have to sail out and visit other islands. This is fine and a very central part of the game. It is just incredible boring after the initial thrill wans. Each tile, or sector, takes roughly 22 minutes to travel at a fair speed. If you're lucky (depending on your definition) you get to fight ships of the damned or dive for sunken treasure, along the way. However, this will just extend the travel time further. 

    [*] This point is mostly for solo players, but paradoxically you have to avoid long explorations as your base will decay within a week or so leaving you nothing to return to. 

    [*] The game is not for the casual player that only has an hour or two at a time to play. You need to be able to dedicate rather large amounts of time, if you wish to really get somewhere with the game. 

    [*] There are many bugs, which is to be expected from a game in Early Access. Problem is, it has been in early access for close to 2 years by now.

update approaching 6000 hours on ATLAS

This game got worse and worse with each thing the devs try to implement.

- servers getting worse and worse and they dont adress the problem, they prefer to keep implementing items in the game that are irrelevant.
- many reports of racism have been filed, that same company is still playing. racism reports gets closed instantly without even being looked at.
- griefing/trolling is not being adressed wich makes many people quite, specially on lawless islands.
- the DEVS seem to have no knowledge and playtime on their own game wich clearly shows, items being changed that doesnt need changing. issues that need to be adressed stay in the game.

i can make 2 full pages of how bad this game turns into atm and the devs simply dont take any feedback from their own community, specially from player like me who spend 6k hours on the game so far. this game in hands of a good company has alot of potential but if it stays with these incompetent people this game is on its last legs.",1572505115,1599063785,True,2,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,True

I was really happy to see activity from the developers, but then my heart sank. Instead of adding endgame PvE content or challenges, they went Fortnite and decided to focus on PvP. There's no real point to this game anymore. Grinding resources is way to time consuming to do in PvP unless you have a large, organized group.

Adding insult to injury, shortly after everyone quit playing, our 5x5 became way more time consuming to maintain than it was worth. We poured hours into making sure we had all the resources and that the islands were arranged logically. During our run, we had to wipe multiple times because the database would just inexplicably fail. Characters, ships, and creatures would randomly disappear. It was always a pain to recover or replace these items. And managing 25 servers by hand with batch files was a TON of work.

I got the game on the Summer sale for $9 and started playing just as Season 4 launch and it was a mess. The lag was horrible, the freeports all at cap and everyone else was stuck to spawn in lawless and it was just a pointless run around and gank fest for the next 8 hours, after that the mega companies/alliances started taking island after island leaving the normal sized companies screwed. The company i started the game with held a island for a bit till we got overrun by Chinese(on a NA server) at 5AM my time so everyone was asleep while we lost everything. After everyone in that company quit i played solo some and that was kind of fun being on the run from all the little trolls trying to wipe anything that moved. Then i joined my second company, that was fun for awhile but then it just started getting slow and boring, sailing for Hours and hours on end just to bring NPC's back or Raw mats from another island because you need diffrent kinds of raw mats to make rare ship parts/items, IE you need Ironwood,Darkwood,Wetwood and esc just to make a rare plank and some of the woods only spawn on 1 island controlled by players. Well you can say thats so people fight for that island that controls that 1 kind of mats, Not if its controlled by a mega tribe you don't. the little guys are screwed unless they want to hand over their child as payment. Its the painfully long sailing sailing and crashing all the time that really killed it for me. If the wind is in your favor and your just sailing north to south expect it to take 5+ hours. Oh and that fancy ship with more HP then a common that you spent hours and hours farming and sailing to islands to get the mats is pointless now. You just need to be  shot once with a barrel bomb and all the planks on your ship have been popped.

This game has a great idea! However it was so poorly implemented, launched and run it would have been better for them to delay it a year or two to have finished and cleaned it up. I know this is early access but most games never leave early access or finish. I just don't see them getting their numbers back in the long run now after how bad its done for so long. I just wish a game company that had the resources for a game like this would have been the ones to do it instead. Not one that feels shady making a sister company to place a DLC  on the early access. 

Offical servers are hard to get going and really require you to join something already established. Private servers are more fun to play on but then lack the players needed or have admins trying to apply weird rules. Also most ships look stupid just loaded with canons in front and back. They should add more restrictions into canon placement. Then you might actually get the feel of an old ship of the line. 

The game as a whole is fun, treasure hunting, diving to the bottom of the sea or fighting other ships on the sea. You can tell they want to have a fighting system in the game but its just bad. Really just a FPS where you are swinging a weapon... great for a shooter melee has always been terrible on this kind of game design.  

With more work it could also be a great RP style immersion game but still lacking a lot. The workshop helps but with such a low popularity there really isn't much there.

I enjoy exploring the see, looking for more or different resources all around the world,

Gameplay : When it's not lagging it's fine and intuitive.

Blueprint system is interesting, but I would like a way for smaller Companies to be able to unlock more engrams.

I never wrote a review before. But this game is so bad i had 2. HERE GOES.....

1. The servers cant handle being 75% + filled without there being game breaking lag. If u ever find urself in a 190+ war the servers will be so laggy that you cant even reload a gun. You cant even stab someone with a sword since its so laggy and to top it off the servers will crash every 15 mins and roll back 5 mins making fighting horrible for teams trying to advance in a war. Rubber banding everywhere. It just shows how the game was poorly designed and backed up with even poorer tech (Devs please lower the server cap or invest in better servers).
It's almost as if the game is mining bit coins in the background. (Kappa) but not really.

2. The devs are low IQ MORONS and know nothing of Game design. They actually take advice from butthurt players and change the game based on it. (sure this means they listen to crying nerds, (blackhole and SDC) but it also means they don't consider the logical and practical Game Design principals). It's almost as if the devs don't want big groups to quit so they alter the game. (throw the game design books out the window boys)

3. UR PC HARDWARE CAN BREAK.....The game is just not built well (at all). Players have thousands of hair on there head which lags FPS. NPC''s are doing constant ray casting checks every frame. No reasonable build limits which will make everything lag. ( it is actually a tactic for clans to lag out their island to prevent enemies from attacking by placing thousands of structures ). The game runs well on day 1-3 of server restart. But on day 4 you can already feel the lag starting. 

4.  Toxic community and Cheaters everywhere. If the lag doesn't get you the players will. From Doxing to Ddosing to intense cyber bullying. Company leaders aim to hurt other people on a personal level by meme waring (kind funny but mental illness is a real thing) they do this to the point of mental breakdown and wanting to kill urself. I wont name leaders here, but you know who you are.  There are also so many China clans that use aim bots and other strange glitches ( like shooting you off ur boat from 1 mile away with a shotgun. The Devs don''t even hardware/ip ban these scum. 

5. This game is literally a mental torment. Everyone who plays will become depressed since the game is so harsh and poorly built. I am not  only talking from person experience but many many players i have talked to feel the same way, and playing this game is a sickness since it will lowers ur mental stability. Almost every Clan leader is on Unemployment since the game demands SO SO much attention and hours put into it. I feel bad for these people since they clearly have developed Gaming disorder from this game. (i know from personal experience)

6. DEVS are somehow bypassing the Standard of game quality and releasing games onto Microsoft XBOX and now Play station is being targeted. Ever single Xbox player cannot even load their own base without crashing or lagging out so hard they crash their boat into a wall and sink. Since the game runs well with no player structures Microsoft was tricked into thinking its a working game. But as soon as things are built the Xbox hardware will fail and crash. This is almost fraud in my opinion since they are selling something that is lower then product standards. Xbox players have to ask PC players to park their boats into the base since they simply cannot.

Im done with number 6. 
Never buy this garbage game. and if you are playing it please stop for ur own mental sanity.

Negatives:
-Pirates (which can thankfully be disabled) glitch out, duplicate and are overall more OP than the player will ever be.
-The grind to gather resources and blueprints is insane (this is coming from someone who loves games with a lot of grinding)
-Speaking of blueprints: Army of the dead will often go back underground for unknown reasons (they do that even when agroed)
-A lot of the game mechanics are not explained (the game plays very similarly to ARK though)
-The wiki is basically useless
-As in ARK, the player is useless without taming animals and has to use ""dodgy"" mechanics to tame (tame pens, sign boards etc)
-Due to the terrain (rocks, foliage etc) the animals you tame (and NPC crewmen) will get stuck somewhere behind you before you notice.
-In non dedicated hosting mode the people that join you are locked to a relatively small radius around you and when you or they move to the edge of that radius they get dragged back towards you (which could be used as a funny way to kill your friends)
-Uses more system resources than an actual triple A game with much better graphics.
-As far as i know its not possible to have a fleet of ships with AI commanding them to support you - meaning you either need other real people (actual dedicated server) or you are stuck with using one ship at the time. This one particularly sucks when gathering a large number of resources in far away lands
-As far as i know there's only 1 way to improve your items even though some weapons have ""Attachment"" attribute and i've yet to find a blueprint that provides a weapon with an attachment.
-Devs are focusing on adding new useless features (like the warehouse and tax building) rather than actually fixing the game and making it more playable.

Not negative and not Positive:

~Weather effects are extreme (tornadoes spawn right infront and around you meaning its hard to plan a route to avoid them when one spawns while you're in another one)
~Lot of variety in islands but the resources you can get from them are basically ""region"" locked (in the current version of the game)

Positives:
+The building mechanics are pretty neat, i personally like making massive bases
+The UI looks like garbage and feels like it but usually does a pretty good job at what is necessary
+Commanding massive boats
+Item power can be increased by the blueprint quality system (although as pointed out in the negatives section, you will never be as powerful as AI pirates)

TL:DR:
The game looks good, runs like crap, is as buggy as ARK when it was initially released and the devs are focusing on useless stuff. Cant wait for them to release a DLC for money before the game comes out of early access... like they did with ARK :WeirdChamp:

If the game is on sale for about 7 quid then its a good purchase, at its normal price its a legitimate scam and a waste of money.

There are too many game and experience breaking exploits and hacks. When you report them, that ticket type is insta-closed and set as low priority. 

Instead of fixing the long lists of exploits and hacks, some since season 1... 

They spend their time creating things that aren't even needed, like farmhouses (making tames and harvest boost useless) and warehouses to collect from those farmhouses. lol 

They've rolled levels back and changed XP, mainly hurting smaller companies and / or casuals. 

I just don't get it. Why have a game if you don't play it or even understand it? How can pushing away many cohorts of people lead to success? 

My theories so far... 
- They plan on staying in ""early access"" until an entirely new generation is of gaming age. lol 
- They see how these experiences push people to rent servers. 
- Heck, maybe they even sell the hacks.

Fixing required: Wild pirates (and their bases) and being able to set/lower or disable their auto repair. Also, being able to fight on and take/steal their ships. Fixing disappearing pets.

Possible additional features and ideas: underwater bases/building, building of (more) types of 
submarines, even more undersea creatures and more fantasy creatures only found on certain ""fantasy"" islands. Caves. Voxel destructive physics for e.g. digging / mining.

Pros: Fun pvp, good sailing, amazing graphics.

Cons: Map was made smaller last wipe, constant glitches to simple things like grenades, crew, very similar to ark. Almost identical. The MAIN ISSUE is that this game is trying to be a pvp focused game but they keep adding more and more pve features. It doesn't make sense and so the game balancing is really horrible. I sit there and lose pvp fights due to random bugs. Even if it's fun the game's core premise feels empty and the game loses it's pirate feeling with each update. Last update makes it super easy to farm. The concept is fine in a pve game but in a pvp game this doesn't make sense. Please change base building to premade houses so we don't have players making pyramids within boxes and stupid crap like that because that forces the devs to make the game even less balanced due to upping rates constantly. The island system is fine but the map should be wayyyyyyy bigger so more and more people can find islands. this map size is quite sad as people tend to spread out and not commune. It's a very anti social game with some good social high lights. 

On another note, the accesibility and viability of the freeport is horrible. PLEASE, No more auto decay at free port. Let these poor people keep their beloved ships, it's annoying when devs think it's okay to take away something awesome from the player because they think it balances the game, but it doesn't! It just makes it harder for noobs to keep their own ship. 

FINAL VERDICT:
Game looks promising but is so broken in both current early access state and in concept that it feels like a cheap thrill that was almost almost right but ended up changing into something you didn't really like. Focus on making the game even more pirate like, like better crew management, better treasure map hunting, improve the free-port, make community features, streamline boat making process. And above all decide if this game is a PVP game or a PVE game, because it doesn't have a healthy mix of the two like ark. This is more of a hardcore game, I personally think you should make the game world split so that the free port seas and around them are PVE and the islands to own are all PVP with a ring of lawless islands somewhere on the map. I love your pirate game above all, but I have to be harsh in my review because of the amount of disappointment I felt. I doubt the game will get good like ark did. and even ark comes and goes in waves with it's player base.",1596659375,1596659375,False,1,0,0.493216454982757568,0,True,False,True

Some tips for the devs...

* First hour of game play genuinely felt like Ark.
* Add more pirate elements into the game (Taverns, Skeletons, Swordplay)
* Sometimes i feel like im playing pirates vs aliens, NPC enemies dont fit the game. Animals taken from Ark, Ships are from some old school Alien game, very weird to put in a pirate game.
* Where are the quests! I want to enter a Tavern and see drunks and speak to the owner for quests etc.",1596599518,1596599518,True,1,0,0.500644326210021973,0,True,False,True

now the bad things:
With the introduction of the new servers we got access to a new feature called ""farmhouses"" which are cool since they farm while your out having fun! bad thing is they are spammed around like crazy and island owners are  rejecting most new settlers due to they themselves not having to rely on the settlers for resource income. 
- the servers are shit...I will go out of my way to not go into lawless zones due to the high ping (23 people and 250 ping? no....)
-constant issues with different nationalities (you know who you are)
- trade shows have become so popular and with the bad ping you cant even get into them

pros!
well you can have fun with your friends.....I mean its the same shit that was in the last version of the game not really much has changed actually...no new bosses or anything

The variety in the world is ultimately this games downfall, where the bigger ship you get the less fun you have.

+ technically better version of survival game than ARK. Ships and a satisfyingly expansive world to sail in, but to my evolved taste 4 times too small and lacking the fully editable world.

I've been most of the time in the best raiding pirate companies in atlas and the game is pretty nuts to play for me now, although I would enjoy it only for its addictive elements to waste time into rather than do something more stupid with my time. But the inhibitors that the broken game has have 
- grown to be too big to play it.

Disgust, Inhibition greater than addiction

First, the raider alpha dog companies dedicate most of their time to hurt other players economies, gameplay, whatever they can do stay top, and once they're there, there's little encouraged and socially proven or acceptable by the game and community for newcomers to the game can do to try organise and topple their defences, although this is what they should be doing with affordable ships, attack the main islands of the top dogs of the sea every day to hurt their slack part, instead of 
- trying to enjoy the moldy bread from toxic community organised against the disoriented newcomers.

Toxic community

Ignoring this dynamic of attack first makes the game even more broken. The worst part is that this dynamic is required, but can be countered by a kettle top company by ganging up in multiple allied companies consisting of all the good players against the newcomers and less experienced veterans. These elite companies exploit when they can, seek the new mechanics and perfect their strategy to kill creativity and slack and decieve themselves into 
- griefing, driving the growth aspects of the game elsewhere.

Systematic griefing.

This is mainly because the mechanics of a survival game genre, where people are driven into adopting their worst parts of personality and potential, which is then rewarded by addictive triggers like gaining control over enemies, through their possessions, hurting their efforts to do the same to you, strengthening the ego, gaining character levels from this, unlocking new interesting skills etc. being able to enjoy peace for constructing palaces and functional architecture from the pieces given, when knowing other players better in it than you may struggle in this, often because of your actions. 
- It's very rewarding for the egoistical mind, and this keeps the cycle going into a screeching halt, because everyone is equally bad

If you play as a small company and have a job, you, your resources and your ships will be wiped by two naked dwarfs with a bear and a cannon while you sleep or work. If you get tired of this and you decide to join a large company with good defense in order to save your ship and loot, and not rebuild your base every day, then one day the game developer will come in and wipe your whole company without warning or explanation.

They reduced the map, now it is impossible to hide and sail on a small ship, playing with a small company has become impossible (if you certainly want to keep your animals alive for more than 10 hours).
They introduced idiotic farmhouses, justifying it by reducing the time for farming resources, this is the laziest and idiotic attempt to drive players out to sea. It is necessary to add ship classes and content to the sea, and not this shit. To reduce the time for farming, need to increase the farming multiplier on blueprinting tools.
Since the release of the game, they cannot fix speed from the recipes for speed sails.
A lot of game content is useless, for example ALL types of weight sails, and ALL types of medium sails. The lightest and smallest ships are the slowest and most useless.
And of course, gnomes, gnomes everywhere. There is no penalty for reducing hitboxes.
Personally, I (I think, like many others) in 3 weeks gained ~ 100 levels without the abuse of a kraken or a snowman, nevertheless, the levels of all characters have already been lowered 2 times. They first introduce a huge amount of exp for bosses, and then wipe your levels.
Most likely, you will be pissed, and it could be the developers.

В игре очень хорошее пвп на кораблях и земле, но для этого вам нужны хотя бы 40 уровень корабля с полным сетапом.
Если вы играете маленькой компанией и имеете работу, вас,ваши ресурсы и ваши корабли вайпнут два голых карлика с медведем и пушкой, пока вы спите или работаете.  Если вам это надоест и вы решите вступить в большую компанию с хорошей обороной, чтобы сохранить свой корабль и лут, а еще не отстраивать свою базу каждый день, тогда в один прекрасный день зайдет разработчик игры и вайпнет всю вашу компанию без предупреждений и объяснения причин. 

Они уменьшили карту, теперь невозможно спрятаться и плавать на маленьком корабле, игра маленькой компанией стала невозможна (если вы конешно хотите сохранить своих животных в живых больше 10 часов).
Они ввели идиотские фермыдома, оправдывая это сокращением времени на фарм ресурсов, это самое ленивая и идиотская попытка выгнать игроков в море.Необходимо добавлять классы кораблей и контент в море, а не это дерьмо. Чтобы уменьшить время на фарм можно увеличить множитель фарма на принтованных инструментах.

Они со времени выхода игры не могут починить скорость с рецептов скоростных парусов. 
Большое количество контента игры бесполезно, например, ВСЕ виды весовых парусов, и ВСЕ виды средних парусов. Самые легкие и самые маленькие корабли - самые медленные и самые бесполезные.
И конечно, гномы, везде одни гномы. Нет никакого пенальти за уменьшение хитбокса.
Лично я (я думаю, как и многие другие) за 3 недели набрал ~100 уровней без абуза кракена или снеговика, тем не менее уровни всех персонажей уже 2 раза были понижены.Они сначала вводят огромный количество экспы за боссов, а потом вайпают ваши уровни.

""Brief review"" 

There has been a map rework and a full reset. Otherwise no new addition to the game so might aswell left the map for a new update and let the ppl play until there are normal changes on the old map. Apart from that now they gutted both bossfights to give no xp instead of fixing exploits and cut player xp back first to 80 now to 82. Now if you only been doing maps to level and been playing the game like I did you had your level almost at 90. Loosing those levels is a big no-no since we all know how long it rly takes to get high lvl maps and even if you get them kill the skeleton army if they spawn in texture under player foundations or just generally in places unreachable becase thats 60% of them. Back to gutting the xp from kraken and yeti which are considered endgame now ppl will only do them once and afk just like that. Gj making the right decisions.
I probably sound salty and thats because I would love to love this game but I cant like this. Both this and ARK has developers who only play the game on the early levels or just not enough. They have no clue what happens later in either of the games.

Instead of fixing problems the developers just limit and turn systems off because they cant fix them. 

Not to mention the devs come out of hiding to ""fake dev wipe"" companies for breaking rules they do not list  by kicking everyone out of the companies and leaving everything as a free for all. The amount of ramapant abuse and harassment in the game is astonishing.

Atlas does have some good features such as a few boss fights, but things get very repetitive and you are reset and punished often.

THIS IS A LEGIT RESKIN OF ARK!

Literally, a reskin. The UI is damn near the same, character creation, taming ect. Even some of the settings, when changing values, refer to the wildlife as dinosaurs.

Now, with that said, thats not necessarily a bad thing. Its still got a ton of its own elements. The building is more intuitive, the ship combat and exploration is super fun, and the lack of sci-fi elements keeps the game immersive for me. 

The dark part, however, is that the toxicity is just like ark. Good luck with PVP if you work or have a life. And official PVE is dead. Thankfully, there is still a large amount of dedi servers run by people to keep it alive if you PVE like myself.

Overall, its definitely worth a go if you loved ARK like me. Just dont be surprised that its basically an ARK coversion, like primitive plus was.",1595872880,1595872880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Build a cheap ship from the free port.
Find some land and build a ship yard to build a better ship.
Find that no land is available to build on and deinstall.

And yes i understand that its early access and i also understand how easy it is for the devs to hide behind this, most the games i play are early access, maybe the devs should take a leaf from Facepunch (Rust Devs) and Running with scissors dev team and understand how to communicate with the player base they have and act upon the input from the community after all we are the people testing the game for them, so why not act upon what the community are saying.. only the devs can answer this question.

Since the update and season 4 the lag issues make the game more or less unplayable.
They've done away with the NA pve server so now anyone wishing to play Pve is cramped into the worldwide EU server and the servers simply can not handle the player load let alone the 40k players we were told the game and servers could handle at launch and is still pushed as a plus point by the devs this a total lie by the devs.
it struggles to handle 5k players and thats across PVP and PVE along with Xbox players who i feel sorry for because they have been sold down the river along with a very broken game that has very little updates and a dev team that really dont care about its player base at all.

Yes we got a patch today 23/07/20 that introduced farms.. Wow thanks for the very small content update that really doesnt add any value to the game except you dont have to personally farm a little.
from what ive seen the farm gather you would be better off farming the materials yourself with the hand farming boost.
this was implemented to get you out and about on the high seas more which at the moment are unsailable due to the massive lag issues which prevent you from lowering or raising sails and even parking your boat,.
you just need to pray that when parking you dont ground your boat or hit another boat or dock while spamming X to drop the anchor. 
how ever the lag issues are funny when the SOD's cannon balls stop midair so you can at least try turn your boat away from them.
the lag issue is not my end and i have evidence to prove that its the game servers and not my 200meg fibre connection and the 500mtr distance to the exchange from my house.
Dont let people blag you that its because of the amount of players, i had a 231 ping while in the freeport grid with 8 players connected, the server downgrade they did in season 3 due to low player count has done nothing but cause more lag.
The games supposed to be about sailing your boat on the high sea's but around 80% of the time your boat is under water acting like a sub due to the lag issues, i cant even begin to imagine what the Kraken fight would be like with these issues.

Dont even think about complaining to the devs on the discord channel as this will get you banned and all of your company too, even the players that have not logged in or played the game for months its a complete company ban so do be aware of this when joining other companies or even merging with them,.
theres massive favouritism towards players that dont complain about the game and the devs will even help them out by removing parked ships.

in my opinion the devs are trying to run the game into the ground and make it single player because its not been the big hit which they were hoping for and simply dont have the funds to keep the game going, they would rather waste money on stupid costumes for the more or less none existing dev team to look like total a5s's

The only good point about the game is that it has potential, but i really wouldnt count on the devs pushing this to its max nor fixing the many issues that have been present since its launch.

making the map smaller on the same userbase certainly is good for your server maintenance cost budget, but it sucks for the players who now step each others toes ALL THE TIME in desperate search for a plot of land to build on.

This game is a huge copy paste of ARK.. the grind is by far even worse than ark just to get some beautifully huge ship destroyed by a smaller ship just because a pirate ship can repair faster meaning that it can only take damage if you destroy their boards completely. However when your ship gets a hole in it the whole thing sinks so fast making it impossible to save the damn thing. (PVE)

We had to use up all our resources (You grind for hours on end) we had which mind you was like 3k each. There was only one time where in my ship I had 3 holes in it and no more planks left to repair it. So I had to resort to destroying some of my own ship which in return we did an oopsie and destroyed the top deck making it impossible to control or move the ship towards an island. But thankfully we were already on course towards one and was able to move the mast's. 

All while the wind direction not being synced with the other players so you had to rely on the main host to tell each player where the god damn wind was coming from. Crashed into a rock lowered the anchor and attempted to swim to the island while an alpha tiger killed us out of nowhere. Not to mention that after a certain time of playing the map glitches turning invisible for me and my other friends (Creatures were the only thing visible floating.) and the icons unsync making it nearly impossible to tell where the ship went. Thankfully you can view just the normal map with M and the atlas map is just reference.

Everything at its current state is just so badly optimized, the pirates are so overpowered that even in the 1.0 rated island we got handed to early on. But once we got stronger and understood how to cheese the terribly done npc's in the camp we just stomped the camps. Some of the pirates would get stuck on the cannon and wouldn't come off it unless you hooked your way up to the top where they are and attacked them forcing them to just jump off their turrets. 

However we were now stuck on the issue of needing to take out the god damn pirate ship. Every time you restart or reload the world the host is hosting the pirate ship will re-spawn a new and different. However if you only cleared the camp and didn't destory the ship on reset you will have to kill everything all over again. We grinded and grinded for 10's of hours to get bigger ship so we could take on a smaller lower level ship so we could take the pirate outpost. As we got into battle we soon realized that the pirate ships were just too overpowered mind you we were many times stronger then the small ship, had tons of ammo spent 30-40 mins on trying to take it out to only run out of resources and then sink due to one hole in our ship that didn't have any water going into it at all but still somehow had water leaking through air. We had no planks as we thought our ship would hold up longer and it would be easy enough to take out such an enemy. 

This game had caught my eye and the trailer at this point is such a huge scam and nothing like what the game is in its current state. As of right now I am done playing this stupid game as we just ran into too many bugs and problems that makes it unplayable. Yes this is early access but to be honest with you this game doesn't even deserve to be considered early access, its a huge joke and the devs just keep adding in random pointless shit into the game that makes it feel more like ark like more Dinosaur like creatures?? and less pirate ships??? Like wtf devs fix your buggy ass game and problems you have and then add more ships to the frigging game?? ITS A PIRATE GAME ffs... 

Bought this game when it was $10 and honestly that's what It should be priced at currently. It is not worth $30. If they fix and optimize the game then maybe it would be worth such a price.  I do not recommend this game in its current state save yourself the horrors and disappointment and wait for it to be fully released and fixed if that ever happens... its been 2 years so I very much doubt that. Too much of a cash grab and too similar to ark.

I can't say anything for the official as they made a private server; with the same settings but less people sort of thing.
But so far everything is going good! Things aren't too hard as long as I'm careful and the graphics are gorgeous as ever!
I will say the shadows need work(?) because our characters shadows look super odd.
Also we have good computers and still lag unless we turn off bloom and shadows and turn down the ground clutter. We've always had games, including ark; super high and never lagged. But maybe it's just our end, so take that at least with a grain of salt.
But super fun, love how realistic it tries to be without being too crazy.
Also! We're currently trying to build a Galleon and I love how you have to actually build it! That's super neat. :D
I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH. This game is a survival game above all else; if you don't like being careful with your surroundings and managing your food intake and diet variations; you will probably hate it. But that part does get better once you get yourself on your feet!

They rotate devs on and off the project who seem to want to ""make it theirs"" 

This game is like the new Folk Tale, I honestly can't put into words how much I can recommend staying away from this abysmal cluster F of a game.

It's not just the bugs, it's not just getting randomly grabbed by animals and dying, it's not just treasure maps spawning in unreachable places or enemy ships spawning on you in loading screens and killing you/your ship, it's not just the major time sync to breed animals (You breed to get better tames, sticking to taming is not an option), it's not just the fact that it's a massive grind and stuff takes forever. It's not just the fact that people can build stuff around your ships or destroy your buildings just because they don't like you. - Let me be clear, I had +level 100 tames, I had a big base with my friends. This doesn't come from not being able to reach end game. It has everything to do with not wanting anyone else to get stuck in the slog of dealing with these developers. These guys should honestly work on Neo Pets 2020, it's about closer to their skill level.



BELOW: Below is my review pre the third wipe.

I do enjoy this game and I play it with friends. Normally I wouldn't downvote a game if I am getting enough enjoyment to play it but there are a few big reasons why I am for this game.

My biggest issue with this game is the way islands work. As a Company (Player clan/guild) you can buy an island that you ""tax"" up to 20%. Most players keep this tax at max. There is no limit on how many islands you can own and some clans have 2-4 islands. There are islands that are ""free"" but the bulk of players have to choose between being on low pop islands where 20% of their farmed resources vanish or on an over populated island where they are fighting for space. This also causes problems when you need to build boats. People block off the shores and hold space by putting building pieces down and even worse, some people block off massive spaces to build massive castles/forts.

The game creates almost a capitalist society within the game. Players are able to accumulate a mass of resources and bulk wealth because new players are almost forced to pay the more long term players. Players also sell animal tames that make a huge difference in resource gathering adding more to the struggle of a new player.


The game has other annoying features like zoning between the map grids, there is no protection for getting bombarded by the ghost ships that sit in the water if they happen to be there while you are loading. Animals falling through your ship and other frustrating features like trying to feed animals during tames require awkward and precise positioning and climbing on ladders hanging off your boat can be difficult (and frustrating when you're being chased down by a shark in the water).

I can honestly say if the friends I am playing this with currently werent playing, I wouldn't be either.


The game is also riddled with bugs that can easily cause hours of work to just vanish quickly. 

It's also far to easy to have your work  broken by players who pull ghost ships into your stuff.",1572473801,1595310911,False,1,0,0.482589423656463623,1,True,False,True

834910,47837759,76561198300941624,0,3,42099,0,15056,1599357108,"Seriously, unless you're a part of a large group (think 10+ players), steer away from this game. A solo player will find the odds against them impossible. A group of fewer than five will find the odds crushing. There literally isn't an aspect of the game that wouldn't be broken. 

From technical issues, game engine, gameplay mechanics, farming and crafting, talents and skill, to even such things as impossibly difficult survival. It's not just about staving off hunger and thirst, but also balancing out four sources of food - which is nearly impossible, because fishing (for example) isn't working. Oh yes, and you will never be able to leave starting zones because there is no wood - trees are simply not respawning fast enough to keep up with demand. So even if you manage to build your own raft, it will rapidly decay (in less 24 hours!) and fall apart, unless you can keep spending literally hundreds of wood and hundreds of hide on repairs. Both are extremely difficult to come by. 

So you're faced with a choice: spend all your ""alive time"" trying to survive, or spend all your ""alive time"" trying to fix your raft. Or you can try to spend all your ""alive time"" trying to get enough supplies to build a respawning bed (which isn't working 90% of the time) and a few waterskins, and leave the starting zone. But if you do, remember that you'll die of hunger or dietary problems about halfway there. So there really isn't a way out. 

If you enjoy a ""game"" that keeps killing you, a game that is so riddled with bugs and issues that it's impossible to play right, or a game that simply sucks, you should try ATLAS. You won't be disappointed. 

Otherwise, stay away from ATLAS.

******
JANUARY 2019, EDIT:

The dev team have proven to have zero concept of how to build, run, and balance a game. Currently, all mega-companies are at a huge advantage over smaller ones, simply because the game has become a 95% grind and 5% of bugs. That leaves exactly 0% for fun. Between grinding and dealing with the same bugs that have been there a month ago, mega-companies can easily roll you anytime they like, and they more often do it just for the fun of it. Of course, they do that when you're logged off and asleep, because all the mega-companies are Chinese. On NA servers. 

There is absolutely no defense, no mechanism that would balance the play field. The devs keep changing the game to fu.ck the small companies over, they never addressed countless documented cases of exploiting, hacking and cheating - because they're friends with these exploiters. If you're familiar with ARK, recall a company called TEA - they're in Atlas as well, cheating and hacking just like in ARK.

Official servers, that (according to Grapeshot's big mouth) can accommodate 45k players are down to barely 3k players across the whole day - not ""in peak"", but ""in total"". This game is already dead, Grapeshot just haven't realized it yet.

******
JULY 2020, EDIT:
A year and half later. Nothing has changed - the game is still bugged as hell. Players have found a number of ""meta"" tactics and the whole game has become a laughing stock, mostly populated by exploiters, chinese farmers, and griefers - with only a few decent people around.   Game servers are unstable on a good day. Oh and would you think that a year and half after initial release someone would've fixed the ridiculous MOB animations that make animals and monsters look like taxidermy pieces trotting around on invisible wires, jerking back and forth, and rarely facing the direction they're moving?

 Don't bother with the toxic community that is official. They are soulless savages. This game effectively destroyed my faith in humanity. The Governor will say it's ok to build; only to wait until your base is ripe enough to rob while they have damage immunity during peace time. 
There is nothing you can do. It's basically giving the isle owner free reign to bully, harass, and murder everyone on the claim with impunity. 

 Wanted to build in Lawless? Too bad, you can't build beds. However you can build beds on boats but they are the first to be sunk when you get raided in lawless. 

 This game seems like it's developed completely naive to the audience it's catering to. You want people to sail and PvP in the open sea? Then make base defenses stronger, make it harder to break in rather then breaking into a boat. More people would find raiding bases to be more effort than they are worth. Making them consider actually using boats instead of bears with cannon carts. 

 Nobody is interested in fair combat and nobody recruits out of fear of ""insiders"". This is what I have come to calling, Honey Pot PvP and it's disgraceful. 

 I played this game for 7 days. Day 1 I sail to an Isle and ask if it's okay to build, I get the ""ok"" allied with the Governor. Day 5, the Governor robbed my fort during peace time. I Leave the isle to find another ""it's cool, you can build here."" So I ally up again... Day 7, Robbed by the Governor again. Absolute abuse of the system and Grapeshot Games does nothing about it. Ever. My time on official was a waste of time.

 However, Single player / Host is this games only saving grace. You can play the whole game map with a group of friends, allowing you to play the entire ocean map while not having to worry about getting ""offlined"" or ""cheesed"". This is why I recommend the actual game.

Their official server provider choice is butts (maybe not for all their servers, but it takes over 12hrs of laggy areas before anyone bothers to do anything about it).

The wild spawns are weird at times, quite often in clumps of aggressive mobs that are fine solo or maybe 2, but more than that gets you killed. The game completely disregards player build structures when deciding where to spawn wild animals, sometimes even spawning them inside enclosed buildings (that have no visible ground in view). This means having to deal with your tames dying because they were killed in the barn by wild spawn spawning [b]inside[/b] the barn.

Taming is bothersome compared to Ark. Small simple animals are beyond easy to tame since they are ""passive tames"", feed berries/food to build up the tame bar and keep the aggressive spawns away. The other animals that are tamable, require you to block them in somehow, or ""tank"" the damage from them as you need to get them down to 20% or less HP then use a bola on them. Then while they are down for 2min you feed them the food while also avoiding their attacks. This gets tedious if they kill you, more so if you didn't have a bed nearby, the longer you wait between feedings the more the tame bar goes down, leading to losing some or all of the progress you'd made in taming.

For building, the game is mostly like vanilla Ark, but looking pirate-y. Unfortunately to avoid the issue of wild spawns in building, some suggest building on stilts, but this is going to be a problem as tamed animals will glitch thru the ceiling either partially or entirely. 

The vitamin system instead of Ark's straight food stat is tedious. It is more realistic than only eating steaks or berries, but still tedious. Fish is extremely tedious to get as the safest way is fishing, but that can have several minutes between fish being caught. Berries and vegetables/herbs are plentiful, but if you can't get all 4 vitamins it won't matter.

The skills system needs work. While it is neat to have perks intermixed with learning crafting recipes, it is also slightly annoying to get certain things unlocked when you don't want or need other perks/crafting recipes. You can get a good amount of blueprints from ships and random flotsam, but this can be a tedious way to get a recipe you want but don't have the points to learn. I don't have a good replacement or suggestion on what could be done instead, I do think that it needs to be looked at. Allowances for solo play should be a thing in games of this type, and yet PvP and multiplayer are still the key things that seem to get patched.

Lastly, there are the minigames. Using certain items or doing certain actions will initiate a minigame, the fishing minigame is interesting and for me seems easy enough for the simple fish I've caught. When fishing, you sit on a chair and use a rod (on a dock near water) or a net(on a ship that is moving), when you snag a fish it pops up ""press A"" or whatever(it asks for keys/buttons dependant on using keyboard or controller) I can only imagine that some fish would be much more difficult, but I haven't seen them. The other type of minigame is much worse, i find. It will show a bar, with a range highlighted to stop the moving marker in, you don't have a lot of time, and while doing this minigame things still happen around you (same minigame for digging some water up and for reloading a gun, which are all blackpowder weapons). This will happen a few times for each action, usually 3 successes are needed, tho there may be some actions that need more or less.

Some of the negatives of the game can be countered by mods, some can't. This shouldn't be required, and the company should be listening to the community about these issues, or looking into which mods are being used most to see what else could be fixed in the game.

TL;DR As with any game I get, if I can get 1hr of play per dollar i spent I'm ok with the money I spent. This game is still not the greatest, or worth full price with all the bugs. It is more fun with friends enjoying the bugs too, tho some are defeating our will to continue playing.",1595002018,1595002018,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Let me explain... 
So i did manage to build me a Schooner in Single player and decided to go 4 maps down to get an elephant so my Galleon ship building would go a bit faster, after getting half way i decided to go to shore since it was storming... ok no issues.. except it being -15 degrees in tropical area and i froze to death, no problem since i have a bed in my schooner.... or i thought it would not be a problem.. i could not find my ship anywhere.. so i decided to check the logs and what do i find there?

its not ""ok"" to sail for two hours just to have the ship do a disappearing act just so you would have to start all over again.. now keep in mind i had full set of crew on that ship with over 1000 gold and LOADS of food, so there is no reason for it to just blink out of existence!",1594995452,1594995626,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really wish I could say it's a great game, but it's simply not. I have a major issue with this game, and it can't go un-noticed. 

#1: You can't play this game if you have a life. I figured this would be the case, as this came from the devs that brought us ARK, a game that had tons of potential, and then drove that potential straight into the ground. It's the sad  truth with these games, and if you have a life, I recommend you look at last oasis. However, this may not always be the case. It is obvious they are trying to make the game more single player friendly, so this could easily change in the future.

Now that that's out of the way, it's time to look at how this game is not great, but still not bad. 

#1: The devs care about the player in this game. This already makes this game better than ark, and it shows. The made TONS of quality of life changes that make this game really good. Unlike in ark, there are no game breaking tames that you can get! You can't get a flying tame, but this is only to promote using one of the best things in this game, which I will get into later. It's not nearly as grindy as ark is. It feels like i'm playing a x4 server when I play this game, and it's great. Taming is not as bad as it might look, all you need to do is make a taming trap, which is something you already had to do when playing ark. The tames are not necessary, but become so if you are trying to make large scale things.

#2: SHIPS! No, im not talking about the sad excuse for boats in ark called rafts, but actual ships. You can get small ships, big ships, medium ships, even friend ships! The ships are great fun to use, and ship combat is amazing. And unlike ark, bigger does not always mean better. The schooner, which is a medium ship, is one of the best combat ships you can get! Get creative with your ships, this game lets you. 

#3: the leveling system. This game's leveling system is leagues better than ark's, and it shows. In a nutshell, this game's skill tree is as follows: say you learn ""advanced tools"" on the skill tree. You now have access to all the metal tools, like a metal pick, axe, sickle, etc... And it's super easy to get to. This makes it to where you can start getting good tools and items fast, and you don't have to grind for levels to get it. 

#4: The grid system. I love the way this system works, I really do! There are 5 types of grids in this game. Freeports, lawless, claimable, golden age ruins, and center maw. For this, we will only have to talk about the first 3, as the other 2 are late game. First let's talk about freeports. This is the area that you will want to spawn in when you are looking for where you want to spawn. PVP is disabled on these grids, and there are special npcs that will help you get on your feet and ready to travel the atlas world! Next, lets talk about lawless. These areas are tricky, and you have to choose between this one, or claimable when figuring out where to settle. This one has no laws, and you can get raided at any time. If you decide to settle here, make sure you hide your base. These grids might be the ones you want to farm on, as you won't have your resources taxed. Finally, we get to the claimable. These have 2 12 hour phases. Peace phase, and pvp phase. peace phase is what it sounds like, pvp is disabled at this time. PVP phase is the time you can attack anyone, it's kind of like the purge. Both phases last 12 hours before switching to the next phase. These lands are taxed, and the owners can choose what the % is. Of course you could try to claim your own island, and you can control the tax and the phases, but it will cost you. 

#5: combat. This game's combat is no last oasis, but it's not bad either. for melee weapons, you usually have 3 types of attacks: normal, fast, and heavy. Normal is at a normal speed normal damage. Fast is a much faster attack, but sacrifices damage. Heavy is a much slower attack, but does tons of damage. However, some melee weapons will have special abilities. Guns are very powerful, (except for blunderbuss that one's trash) but take time to reload. You play a minigame when reloading, and the better you play the faster you reload. Bows are ok. 

And that's everything you need to know when thinking of buying atlas! If it sounds like fun, I recommend you wait for a sale, the game gets dirt cheap. Thanks for reading!",1545671882,1594957489,True,0,0,0.520219326019287109,0,True,False,True

First of all its basically a re-skinned Ark.  Literally almost everything in the game including menus, materials, and most of the bugs are exactly the same as Ark.  Yes there are some big differences, even some good ones.  But this is NOT worth supporting, purchasing, or even playing.

Played on a private hosted server (actually 5 because you have to play the different grid maps).  So we paid for the game and the servers which is alot of money to require from people to play.   Why do you force people to pay for a server to host a single grid of a few islands worth of exploration?  

The crafting is kinda annoying that you have several different named resources of the same thing (5 different woods, metals, fibers, etc).  So you have go around and collect these different ones (required for some items) and store them.  The crafting tree is different and a bit more tree like instead of what Ark had, but not alot of depth there. Skills aren't very inspiring and some of the skill tree points unlock multiple things which says there wasn't alot of thought put in. Illusion of choice.

Building is similar to Ark with many of the same issues.  Not able to snap, not very intuitive, can't pick up things after 10 seconds of placing (so experimenting multiple pieces will cost you).  Ark had a mod for this very purpose (S+) and they didn't fix this.

Boats are pretty cool.  Water and waves are really well done.  Sailing with wind and all that is very interesting and fun to do.  But the simplicity of the wind system and the fact that you can spend hours at sea can get rather annoying when island hopping.  Some cool diving and grappling things to keep you busy out at sea.  Clearly where they spent most of the dev efforts.

Animals (aka dinos since they just copied Ark code) are more or less the same.  Great looking and mostly well behaved animals.  Atlas went a slightly different route with their ""alpha"" predators.  Although tons of complaints on the forums about that garbage system and how they can be quite annoying and constantly have to deal with keeping your outposts free of attacking snakes and lions.  Some of the animals are buggy (croc) while others need to be balanced (Iions).  Taming is atrocious, basically having to pray to the RNG gods that you dont get hit while trying to tame animals.

Food/farming/cooking is a huge downgrade compared to Ark.  Nothing in the food tree is inspiring or resembling anything you want to do for any reason.  Having to manage your vitamins on top of food & water is so freaking annoying.  Its not hard, its annoying.  Need to find water and play mini games to do certain things.  

Weather is awful.  Its freezing one minute, blazing hot the next.  All attempts to make it more difficult, instead make it less realistic and more annoying.  People want to play the game, not micro every bad thing possible.  

Very little documentation about the game.  Its basically dead.   Anything you may read is incomplete, not fully understandable, or just not correct. I get it, early access, but then don't charge an arm and a leg for a game in early access this long.  Most of this game has been done before.  Again its a copy of Ark and they failed with a working prototype game.

So let's start with the dessert first: The map is huge, similar to the ARK engine, and still actively receiving updates.
It's a hefty game at a little over 130GB. For those with minimal space, you'll probably have to sacrifice a game or several to enjoy this title. If you have a beefy PC, the game runs very smoothly. Beautiful oceans, awe-inspiring atmosphere, and detailed islands. The ship building is very neat. The only static part is the empty shell. What you build inside it is completely up to you. An empty hull? No problem! Private cabins? Go for it! Tall tower on the back filled with rows of cannons? You bet! The only limitation (other than imagination) is the weight and ship dimensions. You can pick which sails to use and where to put them.

Now on to the veggies ... a lot of the community is toxic. Mega companies ran by immature trolls and chinese players rule the seas. Even if you manage to stay off their radar, you'd be hard pressed to find a place to call home. Most companies that own islands are very xenophobic. Player-base aside, this game has a number of bad features and bugs. Take the nutrition mechanism for example. You have to maintain a balanced diet of 4 different types of vitamins. Too much or too little of even one of these, and you'll die a quick and painful death. Some foods spike the values too. Try eating more than a few coconuts and you'll see what I mean. The game also requires a really good PC. It's smooth as butter on my RTX 2070 but barely even crawled on my old GTX 960. There have been many major improvements made since the game's conception, but overall it's still poorly optimized and could use serious fixing in that department.

Despite the shortcomings, ATLAS is a very addictive game. You'll probably find yourself coming back again and again as I did. I definitely recommend this game.",1594878517,1594878517,True,1,0,0.513596713542938232,0,True,False,True

Think of it as Arks engrams but each having a branch of their own; I.E. Cooking, Melee combat, Ranged, Piracy, Construction, Breeding and Taming to name a few, so it really opens up the game to suit which ever style you want.
I also enjoyed the different types of basic resources and ingredients, as well as utilising them for blueprints etc, slowly I'm getting used to them!

Overall I'm thoroughly enjoying it but now I'm going to talk about the negatives so people are aware.

Pretty buggy but I'm sure that's down to being an early release game and hopefully this resolved soon, some of the issues I've listed here;
I've not spent much time on it but played enough to know some of the basic mechanics, I like what they've done with this game and wish they would implement some of this on Ark too!

Getting the compass power stones was great and fun but the creatures defending the stone in the caves were clipping and hard to deal with without lock on!
Onto treasure maps, once discovered after sailing for a few hours, I think it would be helpful to have maps for the island you're currently on but have low rewards for them, but also once you've finally travelled across several map squares to find a low quality treasure I encountered a bug with the Army of the Damned, they had many of them spawn the the walls and ground and even after reloading the game and even leaving the zone and returning it it still hadn't fixed which prevented me from finishing the treasure map unfortunately.

I think once they fix the Collisions and Projectiles as well as some combat animations the game would be much smoother! Such as enemy Pirate camps and their guys on cannons! I can't shoot them at all, I have to go around them and melee them, which is super difficult, especially when they're on a tower with no way up!

Again Pirate camps and ships seem empty and dead, having the NPC's roam about the camps and ship decks (just like the animals and creatures do) would make it feel much more immersive.
There are other things I could talk about but I'm going to spend more time on the game and report back after with my findings.

Hopefully they see this as informative and constructive!

- - Old posts;
PROS
- beautiful water/landscape and easy learning curve
- working together with your mates to fix a sinking ship
- exploring and going on treasure hunts
- great ship customization
CONS (as of right now)
There are multiple bugs/annoyances in the game..These should be addressed by the Devs immediately!
- swimming in/on ice or water? you tell me. The swimming mechanic causes you to move constantly like your gliding on ice..very difficult to board that ship when you cant stop to grab the ladder
- treasure map quests are glitching. Twice my buds and I were booted to an entirely different zone in the middle of trying to dispatch the treasure guardians! WTH? 
- needs more land based buildings
- needs more skills
- 4 official servers..? really? (7/12/20 - this has changed to LESS)
- Army of the damned are OP AS F***! 
- Vitamin management is annoying...
SUMMARY
Pretty much an ARK clone with pirates/ships - tough to stop playing...even with the bugs and glitches!
Buy this while its on sale! Great value for $5-10!
Jan 2020 EDIT: friends and I were playing today and out of nowhere all 3 of our ships disappeared while we were on an island.. dont know why.. VERY frustrating... if you can't bounce back from things like this..maybe dont buy this game - fair warning.
Feb 2020 edit (changed rating to thumbs down): tried again...still BROKEN! ok so my friends and i play on  private non dedicated servers that we make - and for about the 3rd time the game has desynced and weve lost our ships and crew. The last one the whole game went corrupt to where we couldnt even load it. The game is broken..i have to change my rating to non-rec. Grapeshot...fix this game. FIX IT!! I want to enjoy it..but if a core mechanic of the game is to lose everything and restart because REASONS!? ...I cant..i just cant do it anymore...
July 2020 comments: what makes a game good? is it the fact that even though you know at some point you are going to be let down/disappointed/annoyed, yet you still come back for it? maybe? maybe not? i dont know anymore.. changed the rating back to thumbs up for one reason: A PVE unofficial server..and Im having a blast. The bugs are SoRtA taken care of... the owner of the server(s) has a good thing going on. Havent had this much fun with Atlas for a while. I said it earlier: if its on sale - get it.

It was a good concept, but forcing the players to play a certain way instead of just letting them play pisses me off, I refuse to do pvp in a game like this where you grind for hours to have somebody come and off line raid you while you are at work or in bed sleeping.
I should have uninstalled it when they took intel out of the clothing, but intel really doesn't matter as it just rolls the dice on what percentage intel you get when crafting, you can re spec and max out your intel, have a high lvl crow on your shoulder and still only get a .8 percent bonus, I call bullshit.
I do like the artwork, very nicely done.
The blackwood map was disappointing, where you get jumped by a predator walking through the town, one guy I played with hired five crew to start off with and got jumped by a lion 10 seconds after that and lost them all.
The heatwaves are stupid, they are hotter than the highest recorded temp on earth by about 20 degrees, sharks spawn and eat the crew you just saved from a SOTD before you get them on your boat.
I only played on modded servers so I can't speak of the official servers.

I have no interest in joining a public server for this game, as I am not the kind of person with the time to spend on keeping up with an active crew or competing against the inevitable Monopoly clans (or companies, as this game calls them) that form with these type of games.

Had a great first few hours, decided to go out exploring the Ocean with my friend. We had crossed over several coordinate grid lines (in this game, the playable area is a very large map consisting of stitched-together smaller maps which form the coordinates of the map). Looking at the map we noticed every time we crossed over a new coordinate line, our ship icon would reset back to the square where we started, which we just thought was a funny bug, since our ship itself was moving along just fine. Upon reaching our destination, we both died, which shouldn't have been the end of the world, but when we went to spawn back on the bed on our ship, it still said it was way back where we came from. Upon spawning in, the game crashed and when we re-loaded the game the entire ship was just gone in its entirety. Pretty much sums up my experience with the game, and why I'm already writing a review with so few hours into the game.

Positive:
Great ideas and a much improved building system (albeit still buggy as LV-426) over its predecessor Ark: Survival Evolved. Ship building and customization is one of the main attractions to this game, and for good reason - you pretty much have control (for the most part) of every aspect of what goes on your ship and how it looks. Beautiful landscapes and an enormous amount of craftable items at your disposal, making for a build-your-own pirate adventure game with a lot of potential.

Negative:
Game is a buggy unpolished mess, which is about all I have to say here. I enjoy Ark, and I enjoy this game (so far) for what they are, but that being said I am not a fan of how this studio/company cobbles together their games in a hurry and just piles content onto an unstable foundation. They say they are not adding more content for a bit, and are working on ""laying out the framework"" for the game, but this game has been in Early Access for 2 years, and it is very very obviously just Ark using different assets and some tweaked mechanics, and that game was supposedly finished years ago and still feels like Goat Simulator with pretty graphics.",1594417929,1594417929,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a new genre.
--------------------- (First part is mainly about ark and how it relates to atlas)
Ark was the example of potential for this genre. It was Extremely bare bones at first, UI, rubber banding, server performance and game performance was absolutely terrible, but hey i played with a 970 when it came out and was actually alright with 20fps when i knew the grind was so deep.

The majority of the joy of the game isn't really about using it's mechanics, those things are buggy and stiff most of the time and pvp combat is laughable alot of the time if you aren't playing on a dedicated server with good performance and low population.

 PVE content is where the game actually shines though. Endless gameplay loops that keep you happy, even if the controls and how you do something is un-intuitive or glitchy, you were in there with 30 other people all trying the same thing, getting more lucky with dino stats or finding new cool blueprints. 

The sense of community within a server is probably the most integral part to these games and ARK was extremely hit or miss depending on the temperament of the people you played with. People on your server could just place pillars everywhere (which we never really saw wildcard implement much of a method to stop it) and reduce any of the natural environments you would like to build in. 

Wow a really nice view on the edge of a hill, perfect for a base ? Someones already placed some foundation down either to control other peoples building locations or to ""plan a new area"" which essentially means 'i want to build here in the future but i'm too much of an inconsiderate arsehole to actually put the effort in now'. All of this just leads to unused sections of map that anyone could use, you've got a very disjointed sense of placement as people tend to place random things everywhere and you're left with little land to work with, and you need that for the game to even start to be fun. 

Problem with all this is that everyone does it, what is the point letting someone pillar up around your base when you can just pillar it yourself to stop them, hell, the part next to my base, why dont i just claim that as well....Congratulations, you've given players no other choice than to be toxic to one another wildcard.

BUT THE CATALYST IS ALL IT TAKES IS ONE ARSEHOLE. JUST ONE. Your entire server can be ruined if one person establishes the annoying strategy and everyone BENDS their knee to it because why wouldn't you? Someone is going to take the land you plan to build on regardless of if you are a new starter or someone moving an established base somewhere else so why not fight the fire with fire.

i could go on with the way the game functions and why it's a buggy mess but at the end of the day, everything that wildcard stands for is taking the lowest road possible, doesn't matter if people are angry it either effects the bottom line or you're player numbers are dwindling. 

Wildcard are FAAAAAAAR beyond trying to fix the major issues that plague any of their games because the system they've chose to create ark and atlas from is all about SCALE and has nothing to do with being workable. 

Fixes cause more problems and essentially the core and fundamental mechanics of the game are so out of wack and un-tuned that they've left themselves so much work to do. Rubber banding was an issue for years before they decided to work on it. Building mechanics could really easily be re-worked just so you can toggle building options but that never materialised. All the small things that make the game serviceable are thrown to the way side for flashy event like content that all these developers are feeding into. It makes sense, making content for the people who play the game is great but when you make content that runs on a system of instability you get glaring issues when you play. 

Frustration is certainly the word to use when playing ark or atlas. 

People are tied to the game based on the huge loss they would have after putting all the work in and these games cannot be developed by studios like wildcard, They are far too far up their own arse to deal with any criticism and it seems that mentality has stemmed throughout the team. Passive aggressive people who have no idea what makes a good game, probably pushed to create content for more money but ultimately have shot themselves in the foot so many times they really should just pack up and get a wheel chair.

You've proven it can be done in some way wildcard but you definitely don't care now about if it's done in the right way.

Time for a larger developer who actually establishes a sense of community and communication to kill this studio once and for all and Even though i have loved playing ark for its fundamentals, the frustrations will make me a very happy man the day that someone pulls the plug.

Everyone who plays ark or atlas for a while knows it and we're just waiting for someone to do it better honestly

To keep it short in a pros and cons list:
Pros:
- Massive world (I don't use the term massive lightly btw) 
- Survival open world MMO - plays a little like Rust on that aspect (though people say it's more similar to Ark. I never played Ark so can't compare) - but much less stressful as way more places to hide or get out of the way of people.
- Exploration is highly encouraged. Hell you need to explore to level up late game.
- Early game does not feel grindy at all. Mid game is only grindy if you don't learn. Basically way less grindy than most other crafting / base building games. Heck even late game where 'super loot' is very rare doesn't feel grindy through the sheer number of other things you're doing while trying to get that maxed out shipyard BP.
- Pretty decent graphics. 
- Very decent performance. You get fps drops with massive buildings and harbours but, once again, compared to just about every other game in the genre I was very pleasantly surprised at the performance of the game in massive ship battles or around massive bases. (Unless you are on x-box - you will be crashing trying to look at basic bitch bases and harbours that more than three people built)
- Lots of Skill trees and basically a very large learning curve - but not a steep one. You will still be learning and figuring out new things, while the leveling process definitely feels rewarding.
- Very few crashes

Cons:
- The few crashes that do happen can be lethal due to simply very bad and lazy design. Crashing while you are zoning into a new area for instance would make your ship continue to sail at full speed. This wouldn't be an issue since yeah - it's a game - we all know shit happens. Problem is, you are then prevented from reconnecting back in straight away until the server ""boots"" your client giving you the ""client already in the world"" error - INSTEAD of the normal and sane way that every other game has handled this in the past, where it automatically boots the DCed client when it detects another connection from the same client. This is a pretty simple and basic oversight that is quite a bit of an embarrassment to the dev team imho.
- Sloppy design like wild animals spawning inside / under your buildings causing them to destroy things they can damage
- Sloppy design like wild animals insisting on attacking targets that they are incapable of damaging 
- Lots of menus and key bindings simplified to accommodate x-box controllers. For instance your whistle hotkeys overlap with your building hotkeys - and you cannot change one without the other. 
- NPC pathing and NPC / PC collision is... bad... manageable but bad. 
- Cross platform with X-Box, meaning neutered features to accommodate low quality hardware and lack of control surfaces.

TLDR: Cool fun game, one of those MMORPGs that is super fun with a bunch of people but with still plenty to do when you are on your own due to timezone differences, which is not polished out and with has some sloppy design. Recommend as you'd definitely get your money's worth before you are anywhere near close to getting bored with it.

EDIT: I am updating this review to not recommended. Now regarding the wipe and the map changes - those I actually welcome with open arms. I would have to disagree with a large chunk of the negative reviews on here stating that it's getting rid of PvE, or there was no information etc. etc.

There was plenty of information - everyone knew the wipe was coming early June. The information was on the forums, on facebook, was talked about widely in discussion and in game and overall wasn't a surprise. The changes and updates to the map layout are also a welcome change - with the map now consisting of clear regions. 

So why would I not recommend the game now based on the last update? Simple - the map was shrunk by nearly half the size. The original selling point for this game was the massive open world, ready for exploration and where you would hear of conflicts and wars happening somewhere on the other side of the ocean between companies and powers you never even heard of. This gave the gameworld a truly unique immersive feel for it's scale. The explanation of ""it's to promote player interaction"" is complete BS - there was plenty of player interaction as it was, with fights and raids less than a sector away. Whether the reality was that the devs were too lazy to update or put time into restructuring the land space of the old caliber or didn't want to host as many servers we would never know - but point remains:

Literally close to half of the game content in terms of land mass has been neutered (104 out of 225 sectors removed). The issue has nothing to do with PvP vs PvE. You can take ANY game (pvp / pve / base building / raiding / whatever combination thereof) and cut the map in half for the sake of a comparative example of what is wrong the issue is. Atlas went from the game I was exclusively playing and vehemently enjoying to a game for which if I could get a refund at this point in time, I would.",1588665731,1594199633,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you play on official PvP expect to get offline all the time unless your in a big group that can cover 24/7. If not you have to be on atleast 9 hours a day to keep your base safe. Playing Official PvE expect people to drop floors everywhere so you can't build and wake up some days to see large walls around your base or boat blocking you in because of trolls and those nothing you can do. If you do decide to play go to a unofficial with a good number of people and admins that stop griefing. And lastly full of bugs and exploits. Not worth the $30 only buy when on sale.

S4 update:
Was enjoying unofficial till the devs decided to for what ever reason delete a handful of islands and add ""new"" islands. But the ""new"" islands were always in the game some unofficial servers were using those islands already. So basically forcing just about all unofficial server to wipe. Yet the game game still has ark assets in the game. So they delete atlas assets for no reason but still decide to keep ark assets.
What is the point of wiping just to make the map smaller but yet keep every level exploit duping exploit in (Note most of the exploit the devs have known for months)? First 3 days a handful of mega companies used the level exploit to hit 120. When will they patch it? Who knows the damage is already done.

Give this game a shot. its on sale for only $10 as of right now. 

Now onto the review. The game is massive and with scaling down the map size, the game is even more optimized from what it was at first. The pvp is intense and the player base is finally growing. Average pop per region is around 20 or more!! The graphics can be more colorful though NVIDIA as its now supported. There are some bugs but this game is a game preview and people failed the realize that. You will get mad at this game sometimes. You might get raided, fall under the map when you die, and maybe every now and then see a lighting glitch. I have this game for XBOX and Steam. And my final input is this. For a game preview this game is outstanding. Compared to a Full released game maybe a C-. Its fun, relaxing, and stressful. That's what you get though with these type of games. If you like Ark but wanted something more primitive. This game is definitely for you. And with the mods you can add to this game.

I have spent hours, days trying to get this server working and only succeeded once and we played for 2 days until there was an update, so i ran the server update... guess what happened, islands were in the water, server kept crashing players kept getting booted from game, one of my friends kept falling through the map.

Graphically it's very nice, it looks good and feels great, sounds are okay, but... that's about as far as the praise goes. I never played the MMO on public servers because there's no protection for low-level or casual players, so you immediately get ganked while trying to leave the spawn area, and never actually get anywhere or see any of the game.

The game play is awful;
Combat is clunky, slow, and absolutely not intuitive. If an enemy's attack animation hasn't finished (I.E. they've swung their mace overhead, and it's currently in the ground), you can take damage simply by being close enough, even if the attack is clearly over. The game wants to be Dark Souls, with everything doing a lot of damage to you (seriously, don't even attempt combat with anything other than wild animals unless you're wearing Plate Armour with all the skills), however with the levels being effectively meaningless it's almost impossible to work out whether you can take an enemy or not. Almost every weapon is completely 
ineffective against any enemy unless it's the pike.
You can max out bows, unarmed, etc... but unless you're trying to use the unnecessarily complex and slow combat system that doesn't work because it's an early-access crapshoot, anything you do against the enemy will do no damage - unless you use a pike.

Every quest is broken. Enemies can spawn in the ground, inside buildings without doors, and basically be hidden without cheats, and thus prevent you from finishing the quest.

Boats are great, they're fun enough to sail in, except you can't see enemies unless they're on top of you, by which point it's too late - the indecipherable level system comes into play again and your crappy level 12 boat you spent so long on will suddenly be in combat with a dozen other ships of three and four times your level, and you will die, and your boat will sink, and you'll need to start all over again.

Enemy spawns are complete madness; there's no level-specific areas, no concept of level-matching, no ties at all between game difficulty and player expectation. You can be level one, or level 30 - when you find your first treasure map and get to the location, a dozen enemies will spawn, and they'll be a couple of the weakest enemy, a couple of the toughest enemy, a hodgepodge of anything in between, and they'll all have randomly assigned levels that don't actually help you gauge how difficult anything is. You will die a dozen times, get frustrated, then realise that it doesn't matter how you think the game is played, you discover there's a specific way to play it that the devs designed around, but spent no time explaining or making obvious. Good luck figuring it out. You'll hate the game before you get there.

And worse yet, the same thing happens on the ocean - doesn't matter whether it's your first time on the ocean, or your milliionth, whether you're on a raft with a single small sail, or a fully kitted out galleon - every enemy spawn is at least six ships of varying level, ALL of which are tougher than you and whatever boat you're in.

There's loads of recipes for various crafting items, but the really stupid thing is that even with the 'diversity' of the materials, they're all the same damned thing and all result in the same products. There's no incentive to build anything outside of the starting area. There's no reason to; the difficulty in getting there is just too high, and the reward for doing so is actually nil.

And all of this awfulness without even going to mention the bugs. Oh Jesus the bugs. Enemies spawning in unreachable positions, invincible enemies while they're manning turrets, sudden and random loss of items, unrecoverable map errors between game sessions that cost you all of your progress, randomly disappearing boats and suddenly spawning in the middle of the ocean... the game is unplayable, even for early access.

It feels like the devs made a resource-harvesting, house- and boat-building, and character customisation game, and then realised they needed to put actual content in, half-arsed something together, and called it done. This was a horrible experience, and I hope I never have to relive something this bad again.

I feel like it has negative reviews because of server issues. But if you rent a small server with friends, or prefer solo play you should be having the time of your life. Even the entire goal of the game is more fluid and comprehensive. 
Anyways, great job to the devs, and I really hope they keep working on new expansions or a new game in the future. I definitely hope the sloppy start of their servers didn't end their studio early because they are an amazing studio compared to Wildcard, even if they're an off branch of the same studio.

The real poblem is simply this:  Cyclones.  They're unrealistic in every way, FAR too abundant, and take time away from the game.  It's too dangerous to sail until directly after a rain.  If you don't know when the last rain was, it's usually best to wait.  This takes a LOT of time away from available play time.  At the very least, as I play on a private server, put in a command that allows for the control of the number of cyclones from a ton to none.  A slider would be great, but not necessary.  Any kind of control would be better than none if it allowed for a severe reduction in their numbers.  I'd be okay if it were more like one every so often, but as it is now, and with the way they spawn, you can't really avoid them more oft than not.  It isn't uncommon to see 10 or more and they ... oddly, tend to chase you. 

I want to recommend this game, but sadly, I'm having trouble doing so for this reason.  The number of ghost ships is fine as far as I'm concerned.  They add an aspect of fun, but the cyclone frequency is just broken.

If something changes with the cyclones, I'll change my review.  This is the ONLY thing keeping me from recommending it currently.

2/21/19 Update:  I wanted to love this game so badly.  Today, all my ships and tamed animals disappeared.  It has been a struggle against game breaking bugs from the beginning.  I've uninstalled the game.  There's no point in playing it currently.  Maybe in the future at some point.  

They did change cyclones, but they didn't decrease the number of cyclones overall, they just decreased the chance they spawn at all during a storm from 100% to 33% and they do 100% more damage.  I'd be happy with 50% chance to spawn and 50% of the number of the freaking things with 100% (double) damage. 

Sadly, I can recommend the game less now than ever before.  Don't get this game yet.  Wait.  If you want the early access game price, so be it but be warned.

07/5/20 I keep holding out hope.  Sadly, it's to no avail.  They're bug fixing but introducing more bugs than they fix with each patch.  At this point, the game needs the FFXIV treatment.  Taken down, completely rebuilt, and re-released.  We'll see what the future brings.  They should be starting Phase 2 of their roadmap to a better game soon.  Sadly, based on phase 1 so far, I'm not confident.  The second they make changes for the better, I'll be happy to post a positive comment about it.  Until then... I still can't recommend it.",1548192527,1593934192,False,5,0,0.495772808790206909,0,True,False,True

So your locked into a smaller area around said lawless to claim an island, that will already be held by one alliance or another so your forced to be a renter on their island and pay tax as well as if they decide to structure wipe, or just leave and someone else comes in and decides to your work is gone.
So many sooooo many things wrong with the way the dev team went, horrible changes for the most part across the board gearing up for the worst season of atlas yet.... map wont even be fun to play on all the pvp is going to be dead center far away from anywhere anyone is keeping ships sooo sailing to fight is gonna be a thing which they said they were going to limit. just it show's the development team doesn't actively play atlas nor look into how the game is playing.",1593920007,1593920007,False,2,0,0.489959359169006348,0,True,False,True
