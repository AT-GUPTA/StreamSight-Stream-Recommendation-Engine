... but it's too expensive, the DLC prices are unthinkable (at the least regional prices), and it's really hard to find match.
Most of the time you have to start a match solo and hope some more players show up. It usually takes 1-2 missions solo for someone to join.
There's a chance for trolls to join the game as well. They can prevent the mission from ending (can't kick when only 2 players in a match), and can team-kill when confronted.

Also, the game has a REALLY BAD leveling system, where you need exp AND in-game currency to lvl classes and weapons. To be able to play a class to it's full potential, you have to farm A LOT...

  I am revising this part of my previous review to add more concrete clarity, the game has finite content which is its fatal flaw, but also its golden apple, what I mean by this is, once you complete every mission on hard mode, it gets very very VERY repetitive if you want to excel further, it is pointless to attempt beating insane/extreme with online matchmaking due to either lack of pc players or trolling/horrible console players, so to ale this, you need to play alone. 
           Playing alone however can be quite frustrating, you need to play a single mission countless times to gain enough knowledge to beat it or just be extremely lucky. This is where the casual aspect of the game dies and is no more. The game does a sharp pivot from casual to uber competitive due to the fact that the devs provide no alternative solo missions instead your forced to play missions designed for 4 people but as a solo person, which just further increases the difficulty. Not to mention the insane amount of grinding you need to do to level each class to 30, although prestige seems to be unnecessary which is nice.
     If you have no interest in this part of the game than unfortunately you have ran out of content, the same is with horde mode, their seems to be a hard cap on waves with randoms or solo that can effectively be completed, not to mention the copious amount of single session hours needed to progress in horde.

XL horde mode is absolutely amazing and would love more maps for them, the flexibility of play is much better with the hidden alcoves you can pay for!

Conclusion: Game is extremely fun but has a hard cap on content for most players, which is probably why the consistent player-base is copious amounts of new or returning players that play for short periods of time than quit, this in turn means the online community is the uber competitive snobs you will find in most comp games which is quite unfortunate. 
Highly recommend purchasing this though and giving it a shot, if you like it you REALLY  like it!

The game is far to reliant on having other players to make the missions reasonable to complete alone. 
This is the exact opposite of what a casual game wants, you need to be a competitive achievement hunter essentially if you want to beat missions alone, due to how tedious ,boring, boring, and frustrating it quickly becomes attempting to beat missions by yourself.

Now this wouldn't be a problem if the game had a plethora of players to fill lobbies... like at all.

Instead Saber continues to run the game like they have been and not innovating or trying anything new in the slightest. Oh we added some new boring component to the game that is basically the same thing as a previous item, but expanded upon very slightly.

Make difficulty more interesting, make a solo mode version of the missions, modify the zombies a little bit, etc so it's more accessible for casual players to enjoy. I know this is a lot to ask but possibly not make the ai useless, experiment with adding commands to the ai.",1692822727,1707717219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS: 

I love the snappy controls and the aim mechanics. 
The weapon variety and functionality is good, albeit some overlap. 
The sounds more than make up for that though.
Zombies, like, a lot of them.

CONS:

The bots on your team leave a lot to be desired.
The run mechanic drives me crazy.
The pathing is sometimes janky. Like, why do I get stuck on a tiny piece of curb?

Pros:
-pretty well optimized, nice looking scenery
-hordes are pretty darn fun, especially at first.


Cons:
-Customization is abysmal, character skins look the same and gun skins are reused across multiple guns
-online is dead, meaning you are stuck with God awful AI
-I hate the gun system. You are forced to start with certain guns and have to get the others each time you play a round at random. Gun tiers are equally stupid.
-story chapters become very boring very quickly. Go here, shoot a couple meaningless zombies, fight a horde, kill a couple more meaningless zombies, fight a bigger horde, then watch an awful cutscene. Now follow that same script 30 more times.
-Gun sounds range from decent, to just plain awful.


I came off days gone so maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think I can play anymore. It's just not fun

Oh, you're still here? Okay then, here we go! Any game can be nit picked down to minute details if you want, this game is no different. Do you really have to throw the switch on both generators nearly at the same time or the breaker will trip? Well if you have a couple portable gas generators hooked up to your home, this logic might be sound. But when you're talking about an industrial sized back up generator system for a hospital, or any industrial sized system for that matter, that's just not how these systems work. But it's an action game, big explosions, lots of bullets and blood and mass slaughter of zombies, who needs a bullet-proof plot? The John Wick theory is strong with this game and I love it.

I fully endorse the value in this game, too; whether you bought the base version for $30, Aftermath for a little more, or the Deluxe with the Arizona expansion for the full $60 (especially if you got anyone of those one sale). If you like zombie wave defense, slaughter types of games with just enough plot to make it interesting and slightly believable, that actually animates thousands of zombies onto your screen (and making them all hit-able targets) without lagging your computer to it's grave, this game is worth it.

I spend MONTHS looking at this game page, watching reviews, analyzing whether or not this was worth buying... And after purchasing [b]Days Gone[/b], and immediately refunding it after 3 hours because the game felt like it was made by an indie studio, I then gave [b]World War Z Aftermath[/b] a chance with the refunded money...

[b]BEST DECISION! This is BY FAR the best ""modern Left 4 Dead clone"" game out there![/b]

Just make sure you get Aftermath too, since the 1st person mode is included in there. It's not ""perfect"" 1st person, seeing that you don't really ""aim down sight""... But after a few minutes, you don't notice it anymore because you are too busy enjoying the game. :)

Zombies feel incredible, and are VERY satisfying to fight. And the Horde mechanic is SO good, and gives you a ""bad a**"" feeling while you fight them. Which is important, seeing this was the ONE doubt I had about the game, since I was afraid that the quantity of zombies in the horde mechanic, would decrease the quality of them. THIS IS NOT THE CASE.

The solo (offline) experience is decent, and I recommend giving it a go when you first buy the game, since you can enjoy the levels at your own pace. Also, if you join a public game with strangers, you mostly get pushed into a ongoing game, where they have already progressed the level quite a bit. Once you are happy with playing through the story, you can then increase the difficulty, and play with other strangers, for a more fun experience. :)

There is also a good progression system, and MANY characters to choose from, which all have a back story cinematic, that you unlock by completing a level with that character.

All in all, you will REALLY enjoy this, if you are looking for ""the new Left 4 Dead"" game. ;) Well worth the ""non-sale"" 40 euro price tag.",1705855748,1705855748,True,2,0,0.482986897230148315,0,True,False,False

Poor loadingtime every time you do a action in a party

Bots are horrible. If they didnt take or deal friendly fire, they would atleast be neutral resbots

Lurkers can do a 180. They are crouched away from you and then they still jump without a animation warning. 
They can also sometimes NOT make sounds

I have ended up on chineese servers with 200+ ping. WTF!=?!=!=!

Economy is grindy BUT atleast they dont have a pay-to-win function. BIG plus!!

Anyways World War Z the game is based off the Movie which was not well received however i did like both the book and the movie but i viewed the movie as it's own thing. However i will say that this game makes the concept of the movie and makes it work. I will explain more of that later as i separate this review in sections.

Gameplay: The gameplay for Wwz is really good, you might think of this as just another horde shooter. However that is not the case. With the various classes and abilities you can use in combination with weapons and teammates. There's a lot of variety in what you can do. Zombies (Zeke) will climb over each other to form a pyramid to get you. The game has a lot of ""defense"" moments in which you prepare a defence and hold. However this game does them right and it doesn't feel repatative because sometimes you are met with an objective or the general environment is nice to play in. The classes and weapons in this game are all well balanced, no specific class or weapon is particuarly better then the other and it all comes down to playstyle preferense. For example i love playing Gunslinger with the sporting carbine. I have it maxed out to the point that my sporting carbine a tier 2 rifle is better then most of my tier 3 weapons. The overall flow of the game is great and the zombie types are really good from the Bull/Stalker and the annoying Screamer that tends to ruin your Nightmare runs because it screams, bringing in a horde. I only really played the PVP multiplayer once and got completely steamrolled so i don't have much of an opinion. But most people play it for the PVE anyways.

Story: The overall story of Wwz is broken up into Episodes and Chapters, each taking place in different locations with different survivors trying to achive a specific goal. I really love this concept because aside from Episode 1 New York in which your on your own until the last chapter where your working with the military. You get that feeling like your fighting a war against the undead. Episode 2 has you getting an orbital laser online to use against the Zeke. Episode 3 has you poisioning the streets of Moscow to clear it out so that one day you can take back the city and with Episode 4 you're evacuating Tokyo and later play as the same crew from Tokyo in Episode 7. But they mention that one day they will return. I do like how story wise the zombies are actively hunting to wipe out humanity and that the virus's soul purpose is to pretty much wipe out humanity. It feels like a genuine war in which they are being hunted rather then the zombies are just mindlessly wondering around looking for their next victim to eat. And in chapter 6 set in Rome you fight to take back the city and you do manage to take it back. And that concept is something i am very interesting in exploring more into. Civilization reclaiming their land from the zombies is definitely something i want them to explore more on. Adding more to that feeling of fighting a war against the undead.

Horde mode: I had to give this it's dedicated spot because to me i think I've spent more time on Horde mode then any other. It's the basic consept of defending your position and holding out. But you have a gate that you must protect. If destroyed, you lose. You are given resources that you can use to buy more weapons or defense setups. The hordes will get more and more difficult as each wave comes. You have 2 locations to defend and every 5 waves you will be relocated to the next spot. Note that you can never have both locations be under attack at the same time unless you happen to go over there and trigger a mini horde from making too much noise. But the horde mode is a great way to level up weapons and find good strategies in dealing with large hordes and using defense kits. I normally do like survival modes or horde modes. And sometimes they can get repetative but overall something with WwZ's horde mode just keeps me coming back no matter what. The idea of trying to go better then last time is what really keeps me going on this mode. And when you do break your own record, it's a feel good feeling. There's also Horde XL wich is Horde but with bigger waves in different locations which is a welcomed edition but can get more difficult.

Conclusion: World War Z is a great game, taking from the Movie which took nothing from the book. And made it great, the gameplay, maps, characters, story is all good and always has me and my friends coming back to play more of. I hope to see this game thrive and keep going.

The progression is slow, any perks and upgrades cost currency, besides xp, that you have to grind trough completing the missions. To get most out of your weapons you have to grind challenges, to be able to buy perks for weapons. Completing a 3 daily challenge maps (which took much more time than necessary for a daily challenge) got me 10 points. The cheapest perk on shotgun costs more than 500. And actually useful one costs almost a thousand. Good luck grinding thoose.   
The game/map design leaves much to be desired. Like, you have to face zombie swarms at some point on a level, you have to prepare your defences, but at the same time you're already attacked by a timed swarm and bosses which sabotages your preparations. Sometimes zombies completely ignore you and your party and run in complex routes straight to the mission target you have to protect, and then you have only 30 seconds to defend it. This behavior is silly as well as the timer. Sometimes, playing with the AI you just don't have the firepower to deal with it fast enough.
Zombies who are about to attack you just sticks to your character. It doesn't matter if you run, climb or something like that, you'll get your damage.
The AI is absolutely useless and I wasn't been able to find anyone to complete a challenge map in 5 minutes, I'm not wasting more of my time on waiting.
Of course there's a ""git good"" aspect, I think you can cheese everything if you leveled up enough, but things becomes pretty boring, tedious and annoying pretty fast for me to get there.",1704705702,1704705756,False,2,0,0.453734636306762695,0,True,False,False

Players run up ahead alone and throw themselves at enemies in unbelievably irrational fashion for the sole purpose of wanting to see their name on top at the end screen.
They'll have less than 20% of health within 60 seconds of spawning, and feel entitled to 6 medkits per match. They'll have your bots killed as fast, the very ones you were keeping alive just fine before they joined. Especifically in situations when there are only 2 players. Randoms fail to realize that bots, improved with the last update, are still FAR better than most of themselves, and vastly the playerbase. If only it'd get through thick skulls.

Players are incapable of differentiating cooperative VS competitive gameplay, and which games are what. Every shooter is COD!
This also means they'll shoot moving from side to side while positioning themselves constantly IN your line of fire.
Sharpest tools.

Players don't respect classes, nor difficulty levels, nor mutators.
Low levels galore joining extreme difficulty and challenges with unsilenced weapons.
Running up ahead (like high levels do) to give a middlefinger to teammates and play individuallistically - hoarding all the best items and arsenal for themselves. And yes, every non-medic class will be taking medkits and applying it on themselves time and again rewarding themselves for sloppy, reckless gameplay. With the grade-A bling that they've sacrificed 2/3 of their health for, they still manage to be the first to fall before any who were left to deal with starter weapons.
Asthma mutator? EVERY. SINGLE. TIME people spawn in, start running and empty the health bar in seconds. You can't make this stuff up!
Read and UNDERSTAND mutators. I don't feel obliged to babysit. At all.

On pitchdark maps where a flashlight is essential, players who feel a weird sense of pixelated power necessitating to always be the one up front, will not - in the slightest - register and grasp the concept that shoving their humongous heads in front of the flashlights' beam will - and catch this, this just in - BLOCK the light and instead create a huge black shadow wherever it's pointing and reflecting.
They're too royalty to walk behind or beside, like cognitively normal people would.
Basic physics too hard. 100% pew pew pew, 0% brain. Letter grade F for you.

Resurrection with bots goes peachy, until cerebrally disadvantaged join.
With only 1 sequence left in tunnels, the recent spawn with itchy fingers pushes the wrong shiny lever for the wrong floor. I correct the sequence and pink gas cloud starts pouring. I run upstairs, dummy gets stuck in gas and incapacitaded. GOING BACK WOULD OBJECTIVELY BE AS DUMB as that would just kill BOTH.
Seeing that as soon as YOU came in YOU started taking a dump on MY game, I expect YOU do a quick considerate math in YOUR head that if YOU leave - the gates will shut, and at least one of us will survive. But randoms such as these are not considerate. They are in-game what they are in life: disgusting, self-absorbed, self-centered. They'll stay laying on the floor while you get irreversibly cornered upstairs. Randoms will not only kill themselves, but'd rather take teammates with and have the match end there instead of leaving.
Dumb, inconsiderate, classless.

You create a lobby expecting to be joined by perceptive and intelligent people, who know that the way the game is meant to be played is stealthly/silent. TOTAL SILENCE.
Especially because they spawned just in time to see you carefully disarming a mine, right? RIGHT? WRONG!
They'll immediately go ape-style full soundblaster shooting mines instead of disarming, heavy-shooting rats, alerting every special, undead enemy in the hood. WHAT?
I HAD A FLAMETHROWER SO YA DIDN'T NEED TO GO HEAVY? HOW CLEVER!
Maybe flamethrower should come in a neon pink skin DLC to be noticeable!

Preparing for incoming hordes when you've got 01:00 (that's one full minute, apes) left on  timer?
Screw that! Take my game hostage and immediately push start button for waves of hordes as soon as you spawn in without any precaution, analysis, preparation whatsoever. So considerate of you to play like someone with incontinence who has to go to the bathroom every 3 minutes - with a playstyle to show for it. And now you're lying faceflat on the floor, who'd have figured this would go wrong? Who will get you up?
Not me. I'm leaving the match I created and was doing fine for 10 minutes before you came in. Good luck and ciao! Me? I can always restart. You? Hopefully my (still dead) bots you killed earlier will get you up. Game over for you.

If they get a Tier 3 Crossbow, or heavy weapon, you're friendly fire sammich.
Characters screaming ''friendly fire!'', ''hey, watch your shot!'' are not obvious enough to get their bells ringing. They'll easily FF teammates for sake of killwh#ring special zombies.
My guess to stop randoms from friendly firing to infinity and beyond towards the enlightment of self-awareness is Operant Conditioning where everytime they FF they receive a 220v shock current.
Only then will the 2 leftover neurons communicate with each other into a ''hey, i've been friendly firing teammates with my complete inability to shoot for 3 minutes, I should stop - eureka!'' synapse.

Random no care! Random want to play like solo and do everything his way, destroy the whole game you had set up to that point soon as spawned in, and play like @ss!
If you turn down the game's volume of screaming alerted hordes and Screamers you'll be able to just faintly catch randoms saying ''But me no brainy, me sole shooty!'' just before they start drooling and becoming one of the undead themselves.

Players don't even comprehend primary objectives.
I will not even go into the unskilled, incompetent ammounts of cheaters granting themselves perks like invincibility. (Granted, much needed. At least cheaters are self-aware they suck and have no shame showing. Unlike players who keep insisting cramming themselves in difficulty levels they have no business being in.)
Come to think of it, cheaters using invincibility improve our shots at winning, oppositely and compared to if they weren't. Know what? Please, cheat - at least this way you actually contribute.

Regardless whether you're being teamed up with high or low level players - their hysteric and ADHD way of playing (it must be strenuous to constantly have to give in to your uncontrollable desire to pushy-push all buttons, doors and levers yourself, while simultaneously keep eyeballing the map everywhere all at once to hoard all items selfishly while throwing every ounce of objectivity out the window) means they'll slip up and fail to spot an item. When you spot a crate before them they'll position themselves on top of you and attempt to snatch the item under your nose, even though they already took the past items that brew from previous chests.
Politely ask them to leave. (Shoot them down when they refuse to send a message and restore your faith in humans despite ever questioning how they got this far).

I don't mind losing campaign, to me it's just fun and to blow off steam.
If I start a CHALLENGE, then OBVIOUSLY the goal is to win.
Keep your noisy, item-hoarding, invidualistic, inconsiderate, ignorant, unintelligent, incompetent, headless gamestyle for playing your own damn lobby and stop taking other people's games hostage. Create your own and stick to your own kind of like-minded buffoons.

Victory rate with randoms on demanding difficulties: 17%-25%.
Bots: 99%-100% Like a team: together, healing, and taking care of them all the way.

I extremely recommend this superbly fun game for SOLO PLAY ONLY.

And yes, under level 900 you're still a low level who'll only wreak havoc and be a detriment taking away a bot who would be doing its job being useful to me and the team. Therefore: don't join my games.

[list]
	[*]I came from playing L4D2 with the expectation of having the same or better experience.
    [*]I have only played this with four of my friends. Never once in a public lobby.
    [*]All items I bought were during sales (Winter/Fall sales, etc.).
    [*]Very seldom played Horde Mode (and not once PVP). Cannot comment on that. All my reviews are on the 8 episodes thus far.
    [*]I have never played in third-person mode.
    [*]I don't care for weapon skins nor character skins. I just used the basic generic model.
[/list]
[h2] Pros [/h2]
[list]
    [*]Easy is too easy. Extreme is too hard (for my skill), thus for me, it's balanced.
    [*]Variety of weapons. Melee has a special class expert in that, the heavy weapon has a class for that.
    [*]Not a single Pay2Win except for cosmetic skins or weapon packs (that I don't really care about).
    [*]A massive amount of zombie spawn. Killing them feels very good.
    [*]The story and voice acting are on point for each scenario.
    [*]Stunning visuals (at least compared to the now very-dated L4D2).
[/list]
[h2] Cons [/h2]
[list]
    [*]You have to grind for money a lot. Played the Missile Command mission like, I don't know, 1000 times already to grind money.
    [*]Each Prestige level resets the whole skill class, wasting your money on buying the same skill again and again.
    [*]Limited maps; the eight episodes (25 levels) will feel repetitive, especially when you've completed all at least once, then repeat the process again with higher difficulties.
    [*]Cannot start the game at a checkpoint. If halfway through a chapter, and your entire team gets KO'ed, then you need to restart from the beginning, which is kind of frustratingly boring/repetitive.
    [*]No modding to add custom maps, or weapons.
    [*]Blue coins are VERY VERY VERY hard to grind.
    [*]Playing solo, AI is kind of dumb and won't do anything except following you, won't even pick up items (like medkits/equipment).
[/list]
[h2] What I would love if they add[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Button to quickly un-alive yourself if you're pinned, so you won't waste time waiting for the respawning countdown.
    [*]Separates zombie amount and zombie difficulties. Like it would be fun (for me) if there are a massive amount of zombies but only on just Normal/Hard difficulty.
    [*]Add an option to disable friendly fire (I know this is far-fetched; even L4D2 doesn't have this).
[/list]
[h2]Bugs I have noticed - at the time of writing[/h2]
[list]
    [*]On Missile Command mission, sometimes you can spawn out-of-bounds at the beginning and die immediately.

It's a good game when you just want to jump in with some friends and shoot some zombies. WWZ feels polished and all of the classes feel satisfying to use, often because they feel cohesive and have something unique to bring to the table. The ones I've enjoyed are Medic, Dronemaster, and Vanguard. There's a lot of content to enjoy, and it's easy to get back to once in a while.

The third-person perspective by design makes the game a lot more accessible. Plenty of my friends have nausea after playing an FPS game, but WWZ gives us the opportunity to have a nice time. That said, I still highly recommend you remove any camera shakes and motion blur, and to lower your mouse sensitivity.

L4D2 world-building, sound design, and overall atmosphere is a class of its own, but WWZ is immersive on its own right. The game is not perfect by any means, but I find it to be good enough as a successor to the former title.

I wish this game had first-class support for mods, but I'll take what I can get. The DLCs are good enough for me as only one person has to own it for it to be playable for the entire group. I like knowing there's probably a new episode coming out in a year or two for me to enjoy with friends, first-timers and old dogs alike.",1703694095,1703756067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But now it seems that people liking what Saber Interactive has done with WWZ… and yeah I think they did an amazing job with the IP.

I was addicted back then when I started playing the game and until now I still play it occasionally, I got like 96 hours on my Epic account and I still enjoy it,

Well what do I think about the game??..... I'll say it’s worth it, now that I finally bought it on Steam, I can finally say that, yes WWZ is fun, enjoyable and addicting coop shooter to play, add points that there’s soooo many Zombies,

Also the game has been updated with bigger and better content, like just now (The Against All Odds Update, new Guns skins DLC and a reward to link your account on PROS and watch 4 hours of gaming live stream on twitch to earn an exclusive skins, ingame cash and points), the update is actually amazing and I love what they showed us, oh yeah did I mention that the update just came out of nowhere.

I mean c’mon.... you can give some props to Saber Interactive that they haven’t given up with the game yet, they still support it in 2023 and gave the fans what they deserve. Saber Interactive is actually a good company now that I think about it.

I have so much mad respect to Saber Interactive and the teams who's working on WWZ, I’ll be buying every new DLC that they release to support them, the game is a 10/10 Horde Zombie Coop Shooter.

I first played WWZ when it was free on Epic Games, enjoyed it, kept up with it, then switched upon its 2021 Steam release. This isn't a game I take too seriously. It's one of those that we return to when the game updates (or if we're feeling like playing horde mode).

PROS ~ Great zombie fun with good friends. Probably the true L4D2 successor. If you like L4D, you'll probably like WWZ. The massive zombie hordes are unique to WWZ and you'll have fun nuking literal waterfalls of them. I refuse to play with public lobbies and will only play with my usual gaming squad.

CONS ~ Low playerbase. The bots can be awesome sometimes, but then they will quickly make up for it by ticking you off. I'd only bother with WWZ if you have 2-3 friends to play with (I play 4-player or 3 player + 1 bot often and we rarely have issues with just the one bot). Game is a bit graphically buggy when you're in a long session. The only game-ruining bug is that sometimes one of my squad gets kicked when we're in a session together.

- The game forces login in a publisher server, which is a bad practice, even it runs offline. 
Several games did this in the past and, for some, a patch was created by the community to remove such feature;
- Have online servers implies to control all that implies in costs;
- The game does not have a ""real"" campaign mode. The maps can be loaded without any connection, storyline,
with, at least, by some drawings and texts. Even cheap productions does this. The game, in fact, never had a campaign mode;
- Low budget games, like NACON's Robocop, have a story and a really single player mode, which is good , by the way;
- The game is an online survival coop-game , with minimal features allowing plays solo ;
- The game is like left4dead ;

I want to start this review by saying that World War Z is by far my favorite game. I just absolutely love it.
World War Z is a game that lets you play scenarios of how countries handled the outbreak, with the respected teams from each country. You can play Cooperatively or Solo. Bots do fill in the empty teams slots. The Bots have been improved drastically, they can finally use equipment or have a class selected for them. There are 3 different game mode, Coop Campaign, Horde Mode and Online PVP. There is replay value as for there are 8 classes that you can choose from a level up. To spice things up if they do get boring, you can play with moderators that add little challenges to the missions you play. There are Document collectibles that you can find in those special moderator maps, that once you've found them all give you bonus for the respected mission.
Now on to the part that's not great about this game. Saber are the not the best developers when it comes to constantly updating and adding things to their game. They are a bit slow but stuff still does get added and it still gets updates, just not as often as it should to keep a huge player base. The player base is basically die hards and people who use xbox gamepass (Gross). If you are looking for a mindless shooter with reply value and still gets new content occasionally then please try this game",1637791683,1702245914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New enemy juggernaught - fcn buggy mess who can down you behind the wall or standing away from him (like 5 meters) he still down you.
What about map - very common, nothing special, that uses previous assets from other maps. The cutscenes absolute mess - the worst one.
I dont know what the devs are thinking abous, oh I know --- cash.
Final review for Z Dlc - 4 cashgrab out of 10.


Base Game is so fcn good. 
But they raised the price. (I got lucky). LOL. Now my hobo friend can't afford this game.   >:(

Ok. Now let's be serious.
I played this game on ps4 2 years ago without any DLC.
""So, why not?"" All dlc, additional content, fixed a LOT of Bugs (but fcn rats comes). And I must say - do not insult this game. It deserves to be played. 

Main kids question - is it better than B4B?
The answer is:  YES! Much better that B4B - omg if you said on the beta test b4b, that is a good game - you're dumb as bread, or never played Left4Dead. Cuz l4d even much better.

WWZ right now is Finished. Even after so much time developers listened to community and fixed problems with RATS! 
Outstanding work on optimization. No FPS drops on old 1050 GTX (My hobo friend destroyed the piggy bank for money).
A lot of gunplay, strategies and builds. Useless multiplayer but who cares - it's free.
Very fun gameplay and expirience with zombie pyramids.

Main cons:
- Degenerative community. IQ lower than 90. And console players got lower 60 IQ. I think the problem is first-person setting (game made for 3d person and they add 1rs...... why? People are masochists or smth?)
-Rats - they must be deleted. (Even after the update).
-Uncomfortable HUD and kick system. Some people need to be kicked, and you need to do a lot of steps.

So why I got not recommended a review you ask? They raised the price after 1 day!  >:D

If you are not aware, rats are a special type of enemy which cannot be killed by anything which does not create fire. A LOT of fire. Basically, they are unkillable unless you horde very specific but rare weapons.

Until this mechanic changes, *do not buy.* The devs witter on about using flame throwers (rare and little ammo) without acknowledging the rats are a stupid game breaking mistake.

I watched several people play this game on twitch and though hell with it. Now yes I have to say the game has its positive and negative about it. The fun side about it is when you just want to go around killing zombies or have had a bad day in real life you can get on here and take it out on the zombies. However the negative side of the game is the repeating maps and missions. One thing I have noticed and I really wish they would allow it is the ability to kick a person from the lobby without having to vote to kick someone. As a lobby leader I feel that if I create a lobby I should have the ability to kick who I want when I want without having to vote on who I want gone. When it comes to playing with friends it is ok but the game needs to be updated with new maps and weapons and zombies and such.

They come with preloaded classes associated with a certain primary gun and you can’t change anything.There are only four levels, which can be played through very quickly on easy or normal.

I don't know if the zombies attended a ""How to Pick Your Targets"" seminar, but it seems they've got a serious grudge against yours truly.

From the very beginning, it became painfully obvious that the undead have a beef with me specifically. I'll be strolling through the virtual apocalypse with my friends, cracking jokes and thinking I'm the cool hero of the story, when suddenly, I become the undead's designated snack. Seriously, it's like they have a group chat where they decide, ""Let's go for the guy with the charming personality and a slightly slower sprint.""

My friends? They're practically invisible to the zombies. It's like the undead have a strict diet plan, and I'm the only one on the menu. Meanwhile, my buddies are casually sipping virtual sodas and exchanging banter as if they're on a leisurely stroll through a zombie-themed park.

I've tried everything to blend in with the background – crouching, running in zigzags, even attempting to disguise myself as a zombie (I might have overestimated the effectiveness of a limp). But nope, the zombies have my number, and it's on speed dial.

The worst part is, my friends find it absolutely hilarious. They're doubling over with laughter while I'm fending off more zombies than a horde at a ""Brains All You Can Eat"" buffet. I've become the comedy relief of the apocalypse, the guy who's one zombie bite away from a virtual re-spawn.

Despite the relentless targeting, I must admit it adds a layer of unexpected humor to the game. Sure, I might be the undead's favorite chew toy, but at least I'm providing my friends with endless entertainment. If World War Z ever introduces a ""Most Likely to Become Zombie Chow"" award, I've got it in the bag.

In conclusion, World War Z is not just a game; it's a lesson in humility. If you're looking for a challenge and don't mind being the undead's version of a celebrity chef's special, then step right up. Just be prepared to accept that in the zombie apocalypse, some of us are destined to be more buffet than survivor.",1666979032,1700659689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ More enjoyable than Back 4 Blood (at least for me)
+ Better looting system than Back 4 Blood
+ Runs better than Back 4 Blood
+ Better atmosphere than Back 4 Blood
+ Characters interact with each other better than in Back 4 Blood
+ Smarter AI(s) than Back 4 Blood (they can carry the player at times)
- Although the AIs are smarter than Back 4 Blood, they are too dependent on the player. (AI(s) cannot pick up any items, cannot heal themselves, and keep moving when the player tries to heal them sometimes)
- Worse gunplay than Back 4 Blood
- You cannot jump
- Settings with a slider cannot be fine-tuned, they can only be increased or decreased by the increment of 1 (sensitivity, FOV, etc.)
- Sensitivity cannot be set low enough for low-sensitivity players

Unfortunately, it came out a few years too late to contend with that classic, along with parroting the gameplay of L4D2: Finding weapons around the map, following a linear map to another area, collect thing then use it elsewhere to progress mission, outlast hordes of infected until time runs out or they're all dead, special infected types (multiple types that pin/incapacitate you), etc.

This game had a lot of similarities to L4D2 (then again, I think any horde-shooter is bound to be compared to the God-tier classic that is L4D2), and it also has some originality: Characters have skills trees, different equipment types, you can upgrade weapons in the lobby, planting defenses before/during horde defenses segments, and some other stuff.

So just to summarize:

Pros: 
+Insanely huge hordes of infected
+Relatively newer game so graphics are fairly good
+Easy to learn
+Option to be Third Person Perspective or First Person Perspective (awesome)
+You can build defenses

Cons:
-It's basically the same as L4D2.
-Online community is either small or dead (good luck getting those pvp achievements)
-Generic special infected types
-The game has multiple mini-campaigns, however in total the game doesn't feel very long
-Levels are the same everytime

Conclusion: This game is OK. That's really all I gotta say about it. The huge sizes of hordes is breathtakingly awesome, to where everytime you see one you will hold your breath and question your capability to survive.

has tons of guns and classes to make into the perfect zombie killing machine.


PVP is basically broken with huge de-sync and tick rate but there's no real insensitive to play the PVP mode besides achievements any way.


campaigns don't exactly offer a lot of replay ability but if you just mute the dialogue they can be fun to play again and again with mindless zombie killing


unfortunately the game is kinda dead. unsure as to why. my guess is the lack of variety in campaigns or that the 1st person is DLC locked. either way don't expect to find full games with randoms. 


the classes need indicators to what skills are active or on cool down rather than weird music ques that dont tell you any thing. (example : shooting 15 zeds gives you a charge to your classes skill, you only get a audio que to say when it happen'd but no indication for the cool down ending of 60 seconds)


[strike]the DLC weapons are literally pay to win. as you can use them before max upgrading a weapon. with some DLC upgrades being better than the level 5 base weapon upgrades[/strike]

DLC weapons no longer give buffs as the weapon over haul update came out so now their pure cosmetic


the grind is not that bad unless you want the prestige or document related unlocks which will for sure take you a while along side the new weapon perks added in the over haul update. either way the grind will be worth while if you see yourself playing this alot.


bugs are very minor and [strike]ive personally never encountered a game breaking one before.[/strike] 

[strike]ive encountered a game breaking bug that at complete random times while playing it continuously stutters after a few seconds blocking all my inputs in game during the stuttering and even after bringing up a support ticket its still not fixed in almost a year.[/strike] i fixed it my self by editing some stuff in device manager.

EDIT: They've fixed the main gripe I had with the game and that was not being allowed to use any character through all the missions. 

It's a decent 3rd person shooter. I got it on sale and it was probably borderline as to whether it was worth it or not. A lot of things I was expecting were actually not a thing in this game and so it made it less worth it than if they were actually a thing. 

 Things to know:
- [strike]You can't just choose one character and play through the whole story/campaign. You get 4 characters per area, i.e. New York, Japan, Moscow, etc., to choose from and that's it. When you get to a new area you have 4 new characters to choose from. Would've preferred to unlock characters as I went and been able to use them through the whole story/campaign.[/strike] It has since been added.
- You don't find weapons because you already have all of them. You just pay to unlock them as you play. And you can only unlock higher level weapons of the same type as you level your weapon.
- No exploration/discovery for maps. There is zero reason to explore maps. No weapons to find or characters to rescue. There are some kind of documents but I have yet to find any. I think you have to be on higher difficulty but not sure and don't really care personally.
- No real reason to be stealthy and go slow because you end up having to fight hordes at least 2-3 times per map. Plus, there is always someone or something making the docile zombies rampage.

Some things I did like were:
- I did like that I can choose any class for any character 
- The skill tree seems decent enough. 
- The game is voice acted so I love that.
- Can pick up any weapon you find so not locked into using only this weapon or that weapon for your class.
- Gun play feels good though not great.",1656449968,1697548476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game offers a gripping and immersive experience that's sure to delight both fans of the series and newcomers, impressing with its intense cooperative action and strategic depth. Classes, abilities, and weapon upgrades add layers to game play, making teamwork essential, and the revamped melee system is a highlight, offering visceral satisfaction. The game also boasts stunning graphics with detailed environments and realistic character models, while its lighting effects and sound design create an atmosphere that draws players in.

While not groundbreaking, the narrative-driven campaigns provide a compelling backdrop to the action, immersing players in a globe-trotting journey to uncover the outbreak's mysteries. The game truly shines in its cooperative multiplayer mode, emphasizing teamwork and replay ability, thanks to the dynamic AI Director that keeps each play through fresh and exciting.

Offering diverse characters, satisfying combat, and stunning visuals, it's a must-play for fans and newcomers alike.

World War Z is a L4D-like game, with some additions. There are special infected like in L4D, but what is missing is a more feared special infected like the Tank in L4D. The zombies act a lot like the zombies in the movie World War Z, where they form pyramids and climb on each other to get to different places. It's insanely satisfying to just blast away into the horde with heavy weapons when they do this.

There is a progression system in this game where you get to choose to play between 8 different classes that are good at different things. You can level up your classes to strengthen yourself and your team by unlocking perks. One class might be good at killing large hordes of zombies, while another is better at building defenses, etc. You can also level up all weapons to unlock attachments, such as silencers, skins and perks for your weapons. Once you have reached the max level of a class, which is lvl 30, you can also take prestige to unlock additional perks for the class.

The zombies AI is similar to L4D. They try to flank you, surround you, attack from behind, etc. If you're playing solo, you can choose to have bots on your team or play all by yourself. The behavior of the bots is similar to L4D, which is not always the best. I highly recommend playing with other players to get the best experience. It's not very easy to find players in matchmaking, but you can join the World War Z discord server to find people to play with if you don't already have a bunch of friends to play with.

The game has 5 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane and Extreme. The game has 4 episodes, with 3-4 chapters in each episode. If you own the DLC, there are 3 more episodes, making a total of 7 episodes. There is also Horde Mode where you have to survive 50 waves of zombies while building defenses etc. Silencers are strongly recommended on harder difficulty levels. It is also very fun and exciting to go stealth.

I think the replayability is good. There are Personal, Daily and Weekly challenges that rotate. Personal challenges can be to kill a certain amount of zombies with headshots, kill special infected in certain ways, and more. In Daily and Weekly challenges you replay random chapters with random mutators making the levels harder, where the Weekly is usually harder than the Dailys. Here you can only choose between Normal and Hard though, but it can be hard enough depending on which mutators are active. Higher difficulty give greater reward and xp, whether you play daily/weekly challenges or not. In any case, there are hundreds of hours to put into this game if you want to level up to max and unlock everything.

There is also a multiplayer mode where you play against other players in different game modes, while hordes of zombies periodically appear. However, multiplayer is almost completely dead, so finding a single match in matchmaking is very difficult, almost impossible. Eventually I managed to find a couple of games and try it out (always with the same players) and it was pretty fun.

There is one thing that is a bit annoying in this game, and that is the inability to jump. You can't jump in this game, but you can climb on things, such as cars and other things. If you then want to descend from the height you are at, you cannot fire or load your weapon while falling from this height to the ground. If you start a reload before you start falling, your reload will be interrupted in mid-air and you will have to reload again when you land.

[b]Overall, World War Z is a very fun co-op game if you have others to play with, and if so, I highly recommend giving it a try! 8/10. [/b]",1696145417,1696147529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]Short Version:[/u]
I don't recommend buying this unless you have a group of friends that you know want to play it with you already. I like the setting and enjoy the game itself but it's main componant (which is multi-player/co-op) is now pretty close to non existant. It's almost as dead as it's own zombies, in other words. Many of the levels are dependant on having a team to play with. You can really only get so far with the AI meat shields :D Finding a match up, let alone a good one is a few and far between sort of event. Sometimes you'll get lucky and snag one quick. More often than not though you'll be lost at sea wondering just how far from the nearest coast you are.

[u]The not so short version:[/u]
Content wise, for this type of game, it's not really massively expansive. So far there's about 7 episodes with anything from 3-5 chapters each. You also get 8 different classes so if you want to level all of them up there's a fair amount of time you can burn on this game. The problem, really, is replayability. There's very little replay value once you've completed all of the episodes. The classes play different but like I said, it's finding a team that's the trick. co-op or multiplayer team finding can make an other wise one day task take 3-5 days because you'll be waiting to find teams so much. You can also play horde mode and horde mode xl. They're ok but similar to the call of duty survival matches, they can get boring pretty fast.

Once you've gone through all of the maps it's pretty much a rinse and repeat cycle. I expected as much when I bought it but god I didn't expect multiplayer to be this dead after only four years old (base game. Two if you count its main dlc; aftermath).

Edit: I actually found a slight work around for finding a team. Start from the episode you want and wait about 30-60 seconds. If you don't find a team, in that time frame, for your level then you can subsequently repeat the process on each episode, going backwards through the episodes. You'll find a team more often than not unless the gods of luck really hatin' on you.

Find a team somewhere using that method and if you're very lucky they'll eventually get to the episode you're after. Team retention is still a problem though and you'll be hard pressed to find a team that'll stick for more than a full episode. So finding friends you know wanna play is still your best bet. But at least some progression is viable now.

Edit: As pointed out by a commentator on my review, I have decided to add general area to my review.

I play from the general area of London, England, UK, Northern Europe. This should tell you just how bad it is. Since my region should be one of the most active regions in the entire world.

I wasn't sure if a new generation of horde shooter game can ever top that. It turns out, World War Z delivered more than expected. The quantity of zombies are 2x-3x more  than what you see in L4D. They can stack up to climb high walls or high fences, just like in the movie. The AI of each zombie is siimilar to L4D. They will try to surround you, flank you, or get behind you.

There's also a progression system which made players stay addicted to the game. You can keep on upgrading your weapons and skills. There are many classes to choose from with their own perks and play style. There are tons of weapons to choose from. Each weapon does have its own feel to it.

There are also special zombies which exist in L4D. A police zombie which will run torwards you and pin you down. A Lurker which will hide and sneak up on you then leap and pin you down. There's a yellow zombie which can spread toxic gas and blur your vision completely. And there are more of them, including those that do not exist in L4D, such as the suicidal bomber, which will come near you and explode at you to do heavy damage.

You can also build defense structures, like auto turret, which will help you shoot hordes of zombies in different directions and electric volt, which will stun zombies on top of it.

So in short, it has far more rich content than L4D, hence its more fun. The only reason why some people haven't migrated to WWZ from L4D is because they still have low spec PC from a decade ago.",1693618362,1693618362,True,10,0,0.590429961681365967,0,True,False,False

Its really nice to see what you can do with minimal HUD, as the game is very intuitive (some areas aren't as tuned as others, but that is the nature of things). WWZ will never hold your hand and if you fail a map, you usually know why you failed most time. The agency the player has is what is so loved about this game. 

If I do have any criticism about this game, personally, is for WWZ to lean more into HUDless design. I'd like to see my side arm on my hip, my medkit and breach charges on my character or in/on my backpack; feels like lost potential. Skins and weapons that are previewed on in-game character backstories aren't available in game, and I feel juked. This is a very visual game, you could enhance the visual experience that much more.

Playing solo on easy and normal difficulty so far, the game seems very good. Better than Killing Floor. The mechanics are a bit poorer than Left 4 Dead (for example, like Killing Floor there is a strength progression system for about six classes; there's even a progression system to level up your guns too) but the graphics and settings are so much more pleasant than either Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead. And it's fun to kill the big swarms, which seem like certain death, but rarely killed me (on easy difficulty). 

There are a few maps that are very frustrating for an inexperienced solo player, mostly because it's not obvious what one needs to protect - I failed on the first map of Tokyo about 8 times (again, on easy difficulty) before realising there were TWO gates I had to protect. The Kamchatka maps in the expansion are particularly bad at this: in one map, the game fails to tell you to hunt down the switches with the same labels on the bulletin board, and so I was lost there for about 15 minutes, not knowing what to do. At other times, I had difficulty protecting the Russian NPCs during swarm events because I didn't know where they were, and when I found them, I didn't know that there were TWO wire walls (on opposite sides of the building) where the zombies were breaking through. 

Another frustrating feature is the screamer zombie (which calls in more zombies until the screamer is killed). They can be very hard to locate, unless you are looking in the correct direction when they scream (one would expect an audio clue, but nope, it's visual). I think this would be a game breaking bug on higher levels, except that the screamers tend to stand and scream in the same 1-3 places with respect to one's current location, so experienced gamers have a good idea where to look as soon as the screaming starts.

All in all though, I enjoyed solo play in World War Z a bit more than early experience solo play in Left 4 Dead, and much, much more than any solo play in Killing Floor.

Looking through the global achievement numbers (Edit: whoops, I was an achievement requirement here. So instead I'll say: Kind of normal stats for a good game: 50% of players finished the first 4-map set (escape from New York), 28.4% finished all the maps (or maybe just the four map sets of the original game?), and 12% opened all skills in for one class, even the skills they were never going to use. Sadly, only 3% of purchasers marked at least 50 special zombies with the ""mark"" button.

My biggest tip is: gunslinger class is one of the best for solo play, but fixer and medic are both much better for multiplayer. I've been enjoying solo play, and maybe I'll max out my fixer before jumping into multiplayer. Apparently Discord is a good way to link up with other players. I guess I'll have to learn how to use Discord. Or maybe I'll wimp out and use the build-in matchmaker. That is rumored to have its own frustrations.

The classes and weapon progression maintain a simple and linear structure, yet the abundance of ""perks"" and ""upgrades"" allows for endless customization. The maps hold substantial replay value, each offering a unique experience. Additionally, the ongoing updates and DLCs that World War Z receives, even four years post-launch, bring a refreshing touch.

However, one aspect deserving criticism is the in-game currency system and the pace of progression. The prevalence of players at maximum Level 999 who've resorted to downloaded save states from others to unlock all content is noteworthy.

Overall, the final review stands at 9/10. It's a game that invites you to turn your brain and dive into a thrilling zombies pew-pewing experience.",1692945087,1692945087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Early Game Grievances [/h1]
The early and late game both feel dissatisfying for different reasons. The early game nothing feels special about until you start unlocking perks for whichever class you are playing which isn't an issue for long but made it harder to initially get my friends into it. As well the difficulties don't feel well balanced where anything below three skulls is absurdly easy and at four skulls and higher felt much harder with certain maps making things harder or easier as well. 
[h1] AI Grievances [/h1]
Before I can explain the issues with the late game I must explain the problems with the AI. The AI simply can't replace actual people. The bots cannot use defenses, gather anything, use higher tier weapons, or level up alongside you. For these reasons you have to play more less on your own o higher difficulties, which is what you must play in the late game. 
[h1] Late Game Grievances [/h1] 
The late game is simply too much of a grind. On the easier difficulties you don't earn enough credits to prestige classes and level up weapons without a serious grind though I learned of an easier grind for credits and XP. [spoiler] playing Marseilles on 5 skull and dying at the first horde event. [/spoiler] The issue is that it doesn't give any blue credits which are required for some of the better weapon perks. On the topic of weapon perks to even be granted the option to purchase some weapon perks you must collect documents which can only be gotten 1/3 of a piece at a time on the randomized daily challenges. As I said, a major grind. 
[h1] Enjoyable Bits [/h1]
The hordes and zombies in general are phenomenal to watch run, pile up and break through defenses. It also feels great gunning down those same hordes. Each class does feel unique and fun as you level them up. The campaign is fun to play through the first few times and has enough variety between the episodes to allow each to feel unique despite following the same general formula. I think the game can be fun alone but is much better enjoyed with friends and do recommend it. 6.5/10",1692937246,1692937246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Simple and addicting gameplay
- Classes (different gameplay per class)
- Graphics and atmosphere with so many story telling details
- Guns feel right and many to choose from
- Each map has different vibes
- Game modes: Solo/Coop Campaign | Horde Mode | PVP (dead mode)
- Many characters to choose from
- Improved bots for beginners and solo players (*THIS IS NEW UPDATE)
- Mutators
- FPS (for guns)
- Surprise big updates
- Nice community

Cons:
- Bugs 
- Sudden disconnections
- Lobby bug (when someone leaves, player is still ""there"" hence no one can replace him/her)
- Annoying specials (Quick respawning lurkers, Rats, Booster)
- FPS (melee shifts to TPS - disorienting) 
- Lack of communication from devs (we don't know if they are still updating the game or done with it)
- Surprise big updates (takes like 2 years)

*NOTE TO BUYERS:
- Buy World War Z: Aftermath or Deluxe Edition for better experience.
- Buy World War Z only if you don't mind having no access to 3 chapters (France, Rome, Kamchatka) and FPS mode

Overall:

WWZ definitely isn't online only, but for a easier and more fun playthrough, the game is actually amazing! The game perfectly captures what the movie was like. I do believe this game takes place after the movie the game is based on. I honestly prefer the movie version of the Zekes than the book version as the movie version are more terrifying to me. How they sprint without stopping, climbing on top of each other as fast as they possibly can, not even wanting to eat you, simply to infect you only. Of course for a game they can't just one hit kill you, so instead they have to beat you until you drop.
The soundtrack is pretty good, and the maps are creative, the game makes a massive first impression in the first campaign level, watching a ocean of zekes running down the street across from the building you're watching from is scary and awesome! Not to mention it foreshadows what's coming. The best part about this game is the horde moments in levels and the horde mode itself. Watching them like ants just sprinting in your direction, sent a chill down my spine the first time I saw it. I think the only complaint I actually have with the game is that there's not enough outfits for each character. I think only half or maybe less of the characters have an alternate look, and every character has a recolour of their default look with maybe a accessory added on or swapped. Really would prefer more looks for the characters and backstory videos for all the characters, only about half of them have those as well.
Other than that, I really do like World War Z.",1692163143,1692163143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a nightmare to make this work with a gamepad; in windows 11 latest drivers and everything ONLY this game has issues with xinput. It is extremely picky. It only worked after I used DS4windows.exe to FORCE xinput on top of my default xinput (nintendo switch pro) controller that works perfectly fine to play other games such as Elden Ring and even controls the operating system natively by itself. 

Steamlink: nightmare as well. Since it has the above issue it doesn't natively support xbox-official peripherals like the Gamesir x2 pro Xbox edition. Again, all other games I have work perfectly fine but NOT this one. 

In order to make it work I had to use steam's settings and force a keyboard WASD+Mouse emulation on top of the controls (which work fine on the overlay by default, but not in this game).

Finally, it Steamlink does NOT work if this game is using Vulkan graphics engine instead of DirectX 11. 

This was the only game on my entire library that had me working 2h~3h to simply make it playable on PC with a gampad and also via steamlink. Ah, it also doesn't work on GeForce now with a gamepad so it is completely unplayable on a gamepad on GeForce as far as I know.

I'm not refunding it because I will not give up the time I invested into working around all these issues and the game itself seems fine (I had already played it in the past on Xbox Cloud).

I'd like to mention that these gamepad issues seem to have been reported since 2020 in the previous versions of this game and the publisher apparently did NOTHING to address these issues. Terrible support I guess.",1691866549,1691866549,False,0,1,0.497340410947799683,0,True,False,False

World War Z is a zombie survival game, takes place in the context of zombies dominating the world and ""Aftermath"" is an expansion pack with many notable additions to the co-op shooter. It added two new levels Rome and Kamchatka. Each level continues to be divided into three different chapters like the old episodes, but still has the same task requirements as what you experienced in the original game. Much of it revolves around defending the base and escorting the NPC to the gathering point. The quest design has not improved from before, especially the Rome stage, more or less leaving me a little disappointed because of this.

Although the amount of new content is not too massive, this expansion still adds some interesting gameplay updates, making it more challenging and diverse than the original. Notably, the option allows players to switch back and forth between first and third person in the game experience. However, this feature is designed quite  ""half-heartedly"",  so it still feels a bit 'pretentious'. Specifically, the scope of most weapons becomes useless when experienced in first-person perspective. This is very evident when you let the character sit and shoot, the feeling is no different from the character when standing and shooting when compared to the experience of any FPS game. 
The game also have some miscellaneous bugs related to the behavior of the zombies. The 'force feedback' feature of the handle also does not convey the feeling of experience well. The most obvious is when performing ""bull butt"", Vanguard character class players do not feel the ironing power of the electric shield, so it is difficult to know if the attack hit the enemy or not.

In overall from my point of view: This is a good game, things i love about the game is the survival horde mode, it can up to 3 hours of playing and the weapon + player class ""ability"".  BUT compare with the game made by Valve,  [b] i'll give this 7/10 [/b].  
Personally i [u]don't recommend[/u] this game due to the game + DLC price, we can still have lots of other better games with better price",1683462304,1690653403,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,True,False

Я отец-одиночка для моего сына, которому сейчас 14 лет. Мой сын недавно начал играть в World War Z. 
Менее чем за неделю он на играл более 20 часов. 
Это было ужасно для меня, потому что мне уже было достаточно тяжело проводить время с сыном. Потому что он всегда был с друзьями или смотрел видео на YouTube. 
Поэтому я решил создать аккаунт Steam, чтобы играть с сыном. Я начал играть, но это был мой первый раз, когда я играл в видеоигру с 90-х годов, поэтому я был довольно потерян. Я попросил сына о помощи, и мы вместе провели несколько часов играя в эту игру. 
Мне это понравилось, так как это было лучшее время, которое я провёл со своим сыном с тех пор, как умерла моя жена.

Buying with friends recommended, solo buyer looking for multiplayer not ideal unless you're okay with spending some time leveling alone first before heading into multiplayer.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're going into this game solo hoping for an alive online play, I suggest reconsidering firstly. The ""veterans"" will outright leave your lobby if they see that you are low level. This is most likely due to horrible practice that shockingly many YouTuber that were World War Z focused, pushed. They all pretty much emphasized on leaving lobbies with lower level players to ""not waste time"" and personally I've experienced this despite not being completely new to this game. Essentially, if you are solo looking for an online scene, you'd need to play solo with bots first to gain some levels before ""veterans"" will want to stick around your lobby. At least this game supports full crossplay though, with Epic, Microsoft Windows Store(Game pass), Xbox and PlayStation so you will likely always find players.

As a double dipper of this game (owned this on the PS4 back in 2019) and having finally finished all the DLC Aftermath has to offer, I'm confident to say that I can still recommend this game.

I'm sure you've heard this comparison before if you've ever looked up ""Left 4 Dead 3"" but World War Z is pretty much the Left 4 Dead 3 that never was. Its a great zombie shooter that focuses on MASSIVE hordes of zombies. Its even got its own kind of special infected too but they are miles more annoying than L4D1/2's and some are less balanced than others. Great selection of guns too but a meh progression built for it. Who's silly idea was it that you cannot level up your guns if you dont unlock the next level? This wouldnt be a flaw if the game was generous or reasonable with its ingame currency but they pay you in peanuts even in the higher difficulties. Dont even let me start with the challenge coins. The amount given for both currency are pitiful.

Overall, I'd say only pick this game up with Aftermath DLC. If you can only go for the base game, I suggest waiting for a sale with the DLC or dont bother because without Aftermath DLC, you would be missing out on a lot of content.

The game is pretty much still alive too with weekly and daily challenges along with it still being updated by the developers. As a vanilla player back in 2019, the most notable changes are being able to play whatever character you want regardless of which campaign map you're on, a reworked weapon progression system whereby attachments are just cosmetics now instead of functional and a first person mode (although this is DLC locked) and many more.

With its relentless hordes of undead, dynamic gameplay, and cooperative multiplayer, this game successfully captures the chaos and thrill of surviving against overwhelming odds. If you're a fan of intense zombie shooters, World War Z is a must-play title that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

One of the standout features of World War Z is the sheer scale of zombie hordes it throws at you. From the narrow streets of New York City to the rooftops of Tokyo, the game presents relentless waves of undead that will test your shooting skills and strategic thinking. The swarming zombies create a palpable sense of tension and urgency, and the game's impressive AI ensures that no two encounters feel the same. Whether you're mowing down zombies with heavy weaponry or holding your ground against a seemingly endless horde, the intensity of the gameplay is unmatched.

The cooperative multiplayer mode in World War Z adds an exciting layer of teamwork and coordination to the experience. Team up with friends or other players online to fight back against the zombie onslaught, sharing resources, covering each other's backs, and strategizing to survive. The game offers a variety of missions and objectives, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging as you progress through different locations and face increasingly challenging scenarios.

Visually, World War Z is impressive, with detailed and atmospheric environments that capture the devastation and chaos of a zombie-infested world. From the eerie darkness of underground tunnels to the crumbling cityscapes, each level is crafted with attention to detail, creating an immersive and visually stunning experience. The audio design also deserves praise, with chilling sound effects and a haunting soundtrack that enhance the sense of danger and immersion.

The game's arsenal of weapons is diverse and satisfying to wield. From traditional firearms to heavy weapons and explosive ordnance, the selection of armaments caters to different playstyles and provides a satisfying array of options for dispatching the undead. Upgrades and customization options allow you to fine-tune your loadout to suit your preferred playstyle, adding depth and personalization to the gameplay.

While the game's focus on fast-paced action and hordes of enemies is its strength, it also means that the storytelling and character development take a backseat. The narrative is primarily a backdrop for the intense gameplay, and the characters may not leave a lasting impression. However, the game's focus on intense action and cooperative play more than compensates for this.

In conclusion, World War Z offers an intense and thrilling zombie shooting experience that will keep you hooked from start to finish. With its relentless zombie hordes, cooperative multiplayer, and impressive visuals, the game delivers a high-octane and immersive gameplay experience. If you're a fan of zombie shooters and enjoy the thrill of surviving against overwhelming odds, World War Z is a game that will keep you entertained and coming back for more chaotic zombie-slaying action.",1689124722,1689124722,True,0,0,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,False

The AI is possibly the most stupid and frustrating I have ever seen in any game tho. (fx. if you are downed the 2 closest bots will slowly walk over to you and shoot zombies. only the furthest away bot will slowly walk up and revive.)
bots seemingly can only run if you are very far away.. or teleport to you.
Bots gets very little kills.
So this then makes challenge maps incredibly hard or impossible to do solo, Which sucks since thats the only way (other than cheesing extreme campain) to get blue coins for perk upgrades.
Also special infected can do instant 90 degree turns.

Pros: Zombies, third-person shooter, simplistic yet challenging, intense horde mechanics, and excellent for those who prefer online play. 

Cons: Lackluster level progression schemes, on rails, no real customization away from pre-rendered skins, and is most certainly, ""Better with friends.""

My biggest gripe with the game is going to be that they didn't flesh out the levels, but instead created a series of extremely condensed environments where the only time spent there is extended through contrived, ""search, activate, fight the horde,"" loops. 

I spend most of my time in-game attempting to locate keys and switches in low-light environments, all the while I'm waiting for the next horde to inevitably show up and make my nearly-blind search that much more of a chore.

If you want to play a good version of this play L4D2, even as old as it is it is a much better/polished game. WWZ is, in all aspects, extremely mediocre. It's not terrible and not great, just midling. It's buggy as all get out, and has massive grind layered over the top for no good reason.


Gameplay:
WWZ gameplay is ok. It's a basic zombie shooter cloned from L4D with specials that mimic the specials in L4D and a singular unique mechanic of zombies building on top of each other to climb walls.  The weapons are ok, the maps are ok, the strategies are ok.

Placing defensive items is both interesting and frustrating as you can only place them in pre arranged spots and in many cases they face in different directions (your oprions) and you never know what direction the horde will come from so it feels a bit forced, rather than being able to place them anywhere or even reposition them.

They don't allow you turn off Friendly fire separate from the difficulty level. In my view this is a mistake made by many games FF should always be a checkbox separate from the difficulty. We want to play at the max difficulty but lag and other things like the bugs (described below) make Friendly Fire idiotic.

Bugs:
I only play MP with 3 other freinds for a team of 4. None of us can walk up stairs in this game, or over train tracks or over anything else on the ground. You stop as if you hit an invisible wall. Running, or couching and uncrouching your way up the stairs can usually get you up but it happens routinely and I can't fathom why it would not have been fixed by now.

Other players also routinely turn invisible. In our playthroughs basically at all times, at least one player can not see one other player. Someone is always invisible to someone until them pick up something (medkit) or interact with something and then they pop back, but interacting can also turn your invisible, so it's a rotation of who can't see who, and sometimes you can't see multiple players. Fairly gamebreaking in a zombie shooter with Friendly Fire that can't be turned off.

Grind:
This is perhaps the worst part of the game and pushes this review into negative territory. The game introduces XP and leveling of your character and weapons. As you play you gain XP to level your character and XP to level each gun you use (you pick up random guns during the game and don't generally start with the one you may want to use). There are three tiers of weapons. 

Each time you level a weapon (or your character) you have to pay money to buy the level, even though you just got enough XP to get it. If you don't buy the level of the gun... you STOP gaining further XP until you do buy it. You can not earn enough money to raise 3 guns (one in each weapon tier) and your character. Therefore you are wasting XP, also you can't delay deciding what gun you want to spend money on since you will not be gaining XP for it.

To get money you have to play ridiculous challenge maps and modes that are simply not fun and grind out the money you need, but you will also gain levels doing this. There is no way to smoothly play through the campaign and raise even one on gun at each tier never mind trying some of the others. 

Not worth it at all. Play L4D2 again, or Dying Light, or any other decent zombie game out there.",1687449952,1687449952,False,5,0,0.516843557357788086,0,True,False,False

The horde fights, or even just the smaller hordes drawn by screamers, end up being life or death battles.  In L4D you can mostly gather in a corner and shove and shoot through a horde until the tank comes.  In WWZ you need to keep your feet moving, but still keep your team in site and protected, or you’ll be quickly overwhelmed.  The stealth possibilities, headshotting a hallway of zombies with silenced weapons, is fun too but rare in matched games where someone is always shotgun happy.

Anyway, game is totally entertaining and I’m sad to see the low review scores.  It is a lot like Left4Dead 3 might have been, minus the first person view.  No shoving though, just slicing and chopping which is admittedly more fun.",1680532353,1687108057,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

This game is like a whirlwind of chaos and laughter, with a side of mindless zombies for good measure. I haven't had this much fun since my grandma mistook the TV remote for a cookie and tried to take a bite out of it. But hey, let's not forget to address the elephant in the room - the discord community.

Now, World War Z itself is a thrilling ride. You team up with friends, unleash an arsenal of weapons, and mow down hordes of undead like you're playing a high-stakes game of lawn darts. The action is fast-paced, the levels are diverse, and the zombies...oh boy, these zany zombies will have you in stitches!

But when it comes to the discord community, let's just say it's like entering a zombie-infested party where everyone's trying to outdo each other in the toxic dance-off. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some genuinely great people there who are more than happy to lend a helping hand or share a hilarious meme. However, there's a small but vocal minority who seem to have a case of the undead grumpies.

You'll encounter a few individuals who take themselves way too seriously, spewing negativity faster than a zombie losing his dentures. It's like they've forgotten that this is a game, not a battle for world domination. But fear not, my fellow survivors, for every toxic troll, there are ten times more friendly faces who will gladly take you under their wing and show you the ropes.

In fact, I've found that the best way to deal with the discord negativity is to fight back with laughter. Share your funny in-game moments, crack jokes, and remind everyone that we're all here to have a good time. Trust me, when you make a fellow player snort coffee through their nose with your witty banter, it's a true victory against the discord undead!

So, while the toxic zombies may be lurking in the discord community, don't let them dampen your spirits. World War Z is a riotously fun game that will have you laughing and screaming in equal measure. Grab a group of friends, form your own zombie-killing squad, and let the good times roll. After all, laughter is the best antidote to any toxic outbreak!",1687031653,1687031653,True,6,1,0.585684537887573242,0,True,False,False

+has lots of classes so that u can change playstyle
+the feeling of KİLLİNG TONS OF ZOMBIES
+third person view is pretty good
+has 6 special zombies 
+visuals are pretty impressive
+voice acting realistic
+u play on locations around the world
+character skins and bag customizations are cute

-classes take soo much time to unlock 
-first person view is dogshit u even lose some sight
-different melee weapons has different effects but most them are useless ur just gonna stick to best one
-players can kill other players to troll and u cant ban them
-bad servers high ping
-dead game no one plays u cant find more then 1 lobby 
-high difficulty u cant miss headshots ur aim has to be godlike
-u used to be able to customize weapon any way u want . They changed that now u cant customize u have to choose already customized ones game offers
-melee class is useless no one uses 
-nothing much to master except shooting heads and learning some special zombie types
-weapons has levels . U need to play specific weapon A LOT to unlock that weapons perk . which becomes pretty boring since if u want to unlock that weapons perk u cant play another weapon 
-blue coin which u use for unlocking weapon perks or skins are soo hard to farm . Even in hardest difficutly u get 10 per mission 1 weapon perk costs 500 (each game takes around 20-30 minute) 
-no matchmaking system u can be 200 hours and get into game with 10 hours which gets frustrating since they cant play properly
-cannot kick while in lobby so if 2 players doesnt click ready and stay afk u wont be able to play

i personally dont like to shit on games where i played 100s of hours but this game deserves it only reason i played it that much is cuz i wanted to experience all classes to fully but even now i couldnt unlock ALL skills in class. i finished every class""s basic set . and theres also vip in order to unlock that u need to pay bunch of in-game yellow coin which u get by completing missions.

All difficulty levels and maps can be played with two human players (or more) while adding bots as friends (in total four slots in the team). Those bots are of cause not as sufficient as human players, but they do their job as bait and by rescuing us.
The maps are very diverse and behave different regards spawn points for lots each time you play them.
There is a high replayability since we are highly motivated in gaining better weapons and classes for taking the challenge on a higher difficulty level, which has been lots of fun so far.
I have pretty average hardware since I am not spending crazy A$1K for a new graphic card, also my CPU is very average. The game still performs fine, even while I am using higher settings than recommended. Which is quite astonishing having in mind that hundred or more Zombie bots attack in waves at once.
A minor mishap is the game not closing on my W11 PC, so the task manager is your friend.
And I wish that the developer would provide $10 DLCs with about five maps being added into the campaign's flow coz such would increase the replayability even more.

However the amount of times you run into this is trivial compared to how bad they actually are. Most similar games I have played, Left for dead 2, Vermontide 1 and 2 The A.I. levels up based on either weapons found throughout the game, or by perks that you have chosen for those characters or classes you've played as. WWZ does not have this, they remain level one gunslingers and do not switch out starting level weapons for any upgraded ones found. They also will not pick up any equipment, health items or defense kits where as in the previous stated games they will switch out both weapons and grab any gear you do not until they all have their equipment/health item and defense/bomb/ect slot filled. Over all a pretty good game but play with friends not alone. 4/5

It's far too grindy, the bots are completely worthless, some classes just aren't worth playing, and the matchmaking is terrible. People constantly go AFK and take up a slot so no one else can join, leaving you (at best) in a 3 man team fighting a horde sized for 4. People also like to friendly fire a lot. Having to play on Hard challenge mode to get challenge coins makes this extremely frustrating, as a lot of the ""challenges"" make the level essentially unbeatable unless you're playing with 4 high leveled people that are very good at the game.

I've gotten fairly far in terms of meta progression, but the barrier to entry on a single match makes me just not care anymore. The length of wait time to get into a match is bad enough, but having to rely on luck to get good teammates just obliterates any chance of me wanting to play anymore. As there's no way to create/search individual lobbies, or stop yourself from matching with a person you know is intentionally friendly firing your whole team, you're subjected to the whims of whatever algorithm this game's search function is running.

One positive thing about the game: The horde mode is pretty cool, and there's not usually wait time for it. Unfortunately, I'm not sure you get any points if you leave early. It's a good way to power level upgrades and regular currency, but most of the more desirable upgrades for guns require blue challenge coins, which you'll have to play the regular challenge modes for.

If the lobby system were fixed so people could actually host a lobby, kick/ban people from joining their lobbies, and search for a list of lobbies, the game would actually be playable.

It does have one thing, that I HATE!
And that is documents. To get documents you need to play on challenge mode. Which is hard enough to find a team for. And from what I understand don't always spawn in on the map. with 3 per map and challenge maps being one of 3 per scenario every week.

Whats inside the game?

PvP (2v2 to 4v4)(side game, casual) 
active at noon (2023) quickplay option to find active lobbies, pvp is looking for games option with 0 matchmaker features, 15 min matches at max, different objectives to win (deathmatch, king of the hill, etc), 10 classes to level up to 13, with weapon and equipment from the PvE mode

PvE (4 players or with bots)(main game)
campaign is is the basic mode where you can load any map at any difficulty to learn the map or play the highest difficulty (5) possible
then you have the challenge mode, where you complete daily and weekly tasks for extra currency, (the difficulty is 3 or 4 out of 5) the twist is that challenge maps have mods that add up to 3 extra rules making it a bit harder 99% of the times unless you pick a class that counters or ignore the mods
difficulty 4 isnt that challenging once you know how to play

DOCUMENTS
documents are just one extra collectible to pick up when running challenge mode maps, every 3 successful runs you complete 1 document, once you have 3 documents (9 runs) you completed the docs for that map, documents give you a very small buff at best, most of them are not even 100% chance of procing, they unlock, 1 melee weapon, 1 challenge perk and 1 skin

HORDE AND HORDE XL (endless wave, reminds me a bit of the tower defense genre)
you build defenses, upgrade weapons, complete side quests to earn more resources to keep your defenses and ammo up

CHARACTERS
split in 8 different classes, each one starts with a set tier 1 main weapon, a pistol as secondary, some with a heavy weapon as third an unique equipment, some classes can start with a tier 2 main weapon, some with a tier 2 weapon secondary (1 even with a tier 3), some can add or change the heavy

the customization is possible with thanks to a level system for characters AND weapons too

characters have 30 levels total and you can activate 9 out of 27 perks, perks 0, 10, 20 and 30 are static, you cant swap them
once you reach 30 for the first time a prestige system is unlocked to grind even more levels for that class, allowing you to reset the progress to level 0 to farm more static perks, up to 4 times for now, 1 every 30 levels (in raw numbers level 31, 61, 91 and 121 to get all the prestige perks) every perk unlock cost coins, every prestige reset cost even more coins and you have to buy the basic perks again

WEAPONS
then you have the final and most grindy one, the weapon farm, for the first 4-5 levels weapons do less damage and aggro enemies, weapons get xp per zombie kill + bonus if headshot, it cost coins for each lvl
you can also customize the weapons with up to 3 perks, you have 1 slot restricted to CHALLENGE coins perks which are harder to farm and in fact is the last thing that you will complete along with cosmetics because challenge coins are that scarce, some of the restricted slot are only unlocked with lvl 2 prestige, the other 2 slots can be purchased with normal coins once you reach the required level or finished a specific difficulty 5 map

weapons are split in 3 tiers (some t3 arent even that good) then you have heavy weapons (from a chainsaw to rocket launcher, lost when you run out of ammo) and melee weapons (from quick light to mid to slow heavy, with rechargeable stamina)

SPECIAL ZOMBIES
the game also has special zombies
the hard to kill
the one that spawns more
the one that puts an aoe poison cloud when taking damage/dead unless you kill them with headshots only
the one that jumps from behind and stuns you until you are dead or a teammate saves you
the one that runs at you with a small wave of normal zombies that also can stun you until you are dead or a teammate saves you
the one that just wants to give you a hug before exploding
the one that spits at you a debuff that kills you after a few seconds if dont have 3 seconds to clear it (basically 3 secs self stunned) everyone with a sound cue to make it fair

theres not much else to say in a basic review, so if u can handle its buggy code this game might be for you, worth about 500+ hours to get everything at max level without perks and cosmetics",1682922388,1682989502,False,2,1,0.525008976459503174,0,True,False,False

But with the 1 1/2 minute wait times in between the horde modes total length of being almost like 1h+ for full completion the pacing is  slow as hell. But still cool to kill Zs by blowing their limbs and bodies off. The missions are cool but again if you are soloing this with matchmaker you sometimes can have actual monkeys who are on playstation hitting the bong while blasting generic rap while screaming at their pregnant girlfriends while also trying to cordinate a 5 level difficulty mission. Also some missions are actually impossible to solo I believe, with the LFD2 vibe of a zombie grabbing you and killing you only works with people but if you are solo I cant see you completing the levels so what is the point of even private play? The bots are also useless aimbot scripts that are very un fleshed out so they will just sit there in a line of 3 while either following you or just sitting there at the pre scripted shoot zone. The skins and gun skins are cool but I do think more should be here even for what the devs have made more needs to be added for more reasons to play. 

Also for horde mode just a lil tip, if you are using a non explosive class and solo dont try to hold forward you have to make setups and defenses in the back, again I dont think its possible to solo with some classes even with bots too...

Ill keep playing this game though but this game is not very PC friendly and the players dont really take this shit seriously and will sometimes do random autistic shit since the game is literally holding back while blasting Zs that cant really kill you so the skill curb will be hit 2 hours in tbh.",1650680469,1682664227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More than happy to buy the deluxe edition and the rest of the content again available on Steam now!

My opinion on the game:

The Good:
It looks and feels a lot like an improved third person version of Left 4 Dead franchise but it's definitely a much better game over L4D with better graphics, horde mechanics, classes, perks, environment, turret placing, barbwire, electroshock, barricades, freezing system, attatchments, various pvp and co-op modes, it has both Third Person and First Person, the list goes on.

The Bad:
PVP mode is fun but dead due to cheaters. Not needed anyway, the game shines for the Co-op PVE part and L4D nostalgia which is the most important thing imo.

- Decent weapons and nice design
- nice zombie behavior
- Very nice character design

WHY BAD REVIEW?:
- Campaign way too short!
- Class are a joke... could be so much better
- Upgraded L4D Copy... it could have been a bit less obvious and more creative, this kind of action should be seen in survival games in the like of 7 Days to Die.
- Way too expensive for what is worth really! 22$ in sales is too expensive! doesn't worth more than 15$
- You cannot start with whatever weapon you want! sometime i have to play a whole game to get the weapon at the end what a terrible thing!...

Too much. Waay too much! The grind needs to be toned down.

Also, the zombiewaves are soo buggy now! Sometimes the zombies are invisible, sometimes they teleport. It's excruciatingly boring to lose a highlevel game of Hordemode to invisible zombies. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!

A lot of characters,maps, weapons, AND HORDES OF ZOMBIES! Characters are well written, but unlike with Left 4 dead 2 you just play with them like 3 missions then it switches to another 4 survivors... So i dont even feel sad if they die in the gameplay... Our story begins in New York - we can play as a Gangster (Named angel - Male), a Firefighter (named Tashaun - male), a Hacker (named Bunko - female) and someone called Arnetta - female. They are trying to get out of the city - they all manage that by finding the army that is evacuating civilians. Next is Jerusalem. This time the 4 survivors are from the Army and bloody hell by far my favourie survivors. that being Judd - male, Dina - female, Ethan - male (my favourite survivor, because he wears a juggernaut suit) and Daniel - male. Their quest is to find a doctor, who can activate a fokin Nuclear bomb. Its not explained how he got to Jerusalem or how he can activate it...WUT?! However they manage it and an army of zombies is done for. Then it cuts to Moscow (obvously it is Russia). We play as Oksana - female, Ivan - male, Timur - male and doesnt sound like a russian... Last is Sergei who is a preacher. But this is where the game kinna gets stupid - first we rescue a chopper that has food suplies, i though in the second mission we deliver the suplies, but nope! we go to a goddamn shop to brodcast a message... after that we go release a super weapon created by the soviets... Neuron gas that kills zombies... And one thing - none of the characters say Blyat... (that is a joke, dont take it seriously). Then another 4 survivors and another campaign. This time Tokyo in Japan. We play as Sho- male, Kimiko - female and a verry good sniper, Tatsuo - male and looks like a ex soldier, Hiroji - male and has wakizashi. These guys are helping to evacuate civis from Tokyo onto a big ship. They manage to do that, but what made me confused that some zombies managed to get on board... Not even explained... However it isnt the end... Apperantly they had a deal with russians in Kamchatka. FOR SOME WEIRD REASON THOSE RUSSIANS OPPENED FIRE ON THEM AND AFTER THAT THEY SAY WE HAD NO DEAL, BECAUSE THEY LOST COMMUNICATION! SO DID THE JAPANESE LIED ABOUT THE DEAL OR THE RUSSIANS ARE LYING JUST TO SAVE THEIR ASSES?! This part is horribly explained and i hate it.... Next is Marseille in France - we play as Eloise - female and sometimes sounds like a biatch, Raoul - male, Marine - female with tomboy hair and is a soldier, Karim. They are trying to turn on the rocket system, so they can fight against the zombies, after that they defend a fort. Next campaign is in Rome (obviously in Italy). These guys are trying to set up A MASSIVE sound trap to kill zombies in Rome and damn that is pretty nice campaign. We can play as Daniela - female and a motorbike champion with a bat, Giovanni - male and a good hunter and fisherman and leads the team, Sofia - female who has phd - engineer, then Marco - male who lost his wife 20 months after the break and what keeps him alive is the love for his team. That is all. Ofcourse the characters have info about them in the menu, but exept Marseille and Rome characters everyone has a video about them... Makes me sad. Now lets talk about the zombies. Even on normal they can kick your ass. I mean litteraly. I got ganged  by 4 zombies and within 20 seconds i got downed. But ofcourse the game aslo has special zombies - Lurker - practicly Hunter wanna be who doesnt scream, but quietly wheezes and he usually wait behind a corner to jump on ya and beat ya up, Next is bull - charger wanna be, but this one turns when he charges, he has no defence on his back so shoot him there. Next is infector - this one spits infection on ya and if ya dont disinfect within like 10 seconds you will turn into a zombie instantly, to kill him easily you must shoot him to head then finish him off with a melee strike. Next is a screamer - he screams, more zombies appear, simple. Booster - makes zombies run faster. Gasbag - zombie with a hazard suit that if he dies makes a cloud of poison. Bomber - he gets to ya = explodes, but if ya manage to shoot him to his legs, then finish him off with a melee strike, you will get a bonus that if ya carrie to the end = you get bonus points depending on the difficulty and also a weapon. Speaking of weapons you can carry 3 weapons and your tool depending on class (about them later). Many weapons are in the game and you can upgraid them when you win missions you can upgraid them, what i do love that the silencers accualy dont atract zombies and if ya shoot with the loud weapon, more zombies spawn and makes screamer appear more. You have primary, secondary, heavy weapons and melee weapons that can be knifes, swords, axes - take your picks. Also weapons have skins... most of them are normal, but some of them look like shit. heavy weapons cant be upgraided, because they are strongest weapons in the game and they are the weapons that you NEED for the hordes or you are good as dead. When defending against a horde you also get defences - that being barbed wire, electicity, fance, mortar, auto turret and 50 mm cannon. Hordes are repetetive as hell, but hey i do like killing zombies. Now those classes. You can upgraid them as well and there is quite many of them. that being Gunslinger - expert on guns and has a granade, Medic - starts with a medikit and has a gun that gives temporary health, Fixer - increases ammo and has a supply bag, Hellraiser - expert with explosives and can have c4 or claymores, Dronemaster - obviously has a drone, Slasher - expert with melee and has a stun gun, Exterminator - focuses on dealing with hordes and has a molotov, Vanguard - has a shield and can charge with it. Also there are Multiplayer classes , but multiplayer is dead in the water. Also like in l4d2 we have a horde mode aka survival. Next we have challanges - campaign maps that have some mutators. Difficulty - Easy, normal, hard - play only on these,because the rest is unfair to play. that is all. 6/10 because the story is sometimes stupid or doesnt make sence, difficulty above hard is unfair and bot are stupid too. However besides all of that I enjoyed this game a lot.",1680971689,1680971689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DO NOT play this game if you are a solo gamer. the bots in your team are utter morons. 
You can't edit their gear or level them up. 
They can't even bloody heal themselves. The only thing they know is which end of a gun is which thank goodness.

their is minimal bugs in the game luckily. nothing game breaking that I've noticed, but the small ones do get to you later on in a fast paced game like this.

The point is if you are a solo gamer then this game isn't for you. play left for dead which has actual decent bots or killing floor where you can solo a game if you got a hankering for zombie slaying. Just not this game.

Story is pretty linear and it has public matchmaking for grouping up. Oh and it has Quickplay. Also has classes and perks system to make a ""build"" though once you pick best in slot perks for that class there really isn't a need to change it. Not sure how end game is though.

WWZ is just a good Zombie killing game. The game doesn't do anything special that will blow your mind in gameplay that you haven't seen before and im ok with that.

It has weapon upgrades and customization. You can level up your weapon and put skin and perks on it.

+ There is a character classes, such as Medic class that excel in healing, Gunslinger that excel at reloading and weapon damage, Hellraiser that specialized in explosives, or a Slasher that excel in melee weapons, etc. You can select perks and play as you wish.

+ The number of zombies is really large, which is both challenging and satisfying.

+ Various random daily challenges

CONS:
- It has a random matchmaking system, and sometimes it will take so long to find players to play with us. And honestly, it's better to have a lobby system with a room list where you can search, create, lock, and join the rooms.

- This game's save data is saved locally, so people can have 100% game progression by changing their save data. This broke down the entire progression system.

- There is no vote-kick system, so you're doomed if you meet a troll player.


CONCLUSION:
Overall, World War Z Aftermath is still an enjoyable game worth playing.

This review is neither positive, nor negative. I will try to be as objective about this as possible.

[h1] Story telling [/h1]

It has some story, but there's minimal emphasis on it. Do not buy the game if you're expecting a good story.

[h1] NPC's [/h1]

[b] Friendly NPC's [/b] are only capable to protect you from small numbers of zombies. They can't use or carry utilities such as: crowd-control (heavy) weapons, class-specific items (grenades, drones, molotovs, etc.), medkits. They can't interact with buttons or set a breach-charge to open a door. There is no way to give them orders.
Friendly NPC's, just like in many games, are designed to be weak. Please, ask friends or find people to play with for better experience.

[b] Enemy NPC's [/b], aka zombies, consist mainly of regular zombies + some special zombies. I will not discuss their specifics, there is youtube and google for it.
Zombies show little threat on their own, but can easily overwhelm with big numbers. Crowd-control is key. Find counter-actions against special zombies to defeat them efficiently.

[h1] Gunplay [/h1]

Gunplay is okay, nothing exciting nor bad about it. But there is something to know: As of 30.03.2023 (dd/mm/yy), there is a bug related to guns. In first-person, if you interact with items (picking-up explosive ammo on the ground), your gun might glitch and it will not shoot. You will have to ADS (which doesn't exist lol, it's just a minizoom)  to make it shoot. Or spam the hell out of it until it works. Better use third-person until the bug is addressed.

Gun and class progression systems are okay, although I find them to be boring, I will explain why in [i] Gameplay [/i]

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

During your first playthrough, I suggest playing it solo with bots or with friends. Do not go CO-OP.
Then it's only recommended to continue with friends. People in CO-OP do not communicate at all. Hence, minimal teamplay. Also, it's always better to play with friends for sh*ts and giggles :-)
Consider CO-OP only if other options are not available.

Oh, this game has ""Multiplayer""? Yeah, about that... It's basically Human vs Human match. It's bad and no one really plays it. And neither should you.

[h1] Updates [/h1]

So far, they haven't forgotten about the game. They recently added a new mode (Horde XL) and a new weapons-progression system. Although I can't say that updates are frequent.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]

I suggest buying this game only if you have friends who will play it with you. Otherwise, keep scrolling.

Majority of features are not well-designed, only extending gameplay through repetitive RNG and encouragement of grinding through a prestige system. 

Update (Apr 2022, Cut and Mend Patch): After more than 500 hours of gameplay, this game has so much potential to be better, but it seems that the developers have shelved this to work on other projects, with the last update in April 2022.

Some perks are worthless (or near worthless) due to poor game design - There's a perk that allows you to recover when pinned by infected. Unfortunately, the recovery animation does not include invulnerability, and you will take damage as your character stands up while infected crowd around you. On higher difficulties, this can cost your entire health bar, and you get downed anyway.

Minor bugs and glitches such as infected swarms dealing damage to you even when you are out of the visual zone, or game-breaking bugs such as special infected clipping you through environment into an area where other players are unable to revive you from.

As a player who enjoys solo play, the AI bots are frustrating to work with, as they either get in your way of your line of fire at the worst possible time, or they are blind to the obvious dangers that downed you in the first place. Examples I can think of are:

1. AI tries to rescue downed teammate, walking through a swarm instead of taking a safer route, getting downed, and the next bot repeats the same failed strategy till all bots are down. 
2. AI walks instead of runs to revive teammates, which is painful to watch especially if the downed player(s) are a distance away. Usually that player dies before the bot reaches them, even in situations where there is minimal infected threat.
3. AI tries to revive you after you have been downed by a lurker around the corner. Instead of taking out the lurker, the bot will make a beeline for you, blind to the lurker just squatting there, and gets downed. Repeat till all bots are down.
4. AI stands at fixed locations during swarm attacks, especially in the line of FIXED machine gun placements.
5. AI does not prioritize special infected targets such as bombers and focuses on normal infected around them. This leads to the bomber dealing massive damage to all of them, as the bots tend to stick close to each other.

AI can and should have been designed better. They seemed to have been designed poorly on purpose, which is even more puzzling. Bots are perpetually stuck at level 1, cannot upgrade or modify their weapons, or pick up, or use items. Even bots in l4d2, a game that came out in 2009, could pick up health packs and try to heal you. Players should be able to give bots simple commands, such as stand and guard a specific location, or pick up/use/give items. Instead, bots crowd as a group, and follow very obvious preplanned paths, which makes for a robotic and lifeless feel. Bots can be helpful on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties they are obviously a handicap.

Once you've played enough, players should have an understanding of ""the meta"" - how to exploit certain safe zones or manipulate the infected system to clear higher difficulties. Personally, it does not feel as rewarding as if I had cleared it ""the proper way"", as it feels less organic and more of taking advantages of loopholes in the game.

I want to love this game as the unique swarm mechanics, graphics, and weapon mods/customization options are a step up compared to l4d2. It seems like the developers were on their way to create such a good game, but then they decided to just stop and not take the last step to polish it slightly. It feels like such a wasted opportunity. 

7/10.

Update (Jan 2023, XL Horde Mode): The developers have given bots a way to pick up ONLY health packs (excluding bandage kits and adrenaline), and use it on themselves or pass it to players when pinged. This is an improvement, but it remains janky as the bots do not respond quickly to it and require multiple pings to pick up nearby health packs. As of this change, bots are now health pack mules at best, which is a small improvement.

The XL Horde Mode update is a lot of fun if you enjoy just blowing up massive waves of zombies. In addition, they revamped the weapon skill system to include perks and other changes. These are nice changes, but it isn't very user friendly, as when your weapon levels up, excess experience points are wasted until you unlock the next level (which uses in-game credits). 

6/2/23: A quick fix was issued to fix the silenced weapons breaking stealth, and all weapons have been returned to having a silenced variant. As it stands, the current underlying negativity could have been avoided with some basic user testing. While the developers fixed it within a week, it seemed only due to the strong backlash from the players. The optics that they present to its player base displays a lack of care and respect, which in turn is reciprocated by its players.

+The feeling of hitting is satisfying, it's quite good, but when you kill zombies, you can really feel that you're killing.
+The variety of weapons and weapon cosmetics is fine (A few of the melee weapons have cosmetics)
+You have the opportunity to go undercover up to a certain point, so you can go undercover until you come to the buddha + (Horde.)

-The constant arrival of the horde can sometimes cause problems for our low-level friends, it's a little difficult to do solo, for that matter. Especially if you are playing on hard and higher difficulty.

Grinding for weapon upgrades is a slog because the devs introduced new mechanics to slow your progression down. Upgrading a weapon's level costs up to 4 or 5 missions on the highest difficulty worth of coins. Higher tier weapon perks like damage upgrades or +magazine size may require up to 3 complete documents, which can only be found while playing challenges. Most weapon perks are useless or too situational eg missing health to be useful. Weapon perk tree needs a complete overhaul. Plenty of people play on modded save files, so although they are max level, they still play terribly. 

TLDR Dev's don't know how to address player attrition so they put up lots of barriers to player progression and try to get you addicted to daily quests to promote longevity.

The AI sometimes doesn't react to special zombies now.  I got grabbed by a Bull and the three schmuck AI player just stood still and watched me get killed before dieing themselves.  Wonderful.

TLDR: If you don't mind grinding for content, knock yourself out.  It just isn't fun after about 75 hours..

This game is a ""no"" for me, dog.  I want to like this game.  I really do.  It is a fun game and with a few tweaks, it could be a classic.  The problem is in the core mechanics.  The special Infected semi-mirror Left 4 Dead and they require ""teamwork"" which wouldn't be a problem except the friendly AI are as useless as porn to a eununch.  They can fire their gun.  Not accurately either (try the Crossbow Fiesta mutator and see how bad they really are).  And that's pretty much all they can do as of the time of this review.  Need to be saved from a Lurker (L4D Hunter)?  Nah, they might get there but it will be 30 seconds too late if they do.  Grabbed by a Bull (L4D Charger)?  Forget it, you're gonna be pounded into ground monkey meat.  Get Infected and need cover while you heal/recover?  Nope, and not only nope but the 3 bots will die in seconds of you going down.  So if you're more of a solo gamer or can't convince 3 friends to buy this or can't kidnap 3 other people and force them to play, you're up crap creak without even so much as shoes.  I'm not saying I want bots to carry players, I'm saying I want them to have basic skills like ""protect the only player who matters"" and ""defend the NPC who's death means game over"" or ""carry this medkit for me.""  Basic stuff like that.

Next point, The Grind: The ""best"" versions of the weapons in this game are locked behind a grind that makes World of Warcraft is jealous and without 4 at least competent players, you're in for twice the grind because the only way to earn challenge coins is to grind and with the AI having a spoon lodged in their frontal lobes, you need to use mutators to make winning possible.  After you play the campaign, it's just not fun to keep playing the same levels over and over to earn 1000 challenge coins (you can get 5 at a time with mutators).  

Bottom line is: friendly AI is brain dead so bring friends and there isn't enough content to merit the amount of grinding it takes to unlock everything so don't be a completionist.",1636714326,1677307001,False,3,1,0.488481879234313965,0,True,False,False

The cosmetic skins of the weapons, that's fine, I don't have much issue with it as the stats and perks of your choice are added to the weapon. What really bothered me was how grindy the whole process was going to be in leveling each weapon, because obviously enough, you can play favorites, but how often does your favorite gun come out? You now have to grind out 15 levels or so for the weapons, which is very tedious and time consuming.

The perks are hit or miss, some are really good, and some just plain suck. But the kicker here is that they tied a portion of the perks to the silly document hunting system they introduced some time in 2022 or earlier. Imagine having to play the same level 9 times, along with mutators that might or might not be in your favor. I did this for the ""Advanced Combat Weapon"" before the update, and while we did achieve a stage with all 9 documents, the achievement was short-lived, because the devs locked the most important part of the perk weapon to collecting every document for an entire episode. Sorry, but not all of us want to search every nook and cranny in a level to find 1 document, and repeat the entire thing again hoping that you'll complete the stage without incident.

Looking at the horde XL update, it isn't that big an achievement in all honesty. First off, it's mandatory to own the aftermath DLC to access horde XL - but before the update, you could actually invite friends that only had the base game, from different platforms to join you in the aftermath DLC stages. That was really good, but it does not apply to horde XL. Speaking of these changes, they have yet to address the framerate issues, the lag and freezing on devices that aren't next gen, like the PS5 and what have you. This actually occurs when you're just playing the normal story stages, which totally ruins the gameplay for all of us, especially where the game continues to run and your character just dies by the time the lag or the framerate goes back to normal.

The devs could have added more stages (seriously it's called WORLD War Z for a reason) yet we're stuck with New York, Jerusalem, Moscow, Tokyo, Marseille, Rome, and Kamchatka. I'll throw in South Korea because they made it clear that the normal horde mode takes place there. But no other countries have been added yet? After the game has been out this long?

And they still haven't added the 3rd row skills for our classes. It's rather obvious that with the space left for it, there should have been a 3rd row of new skills, but the devs have not sorted that out yet.

So would I recommend this game to anyone else? No, I'd wait until the devs have sorted out the performance issues of the game at the very least.",1677159491,1677159605,False,4,0,0.512222468852996826,0,True,False,False

I'm as surprised as the rest of you.

They more or less fixed ALL of the issues that I had with the game, save for a few new ones cropping up that really aren't as bad.

It would be nice if FPS mode was more fleshed out, if the attachments for the guns and such actually meant they handled differently, ect, but it's better than it was before and that's a good start.

The fact that weapons no longer can be ""Paid for"" via skins or the deluxe edition to skip all of the progression. There's actually progression to be HAD now, though I figure most people playing have already capped out their guns, it's still nice to see them having some customization and the skins being JUST skins.

The performance is a bit better than before too, and the new XL map gives some much needed variety to the grind.

If they can keep this up, maybe tweak movement a little bit to be a little tighter and less floaty, and keep pumping out some maps, I'd pay full price for it. As it stands, I'd still wait for a sale, but at least you're not skipping straight to endgame with the deluxe edition anymore and that's nice.

Because earning your powerups feels better in the long run, and that alone changes me from a ""Nah"" to a ""If you like zombie games, sure!""",1670238418,1675802640,True,0,0,0.474456965923309326,0,True,False,False

I figured I would download and jump back on to have another spin with the new XL horde mode - Would have been fun IF the devs knew what they where doing and stopped deleting peoples progress. Weapon unlock, level progress, collectables - all gone.

The new weapon upgrade system is fucking awful. It wasn't great to begin with but it was infinitely more preferable than what we got now.

[strike]Ignoring the fact there is no in game way to see how much experience a weapon has mid mission, all level progression stops when a weapon levels up and you have to wait until you're back in the lobby to ""unlock"" the next level and continue progressing. Any experience you thought you were making is lost just to needlessly pad out the grind.[/strike] There is no way to preview any of the new perks so you now have no idea what weapons are worth upgrading or what they even do when they get there.

And the new hoard map is a mixed bag. While it's nice we finally have a new survival map that's a little more involved it feels needlessly complicated. There is no clear way to know where the zombies are coming from, or what route they'll take, or what the new traps do or even what areas are in bounds until you play it once, and even then it's confusing and easy to forget when you have dozens of zombies bearing down on you from every single direction.

As nice as free updates are this one aint it, chief.

So apparently some of my information was entirely wrong, and I feel kind of bad for not doing my due diligence and leaving a review while emotionally compromised. There is a way to see experience for a your current weapon, but it is tucked away and easy to miss if you don't know its there (In the in-game scoreboard at the bottom right). Also, needing to unlock new levels was actually how it worked before and there are others that claim that you can now level up multiple times in one run. Unfortunately, the one game I played to test these new features ended with me being hit with a glitch that did stop my weapon progression, which combined from my long absence from the game led me to believe this was the new system.

I apologise for my mistake. However, my stance on the game still stands and anything I haven't struck through I feel is still perfectly valid, along with a few new criticisms, even if they are more minor. Customizing your weapon now feels entirely pointless since it is purely visual. A few guns seem to be nerfed with the removal of the silencer upgrade seemingly chosen arbitrarily, and others buffed for the same reason. Popular long standing weapon grinding spots seem to have also been nerfed in response to the leveling buff. All in all it seems like a mostly solid win but the increased grind makes it hard to recommend to anyone not interested in the grind, or have no one to grind with.",1675041773,1675334138,False,2,0,0.503991544246673584,0,True,False,False

But making it an FPS was a real game changer. I'd go as far as saying this is probably the best co-op zombie slaying experience on the market right now.

 It has everything L4D had and more. There's a bunch of classes to choose from. All catered to a playstyle, like melee, sharpshooting, tanking, etc... They all go up to level 30 and then you can prestige. Doing that multiple times unlocks all kinds of extra skills. If that wasn;t enough there's at least a solid thirty weapons, all of which can be leveled up to increase their power. You'll find them randomly spawned throughout the maps.

 The campaign seems long enough. I've logged 32 hours and I only beat three of the sevenish campaigns. All the spawns for weapons and some objectives are pretty random which helps keeps things from getting too stale.  They are pretty detailed and I don't ever feel like I stay anywhere for too long. I've been through new york, egypt and russia. Currently working on Japan now. It's safe to say there's a lot of variety in the settings. Plus there's also two horde modes as well. The newest one being Horde XL and just spawns an insane amount of enemies.

In the end, you need to just buy this damn game. It's not perfect and it has quirks like any other but you'll have a blast playing it. The progression systems do well enough to make you want to grind a bit more for that next skill or weapon upgrade. Plus co-op and it's cross platform so you can play with your gay friends on consoles.",1675324324,1675324324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Horde is good but the addition if horde XL has really helped the game out. XL is just plain madness, which is so awesome. It's gets your heart beating when you see all those zombies coming to you. The game is also good with trying to get players to work together. The weapons in the game are pretty good, there is a lot of weapons and they feel good.  my only problem is the AI.

Today I played the first offline solo story campaign and I must say, that this game is on the on hand looking really god damn good and on the other hand its really interesting.

It gives some L4D2 flashbacks (hunters, bulls as ""chargers"",...) but its more then that. Its like an evelopment of this game.

Zombies clip through walls, they vanish and reappear, and they have pointless game ""mechanics"".
The co-op campaign is a very boring story line by going through a linear path which is pre-solved by a marker telling you exactly where to go and what to do. The linear game play is only playable when there is a horde of zombies, but that only last a few seconds. 

There are ""classes"", but the only real thing which separates these classes would be what weapon you start with. Other than that, it is just a reskin of ""abilities"" which are so mediocre, they wouldn't make a difference. 
The weapon perks are hard to obtain in the co-op campaign and once you have them, they just reset in the next campaign mission.

They also had some very pointless limitations in their ""horde"" mode. Why must you purchase random weapons rather than the one you specifically enjoy/like. What would the purpose of this be?
You can only place barricades and sentries in pre-designated positions rather than freely building.
They had random placed ""creepers"", which is essentially the hunter in L4D2, in certain places for no reason.

Then they updated it to make it 10 times more grindy and 5 times more broken. A bad game is one thing, I can return it. Taking a good game and turning it into a bad game, that is a real scumbag move. Let this be a lesson to everyone not to trust Saber Interactive Inc. No one should support any product they put out. They could decide to ruin it some day to make it more pay to play.

What did they do? 

Instead of starting with silenced weapons or being able to unlock them after a few hours of play, you now need to put in dozens of hours with each weapon to unlock. Some weapons that did have them don't have them at all now. In this game zombies are attracted by sound so this is a huge gameplay change. Teammates will get pissed if you're constantly making noise. 

They also separated skills from skins. What does this mean? You can have a gun that looks fully upgraded with a silencer that has no silencer or stat improvements. At the same time you can have a plain looking gun fully stat boosted and silenced. Super confusing, dumb change.

It's kind of impressive that they could completely ruin this game for anyone who doesn't have 1000 hours already in it with just a few changes. DON'T BUY SABER INTERACTIVE INC PRODUCTS!",1674770657,1674770657,False,8,0,0.533114194869995117,0,True,False,False

PVP is kinda dead or take long time to find players or even Co-op you might have to wait til someone join.

I uninstalled it assuming it was abandoned, then the XL update came out, was excited to see the big changes they mentioned and I honestly hated all of them.
the new leveling system feels more like a punishment, you level it up enough to earn a perk, that you then have to grind even more for, for the proper challenge credits to even use them.

If I worked on leveling a weapon, just let me pick a perk, or use the standard currency, the weekly and daily's aren't fun enough to sit and grind over and over for a single perk for 1 gun.

Its basically a third person horde shooter. Little strategy to it. The maps are long. To clear a map could take you 15 minutes, sometimes close to 30. And there are more than 15 maps. 
If you get this, do it like i did. You want something fun, and sort of like shooting fish in a barrel. 
The graphics are slick. 
The visual representation of the hordes are really cool. 
The cities and scenarios are well composed, and the chromatic gamma chosen... very nice for the game. 
On the plus side, you got perks to achieve, and upgrades on weapons to unlock. 
And 4 difficulty settings. 
I am having fun at the easiest. 

Onto the bad side, i can see how it could get repetitive fast. 
I am a casual gamer, and put 30 minutes a day into the game, so i am able to get a bit out of it. 
But at this point the multiplayer is almost dead. 
Servers are pretty much empty, and also there's no way to kick people out of a match.

I've been keeping an eye out for WWZ for quite a while ever since it was announced and to my utter disappointment, it had to launch on that Epic Games Store as an exclusive for many months, surely a year. So that shutdown any interest I had with WWZ but then, once it released on Steam... d@mn its price was high.

As for the game, it is quite a fun game! Played solo mostly and the last episode, I had to play with players since the teammates A.I. were somehow broken and kept getting killed by zombies, without doing any actions whatsoever. So after restarting that same chapter 4 times, playing with players helped a lot!

I would say overall, the teammates A.I. are serviceable and works decently but for EPISODE 7, that is another story. It is much better than Aliens Fireteam Elite since their teammates A.I. are utterly dumb and useless. AFE REQUIRES you to play with real players so no wonder that game will die out faster than WWZ.

The many locations of this game is quite cool. The visuals are pretty impressive, animations, level designs, sounds, music and especially gameplay, all good! I did not experience any crash or bugs on my playthrough.

My irritants for WWZ would be the slow progression of weapons and class unlocks, requiring you to keep playing in order to unlock more good stuff... especially the starting weapons. What could mitigated on an eventual sequel (if there is any planned) would be to have more variety in missions. They mostly all consist on either escorting VIP's to either repair/unlock areas for power or babysitting NPC's. 


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Visuals are pretty great!
+Gameplay is fun. Mowing down zombies with all the firepower at your disposition is quite satisfying!
+Maps variety from the 7 episodes, divided by 3 to 4 chapters for each.
+Zombie variety akin to Left 4 Dead... but no Witch at least!
+No technical issues, bugs or crashed experienced in my playthough (unless you consider poor A.I. for a specific chapter!).
+Perfect UltraWide Monitor support.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-EPIC GAMES STORE EXCLUSIVE for way too long.
-STEEP PRICE for its Steam launch.
-Slow progression system to unlock weapons and class perks. I'd recommend focusing on one main weapon and class.
-Episode 7, chapter 2: Playing that chapter with teammates A.I. got frustrating since some teammates were kind of frozen, not doing anything... which made me fail the mission four times. [/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]Overall, I do recommend this game... BUT AT SALE ONLY. 
It's fun for sure but I'm pretty sure that fun won't last long. You could solo almost all of the game so you can have decent fun there but I do know WWZ and its same kind of game are designed to be played with players. Keep that in mind later if the game doesn't have any players online.

Until then, if Saber Interactive Inc. do release an additional episode, an expansion or make a sequel, I'd be sure to keep that on my radar! It better not be another EGS exclusive though![/b]",1672474881,1672474881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like kill 15 zeeks get 25% chance for equipment fill.Some classes have the same abilities.Its OKAY but feels a bit dry with what could have been done but isnt horrible.The defending a spot against hordes is where the fun and uniqueness of this game shine.Harder difficulties make communication a must for these parts of the game.Just willy nilly whatever wont cut it you need seal team 6 tactics! The weapon upgrades/leveling are cool and refreshing in a elder scrolls sense of the more you use that weapon the more you level its ability and these are found randomly usually in sequence to the stages of the game your in.More likely to find tier3 weapons later in a level.I find myself replaying levels many times over and not getting board with it.Id say a good 8 for this zombie co-op shooter.

1. big amount of weapons and well done customization

3. when you play online public, anybody can just come and bot player will be replaced by him immediately
4. plenty of special zombies, every one should be killed different way
5. deployable bandage kits, turrets, autoturrets, razor wires etc., great heavy weapons
6. good music and suitable weapon sounds
7. campaign is long enough

I DON'T LIKE:
1. horde mode is not good enough, only one map in there.
2. player skins, which you can buy, often are not really a change to an original skin

I changed my mind and I appreciate a great game overall, I recommend 100%, but still I would love it more if it had a map editor and skin editor perhaps.",1661111774,1671306036,True,0,0,0.613470137119293213,8,True,False,False

At this point I personally feel like the classes don't play different enough, apart from the medic but that can be said for many games. Game play is super fun but after playing through the entire catalog of missions three times each I feel like there is not enough content in this game. the missions themselves are really well designed especially the rome levels.
Graphics are really good as well along with performance has been super solid on my system (Ryzen 5 3600 GTX 1660S) has been great on high settings (as it was the default on).
but back at the level design while great it's static there is no new changes that occur and the modifiers while good aren't enough personally for me. Rough-like levels and objectives in missions would make this amazing.  
Customization is something I was very disappointed, no way to select attachments for your guns along with there being so few to chose from because each gun only has 5 levels respectively, almost all of them are unlocked on my end. Bare-bones character customization.
FINAL THOUGHTS:
-Game is fun for a while (make sure to play with friends to extend the life of the game on your end)
-Customization is okay but compared to other games like Deep Rock Galactic it pales really it does",1671296918,1671297022,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

World War Z supports cross-play across multiple platforms. It's possible to play together with your friends on Playstation 4/5, XBox One/Xbox Series X and Series S and Steam/EpicGames/Windows Store.
You will never have any issues finding other Players in this Game.

For Zombiegame lovers this Game is a must have in my Opinion.
You ever wanted to see hundreds of Zombies running to you on your Screen? Play WWZ and experience it by yourself. Besides the Common Infected, you get a bunch of ""Special Zombies types"" each with their own unique Ability trying to take you down! some of them eat more Bullets, so be sure you got enough Ammo ;)

- There is enough ammo, but plenty of opportunity for melee and environmental kills.
- Skill trees are decent.
- Story mode has enough difference between each group to keep things interesting. (Granted, the end goal is always just to survive, but they encounter different obstacles)
- Goals and ""go here"" markers are used appropriately. I did note a time or two when they could've been more obvious, but, if I ran into that issue, I didn't really have to wander far to find out where to go. 

My only nitpick is that you can only choose from a few prefab appearances for your player. I wish they would've allowed you to pick from various pieces of clothing and gear so you could make a truly unique look. It's not super important, just a preference.

Pros: - Big arsenal for a zombie title, with a lot of variants of the same gun.
         - Very good scale. When they say ""swarm"", they actually meant it. Exactly like from the movie if you watched it before playing the game.


Cons: - Dumb AI. Like really dumb, and this is from someone who played Left 4 Dead with bots. At least in Left 4 Dead you can add mods for them.
          - Gameplay can get boring after a while, it's just ""go grab this"", ""protect that"", etc. But hey, this can also be said for a lot of other zombie games.

- Terrible A.I
     You got knocked down/catched? Good. Because it's A.I tactical moonwalk time.
     A.I pathing is terrible. It has tendency to follow your previous path even though you already move somewhere else. It also love to move in front of you when you're shooting.
     A.I Bots uses basic non upgraded weapon. Combine with A.I pathing, this can be a nightmare sometime.
- Zeke with leg can follow player like a flying ghost, made me doubt if it a normal walking zombie.
- Need option to join on-going match only.
- Some class need update.
- Weapons need rebalance. A big sniper rifle that feel weak unless you got the special version, burst-fire weapons aren't impressive and nobody using it in online pve, new ""special smg"" so ""special"" it really need buff,...
- Need more pve map, both campaign and horde. Some campaign map so bad it got people quit lobby the moment it appear. New campaigns are just meh.
- Difficulty need update. In some map, playing with A.I can be a nightmare and too easy with human.
- Character voice line sometime feel out of touch with the atmosphere and need some rework. This is WWZ, not a bunch of edgy hot shot in Back 4 Blood.
- Barely enough content, get bored quick.

    My save game is gone. Or should I say it's stored where it should be but the game won't recognize it's there now even after attempting to fix it through multiple video tutorials. So I basically wasted 85 hours to get most weapons maxed, a few classes maxed, and make it to somewhere around level 200 just for the game to tell me I have to start back at level one now. I wouldn't mind it so much if the game had more replay value than it did, but sadly the maps and characters have gotten stale for me after the 80 hour mark...

I think WWZ server should be one of the worst server I have ever seen in my life. Even I host a peer-to-peer server, it can still go up to 50 - 60 ms for my friends and I. Shouldn't it be LAN ping at least for solo game?

2. Friendly AI is awfully bad
I swear the AI in this game is SO FUCKING TERRIBLE, AI can fuck you up in any way that you could never imagine. I enabled ""I feel your pain"" mod to make AI invincible but still, they can fuck you up hard. 
When you get downed by zombie (of course you do, because you are taking all the damage, even AI's), AI find it hard to save you because only 1 AI tries to save you at the time (other 2 would stand and stare at you. FUCK). AI generally takes 2 seconds to figure out what's going on and what to do, it's fucking retarded.

3. Defense system does not have flexibility
Random defense kit is fine but why I must put it at certain place where I would never think it is a good place to have a defense item. I just want to put it somewhere else.

4. Zombies are so agile while human is heavy as dumb
First of all, I am not a WWZ fan so it might be a WWZ feature, but why can a zombie sprint, slide or dodge a gunshot while player can do nothing other than run? Player is also forbidden to do anything when falling down from higher place too.

5. Zombie can attack you through distance
I am not sure if this is caused by terrible server or not, but I see many times zombie hurts me from a short distance that it shouldn't be able to hit. I guess it's just awful server.

6. FPS mode is not really FPS
Though the game provides FPS mode, it is actually not really FPS. I've seen many times that I can 100% land my shot on a zombie but shot it on a wall or an obstacle. REALLY? I even have my muzzle outside the obstacle.

If you want to play zombie shooter game casually, sure go ahead, but if you ever think of playing seriously. HELL THE FUCKING NO. I'm serious. For you own good.",1665671066,1665671495,False,3,1,0.547014415264129639,0,True,False,False

TL;DR
It is good, worth a playthrough if you are a fan of the COOP zombie survival horde shooter genre. Do not pay 40$ for it.

The game is about what you would expect at face value but once you go any deeper than that it quickly gets out of hand. Of the the nearly 200 hours I have in this game almost 130 of those were in que's waiting for multiplayer games. If you want to finish this game 100% you will have to either find friends to grind about 20 hours of pvp or just suffer the abhorrently long ques. The classes are also a grind to level but that can easily be exploited thanks to a very specific map (if you know you know). At a certain point this game stopped being fun and just became a chore to finish so if you are a completionist be aware you got a struggle ahead.

It's a great game and I wouldn't want to see the potential rot away because nothing is being pushed for it.

Edit: Just to clarify as well: I know live service games have altered our way of viewing games - as if they need constant updates. I agree they don't. I'm just not sure if they'll release another game, would be cool if they did, but if not modding would help keep the game ""new"" for those of us who play the campaign or horde over and over again.

I like the perk system and the way it kind of promotes experimenting with different builds essentially.  you can really get pretty creative with this game, in regards to play styles up until you get into the very topmost difficulties. 

 The difficulties, by the way, are scaled so perfectly in my opinion.  As soon as you're proficient, MOVE UP!  the zombies employ different tactics and teach you to be more effective if you pay attention.   This is a really well-crafted game that got unfairly overlooked.   I think it's movie tie-in circumstance probably affected this game negatively because it's one of the exceptions. 

 there can be frustrations in regards to adding friends sometimes from meeting in game, if you're on crossed platforms, so to speak.  I've met people in this game that it really hurt me to lose because there wasn't any efficient way of contacting them again after you're disconnected or w/e.  That may change or may have already. 

 I'm writing this after far more than only 54 hours or whatever it says.  I bought this game a second time on steam, thinking that i would bump into a larger playerbase than i typically saw on epic but it wasn't the case.  i really love this game and i still play it from time to time, but it really suffers from stale content.   

I played the slasher class almost all the time, until i started playing in the final difficulty extreme or whatever it is.  the slasher is kind of  set up for failure in many ways, no matter what difficulty, but there's a couple really effective perk combinations for this guy that can make it almost unstoppable until you get on extreme.    sadly, the slasher's prestige perks are all 100% useless and it's a total waste of money and time to grind them all out.  the only good perk you get out of prestige as slasher is hitting 1 more enemy before you become fatigued.   everything else is so negligible that you can only perceive them statistically.  i did it on epic games, but i just decided to keep the imaginary money on the steam version.",1633282104,1660803385,True,9,1,0.564204096794128418,0,True,False,False

It has a bunch of campaigns which are about 3-4 missions long each, a single Horde survival map, and pvp multiplayer. Multiplayer is absolutely dead, but you can still find people to play with in the campaigns and horde mode relatively easily, as the game is crossplay with Steam, Epic, PS and Xbox. Pick it up on sale, it's a fun time, you'll probably get around 80 hrs of replayability before you never want to look at it again, though. I think the amount of campaigns the game has is fine, but it absolutely needs more horde maps.

Unironically one of the best co-op zombie games in recent years. Do yourself a favor and pick it up.

However, there's lots of cheaters. Being primarily co-op, it's not *that* big of a deal but it's still annoying as there's so many lv 999's that are inexcusably garbage players because they're boosted through cheats. I've yet to see a legitimate high level player, aside from a single 800-something who was beasting his way through an Insane-difficulty level on his own.

The cheaters vary from doing nothing out of the ordinary, to increasingly obvious things such as quietly getting their health back, respawning themselves after death, to teleporting out of bounds and aimbotting all the zombies on the map. With the game running on a peer-to-peer matchmaking system, the character files are easily editable and there's no way to report anyone so it's something you just have to either deal with or find a new lobby. It's a prevalent issue, but by-and-large, because of the nature of the game, not one that impacts your game experience 98% of the time. If you've played it, It's comparable to the cheaters in Payday 2 -- a lot of users and a few abusers.

Cheaters aside, the game honestly gets an 8/10 from me, as a longtime-fan of the 4 player co-op genre.",1632879738,1660716329,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Screamers spawn out of sight and in the most out of the way spots just to make you run all the way around to get them in your line of sight.  Instead of fixing the zombies they clearly fucked up they decided to do a 30+ gb download to fix the horde mode. Overall the game is good but until they fix something as simple as fucked up special zombies then I would wait to get it on sale. Not worth full price for how much frustration you'll get out of it. Also, AI bots go full retard like 90% of the time if you don't have a full squad. At least they risk their lives just to revive you though.",1660462134,1660462134,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Won't really go into the nitty gritty since I am sure more hardcore passionate players will probably have already covered this or will cover it in better detail than myself but if you can get this game on sale you can put a solid 25-50 (or more if you plan on being a completionist) hours into it easy and it'll be fun for the most part. Don't forget to grab some friends, family or a significant other to play with as it makes this experience more worthwhile as certain rando's (as they usually are) are not reliable or just terrible to play with ie. was exploring the nooks and cranny's with the wife and one rando shot at us because he didn't like that we were taking too long so we booted him.

Nice cluster of zombies to slay, really nice online co-op/multiplayer system.
Although aftermath too YEARS to be worked on an released, it would have been nice to have more episodes added, seeing that the community had to wait so long for a way overdue, DLC. If you don't mind playing the waiting game, with WWZ for more episodes, definitely recommend. But if you get bored easily, and massive cluster of zombies gnawing at you doesn't do it for you, then I'd say move along.

See how much time I have in this game? 11 hours when I typed this review.   I've burned through all of those maps and maxed out the Gunner class already and I just bought the game 2 days ago.   

There are difficulty levels,  Easy, Hard, Insane,  it's difficult to find other players on anything lower than hard difficulty and the game is actually not any fun at Easy because it's too easy.   

I've had fun with this game but in my opinion,  it's not finished,  there is about 1/10th of a Zombie game here and it's not much to brag about and it's not worth more than 5 to 10 bucks as it is even though the third person gun play is fun,  the zombie killing is fun, there's plenty of gadgets and explosives, it's still just not enough, the game is too short and it's too shallow, it's unfinished in my opinion.  The content that is there is polished enough for what the game is but there is still not enough missions at each location,  there should be at least 6 to 12 missions per location,  AT LEAST THAT MANY,  but there isn't so you will knock it all out in less than 10 hours of gameplay which will take about 2 to 3 days.     I do not recommend this game even though I like it because I feel that the developer screwed the consumer and overcharged for what they have to offer here.   It's a damn short game,  the shortest game I have ever played and once you finish all of those missions it just becomes ridiculously repetitive no matter how difficult it is.  Horde mode is moronic.  You can't even find weapons to switch to or medkits or ammo,  you buy defenses one at a time while a 1 minute timer ticks down and then the hordes are unleashed on you.

To think that this game used to cost over 40 bucks is disgusting,  it takes 10 hours to figure out that it's a scam.   This is not a triple A in depth, detailed, quality title well worth the asking price and even at the discount it's being offered for on the STEAM summer sale you will not get your money's worth even at 15 bucks.

Like I said there is quality but there isn't much of a game here.   There is a game, it's well made but there isn't much of it and it appears intentional.

This game lacks so much content that it almost could be mistaken for a DEMO.

It actually has a cool sort of Division 2 vibe meets Zombie Army thing going on there and it could have been exploited with more content but the developer chose a quick buck over value.

Dodge roll,  you can't dodge roll either.  But movement is actually just as smooth as in Division 2.  No dodge roll though.

What I'm wondering while I played this game is what about Berlin? Los Angeles? Chicgo? San Francisco?  Washington D.C. ? London?    each with at least a dozen missions.  No sir,  you get 7 other cities, only one in America and no more than 3 to 4 missions on average per city.  You can do 4 missions in one city in a few hours.  Some less than 2.

It's not the type of game that wears you out, where you play it for hours enjoying the vast amount of cool content, you will wear it out because you will run out of content and have to keep repeating what is there, over and over again.  What they offer instead of more missions and destination is more classes to level up with corresponding skills, variations on those skills, with weapons and new skins for those weapons, to unlock ACCESS to in game, during a mission. .....ridiculous, I know.  There should be at least a dozen locations with at least a dozen missions each for a total of 144 missions.  Each mission should take 30 minutes to an hour to finish.

I've got ELEVEN HOURS in this game and I've seen every mission and location that it has to offer and I'm done.  There are no more surprises here.

this is a 50 gigabyte game that you can finish in 10 hours.

Another point I'd like to make,  the players aren't given a fighting chance on levels above insane,  if you pick this difficulty level you will die quickly and none of you will finish the mission because the game is designed for you to fail.",1656216829,1657944276,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 In my opinion, this is currently not worth buying unless its WELL over 50% off, because people drop this game due to frustration with daily and weekly challenges, and ludicrous ace-busting carrot chasing ""blue coins"". 

This game is simple for most people, but if you plan on NOT cheating and try to platinum this game, it becomes frustrating. Documents to get a single gun is not worth it. Neither are frustrating yourself with crappy modified players who have no IDEA what strategy is and run off with their pants on fire, with no way to KICK these idiots.

I have found NO ONE communicates via voice on this game, other than my gaming partner. 

Zombies spawn in previously cleared ares? Yes, lots of them. Realistic, ummm NO.

Reaction time favors the zombies, even if you are a religious reloader like me, they will win.

Electric fence grids are nice, but they are zombie magnets. Even if our Team gets the idea the  zombie is dead by electrocution and bullets, it sits on the grid, chewing away valuable points. 
Yeah, we tear them apart to help save resources.

it seems an heavily unfair advantage goes to zombies in horde mode because ""resources"" bongo bucks to purchase supplies gets less and less after wave 30? WHY is that?  Cuz....
I guess being part of HUMAN wasn't calculated into this equation... we are and DO make mistakes. Why penalize players by throwing more stuff at them with less bongo bucks?

BUT since it is NOT worthy to play over 30-35 waves, because once you hit the level 30 cap for that prestige level, the rest of your XP is trashed. So, quit in order to stop wasting your time and effort in horde.

To obtain a sword you need to play the hardest level. You read the words from the developers that paraphrased seem to indicate your chances to succeed are zilch. Most ""carrots"" are the same way. 

IMHO, CROSSPLAY purely sucks, but will be turned since people cannot be blocked or is RARE cases, friended if they are really talented gamers ( 2 in hundreds of players noted).

There are ""carrots"" within this game that ""appear"" to be game changers, probably allowing you to go a little farther than normal. BUT the objectives are riddled with 3-4 mutators when playing the daily and weekly challenges that are close to ludicrous. In order to platinum this game you need to get like 10,000 blue coins? COME ON. Who the hell comes up with these ""restrictions"" ?  isn't this supposed to be an enjoyable and fun game?? 

These blue coins are difficult for the average player to obtain. In my opinion, it is the developers way to ace bust the game. BUT there are trainers and cheat people use to get 999 levels and 99,999 blue coins, so lets have the cheaters benefit from this and the regular players suffer. Rich.....

If they would give you ONE blue coin per horde wave completed whether normal (1 coin) or hard (2 coins) , it MIGHT be worthy of trying to platinum this game. Most play it for as long as they can tolerate it, and flush it.

The ""weekly challenges"" are NOT worth playing . The restrictions they place on you by raising the difficulty level and throwing mutators on the missions makes it ludicrous to get blue coins and or documents.

I have followed the press for this game since it launched years ago. I remember the times where, I thought - some one agreed that this game would NEVER be on steam. Well, I hope since they have come here, there is no silent bad blood, developers prove themselves on what is on the table and whether it is an enjoyable experience.

I am a military veteran, I typically try to logically approach games with reasoning and try to figure out plans, change as needed. well, with enemies that spawn next to where you are standing is an issue. Throwing chaos in a well thought strategy? THIS is NOT fun, exciting or reasonable in any night mare style play.

We'll play this for a while more, but I am sure we will revert back to Zombie Army 4 which is slower paced and more realistic. I don't about most of you, but where in the heck does anyone expect a brainless hulk to run faster than a human being and dodge shots like they are a ninja? <shakin my head>

To make it easy and Simple. If you've ever played [b] Left 4 Dead [/b] or any of games alike it, you will notice the similarities, just like many other Zombies games that features a four-player co-op history-mode.

Some missions may have a few different things from others, but in the end, the whole gameplay is the whole repetitive form of ... 

 [u] 1 [/u] -   [i] Go there! Get some weapons on the way, there [/i] 

[u] 2 [/u] - [i] You've Arrived! [/i] [b] NOW DEFEND THIS! [/b] 

[u] 3 [/u]  - [i] Good job, now thou hath  defended this, Haveth a few objectives for you, as you get some more supplies and weapons, on your way to the rest of the mission. [/i]

 and then it goes on Repeat-Mode, and you just repeat [u] 1 [/u] from [u] 3 [/u] , and sometimes you get to [b] ARM DEFENSES, TO DEFEND AGAIN! [/b] ---  [u] Wow, good job, you've finished the mission, now be ready, for the next mission will include exactly the same objectives, but a whole different layout-map~! [/u] 

[h1] Is The Game Any Way Related to The Movie? [/h1]

Sorry, fellow-movie-fan, It's the same Universe, Completely different history, to be fair, some of the logic of this game... I would even dare say, this is a whole different dimension too, that just happens to have the placeholder event of Zeke's  biting people's neck all over Earth or something.

[h1] What Else Should You Be Aware of?! [/h1]

The [b] A.I [/b] , it takes alot of patience and time to play and adjust together with the A.I, the A.I won't help you at all if you play a high difficulty mission, they take times to do alot of things, and sometimes they will completely forget they have to revive you, or any other of themselves. But they're damn good at shooting zombies, they're like human-like turrets, a shame we can't make them use specific weapons, they would destroy every single zombie!

[h1] Some Completely Unrelated Commentary that literally doesn't even make any Sense. [/h1]

Ah, yes... A game where... [u] Russians [/u] will speak [b] English [/b] with [i] Heavy Russian Accent [/i] to Other [u] Russians [/u], while being in [b] Russia [/b], for unclear reasons? [spoiler] Like, Broh, You're in the same country, you're all russian-speakers, why speak english to each other? Do you think the zombies even know language? [/spoiler]

While the game will also feature [u] Japanese [/u] Character who will simply, and mostly, just speak  [i] English with Heavy Japanese Accent [/i], while also being in [b] Japan [/b] and simply talking with other [u] Japanese [/u] who will also answer back in [b] English [/b]...  Excuse me, what?

This is by no doubt, a game made by Americans, I expected more Immersion,  from the Money I paid for, aside from all the Cool '' MOUNTAIN-CENTIPEPE-CASCADE'' Of zombies that pile up, just like in the movies!

The only thing that was somewhat interesting was the class system, but even that was disappointing in the end, with it being so linear and unsatisfying. You could have special zombies that would be much easier to take down with specific classes, but there's simply no difference whichever class you pick. The potential is obvious but no capitalized upon, which is a shame.

There is ZERO reason to replay this game's campaign mode, and the characters are so generic and one dimensional that you will wish they would just die already.

 I assure you, after the first few levels, you'll be passively running through the campaign episodes while daydreaming about a different game or what you're gonna have for dinner later.  

I was told to not rush through the levels and instead search for weapons and stuff in the environment, but what is the point when there will be the same, or even better weapons at the next checkpoint you run to? what kind of argument is that?. The weapons themselves are just mediocre and you won't even be compelled to upgrade them, cause it doesn't make a difference!.

There's just zero initiative to play this game over better, more fun zombie shooters like L4D, except for better graphics. This game also came out years after L4D yet doesn't really bring anything new to the table, which leaves me dumbfounded.  There is definitely fun to be had, just not for more than 2 hours or so. 

Ask yourself: Should I spend close to $30 bucks on a game with less content than a kindergarten point and click adventure, one dimensional characters that you wish would jump off a cliff,  a lack of any compelling plot whatsoever, narrow linear stale environments which all are the exact carbon copies of each other just with a different paint job, a dead online multiplayer and worthless player progression, or do I play a better game that is cheaper, way more interesting with loads more content and still boasts a huge community despite being more than a decade old?

so if ""woohoo better graphics = great game"" or if you're a brain-dead zombie that feeds off mediocrity,
give it a shot.

 But if you want to spend your hard earned money on something worthwhile, compelling and enjoyable for more than a couple of hours? give it a pass. In fact, go buy a pizza instead! way more satisfying.",1657059907,1657398199,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

And if they added like: more talent tree upgrades, aiming down sight (with scopes), prehabs a story-mode survival play mode that is like the one in the movie and prehaps being a bit more forgiving towards solo players. 
I feel like that would improve the game a lot.

the game ain't perfect, but its pretty good although it does feel like L4D a little bit too much sometimes when there shoudn't be a reason to since its a whole unique concept they have here.

Very short version: yes the game is fun and worth the purchase.

Okay, so there is nothing to actually spoil. There is a few lines of dialogue to move things along but in terms of a story? There is not much of one. That's not the reason you would want to play this game anyway. For a direct comparison this is basically a third person Left 4 Dead 2.

Graphically the game gets it done. Not groundbreaking but certainly very pretty at times. What steals the show though is the size of the zombie hordes. They are absolutely massive especially when you get to higher levels in of horde mode. Levels are mostly linear but can have areas to explore and made in such a way that I often forgot that they actually were linear.

Control are simple and precise with either mouse and keyboard or controller. There aren't an overwhelming amount of keys to assign. It would have been completely unnecessary in such a game.

Lastly, the Aftermath edition is worth the extra money. You get additional episodes, horde mode and the ability to play the game in first person. The only issue I have is that in first person mode there is no actual ADS but only a simple zoomed view of the weapon so scopes and sights are all but non functional except on two sniper rifles.

Hardware: Predator Helios 300 with 1660ti
Graphical Settings: Ultra and it runs without so much as a hiccup.

It almost gives the same feeling as L4D2, but lacks the 'scary-horror' segments of encountering a witch in l4d/l4d2.
But WWZ has its edge of having more multiple ways of tackling the game. and Better Replayability, courtesy of getting your arsenal improved as you progress with the game

TBH, WWZ is a better successor to L4D than B4B.
WWZ follows a similar format to L4D in which a region is cut into smaller events and ends with an epic finale map.
B4B just doesnt have that same epic value in their finale, which WWZ does well

As expected, it is only loosely World War Z (there's a bunch of zombies around the world), but it does follow different characters in different areas with different goals so it does somewhat capture the spirit of the book.  
+ Difficulty scaling seems to be pretty good, so easy is actually easy and you can choose harder if you want
+ Weapon upgrading is a fun mechanic 
+ Class skills are enjoyable to choose, though some are obviously better than others
+ Mutators to change things up (though most of these are about making the game harder, it could do with more directly beneficial ones and/or amusing mutators)
+ Maps look excellent
? The game really likes swarms suddenly running in as you wander about. L4D2 did more of a 'there are a bunch of zombies already waiting in the level', while this has that, most of the enemies you face while walking around are ones which rush in.
? The game really likes areas where you have to defend against large swarms. There's at least 2 every mission. Place some defenses, try to defend a specific place which is for some reason attracting zombies (sometimes this makes sense due to a large noise, sometimes you're left questioning as to why hundreds of zombies are rushing this area). This isn't bad, but it does feel overdone. L4D2 did this more often just at the very end of a level.
- The game appeared to give some upgraded versions of weapons at the start? I don't know if this is DLC or just things they've added after the game has been out for a time, but they tend to be better than the default ones for that level. This makes so you basically skip a couple levels of a weapon, which is weird.
- There's no (notable) modding or custom maps, and you can get through all the maps in ~12 hours (probably shorter if you really try, or longer if you take your time on harder difficulties).
- It feels too easy to get most of the weapons? 
- There's 'blue coins' for accessories which you get from completing challenges, but with how few you get via just playing the game rather than focusing on challenges, you probably won't get any accessories for the characters without essentially playing through the game repeatedly. As well, since the missions have a different set of four characters each time (except for the Japan and last Russia mission, though I don't know if they get the same accessories since they're treated as different characters elsewhere) then you won't be having them a lot of the time.

The game is fun, but I'm not certain I'd suggest paying the current $40 for it. It has some issues in polish (though the maps are beautiful, I'm referring to gameplay) and notable issues in how much replayability there is or will be.",1652995063,1652995063,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

There should be modification to runs not challenges. Unless you want to stress yourself. Instead of de-stress after a long day of hard work. Game is very grindy. This game is no longer fun to play. My goodness the gaming industry needs my help big time to make their games fun again. I do not recommend. Avoid at all cost. Until they make competent AI teammates. Also why make extra clothing if its almost impossible to unlock?,1641552802,1649749140,False,7,0,0.544937551021575928,0,True,False,False

Mapas:
La verdad que me encantan, el equipo de Saber ha desarrollado muy bien nuevas mecánicas incorporadas en los nuevos mapas (Roma y Kamchatka). Me hubiera gustado que hubieran más catacumbas al estilo de Marsella, pero es preferencia personal. El elemento de perder vida por las bajas temperaturas en Kamchatka es increíble, en mi opinión ha sido perfectamente implementado y espero se apliquen nuevos elementos atmosféricos que involucren nuevas estrategias de juegos en futuras actualizaciones.

Clase Vanguardista:
En mi opinión la nueva clasde es bastante mediocre, es superada por cualquier otra clase support (Médico, Maestro de Drones y Manitas). El único momento en donde brille y sea bastante útil es por disminuir el tiempo de espera en reaparición de un personaje cuando es eliminado; sin embargo, con la presencia de un Médico o Manitas o un Drone que te protege de zombies cercanos, morir es casi imposible cuando se trata de jugadores con experiencia.

Ratas:
Me gusta que aporta un trabajo en equipo para poder deshacerse de ellas en caso alguien sea deshabilitado, además de forzarte a usar armas pesadas o inclusive el lanza llamas, que anteriormente era muy infravalorado por muchos jugadores nuevos. En un inicio eran bastante difíciles de eliminar, pero no imposible; sin embargo, por bastantes quejas de jugadores al no encontrar posible forma de matarlas, las nerfearon a tal punto que ahora, en mi opinión, son inservibles, muy fáciles de matar.

Cosméticos:
Agregaron dos nuevos llaveros, un mando de PS y una bocina pequeña. No son nada impresionante, pero dan más motivos de querer adquirir nuevas monedas azules. También agregaron nuevas apariencias a los personajes de Marsella, los cuales son increíbles, en especial el de Eloise. Obviamente tras la apariciónn de los nuevos mapas hay nuevos personajes en Roma que ya vienen también con apariencias para desbloquear, pero lamentablemente solo 3 por cada personaje en vez de 4. Los personajes de Kamchatka son los mismos que los de Tokyo, pero con atuendos de invierno.

Por último la nueva mecánica de combate cuerpo a cuerpo es increíble, hay para todos los gustos y colores, desde armas ligeras hasta pesadas, dependiendo del estilo de juego de cada uno. Además que cada arma cuerpo a cuerpo tiene una pequeña ventaja que personaliza más a cada clase. Si tuviera que quejarme sobre este nuevo agregado sería que agreguen más armas.

En general la actualización ha mejorado al juego en todo aspecto. Y para aquellos que les gusta tener una perspectiva de juego de Primera Persona, tambien lo tiene, para que ningun otro juego de zombies pueda superarlo.",1632905457,1649111133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, this turned out to be a New World situation but for my GPU. Something is fucky in the game to such a degree that, with the default unrestricted framerate, it will cap out your CPU, and in my case do it so hard it causes repeatable crashes. The solution is to lock the framerate to 60, but I cannot comprehend how this is a problem almost 3 years down the road.

Very first launch, and after spending about double whatever listed time I have on Steam, I have had the game not just constantly crash, but crash so hard my computer passed Bluescreen and went straight to rebooting. The only thing that even marginally helped was reverting both my CPU and GPU(an R9-5950X and EVGA 3090 FTW3 Ultra) to stock specs across the board, letting me actually get into the main menu but still resulting in the same exact crash while browsing character bios.

Good graphics, intense gameplay, extremely quiet community. You might see someone say something 1 out of 10 games. Good for a casual experience but if you want to play on the more difficult settings or get far in the 'horde mode' you simply cannot risk being physically around the zombies due to faulty hitboxes.

What I mean by faulty hitboxes is, you will see a zombie standing with its arms at its side and think it is just out of reach, then you start receiving damage without any visual animation. I've had zombies walking by me without stopping, staring in another direction, and died from four hits at once. 

My best run on the Horde mode ended because one person died standing on a ledge too close to the zombies and then when I went to save them using a special ability, the special ability animation completed then I was pinned by zombies while still in the middle of the special ability animation. I have 0 ping issues with the server and I am confident this is just how the game is coded. 

Compare this to Killing Floor. In Killing Floor, I always know exactly how I screwed up, where the attack came from, how far I was from being safe from the hit, etc. All of this ensures that you can get in the middle of the action and, if you are skilled enough, kick some ass. In World War Z this just isn't feasible.

Only recommended for casual/group play on 50% sale or more, otherwise don't waste the money.

World War Z iz a zombie shooter game with FPS logic. There are similarities between the game and the movie. It mainly focuses on cooperation and multiplayer. It has serious amount of challenge if you want. The weapons are diverse and strategy is mandatory. I think it is better than Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 but this comparison is not valid, since this game has horde mode. Overall, could be real fun with friends who know how to play this good.

Long review:

Ok first of all we should not be comparing this game with Left 4 Dead. That game is also awesome and rich. World war z is mostly about strategy. This game has 2 modes, 1 is just story progression and 1 is for multiplayer. There is also a horde mode to kill swarm of zombies in a strategic way.

Story is kind of boring but you can play it offline and easily finish all of it with bots on your side. All of the story requires 4 players and it can be multiplayer or singleplayer with bots. If you go into multiplayer and expect other people to jump in, be aware, the game changes its progression and map a little. It expects you would get human help and increases the difficulty. If you stick to offline mode, the game will help you a little, since the bots are way too stupid :D

You will meet new characters in the campaign mode. Each has some unique characteristics on the outside. They also have customized outfits but you have to unlock them with challenges. This is not cool. Each campaign mission has some sort of story but mostly, it is point to point zombie survival game.

The traps are improtant in this game. There are auto turrets, electric traps, proximity greanades. You will use these to stop and efficiently kill zombies of like 100 in numbers. There are also good number of different weapons from the get go in the game. But in the story, you will start with small ones and discover bigger weapons throughout. Also in horde mode, you will have to unlock them with points.

BTW, horde mode. This is where the game excels. It is basically area defense war. Zombies swarm in and you have weapons, traps and friends to stop them. There are destructable environmental ebjects like fences to slow them down but you will need to replace them when they are broken. The game will throw waves at you and you will be rewarded with points. You will use them to buy traps, guns, ammo, medkit and etc. Bots will not get points, so you have to work for them too :D

In this game, bots are idiots. They don't know how to use a stationary machine gun or take a medkit to heal themselves. You will need to take care of them. That is why this game really need friends to be played with.

I have never actually played multiplayer mode. There are like capture the flag modes or something. I think horde mode is good enough.

There are lots of weapons and their upgrades. You will have unlock points to unlock weapon upgrades, as you play horde mode or story mode. Every character can use every gun in the game.

There are classes to chose. Every character can chose every class. These classes are like Medic, Gunslinger, Explorer, Slasher ...etc. They have unique abilities and they will be upgraded too, as long as you play in tha class. Again you will spend unlocking points like in guns. These should have been separated i guess. But the same points will be used for guns and classes so be wise.

Visuals are good enough i guess. The gam renders literally a hundred zombies on screen with no problemo in my pc, which is I5 966K and GTX 1660 Super OC. I was able to play at 50-70 ms pings online. Not many people are online though. Nevertheless, you may find some people with some patience :)

Overall, very good game for its price. You might get bored after around 30 hours or so. But this game doesn't promise huge load of content. This game promises zombies and slaughter and strategy. You can also find serious challange here. I would give it 9 out of 10.",1645566531,1645566531,True,1,0,0.521276593208312988,0,True,False,False

- Getting the Deluxe Edition and DLCs gives you nearly all the weapons with maxed out stats, skipping the weapon upgrading grind
- Nearly nobody's playing the campaign online because the Horde mode gives you more rewards, more XP, and its much more easier to coordinate a defense
- Horde mode, the most populated mode of the game, has only one map. Repetition is a major problem in this
- Getting the challenge coins (the blue coins) is extremely slow and its required for getting alternate or special versions of weapons so expect a slow grind.
- The developers updates at an extremely slow pace so don't expect constant updates for patches and content
- PvP is a mess, don't even bother
- Don't even try Extreme difficulty unless you hit an extremely high level and learned every map in the game because people will insta-kick you faster than L4D2 Versus players

Despite all these flaws, the game is still fun, especially with friends and I do recommend at least playing the entire campaign with someone instead of bots. Don't stress yourself over the high difficulties, just play normal horde mode until you get the hang of the game. That's my advice for those wanting to try this out.",1645470858,1645470858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it is true there is something a little different here compared to Left 4 Dead, I believe that Saber Interactive delivered very well here.

The main campaign follows various groups of survivors spread across the world map, each location having 3 or so maps associated with its own plotline. I really enjoyed this, while the characters are not as well developed as say the crew in Left 4 Dead  2, they offer their own personalities and quirks that play out as the levels progress. In contrast the Left 4 Dead characters were present in all of the campaigns and had more time to develop as the game went on.

The core gameplay is very good, at first I was worried about the 3rd person view; but it actually is made very well, since the camera pulls back when you are aiming down sights and it feels like first person anyway (similar to Metal Gear Solid 5). The updated version on Steam gave us an option to play entirely in first person mode, though after trying it once I went back to the original designed viewpoint.

The zombies feel threatening, and there are a bunch of specials in the mix as well. They are made quite different to Left 4 Dead’s offering, thankfully. The common zombies will blow apart depending on when you shoot them, with a bonus damage when hitting the heads; a crucial part of the higher difficulties. The zombies will sometimes dodge and weave around, making this a difficult task to achieve sometimes; adding to the threat and the immersion of the game.

The maps are varied and very different in how they play out. Additional map variety occurs with some maps having routes that change, and the battle crescendo moments have defence hardpoints designed into them. The catch is that some defences will spawn randomly, and some defence crates will randomly spawn as well: these are 50-cal turrets, auto-turrets, car batteries attached to fences for stunning and frying zombies, barbed wire, and mortar launchers. The crates allow the player to choose where to place the defence, given a valid hardpoint that it matches with.

As for the normal play, there are a very nice mix of weapons similarly divided into 3 tiers just like Left 4 Dead. Instead here we also got a weapon upgrade system, where each weapon is a slot and as you level up that weapon you can buy different versions which have different mods on them and different statistics. This progress was very fun to unlock and gave a gradual curve to managing the difficulty of the 5-point skull system.

On difficulty, going from easy to extreme, the rule changes are consistent and the challenge is very real and insane and extreme; but not impossible. The idea I think is that you get a group of max level (at 30) players with max upgraded weapons and try to complete each map in extreme. This grants you an unlockable which is like a skinned version of the sniper rifle, this model granting bonus stats and special abilities on the weapon.

Other weapons have a variety of unlocks as well, by ‘prestiging’ a class twice; you are granted a unique skin for their related default weapon (offering something different gameplay wise). Each prestige level resets your level to 0 for that class; and as you level it up again you are awarded bonus skills not previously accessible. This system gives some replay value and time to really learn a class. 

Since there are 8 classes in the game, there is a lot to try out and a lot of replayability here. Each class plays quite differently, and I have to say the levelling system and customisation on how you set up each class is very welcomed. 

Other stuff is the PVP mode, no comment from me since I don't bother with these modes to avoid toxicity. The challenge mode allows you to play the maps again to collect a set of 9 documents per map. When collecting these you unlock bonus chances for more loot/map aids when playing the maps. This is useful for beating the extreme difficulty on the standard campaign. Also the challenge mode has a normal and hard difficulty; and a set of random mutators that mix up the gameplay. In some cases the mutators make the hard challenge mode  even more difficult than the extreme campaign difficulty.

A whole bunch of high difficulty modes and challenge modes (with daily and weekly bonus challenges) award you with blue coins. These can be used to unlock character skins and unique weapon skins (which have unique stats).

The online play is pretty good, I haven’t had any major issues but I wish there were more controls of your lobby and a few more online player features. 

A note on the options and performance, pretty good selection to tweak the engine, and the option to switch from DX11 to Vulkan was very welcomed. The game in my opinion look very beautiful; the engine creates a very vivid world to play in. One of the best features in this game are the zombie hordes, which are something special to witness and never gets old.

So in summary for me the class system, weapon upgrades, defence kits, and a few other additional features give something moreover than what Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 gave us. And I love that. I hope this game gets more updates and more DLC, because it is a very good co-op survival game.

The class and progression system is quite fun and it also improves on quite a few things compared to left 4 dead, such as making heavy weapons be useful because they have their own weapon slot.

AI is terrible though, they cant even hold or use medpacks but it didn't detract too heavily.
The hordes are much larger and lead to exciting defence sections as well as more varied finales. Really enjoyed playing through all the campaigns.

But there isn't enough between each mission to keep you coming back. This is a game in desperate need of a massive expansion that tosses a few grenades into the game play to living things up.

Worth it on sale. Think I payed $20. But as some other folks have noted, the player base has dwindled fast. Let me know if you wana give it a shot and I'll play with you.",1644734537,1644734537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]It is a no. NO.[/u] Unless you have nothing better to do with your life.[/b]

[b]+[/b] These people know how to make scenarios, characters and animations. (not only here, Snow Runner and Ghostbusters are amazing ones)
[b]+[/b] My greetings to sound engineer. Weapons are pretty decent and explosions very nice.
And that's it.
[b]-[/b] There's a loading screen when you launch the game. And when quit the game. There is loading everywhere.
[b]-[/b] There's no ""press"" a button here, it's only HOLD. Hold E for every action in the f*cking game.
[b]-[/b] Fancy weapons sights... useless. Cosmetic. Despite the sniper, there's no way to use them. Only ""minizoom"" option.
[b]-[/b] I hate games with no jumping free action. Scripted jumping is a NO to me.
[b]-[/b] Loads of bad ideas. Messed up skills and perks; EXP system I'm sure someone pulled it from their behind.
[b]-[/b] There's no objectives markers or something like that; you (noob) are going around lost like and idiot until you find a f*cking switch on the wall.
[b]-[/b] Talking about switches... they're a fetish in this game. Like levers in Resident Evil.

Maybe I'm a moron. Probably, I would say. But this game is not worth it. The typical wasted potential.

There is no connection to the movie i think and it's closer to the book, it's about war/ survival against zombie not ""Find Cure Z"" or ""Investigating Z"" like the movie adaptation.

I have to give this game credit for not trying so hard to be L4D unlike Born4Bad or whatever that game is, WWZ is trying to be the game of own it's own despite having the same concept as L4D. what made me like this game more is that it has serious tone like the first L4D not comedic like L4D2 nor cringe like B4B. it's not a perfect game, the janky & weird animations feels off, still bit buggy, the balancing which unfair but make sense considering it's zombie apocalypse BUT MAAAN the game is GOOD. 

First of all the game sets literally in around  ""World"" not just America and each region has different characters which means there is 28 characters of 6 different regions, you can unlock first 20 characters background story if you finish which each one, it's CRAZY. There are a lot of beautiful guns you could use and the Weapon's kick back, punch, and sound is wonderful. Game's optimization is good despite having a lot of horde at once, hell even it running on Nintendo Switch, again it's CRAZY. The game is little bit grindy, you get rewarded more if you finished a level, if you wanted to grind your level there is Horde mode which easier to gain xp but the horde mode only had 1 map which is shame. And like always the AI companion is Fkin Dumb, i bet the zombie are smarter than them, The Best experience is at least having 1 player in your lobby, because the objectives are easier to do with players because the AI won't do a danm thing. Even better the game has crossplay which make us easier to find teammate.

I say it's a solid co-op zombie game, 7 or 8 out of 10 kinda game. words are it's broken at launch but it's better now. get it on sale, it's even cheaper than born4bad.",1644601875,1644601875,True,5,0,0.588604271411895752,0,True,False,False

The Zeke movement is a little bit more janky, if you know what I mean by that? I will say it is an excellent system in regards to aim and aim assist. At times you will feel like a headshot god with this aim assist, best I've seen honestly. You will be paired with randoms that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. They will not understand that they have points in horde mode that they should be using for voltage grids or autoturrets. It will, at times, piss you off. You might want to say, ""hey fren! Why you not use your points while I'm currently at 0 points after spending mine on every voltage grid and ammo crate?"" But you will learn that this is just the way of some folks, and that it means you have embarked on yet another journey into wave 5 of horde mode that you will not survive, even when you have survived wave 20 with a good team that does understand how to spend points on equipment and defenses. It's hit or miss. It's fun to watch my kids play in cross platform with each other with an invite code. I have an X-box series S and a PC that supports the game, and it is a lot of fun to watch them panic as the zekes pile in and overwhelm their position.

In sum, it feels like an actual zombie game - like real zombie game. 

Ill give it a positive, I think there are some cons, the matchmaking system you can tell is as unpolished as a dog turd, and generally speaking the weapon upgrade system makes little to no sense. It doesn't necessarily explain how you get cosmetic outfits in the early game, and the story (while we know it from the book and movie) feels like it could have been fleshed out so much more. 

But again, the maps feel good, gunplay feels good, and I may be enjoying this more than B4B which I put plenty of time in an early buyer, and the maximum tier of ultimate, dlc, whatever BS they sold to me - so I recommend this without a shadow of a doubt for anyone looking for co-op, ""mow-em-down"", zombie slaying gameplay.",1643341744,1643341744,True,14,0,0.623854577541351318,0,True,False,False

A solid, but average game inspired by Left 4 Dead. World War Z: Aftermath modernizes the genre by making it prettier and third person. Some highlights include the variety of maps and animations of the zombie hordes moving through the terrain whether it being jumping off buildings or climbing up. There is some replayability with progression through character classes and weapons.

Unfortunately, some parts are worse than Left 4 Dead like the readability of special infected due to the lack of sound cues and specials spawning too close to the survivors. There are too many characters in the game which lead to undeveloped characters as well as the lack of easy class identification in multiplayer. My biggest regret with World War Z is that it doesn't include workshop content for modded maps which vastly hurts the replayability of this game for me. The Ai is also shockingly bad, recommend playing with other people.

The game does a fantastic job at providing a larger than life ""it's us vs them"" experience. First off, if you have a group of friends you can play with I strongly recommend playing it that way. 3 players and 1 A.I. is enough, 4 players is best. The first time you see the hordes your jaw will drop, and the terror of it all, as well as the hype, is great when sharing it with a group of people you know. Just when you thought the devs exaggerated it as far as it can go, they'll make you go ""no way...that's craaazy lol"" again and again. Standing back to back with your team and seeing that you're outnumbered a gazillion to one is exhilarating.

The game is pretty easy on normal difficulty so we played out the story on hard mode, which is also far from the hardest difficulty. If you're looking for a challenge I assure you, this game can get pretty brutal and frustrating. Between grinding your class for perks/weapons in horde mode and the campaign alone, there's a lot of content here already. I haven't touched any of the multiplayer modes. Only hordes for grinding prestige to get all of my perks and story mode have provided me with 69 hours of gameplay. Pretty decent for $40 if you ask me, even better on sale.

There's not much in the way of bugs other than one or two enemy specific bugs we've encountered only when the game is on hard mode. Outside of that the game runs great. Some of us had high-end rigs, others with low end laptops with iGPUs. Everyone was able to get a stable, high frame rate experience, while making adjustments to the graphic settings of course. I'm glad the devs plan to release a new horde mode soon. Looking forward to that and extending the time I spend with the game. It's a really fun PvE co-op.",1641823148,1641823148,True,1,0,0.496867179870605469,0,True,False,False

Graphics - On Linux they are GREAT colors, sharpness... on Window well it's Windows. :)
In Linux with BETTER graphics my 2080 TI runs 35 to 37C in Windows with it's horrid colors runs 65 to 68C

Profiles -  One new one ""Vanguard"" Yeah it sucks lol the rest are the same.
Rank - looks like the max is still only 999 yep that sucks also.

Characters - Yep there are new one's so there are tons of them. And you can do first person which is a huge PLUS, but you still can't choose a character and just use that one all the time. You still can't have two people using the same one. So someone will be stuck using the one's they don't like. You're still stuck with the characters per mission. 

Beaching Charges - There does seem to be more of them but the rooms have a lot less in them almost not worth using until the end.

Horde mode - Is unchanged they really should add a few more horde mode maps. LOL Well more then ONE.

Special infected - Seem really easy on easy and normal and jump way up on hard. And do more damage then the old game. The gas guys are the worst for me I can't run fast enough to escape the damage.

Guns - Same as before very few good guns to find and if you find one no else on the team will. And you only rank them until you buy (with game money) the next level. So if I find it I use it then drop it so someone else can rank it up. There are two new guns I think ""Light Machine Gun"" primary and ""Special Sub Machine Gun"" also primary. But like I said on hard or above (where you need it) good luck finding one. And if someone does IT WILL BE THE ONLY ONE. :)

AI Bots - They are still really bad, if two people are playing both bots will always follow one person. They still stand right in front of you when you shoot, stand in front of mounted guns. Then of course you need to move around to shoot or just shoot the bots. I play with bots 50% of the time and they are hard to keep healed and alive! LOL

Edit Rank: (Added 12-30-2021)
Well they didn't upgrade the rank you still max out at 999. So if you play all the profiles you max out about level 5 prestige 4. If you take all the profiles to prestige 5 level 30 you won't know what level you really are.

Still ONLY ONE horde map :( raise the rank, add two or three more horde maps PLEASE. :)

The new daily challenges are great, you earn the BLUE LOL they are harder then the regular matches. But they do mostly old maps. 

If you like zombie games Left-4-dead, liked the original World War Z you will like this one. It seems to have a lot less problems on Steam then it did on Epic. Joining friends is super easy, download speeds and updating speed are SO MUCH BETTER ON STEAM and if you're on Linux ZOOM.

Steam has steam play which runs most Windows games in Linux. And the sad part they look better, run faster, have higher FPS, cooler video card temps... in Linux using wine for windows then they do in windows. (THANKS STEAM) Not to mention download and drive speeds in Linux compared to Windows LOL Windows is a joke.

The game ran OK in Xubuntu 20.04 before the big update. After the big update it runs PERFECT! If you haven't gamed on Linux you should give it a try. You won't believe how much better gaming on Linux is then trying to game on Windows. :)",1634700474,1640898088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best selling point this game has is the amount of zekes that can spawn on screen at any given time; but they made this even better with an optimization like no other. With all those animations and physics on screen, this game has never stuttered, and only crashed a couple of times, and I have the Epic release as well.

I don't like the addition of rats in this, but they make the game more challenging when you're a former player from the Epic release.

The FPS mode, like most would say, seems like an afterthought - it doesn't have ADS, just a simple ""zoom in"" with your view.

The levels have a lot of different objectives to do but most are defending some helpless survivors against an insane amount of zombies. The locations in the levels are really cool by themselves too. Some of the classes in the game have pretty cool perks that set them apart from each other. My favorite being Vanguard which can charge into the horde and not care or draw aggro from the team by blocking hits. Getting the prestige perks requires a lot of grinding though so I dont really care to much about that aspect of the game. I was surprised at all the playable characters and thought it was shame they're not available in every campaign but at least Survival mode gives you that option.,1639781115,1639781115,True,2,0,0.539647579193115234,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------Why :
Great L4d experience , with a new focus on hordes rather than larger bullet sponges. Experience (RPG)system works great(feels good to me)! I guess its a grind but I enjoy it!  Aftermath brought a few more campaigns, that were decent enough;  You can easily play this all night! 

Maps are pretty good too – Linear as they are - there is a reasonable amount of variety and many are interesting even if you have played them several times; with the odd secret here and there.  There are other dynamics, such as planting defenses and finding items that help along the way, as well as items to boost your xp points.

Generic zombie types, but are done well, i.e. how the bull or infecter work - both need prioritising, and well if two hit at a good time and your team sucks, then someone will likely die!

However, the creative aspect of the game is so soulless it hurts the game very badly,  to the point that it makes me question why I play it - apart from the grind!  The story is pretty ^&*% and I don't find anything interesting about the characters at all.  The lines and battle chatter are trash (let alone the accents!!! Haha!).

 The music is there to be turned off.

There are issues (as I saw reviewers mention) with aftermath, and this is not even a through review:
-Look to iron sights is not what it should be , its just a sort of change of FOV, and doesn't look great!
-network problems with matchmaking and game hosting servers = dc from session every so often.

Other issues I found:

-Some noobie players joining sessions, who play so bad, that I cannot describe it any less than trolling (most are console players – I'm sorry this is the truth!) 
-These same people sit in lobby before the game starts, walk off for 10 mins sometimes, this is after we just played a map, and they did the same thing last time... 
-Bad optimisation : at times,  I am getting Fps jumps which drops frame rate to <60fps when it should be 120fps(at times).
-monitor focus needs changing most times i start the game up - it seems to lose track of the monitor numbers(multi-monitor set-)ups
-I dare you to turn the battle chatter off(or dialogue).  The game is just guns and the odd zombie grunt.

I want to start off by saying I wouldn't've known about this game unless Back 4 Blood existed. I played the Back 4 Blood Beta, game was iffy and too overpriced, so this was the next best option. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase, I was looking for a decent zombie shooter and here it was, better than I expected.

As of writing this review, I've beaten every episode and every chapter at least four or five times over, I've maxed two classes, and obtained several level 5 weapons. From what I've gotten out of this game thus far, it's everything I could have hoped for. This game is what happens when you mix Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Borderlands with Warhammer: Vermintide 2. Keep in mind I also own the DLC, which may alter my opinion.

[h1] Review [/h1]

Similar to both games mentioned above, the gameplay is fiercely satisfying, addicting and varied. The immense amount of variety in the weapons is welcome, and the weapon leveling system is superb. Most guns are very satisfying to fire, each having their own playstyle. Heavy weapons are very helpful in a tight pinch, and also very effective against hordes. Not to mention, they're very fun to fire with the immense amount of bodies and particles most of them generate after use. You can toggle between thirdperson and firstperson, both have their merits, though this game is clearly designed with thirdperson in mind, which is in no way a downside.

Melee weapons are fairly limited, though with what is provided, there's a lot of interesting combinations. However, the fact that all melee weapons are automatically available makes a huge amount of the melee roster useless (i.e. the Machete, which has no perks.). Locking more of the melee weapons probably would've been a great idea for a sense of progression.

All weapon drops are randomly placed, and tucked away in crates or out in the open. Weapon tiers range from 1 to 3, excluding heavy weapons. Tiers don't typically matter for secondary weapons, though they are vital for primary weapons. All loot is up to chance, which is why there are perks to start with certain weapons; though these perks are partially useless in the grand scheme of things. Like in Vermintide, this game has unique pickups throughout the level which grant bonus experience and currency at the end of the mission. Defense kits are also a very fun mechanic, which almost partially turns the game into an RTS.

Unlike a good amount of zombie titles, this game has eight different classes to choose from, all independent from the actual characters. All classes offer different playstyle choices, classes such as Dronemaster offer a more pet-orientated playstyle for self-protection, while Medic is pure team support. Vanguard is a tank class, while the Gunslinger makes for an excellent DPS class. There's plenty of strategy that comes with picking the right class and perks for a situation, especially in a team. A lot of the perks help make the game much easier, such as double damage, extra equipment, better gear and less friendly fire. Experience is also very easy to come by, as even if you lose a mission, you still gain class experience, weapon experience, challenge coins if you completed a challenge, and currency; meaning you don't feel terrible for dying at the very end of the level, since you still get pretty much everything you would've gotten anyway if not a little less.

The Zeke (zombies) are lots of fun, they act just as they do in the book and the movie, with minor differences. Zeke still tower over each other, they can surround and incapacitate you if you are left alone, they can infect you in certain circumstances, and you also become a Zeke if you die. Not to mention, like in the book and movie, they are attracted to sound. This level of detail is seldom seen in other zombie games, which is partly why I admire the amount they've put into this. The Special Infected are also quite interesting, some are obvious, others are less so. The infector can be hard to see in certain circumstances, while infected like the Bull, Gasbag or Reeker are very easy to identify. Lurkers are almost too quiet in hordes, but are very obvious when alone or with the ""Seek and Destroy"" perk, which auto marks specials.

Another part of this game is the NPCs in the world. Unlike Vermintide or L4D2, WWZ:A has in-game full NPCs and scripted actors that help flesh out the world considerably. As a side note, most NPCs can also turn into Zeke, more nuance that I didn't know I needed. It is so satisfying to both keep these NPCs alive, and watch them turn into zombies. These NPCs are as effective as Survivor AI, only they go down a lot quicker.

As for the Survivor AI, they need some serious work. As in most games, the built-in Survivor AIs in this game are as useful as a broken pencil. If you plan on playing this game singleplayer, keep in mind the AI will struggle to save you in most situations. The bots don't pick up heavy weapons, medkits, defense kits, breaching charges or virus samples. Bots also don't mount onto turrets, and they also don't replenish auto turrets. Bots also default to a level 1 gunslinger, and do not have grenades to throw or any perks to speak of. They also don't have good priorities, and will likely shoot at the nearest special infected instead of protecting the objective with a fail condition of 50 seconds (or less in higher difficulties), resulting in one player versus 1,000 Zeke on a gate; not a good combination.

One aspect that's positive about the AI in this game, is that their weapons will slowly upgrade themselves as you progress through the level, meaning they aren't stuck with the base weapons, even if the weapons are level 1. Bots also take up positions during a crescendo event, meaning they have fixed locations they can stand at which benefit towards the overall defense; instead of crowding around you. This is especially helpful if you're breaching a door while the crescendo event is still happening, the bots can fend off a horde well enough. However one downside to this is you're ultimately left alone, and a very easy target for Lurkers or Bulls. One negative aspect to round this off, is that bots [i] walk [/i] to where you are if you're being attacked, and will only sprint if you're a very far distance away. Even then, it'll still be too late for the bot to save you.

In terms of customization, there are [i] no microtransactions as of writing this review. [/i] All cosmetics in this game are unlocked via Challenge Coins, which are obtained by playing Weekly and Daily challenges. There is a surprisingly low amount of cosmetics, but I have a feeling more will be added.

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]

This game has it's flaws, but that doesn't make it a bad game by any means. The levels and scattered loot gives for a unique and replayable experience, especially accounting for class perks and the unpredictability of the director. The zombies are wild and overwhelming in a very good way, making it not only challenging, but adrenaline pumping. Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10, I got my money's worth, and I'll be playing this one for a while I reckon. If you want a great action zombie shooter that isn't 60 to 100 USD, then this is the game for you.",1638380614,1638380614,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But in all seriousness, the gameplay feels like Left 4 Dead 2 mixed with a class system and customization similar to Killing Floor 2. Unlike the L4D games, replaying levels now has a purpose since World War Z has a progression system for upgrading weapons and class abilities. The game experience is borderline surreal with the amount of zombies which get thrown at you in a defense objective. This is perhaps the only ""game based on a movie"" which manages to far surpass its source material.

Pros:
- Any weapons you find in game will always be equipped with the upgrades which you unlock/select from the main menu.
- Game is well optimized and smooth despite rendering a literal flood of zombies (like thousands attacking at once) during defense objectives. 
- Class customization for different play styles. Different classes have access to different equipment and roles, but anyone can use anything they find in the area.
- Defense waves allow you to place obstacles, fortifications, and stationary weaponry (turrets/mortars) with devastating effect. This equipment is randomized and scattered throughout the level before you reach a defense area, so you'll have to improvise and think about smart placement based upon whatever you've got.
- Hellraiser. I only have one question for you: Explosions? The answer is always YES.

Cons:
- First person mode doesn't allow you to aim down sights. Most weapon models aren't designed to be aimed in first person unless it's a long ranged weapon, similar to L4D or Counter-Strike.
Gun enthusiasts may question their sanity upon witnessing the upgraded variants of the double barrel shotgun.

The game plays out just like the movie with hordes of Zeds running at you. Levels are well thought out and the gun play is well done - lots to choose from in the latter, too.

Beyond the major world locations (New York, Tokyo, Moscow, etc), there are about three chapters within each to help extend gameplay for dozens of hours - this alongside Quickplay and Horde Mode options. Beyond these you can level your individual classes, of which there are at least eight or so, and each individual weapon type - of which there are plenty from pistols and SMGs to battle rifles and assault.

So, as someone who put in 100hrs the week of B4B release, I wanted to check out THIS game and see what it was like.  The other reviews for THIS made me excited to kill more zombies.  Since I had actually played B4B, I thought I could give an honest review comparing the two as well seeing as most other reviews just had one sentence saying ""this was better than b4b"" without any real detail or explanation. This review will be in 2 parts and the first part will be First Impressions, meaning the first hour of game play, general overview with more focus on cosmetic design than detailed game play.  My second impression will focus on more of the technical aspects of the game as I give it another go!

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

ZEKES/RIDDEN: I was NOT, in fact, blown away by this game as I had been in B4B.  I was actually bored of it by the end of one chapter and with 41 minutes of game play.  The graphics are good, but I found the Zeke's to be boring.  You have way more Zeke's than you do Ridden (Minus a Horde) but there is no definition or detail to the Zekes that make the Ridden fun and unique. I'm a sucker for details but not everyone else is, and I get that so don't come for me!  B4B also has more unique ridden with different characteristics that make them their own powerhouse and super dangerous if you get a horde of specials rocking your way.  I found on my INITIAL play through that WWZ lacks this which again had me bored.

CHARACTERS: You get MORE characters to choose from in WWZ but I did have some difficulties in choosing a character that I liked and wanted to explore when starting a chapter. This can very well be user error, but B4B definitely has an easier way in which to choose what character to play and how to customize it.  WWZ beats them on # of playable characters, however, and I do LOVE a good variety!

POV Toggle: I prefer first person, and it was a pain to figure out how to acquire that view in game. I had a friend help me and cover for me so I could switch over mid chapter to First person view and be able to actually get sh*t done!

MAP: I do love how you are not restricted to one map in regards to you are not limited to one city and it's general area as what you experience in B4B.  I did like this very much and the map I did play on my First Impression was beautifully made.  The run down mall in the frozen hell landscape was perfection.  

WEAPONS: In B4B you can customize weapons with various mods to upgrade it and you have different level of weapons pre modded that impact damage dealt.  In WWZ, you don't have to worry about mods, you grab your guns and you go, go, go.  I love the modded aspect of B4B, but that does tend to slow you down when you are on a map and you are trying to switch out guns AND keep your mods.  So, not having to worry about it during a game is a perk. I did find it strange the way you have to choose and rotate through what weapons you want to use.  I love to run mielee and it was annoying to have to keep hitting F over and over to slash and dash zekes and not be able to keep out my mielee weapon.  Again, this is a first impression review as the game is laid out without tweaking so don't come at me.  I plan to try and tweak and edit my settings to make it an easier handling for weapons with my next shot. 

OBJECTIVES: Based ONLY on first chapter play through, WWZ is you bunker down and protect an area where ""mostly"" in B4b, you are running and clearing out an entire map WITH predetermined objectives laid out at the beginning of the round (Minus the Bar and Dinner).  More defensive (in WWZ)  than offensive game play (as in B4B) across a map.  

**NOTE: I did not watch any play through of WWZ or B4B prior to playing either game.  This limits me to only what I have done so far but also allows for an unbiased review based on MY preferences/experiences**",1638113648,1638113648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, despite Back 4 Blood being the ""spiritual successor"" to Left 4 Dead and such, being made by the original L4D studio, that game is very poorly made and under developed, the new additions are cool but not as fulfilling, while World War Z did. WWZ feels like L4D on steroids, and that is in the literal sense.

Small encounters around the map feels exactly like when I played L4D, albeit not as a horror vibe as L4D. You have Lurkers which are essentially weaker Hunters scattered around, you have the Bull which is a more bullshit version of the Charger, you have stuff like Gasbag, Infector (which is a much more dangerous Spitter since it can instakill you in certain situation) and more. The special infected in the game is not that varied and not that ""special"", but I appreciated the effort. They posed actual challenges in certain maps and not so in the others, but still, a fun novelty. Except for some special infected that are actually different from L4D like the screamer, sneaky beaky bastards who call in hordes of infected and stand in obscure sights, or the Rats who is stupidly strong to the point of multiple frag grenades must be used to kill just one, these are just really really imbalanced (good thing they fixed it the last patch). Normal infecteds are cool too, you can also see the individual detailed differences between each infected of each region in the world (like normal infected in Tokyo looked more like Japanese than the infected in like Moscow for example) and such. Overall the ""normal"" gameplay is very good.

Then we get to the meat and potatoes of the game: the horde mode. every checkpoint there will be a huge swarm spawn in waves to drown the survivors and the millitary, and oh boy, this is the one thing that sold many people on the game, and frankly me too. The Hordes are terrifying, overwhelming and really satisfying to take down. Although 90% of them are normal infected, that doesn't mean they are weak if you have large firearms or setup a ton of autoturrets and machineguns - make no mistake, they ARE STRONG and will defeat you in a flash if you are not careful enough and work with your team. The designs of the horde spawn and the mechanism surrounds them - the sheer amount of zombies, the defensive kits you have to setup around the chokepoint of the swarm, not to mention, each and every chokepoint is essentially made to be like a warzone, and military dudes despite very useless in helping you defend stuff (most of the time they will all be overrun by zombies and be infected themselves) their shoutouts and battle cries really helped set up the mood for the situation, made you feel a lot more like you are actually fighting a World War against Zombies, not just ""four immortal infected with guns mow down zombies"" like Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood.

The perks and class systems in the game are also very well-designed... for the most part. We have ridiculously overpowered classes like the Fixer, the Hellraiser or the Vanguard, and utter useless classes like Slasher. After the buff came with Aftermath the melee combat and thus Slasher builds are a bit better but not enough. while the Vanguard is still too strong and Fixers/Medics are a must in high-level maps. Saber Interactive actually acknowledged a lot of this and constantly fix and rebalance stuff behind the scenes, so that is a plus, but seriously this system needed a lot of revision.

With the recent Daily Challenges/Missions and Weekly Challenges update to the game, this became the real motivation for me to write a review on this game. I was gonna leave a Not Recommended mark on this game until this came out. Daily Challenges and Weekly Challenges presented a truly infinitely replayable experience to the game, that made the game really interesting to play each time and fun to mess around with friends or on your own now. Before, when me and my friends were done with all the maps, we called it quits and move on to other games since we have nothing left to do, the aspect of grinding the perks system was not that appealing to us since without proper challenge, the game is really boring after a while. This changes that - each playthrough now feels different and the amount of challenge tags are vast, with hundreds of possible combination each playthrough. And it refreshes quickly - once a challenge done, another instantly took its place, so you can essentially play it all day without getting bored.

Overall, this game is now a 9/10 for me. The graphics, the setting, the story and the gameplay are all good, and fun to play alone and with friends. Heck, the story of the game even expanded on the shitty Brad Pitt movie lore which is an achievement in and of itself :)",1638088102,1638088102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(+) Good map design, some map like Japan area is really well made.
(+) Weapon variety, not the best on market but it's okay.

Gray:
(?) First person mode, good addition but it's not well made. right click aim is just zooming in the view. But i guess it's okay for last minute addition to game. And don't make me start talking about how rushed the gun animation in first person mode.

Cons
(-) Weapon progression, higher tier of same weapon add fixed parts to the weapon, instead of allowing us to customize it manually. It's 2021 and that kind of mechanic is quite outdated.
(-) Clunky control on 3rd person mode, some people will defend it, but in my opinion the movement is not snappy at all. You can't ignore this fact once you realized how bad the control is. Making the game not enjoyable.
(-) Zombies sliding when running in a horde.
(-) Not enough progression loop to keep people engaged to game.

However B4B was well beyond my disappointment(that's another story) and it's too damn expensive, the price doesn't matches it's content(Ok enough of digression). This game has less than half price of B4B and comes with good amount of content that deserves the price. With 8 classes in total in PvE mode, different skills to pick in each class so you can build it to best suit the team. Weapon upgrade system, with special reward after prestige.(Leveling up class) 7 episodes with 3 maps in each individual which provides long enough game play. Setting up defence with random kit you find. Remarkable characters and voice acting. Now let's talk about the flaws. Biggest issue is low player base, and there isn't a lobby list like in L4D2 or Payday 2, so it takes some time to wait until you can find player(s) to join or someone joins you. The equipment is extremely unresponsive, the extreme case is shield, it refuse to work when I desperate need it, and got me into trouble a couple of times. Other equipments is not as ridiculous as this one but have some kind of input delay which can be annoying. Some of the maps are annoying, such as in Kamchatka, when saving the Russian, you will have to withstand the earrape of someone screaming: Dima, Dima, Dima. Another one is the power substation, because who on Earth puts the important switches scatter around in random place? After all it's still a good game and I definitely recommend it, we definitely need more players, and I am hoping that more contents will be adding in the future.

If you were playing on Epic Launcher since the old World War Z, remember to covert your save file to Steam, the old game's save works with the new game. As for how to do it, there're guides out there already.",1637847277,1637848118,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

-Story so far is good, every chapter contain move here and then defend the area and so on. and there's NPC that sometimes help you defend make the game feels alive.
-when you see the swarm of the zombie in the open area you feel like ""Whoaaa holy shit that's a lot to take care of haha"", they stack to reach high place to come for you just like in the movie.
-these map has random items and sometimes random 2 path so you don't go through the same path as you play before.
-there are multiple difficulty to choose.
-A lot of character for each scenario with skins customization.
-Multiple Upgradeable weapons with leveling systems to unlock the upgrade.
-Multiple Class to choose with Leveling systems to unlock the next perk.
-there are Challenge which rewarded a coin for purchasing skins or charm.
-PVP are available too but people tend to play PVE.
-the price is actually cheap for this much content in my country (12 USD regular price)

the bad is:
-the zombie animations kinda weird but i'm fine with that.
-you can't keep your weapons after finishing a chapter, mean that you must looking for another weapons when starting a new chapter per episodes but you already have starter weapons depend on your chosen class.
-No checkpoint, when you fought hard and made it to the end but you die in the end you gonna start from beginning of that chapter but i'm fine with that
-The AI bots are stupid. play with friends is recommended

This game is really fun with friends, and it's different than Left 4 dead or Back 4 blood, it has its own style.
if you really like zombie shooter kinda game then this is for you and it's cheaper than Back 4 Blood.
it really blew my mind turns out that this game better than i expected when it release on EPIC and the steam version already contain all of the DLC except the weapon packs.

Overall 8.5/10

The enjoyment I got out of this game was minimal. Basically different maps to throw hordes at you. Only the hordes aren't real, mostly. The hordes you can kill and that matter, spawn right at the gate or points where you're meant to defend against them. They did a good job of making it look like you're fighting mobs of zombies, but it just gets repetitive quick and the strategy to kill them is the same: electrify fence, post auto-sentry, throw grenades and shoot. Really, it felt very much like L4D2 except the hordes of zombies.

World War Z: Aftermath is the ultimate co-op zombie shooter based on the blockbuster film, and the next evolution of the original hit World War Z game. Turn the tide of the zombie apocalypse with up to three friends (in cross-play multiplayer for all supported platforms) or play on your own with AI teammates against hordes of ravenous zombies in intense story episodes across new zombie-ravaged locations around the world: Rome, Vatican City and Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula.

That is the only thing I would like to see, some type of rewards for how well you do. I know others prefer the more L4D style no nonsense gameplay. Just make it through the stage and survive. Like that game however I dont see us playing it constantly, just only when we get bored and want some quick fun. Otherwise thats the only con imo.

Too grindy with barely enough content to do. If I bought this game when it came out it'd probably one of the lowest rated for me personally. Good thing it came out after years of being EGS exclusive to steam with 2 expansions (barely qualified to call it, one new campaign and one new class per expansion).

The recent patch introduced new challenges (dailies and weeklies) but even queueing takes too long to do them. Some of the challenges aren't balanced (some are too difficult while others aren't even a challenge) and the queue reflects that. ""Premium"" coins still aren't that much rewarding considering the slog you have to go through to earn them. Probably a PTW model that got ""implemented"" as is during dev's interregnum last year (Saber interactive being acquired by THQ Nordic).

The BOT AI is absolutely atrocious. I don't see why they don't invest in this. Even if there is only 1 bot in the team, they can inadvertently cause a wipe because of their poor pathing and bad scripting.

First off, the game is just the base game with a few more episode so the game is worth it if you havent actually purchased WWZ from the epic store which i did. Apparently you are able to transfer your progression from Epic to Steam by copying and pasting the files from epic to steam which i was unaware before asking for a refund.

Even with the progression transfer, i believe the game is still not worth the 45 Dollar (CAD) price tag. Wish this game had an option to ""upgrade"" for a cheaper price where all you have to do is locate the .exe file for World War Z and it would allow you to install. Which im sure its impossible how games are today.

Story 7/10
You will play the one of the four people who are the skilled survivor in the campaign that set in all over the world, you have to fight a horde of zombies and complete the objective. I've played like a lot of co-op stuff, it is kind of common to me, but at least it has a little bit of campaign to follow up, it's kinda like you watch series that's not beautiful, but it is interesting and keep you comeback to watch some more, in steam it will bundled the main game into the dlcs of new campaign, character, guns that I found it really fair enough.
Activity 7/10
Follow the objective, shoot down a horde, casual, but it is not boring. All you have to do is grab the weapons that will be better as that mission process or you can take the tier III weapons by luck, clear through the horde of the dead, doing mission, receive exp and rewards, then do it all over again. For the person who found this very repetitive, you may get bored so fast, but at least it is fun for the time when you change the class and expect the a little bit of refreshment and new strategies to play.
Gameplay  8/10
This game will bring the half of RPG aspect, your level is not affect the damage to zombies(Or if you unlock some skill that affect on specific type of guns) skill make you survive longer in the harder difficulty, reload gun faster, Gun experience for new attachment to the gun that you use, or especially give you a chance to counter the special type of zombies that can put you down in one shot, with many class you can be, it bring many variation of playstyle. This version will also add more class(Well...only ONE class) and guns, so don't worry about being bored of the content for a while. Additionally, they fix the reloading sound too, after I have to listen the same sound when I reload my pistol and Assault Rifle in the same time.

i don't found the First person mode is effective, you will get grabbed by the special zombies from the corner easily, which is very irritating to play.

For me, this game is not a remastered, it's like a patch-up of what they should have in the main game.

The number of zombies this game throws at you is insanely fun, and it doesn't seem to ever get old. 

There's an impressive variety of weapons, from secondary sidearms, to primary rifles, and even special elite weapons (such as RPG rockets and flamethrowers) you can find spread out randomly throughout the levels. You can also spend experience points you earn from playing to upgrade your weapons and purchase special kits to modify them, all changing the weapon performance characteristics in different ways.

The coop campaign progression is refreshing in its stylistic creativity and its diverse range of atmospheres. The campaign, which offers up to 4 player cooperative play, consists of multiple ""episodes"" in a series leading to the ultimate finale (similar to Left 4 Dead campaigns). However, this game's campaign is significantly longer than those found in the Left 4 Dead games. In World War Z: Aftermath, each individual ""episode"" is comprised of multiple levels. So depending the difficulty you choose, this campaign could easily offer 30+ hours of intensely action-packed and mostly original game play.  

To add even more replayability to the game, it also offers a variety of character classes, each with their own perks you can unlock as you gain experience. You could be a medic class with bonuses and special health abilities, or even a drone specialist with a flying autoturret that essentially hovers around you and kills zombies.

Each level has at least one major event where you open a gate or initiate an alarm, which triggers a massive horde to attack. When I say ""massive,"" I mean FREAKIN' MASSIVE! Much like the movie this game was inspired by, you will literally see hundreds of zombies piling on each other to climbs walls and barriers to get to you and your team. In some levels, your teammates could literally tally over a thousand zombie kills. Thankfully, these absurdly insane numbers of zombies are well balanced by the simply bad-ass weapons at your disposal.

Honestly guys, I've never seen so many zombies coming at me at one time in any video game. The bloody adrenaline pumping carnage in this game will hook you in no time. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually having a hard time finding friends to get the game. Friend or not, if you enjoy zombie shooters, this is a no freakin' brainer. 

To be fair, I've only played this for roughly 5 hours so far, and I've only played through the first episode, but I feel confident in giving this game a rare 10 out of 10.

This game is everything that I wanted [i]Aliens: Fireteam Elite[/i] to be. It's fast paced with plenty of weapon and class customization. The locations are beautiful and varied. The zombies are overwhelming and relentless. Now that I have this mini introduction out of the way let's take a deeper dive into the game. 

[h1] The Graphics [/h1]

While the graphics aren't exactly mind blowing they're more than decent. The textures, character, and gun models all look good. The zombies have a variety of models and it took me a while to start noticing repeated models. My only real gripe with character models is the special infected. To be quite frank they're kind of lackluster, Unlike Left 4 Dead, which has pretty distinct models for specials, WWZ's specials are hard to pick out in the relentless mass of undead that's almost constantly trying to eat your face. Although that issue is somewhat alleviated by the Gunslinger perk that outlines special infected in red. To give you some idea of how this game performs, I have a 2070 Super in the DX11 API with ultra settings I'm usually getting a wide range of framerates. I can bounce around from 70 to 100ish FPS.. Unfortunately this game does not support DLSS. However, in the Vulkan API with AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (Quality Preset) I’m easily able to get 144+ FPS. I really wasn’t expecting such a big boost from FidelityFX Super Resolution. If you’re having FPS issues I highly suggest giving it a shot. Overall, I’d say that the graphics are good, maybe even great, but not amazing. I almost forgot to mention it but I’m playing at 1440P for anyone curious)


[h1] The Story [/h1]

This section is going to be much shorter than the previous. Most games of this nature have some threadbare narrative that tenuously connects the missions together. This game is no different. At the start of each campaign mission there is a short cutscene that gives a brief explanation of the current status of whatever area you find yourself in. Upon successful completion of your current mission there will be another short cutscene to wrap up the mission you’re on. This is fairly standard for a game like WWZ. Basically every horde mode type game I’ve ever played has done something similar. 

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]

[i]World War Z[/i] can be played in first or third person if you have the [i]Aftermath[/i] edition of the game which since this is a review for [i]Aftermath[/i], I obviously do. While I don’t agree with the idea of locking a view point behind a paywall, this is a view of the game and not the actual developer. To be frank, I’ve played this game exclusively in first person. The bread and butter of [i]World War Z[/i] is obviously going to be it’s gunplay. Thus far in my 26 hours of playtime, I feel that the guns feel great to shoot. A large part of this is great sound design. Each gun sounds great when being fired. From the blast of a shotgun to the endless barrage of bullets being fired by a stationary .50 Cal machine gun. Everything sounds fantastic. For the most part, [i]World War Z[/i] feels like any other horde slaying type of game. With a few notable differences. Every so often during a level you’ll run into an area you’ll have to defend against the horde. You’ll find chests with items like automatic turrets, mortars, barbed wire, and electrified panels that you can put on fences or the ground to stun oncoming zombies. This little base building aspect adds an interesting mechanic to the tried and true zombie slaying formula.  [i]World War Z[/i] does offer a solo mode allowing you to play through the campaign solo. However, like every other game in this genre, playing with friends (or even randoms) is almost always better than playing alone.

Furthermore, much like [i]Killing Floor 2[/i] this game has a class system with each class having numerous skill unlocks that can vastly change your experience. For example you can get unlocks that will let you start with a better weapon, more equipment (like grenades, molotov cocktails, drones, etc.), faster reload times, and much more. Each class can be prestiged multiple times with each prestige allowing you access to powerful new skills to unlock. The weapons in this game also have their own levels. Each level of a weapon will allow you to unlock a better version of that weapon. For example if you have a level one assault rifle it will have no attachments. The level 2 version of that assault rifle might have a red dot sight and a muzzle break. The level 3 version might have the red dot sight, a muzzle break, and increased ammo capacity. 

[h1] Optimization [/h1]

The most impressive part about [i]World War Z[/i] is easily the amount of enemies on screen at any given time. During times when the hordes of zombies are swarming at you, there are easily hundreds of hungry undead rushing towards you. Yet, the framerate never dips into unplayable territory. Throw in the numerous explosions causing the undead to ragdoll all over the place and the performance of this game is downright impressive. I’ve had a few server disconnects here and there. Not to mention the occasional long loading time. However, these problems are rare and haven’t been egregious enough to detract from the overall fun experience that this game provides.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

As someone who has always enjoyed this type of gameplay, I’m glad that I took the chance and purchased this game when I saw it on the Steam front page a few weeks ago. I’ve already put 26 hours into this game and I can see myself putting hundreds of hours into it. If you’re looking for a fun horde style shooter to play with a few friends look no further. You’re in for a blast.

You can play it with other people or play solo. The game emphasizes strong teamwork; if you try to Rambo your way through a level, like I did the first time I playing you will die. You need to stay close to your teammates and watch each other's back. I played the entire game solo and bots always saved me when I was pinned down by a zombie and helped me out of trouble. AI of the bots is good. Aftermath retains all the features from the base game, while adding new elements that further enhance the terrifying experience. The new, first-person perspective is a great addition. It brings you closer to the action. There are two brand new co-op story missions to shoot through, set in the Vatican City and Russia’s snowy Kamchatka peninsula. These follow the theme of World War Z’s epic backdrops that host each separate episode in the interconnected, zeke infested world. Each mission looks distinctly unique and fun to play. Classes are the way in which World War Z offers the player customisation, with numerous skills to unlock as you gain experience. 
Weapons also work in a similar way, with you upgrading them in numerous ways as you use them in the co-op campaign episodes. Also, in Aftermath the melee system has had an overhaul. Vanguard is the brand new class available in this update, as well as daily missions offering unique rewards which you can find out more about in the brand new message of the day pop up box in the game menu. World War Z: Aftermath is the most substantial, and impressive update yet. New content and improvements to how the game performs means World War Z has never been in better shape. The question is Is Aftermath worth it? It is if you are a fan World War Z and are looking for more content. The new class is a decent addition and can add a new tactical choice when facing the hordes, while both the episodes of Rome and Kamchatka add a couple more hours of content and more variety for when you're grinding for levels and upgrades. World War Z: Aftermath improves on the base game in a number of ways. Despite the new content only adding a few short hours of gameplay, there are more reasons than ever for players to keep coming back for more.",1634401739,1634401739,True,16,0,0.665835857391357422,0,True,False,False

Suppressed weapons are your best friends here, as the zekes get alerted by loud sounds. 

Player class & the choice of weapons is good. I'm an assault-rifle fanatic & the game has a good assortment of AR weapons. I especially like the AK103 - suppressed.

What I'm not happy with the game is the restriction of the AMD FSR feature to Vulkan API only. There're certain graphical features that only works with the Vulkan API - and that runs worse than the DX11 API.

Hopefully Saber Interactive will implement a future patch to address these issues.

Gunplay/maneuverability is good. My biggest pet peeve is that the game gets stale too quickly, you can play for ~2 hours and feel like you've seen it all. Being a bit of a fan of the grind in games I thought that with the replayability I could easily get a few hundred hours of fun from this game, well the last 30 hours or so have been pretty much a chore and me forcing myself to do one more game and give it another try and my conclusion is this: if you are a solo player, just don't but it, randoms will piss you off and you can not play missions solo, you can play without real people but you will always have teammates in the form of bots, which are either very strong in the campaign or are just dead weight mostly in the horde mode. Think you're gonna like horde mode? You will! But not for a very long time imo, because you will start to realise how bad the average random player is and you will not come past wave 30 whatever you do. That's on easy mode btw. If you have a group of friends to play this with, forget all I said and buy it because it's a great game that gets ruined by randoms and yes it is short but playing it with your friends makes up for it.

Issues I've had:
- Mouse sensitivity can't be fine tuned in the game settings.
- Team bots tend to sit in fixed positions on defensive objective. They won't move, even if they're getting clobbered.
- Team bots are slow to assist, especially on defensive objectives. If you're pinned, only 1 bot will move to you while the others sit back.

Campaign quick matches only seem to fill in slots at peak hours. Only tried a few times, but outside of peak hours I would be waiting an hour or 2 just for 1 new teammate.

That's fine enough, but maps seem pretty short and the gun play feels pretty bad. The audio for guns is weak and unsatisfying even without a silencer. 

It reminds me of OVERKILL's The Walking Dead more than it reminds me of the L4D franchise, and while it's no where close to being as bad as OTWD it's still not a very engaging game. It doesn't help that characters are locked to specific maps, and that gun unlocks are tied to weapons you can't start with or can only start with by buying specific perks that take up a character perk slot.

I've only played cooperative maps though, so perhaps the versus mode is more tolerable but since that isn't why I bought the game I really can't say.

If I could give a middle of the road review, I would, but since it's either a yes or a no I'd have to say no. I'll still play a bit more of this game, but ultimately I doubt I'll be able to tolerate it for more than 100 or so hours.",1633721812,1633721812,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am 28

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.

WW Z is a fun rare beast of a Co-op game as unlike Remnant from the Ashes or Fireteam, It's a four man coop.
Set in the world of the movie and with nods to the tongue in cheek Zombie survival guide it's pretty to look at, sadly a bit dark and almost impossible in places to see Mr Jack Shit BUT it gets a pass as its kinda the setting's thing.
Combat is Fun, be you a actual marksman who can work with a semi auto weapon, a fire spraying noob who loves to rock and roll or somewhere in the middle. Hordes are absolutely terrifying (if somewhat comical depending on your first encounter with one), but they do force you to sit up straight and un-cup your balls.
But the biggest sin of the game from a partial sighted players pov is there is no option to upscale the in game chat that while nice to have, can be easy to miss. For me personally (I have a VERY bad left eye) the minimap might as well not bothered to show up as not only is it in my blind spot but its so small, I can't even see it.
The AI on your partners is also woefully bad with them often wandering into your line of fire or standing next to you while the Bull gives your back a wonderful massage on the hard, debris stricken floor,
The Last complaint I have is you can sweep a area, come back for a weapon to use later and some Zeke creeper has spawned out of spite.

FALSE ADVERTISEMENT 

Full Controller support? More like no controller support, the game has a map out for the buttons on a controller but fails to recognize that a controller is even plugged in. I even restarted my controller, then steam, then my computer and still it didn't recognize that a controller was connected. 

The game couldn't sink up with steam cloud, and the game froze on the first time I ran it. 

The B4B beta was better than this, I say wait for a couple months for them to iron out the bugs then come back. Till then don't buy this game, wait until it goes on discount on Christmas.

Pluses:

+ With Aftermath, the game is fair in length. It is well worth price tag even if you can't wait for a sale (IMPORTANT: it is apparently NOT worth it IF you already own the base World War Z tho, I read in other reviews, as this one only adds 2 locations to the previous 5, if so wait for a big sale). 

+ Fantastic gameplay and level design. Doesn't really get old.

+ The sheer number of zombies rendered on-screen and the fantastic feeling you get both when mowing them down together with your team, or the panic you get when you're about to be overrun (and your last standing team-mate hopefully heroically saves the day!). Great feel all through.

+ The game has a lot of replay value as well thanks to the various classes, difficulty levels, perks and prestige modes. All this means you can find a play style that suits you, and that players can specialize according to their abilities to form a competent team.

+ Seems well-optimized. Played mostly on very high settings and frame rate on my 6 yo gaming desktop and it feels great. AND when I sometimes play on my 3 yo mid-range gaming laptop, the performance is sufficient as well, and it honestly looks pretty great even on the lower settings on the laptop, plus I get a stable 60+ fps.

+ On a random note, if you enjoy Left 4 Dead, or you liked The Last of Us multiplayer on Playstation and you felt that game lacked a co-op mode, I feel like this game is for you.

+ Works well both with mouse and keyboard AND controller. Whatever suits you. Controller settings are so good you can easily compete with mouse players on the scoreboard after some practice.

Tiny gripes of mine:

- Probably best with friends (as with anything...) although the public matchmaking system is more than sufficient. My only wish with the matchmaking is that you could select several maps and difficulties to search for. As it is currently you need to select either one specific map and difficulty to play on, or there is the quickplay option that matches you to ANY map on your selected difficulty. In this way it is a tiny bit clunky and sometimes you got to wait few minutes for a game if you want to play a particular map on a particular difficulty.

- It is obviously designed to be played in third person (which works great for this game!). Third person gives you a bigger FOV and a better feel for your surroundings. But if you are one of those that only plays FPS, you won't be happy as the first person mode feels a bit like a gimmick since you can only aim down sights with the sniper rifle.  You also have to go to the in-game menu to switch between FP and TP, you can't do it with a button press if you are one of those that enjoys that. It is a bit of a shame that they didn't add a FPS mode with ADS, and made it like a separate game mode. I feel like that would add even more replay value (to be fair tho, you already got a lot!).

- There are some sections where you 'see through' the level design when you get a few hours in, and can use it to your advantage, and in other scenarios you feel a bit hindered by it. I feel like I don't want to  expand on that since it might spoil the experience a tiny bit, find out for yourself! This is not really a big deal tho as the level design is overall fantastic.",1633366511,1633366511,True,11,0,0.617557287216186523,0,True,False,False

Rats are always fun to find, but be careful, they are TOO OP at higher Difficulties they are gonna destroy whole your team in 10 seconds if you don´t take them out in a time.

The only downside of this game is the lack of community made maps and no real endgame.

There are quite a few maps, but adding the possibility for players to make maps and sharing them would make this game infinitely replayable!

I had some issues which need to be mentioned.
-several fatal game crashes.
-server connection issues. (unable to connect to server for ~1min, but i can access the internet just as usual)
-stuck in waiting for group member's loading screen
all the above is usually fixed with a game restart.

26.09.2021
seems like the above issues got fixed with the september 23rd patch.
there is just one annoying issue left:
you are unable to remap some default keybinds. for example the scoreboard, it is bound to the tab key but changing it to another key does nothing, it is still usable with tab.

27.09.2021
today i saw the vote kick panel for the first time.
i had no option to vote, no keybind available. after that i tried to find the general menu to vote kick people but could not find it either, must be a console thing, maybe.

28.09.2021
today i unlocked prestige rank 6 because it was available. turns out it gives you nothing, what a fk waste, why is it available then?

talking about the issue with zombie hordes:
-levitating zombies, instead of running.
-zombies flicker, lagging at the same time 
-some just vanish and others just appear out of nowhere
-zombies who totally ignore you and just run pass you
the above issues also lead into character dmg or death.
zombies hit you, but they are a few meters away and or don't even reach out for you (hit animation).
in one of my last game where i died, a zombie just ran past me without visually hitting me. the hitting sound was hearable and i died in just 2-3 seconds

[h1]Guide to copy progress[/h1]

- Head to:

[u]C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Saber\WWZ\client\storage\509380f868fd4399a75020e60a2ad79c\[/u]
Folder after storage (in this case [u]509380f868fd4399a75020e60a2ad79c[/u]) is your unique ID folder and will be named differently.

- Copy file named [i]""user_progression.dat""[/i] into folder:

[u]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata[your user Id]\699130\remote[/u]
This is a default Steam installation folder, it could be different in your case.
User ID is different for each user, normally if there is only one folder so you can’t miss anything
[u]699130[/u] is WWZ Aftermath id it will be identical on all PCs

- Delete old [i]""user_progression.cfg""[/i] created by Steam.
- Rename [i]""user_progression.dat""[/i] into [i]""user_progression.[b]cfg[/b]""[/i].
- Launch WWZ Aftermath on Steam, if you get a popup about cloud saves conflict select local files option.

Don't forget to make a backup of your

I owned WWZ on Epic and never really played it. Just didn't like 3rd person and I prefer my games on Steam. Aftermath is a much better game especially now offering 1st person which IMO is how a game like this should be played. I have played coop but I am most surprised with how well the game plays solo. It is a much better solo game than L4D2 IMO. The game includes AI helper bots as a great addition. Some may say they are dumb, I would say you can say that for all helper AI. They basically follow you and shoot. Not many games like this allow solo progression but this game does. The ""run and gun"" approach didn't work so well for me. I find the game plays better with a somewhat stealth approach with a good weapon and a silencer as the hoards are sometimes activated by loud noises. This makes blowing up a door to get at storage boxes a decision of if it's worth it or not. Many reviews include hate for Epic and/or Steam or the pricing policies and some believe they should have received the Aftermath update for free, not discounted. For me it was well worth the repurchase on Steam.
The game has a Hoard mode with an free XL hoard mode DLC coming later. The current mode is done very well with manageable wave after wave. With each one you have time to set traps which you can buy as you progress.
While the Aftermath version offers first person view, it is a bit underwhelming. There is no ADS or scope view although some rifles have scopes. The right mouse click just causes the First Person view to zoom just a little bit. I sure hope they improve this in the future as sniping zombies is a lot of fun in this game. Also, the game explosions like grenades are very underwhelming. They go off with a dull sound and the damage radios is very small. Very unsatisfying.
Overall, the game is a blast to play and well worth the price of admission.",1632445076,1632924591,True,91,3,0.752281248569488525,9,True,False,False

For owners of the original game: There's 2 new campaigns with 3 maps each, a couple of new guns and melee weapons, one new class and 8 ""new"" characters to play. Reason I say ""new"", is that a lot of them are just original characters in new clothes. I can't really say it's worth it for the asking price. I enjoyed the new maps, but unless you're a hardcore fan, there's really not much new here for what you are paying.

For people who doesn't own the original game: Absolutly worth it. Great coop game with replayability. You have lots of different classes to choose from, many skills to choose from, tons of weapons, great selection of maps and campaigns, differnet game modes, an amazing amount of zombies to kill etc. It basically has everything you need for a great gaming experience, except for servers.

The more I play it, the more it blows other games like this out of the water. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun. If you liked L4D and you haven't or won't give this game a chance, you are a F*****G FOOL! Now go read my review! 

I had to stop playing WWZ for a moment to write this review. Are you looking for a BETTER L4D game? This is it. Honestly, I knew this game was coming out, I didn't know it was already on Epic. I had lost track of the game and forgot about it because I had seen nothing about it on Steam. All of sudden, boom there it was on Steam and I saw mixed reviews. I was concerned but then I read the reviews and it was mostly complaints about regional servers in certain countries. Nothing negative on the U.S. front, so I purchased the game. I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED! 

Pros:
* Better than LFD, this game had a chance to get most of the bugs fixed and add plenty of content while on Epic to make it EASILY worth the price tag on Steam
* It's just PURE fun, I'm just playing it solo atm (which solo mode is actually pretty damn good) so I can figure out each level before I play with others 
* Several difficulty levels
* Horde Mode is fun, lots of play time in this mode
* Many different unique characters
* LOTS and LOTS of weapons and different attachments as well as few different skins for each gun, guns all feel and sound distinctly different while firing them 
* Each time you play the same level, weapon locations are randomized, hidden items are moved. It adds variety to each play through and thus extends replay-ability 
* Multiple different classes you can level with their own unique abilities and perks that are unlocked with exp points
* Each mission has several different chapters that last anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes depending on the difficulty
* Game is visually appealing
* Zombies are FAST, if you've seen the movie you know how fast, several types of different zombies that have different tactics, you often feel overwhelmed and that's pretty darn exciting 

Cons
* Regional server issues
* The WWZ: Aftermath is pretty much the exact same game as the one on Epic but they advertise like it's a brand new game
* AI allies are pretty stupid sometimes, will just stand in your line of fire or be completely useless as you get pinned down by a zombie (fyi, you can't free yourself in those cases and you can easily die if you aren't helped by an ally)
* In solo, it seems all allies are always the same class if there is way to change that I haven't figured it out
* Match making is AWFUL for the co-op missions at least, even if I select quick match most of the time I'm by myself in a lobby. Maybe that's because people are playing the other modes, which is too bad. The co-op missions are the best part of the game imo. 

Not really much on the negative side that I've found so far, but that could change once I start playing with other players. I'll revise or add to my review if need be as I continue to play.

There are some negative things here and there, but what takes the fun out of the game is the ""FAKE"" high rankers. Sure, the game itself is quite a grinding game to max out. Some will resort to the specific grinding loops or even cheat for it. These guys are annoying, especially on Insane/Extreme. Instead of being some good teammates or carries xD, they become the reason for failed runs. So please, if you fall into this group, play on ""lowered diff. with your MAXED out stuffs"" to get knowledges or skills first, before joining higher ones.

+ / - While there's lots of missions to play through featuring characters from across the globe, there's also lots of overlap in mechanics and mission design. They all have almost the same exact pacing from start to finish

+ / - The ability to level and customize classes adds some variety and replayability, but most of the traits and equipment one unlocks doesn't feel terribly effective, and collectively doesn't make any one class seem all that different from another or crucial in any given circumstance. Some of the unique class equipment is actually so poorly thought out that trying to figure out how to effectively use it can lead to swift death. Some of the class trees seem incoherent as well, with late-stage upgrades/unlocks going against the overall design of the class given previous unlocks - and not in a way that allows for more specialized builds. It's just all over the place

- The AI for team mates is terrible. They won't go for objectives, they rarely use their equipment, they won't heal themselves or others. The game is a really poor experience if one tries to solo it

It does some things right, some things mediocre, and some things outright bad. However, the game has garnered a healthy following and I can at least understand why. 

So let me start with what it does good:
-The gunplay is fun, it's very satisfying to shoot most weapons and the feedback is pretty good
-the zombie variety, weird thing to list but, it's nice when every zombie isn't a copy of 3 existing models
-special zombie designs, I love L4D2 but one thing that was a nitpick of mine was that the special infected just existed, there was really no way to connect them to the infection and how they got that way, however, in WWZ, the zombie designs themselves tell you their lore, for example, it's very obvious the bomber is an infected demolitions expert or the screamer was a worker with a mic still connected, it's very grounded world design
-the level variety, not gonna praise it too much but it's a nice change of scenery from fighting zombies in NY to Tokyo to Marseille
-the progression feels fluid and like you're actually earning towards better equipment
-classes actually add some variety to gameplay
-replayability, the game is fairly replayable and you don't feel burnt out playing certain missions again, granted it's not l4d2 replayable, it's still decent

and now the Bad:
-the game is soulless, the game has absolutely no soul of it's own, while it does do some things right, it just doesn't try to distinguish itself from anything other zombie horder shooter
-the characters are awful, they aren't fleshed out and having absolutely nothing interesting about them
-the campaign stories are fairly lacking, granted they didn't need a whole lot of narrative to keep things rolling. the writing for some is just outright bad

Like I said, this isn't a bad game but it isn't a great one either. It's fun but it's not groundbreaking and it's certainly no ""left 4 dead killer"". A lot of people have been attempting to compare this with the upcoming title Back 4 Blood but let me give a bit of impartial advice, dont compare them, they aren't the same and they aren't comparable. I'll probably get both at the end of the day.

I kinda feel that getting WWZ Aftermath is a little bit of a steal because it includes all DLC including/before the Aftermath release for only $39.99. And since I keep getting asked if WWZ is any good I figure why not write a review.

 Game-play wise its your most generic swarm shooter and tower defense. Is it fun? Yes. Every review for any game like this will have something saying its just like L4D so play that instead. And since almost every game/show/movie/song these days is just like another those comments go out the window. Classes can be decent in the right hands and with the right build. Weapons are somewhat satisfying with a couple new additions. The idea of upgrade-able weapon tier is just a bit ridiculous in games these days, especially when the currency used to upgrade is also the same currency you need to get perks and prestige whichever class you prefer. A lot of people want weapon customization, either to make a working weapon that suites their taste or to make a ridiculous fashion statement. The former I can agree with, the latter I couldn't care less but don't look to this game for any of that. Enemies can be irritating at times, or even look laughingly ridiculous when fighting. Lurker flies like a wingless demon with sleep paralysis, and thrashes you like a ditched date on prom night. Bull charges you like a linebacker imitating a sumo wrestler. Infectious Spitter is like that annoying ex that makes you want to take a shower cause you feel dirty being near them. Bomber acts like a cod player trying to pull a stunt from battlefield with C4. Screamer is that trash talker that thinks you won't do anything cause he is far away. Gas Bag is just that friend who farts in a full room and thinks he's funny but because he is in a suit he forgets only he can smell it unless you're dumb enough to poke a hole in it. And the newest addition to the horde is the Rat Swarm, like a swarm of Karen's or other mindless groups of people who harass you for being you or for not seeing things the way they want you to. Pro tip: You might want to bring explosives because that's the only way to get rid of the Rats quickly.

 When it comes to server connections for online play it can be spotty at times. There have been a few times where there were disconnects from just trying to setup a co-op lobby, and though I have yet to experience a connection drop mid-game it can still occur. If this is something that you don't mind then props to you. The AI teammates are just as dumb as I remember, but if you are skilled enough they won't slow you down if you play solo. Just don't forget this game is peer to peer so be prepared for high ping if you aren't host.

 Overall for people who want to see if this game is for them just buy it and play it yourself for an hour. You can always refund it below 2 hours of playtime and within 2 weeks if you don't enjoy it. Games are games, and if its fun its worth it. Almost forgot, since the weaponry has increasing levels there are special unique variants of the weaponry that require Challenge Coins. Challenge Coins are earned from farming Challenge missions that will have random modifiers and only refresh either once a week or once a month. Normal gives you only 100, and hard gives you 350. Bear in mind that most of the unique variants cost 1000 challenge coins and you can only farm the mission twice each difficulty. You can earn them from playing missions on Extreme and Insane but the amount is 15 coins for extreme and 10 coins for insane.  So either be ready to go for a long monotonous grind/wait or be ready use some kind of cheat menu... And if you have to cheat just to get a weapon in a game that should have been easy to get then clearly something is wrong with the games design.",1632410149,1632559753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Shooting zombies is fun, shooting hordes of zombies, that run at you like a tsunami and mowing them down with a stationary LMG or blowing them up with mortars is even more fun. IMO specials(unique types of zombies with some quirks to them) aren't special enough. The audio ques, the sounds they themselves make, how they look, imo not distinct enough, compared to L4D or Vermintide atleast.

A good game to jam out to your favorite playlist and just tear through zombies. Good ol fun mindless shooting that can also be serious when you want it to be. Ton of replayability !!

Breath of fresh air! Takes me back to the good ol days of Payday 2 in a weird way. This game plays very similar to Left 4 Dead with a few differences. One of the biggest differences and one that keeps the game fresh is the good sized variety of guns to pick up and level up and a good variety of perks with varying skills to grind for and unlock. Each perk has different starting weapons which is nice, so youre not left scrambling over the good weapons when going about the level with your teammates. 

When things are working well and your team is cooperating, it is an absolute blast, playing now on hard and it can def be a challenge. Seeing the massive swarms hasnt gotten old and is awesome every time it happens. This game isnt reinvinting the wheel, its just a straight up zombie coop shooter with a nice leveling system.

MY SHORT REVIEW :
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
My review for the game is so simple basically if you played LFD2 or LFD1 its very like the same but with some differences in this version you have something called multiplayer which not only zombies but also other player are you rival to achieve what ordered they are pretty good game modes for this btw.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The CO-OP CAMPAIGN is like LFD2 good old days that you switch between different cities all over the world with all contains 4 scenarios to end each city that you can choose your character with customization before game starting.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Also you have abilities like MEDIC or GUNSLINGER which allows you to switch between roles and they have different benefits and if you play with them and lvl up them you can use in game money to upgrade them for faster and better options.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
You can upgrade the guns when you use them in the matches to buy attachments like silencer or optics but this version offers you special weapon with power. (ALSO SHOOTING WITHOUT SILENCER WAKES ZOMBIES UP)
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
ATTENTION : THIS STEAM VERSION GIVES YOU ALL MAPS ; FIRST PERSON VIEW ; SPECIAL GUNS ; ACCESS TO ALL CHARACTERS and much more.....
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I loved the game personally but it has bad servers sometimes I have so high pings unfortunately.

EDIT : Dont buy if you have epic one upgrade it into aftermatch if you want idk i dont have it on epic and i dont like epic cause im steam fan and epic has alot of country restrictions :(

The major one is classes that let you play the way you want and give you a clear role to perform on the team. And within each class there are different skills that you can unlock as you progress in level. Some of the classes are pretty unique as well, such as the Drone Master which gives you a deployable drone that you can customize with your skills.

There are way more objective types. Defending points, stealthing, bypassing traps, and escort missions are just some of the different objectives I've seen. It's not just running and gunning the entire time, sometimes you take a break to restock your supplies and setup defensive for a coming horde. Defensive turrets and traps can be placed which make these very dynamic.

The zombie hordes are massive. Hundreds of zombies on screen at once. You don't want to get caught out in the open when they bust through the defenses.

You run around and shoot zombies and then hold your position against an army of them while you set up defense, rinse and repeat. There is a little ""stealth"" involved, but don't expect much, it's mostly not drawing attention to yourself by blowing stuff up or not using silencers. Lots of variety in the maps and the enemies have the usual suspects in variety. 

The challenge is just right (plenty of difficulties to choose with mutators if you want). Playing alone is not harder, the AI is using aimbot and you really need that. 

You can choose a class and progression to learn more skills in that class is pretty quick. Lots of weapons to choose and attachments to unlock for them. 

You can change your appearance but it's very limited. 

The optimization is just right (not great but good enough if you tweak the settings). 

The new first person mode is fun, but the game is clearly intended to be played in thirdperson. 

No mods needed so far to make the game more fun/playable. The game allows you to increase the FOV, customize the HUD, has full controller support etc. Also no unnecessary effects like vignette and filmgrain.

The game in itself is in most aspect a standard zombie coop shooter. Tho at the points that let World War Z stand out of the crowd, it REALLY shines.

This mostly mean its hordes, as those hordes are the main focus of the movie and the books. It's just so amazing seeing over 100+ Zombies charging towards you while all you got is ""just"" a assault rifle / shotgun / sniper and so on. It's also equally awesome to just shred those hordes with all the possible defensiv devices / equipments / weapons you can have.

Speaking of that, the weapons are pretty much standard guns you see in most of the current shooter games.
Means you got your assault rifles, shotguns, sniper, machine pistols, pistols you get the idea. 

The equipments however are bound to the current class you are on. So each class has its own equipment which defines them. So you either can have e. g. molotovs, claymores, C4, Stim packs (health boost), ZAP-gun and so on. 
Most of the classes are pretty unique in their playstyle and function in a team. Only a few are a bit blurry in what they can do or should be used for.

Before you fight a incoming horde you have a timer to prepare yourself and fortify your current location. For that you can find defence boxes which can include a stationary machine gun, an electric grid, automatic turrents for example. 

Basically, if you like shooting lots of zombies and burn / nuke / zap / bomb / shred zombies with either smart placed traps, lots of bullets or a good ol' 50 cal. you might love this game too. It does have some issues, but basically every game has some problems or issues anywhere but what they did amazingly well is to catch the theme and feeling of the World War Z universe.",1632415592,1632415709,True,8,0,0.587781429290771484,0,True,False,False

Yet, buying the Aftermath version, you get all content from the original WWZ ( Personally, I did not know that when I bought it :D )

My review is based on my opinion and views on this and the other game I'm going to compare with. 

- Firstly, is it worth the money? Especially with Back 4 Blood coming out soon? 

Yes it is if you have never played this game before and didn't like Back 4 Blood open beta.
Probably, yes if you played it before and liked the original game but wanted more content.
No, if you didn't like WWZ. Don't waste your money and time again

Aftermath adds the FPP mode that adds to the game the feeling of og Left 4 Dead unlike Back 4 Blood that appeared to me as a boring, empty, generic copy-paste version of Left 4 Dead. Soulless, gloomy, dark, and with minimum amnount differences from Left 4 Dead. I was pretty dissapointed when I played the open beta. I know it's from the same developers but I didn't feel Left 4 Dead 3 vibe either.
Anyways, back to WWZ it is brighter and spectacularly amazing game that triggered ''wow'' effect when I saw damn tsunami of zombies rushing to our brains. FPP makes it look like a different game as well. It is not like GTA 5 or RDR2 camera when it is just sticked to the face of the character. No, it is done better here. But I was upset that can't actually aim downsights eve though I had a scope on my gun. 
Two new maps look pretty juicy as well as the characters, weapons, zombies and more. Besides, the new melee weapons; they added an entirely new meele system in Aftermath. They added classes from light to heavy and each melee weapon has its own perks. Now it looks cooler seeing different animations.
All and all we have an entirely new meele weapon overhaul, few new weapon variants, a new Tier 3 gun, and a new class. 

However, there is one thing I dislike about the game and something that has been around there since release is about the bots. If you'replaying solo, you're gonna have a harder time than if you were online. I had to restart a level quite a few times because they constantly died in hordes trying to revive one another. When they all died, I got slammed into the floor by a charger. That is only one of the few cases playing with AI. If you have the option to play online - definitely do it.

Overall, I think WWZ is a pretty good game that gives a lot of fun and tons of different grind out levels and upgrade all of your stuff. I can imagine you could grind out hours and hours in this game. It's more fun fun if you have got some friends  for sure. There is also matchmaking to help you out there as well. I think it's definitely worth the money whether you're paying full price for the full game and have never played it or upgrade the current version as they will continue update it because they're releasing a new special zombie nex month.

There's absolutely nothing different about it, other than you have to start all over again from level 0 on all your classes and unlock all your fun weapons and such all over again.

Some positive reviewers are saying it's ignorance on the part of people who feel scammed by this game, that this is just a re-release on a new platform which happens all the time. 

Hogwash! Nonsense! 

The description of the game on Steam is deliberately misleading. It says, ""World War Z: Aftermath is the ultimate co-op zombie shooter and [b]the next evolution[/b] of the [b]original[/b] hit World War Z..."" 

This makes it sound like a sequel. It is worded to sound like it's a different game. When you say a thing is the [i]evolution[/i] of an [i]original[/i], you're literally saying that that thing has changed over time from the original thing. You're saying the original is still the same, and that this new thing is different. 

Aftermath is no different from regular plain ol' WWZ. They're the same game on different platforms, that is all.

I am actually new to this game.I have heard about it and also tried to download it from the microsoft store,but at that time i had a shitty laptop and could not run this game,and i refunded it.

Now,after i have got a decent pc,i was actually looking forward for this game releasing on steam,as i would anyday prefer to buy it here rather than in the microsoft store.This is a little background info,now for the real review:

GAMEPLAY:
According to my perception,the guns feel really crisp and even when they shoot,they feel satisfying.It does not feel like you are shooting rubber bullets at zombies.Zombies also react to the bullets.The most satisfying thing is also the hitmarkers. When you perform a headshot,the hitmarker is red,indicating instant death for the zombie in your crosshair. The game reacts well to you shooting a zombie.You also can find different weapons as you progress.

REPLAYABILITY
The game has tons of replayability,because there are a lot of perks you can unlock and also different types of guns.You can also customise your character,which is also cool.Even though there are only 7 episodes,they have different chapters,and even if you finish them,you can increase the difficulty of the game and get more rewards at the end.

SINGLEPLAYER
Although this game does not have a dedicated singleplayer mode,you can still play with the bots.The bots are not entirely stupid,but i would give them a stupidity rating of 4/10.I have heard about some people having problems with ping,but i myself play on my own only,so i have no problems.However if you have friends to play with who can also buy the game along with you,i highly recommend it.you can also go fully solo without bots,which is extra challenging.I play on my own because i am the alpha male and i do not need anyone else's help.

PERFORMANCE
I play this on my gaming laptop with a rtx3050ti , and on ultra , i get very good performance, getting around 90-100 fps.If you have a rtx 20 or 30 series card,u can definitely play this on 1440p or even 4k,Even with large hordes,I have not seen any large fps drops,so a great thank you to the devs for optimising the game so well.

SHOULD YOU BUY IT?
well,it depends on you.I have heard of some people buying this because it is on steam,but i am a new player,so i anyway bought it.If you are new to this game,i definitely recommend it over back 4 blood,and it is also way cheaper.Everything feels good about this game.

hence,gigachad recommends this game,and yes.you should buy it.This is an order.",1632296178,1632400533,True,32,2,0.608213067054748535,3,True,False,False

What can be cooler than mowing down a literal wall of flesh hungry rotbags, right? And it has so many different locations, characters, weapons, tactics. It must be a dream come true, isn't it?

But after a few matches I have a few very important things to share. WWZ: Aftermath has a potential to be a great game, but right now it's mediocre at best. As someone with a shitty internet, the whole P2P thing is disastrous if my connection decides to kill itself. But that's a minor complaint and something most players can live with. What I can't forgive is lack of general customization of bots, dull and sometimes stock sounds for weapons and very poor audio work for special infected.

Problem No.1 - Bots are dumb as a sack of bricks.
Sure, they can be useful, but only in killing. The entire map is just babysitting a bunch of level 0 braindead idiots, who can't even navigate correctly. If they are stuck somewhere, they are teleported to you and potentially can fall through a texture. You also can't customize them, give them different classes and other great stuff. They can't even follow simple commands like ""pick this up, refill the turret, hold this position"". If this is not true, please let me know how to, because the menu is a god-awful mess. If it is, then what are they even good for? They are useless! How did a 12-year-old game managed to make a good AI and this one didn't? Probably because they didn't think that someone would actually play with bots and threw it in just for show, but those bots are still part of the game and it needs to be done good.

Problem No.2 - Weapons sound weak and feel like peashooters.
How a weapon sounds and feels impacts overall enjoyment of combat in a game like this. Guns here sound weak and I swear, I heard one or two stock sounds every now and then. This is bad. Bad on so many levels. Just why does .45 ACP pistol sounds like .22 LR? IT'S WEAK. EVERYTHING HERE SOUNDS WEAK.

Problem No.3 - Special Infected lack sound design.
Left 4 Dead did this one great. Vermintide 2 did this one great. WWZ did it this one poorly.
If your game depends on huge hordes of enemies, then for the love of god, do some proper sound and art design for them. WWZ's infected are near impossible to detect in a big crowd. And don't get me started with ""but they made sound design for them, can't you hear it?"". No. I can't. In amidst all the chaos, I can't hear them. Again, L4D did a good job, Vermintide 2 did a good job, but here it seems incomplete.

Problem No.4 - This one is pure nitpicking, but REALLY? We can't place AT LEAST turrets where WE want? We can't pack them up and relocate? Why?

Overall, the game is solid in its own right, but it has so many small inconveniences that just pile up and ruin the fun, so I PERSONALLY cannot recommend this to anyone. My time with it was not an enjoyable experience. But I'll hold off a refund and hope for the best - that Saber will improve on it and make this game into another exceptional horde-shooter.",1632372126,1632372126,False,10,1,0.522832393646240234,0,True,False,False

While using classes to your presence of play style with 8 different chapters to play through as each chapter has 3 episodes/maps to fight through with up-to 4 players.

I've played the original through the Windows store and damn it is just so good sometimes even intense with the amount happening on the screen.
I’m so glad it came to steam for me to jam it out more and to also convince friends to get it as well more easily.

That being said.... the game is pretty great and I've been enjoying the old version for some time.

I'm very interested to see what future updates hold and if there will be some much needed improvements on the lobby handling, cross-play, server locations and vulkan renderer.
Even with them issues i would recommend the game as it is a whole lot of fun with friends and even random players from time to time. The new updates also bring more of a challenge as the AI has become somewhat smarter since the original game so i'd advise paying attention to your surroundings a lot more often.

Overall you'll find yourself spending a lot of time completing all of the campaigns as each usually takes an hour minimum depending on difficulty and player classes/skill.
Not to forget there is also a pretty large grind to get all the weapons and classes upgraded.

I had no expectation of the game when it released, but it quickly grabbed my attention and sated the hunger that I desired for another PVE zombie experience. The game in general follows a simple formula of clearing objectives to progress through each act, essentially building on what Left 4 Dead established. Objectives can range from the classic crescendo events, defending a point, collecting supplies, completing puzzles and so on. 

It sounds simple enough, but there's a lot of enjoyment to be had in the simplicity. Some of my favorite moments are the ones that emphasize proper cooperation and teamwork. For instance on an act in Marseille, one person is required to be on flashlight duty in a pitch black tunnel. Zombies are crowding in from all angles and its their job to properly light and guide everyone through the tunnel. On another act in Russia, you're required to complete puzzles involving switches and generators while making the proper call outs and killing floods of zombies. 

I find the game to be far more enjoyable when playing on the harder difficulties. This is, again, where proper teamwork is a necessity. One can't just sprint throughout the level and solo their way to each objective because sprinting alerts hordes in the area. Weapons also have to be suppressed. Firing an unsuppressed weapon is a quick way to get everyone overwhelmed. Zombies only take a few hits to down you, so it becomes very tense. Other things, like proper positioning and crouching in front of teammates so they don't shoot you in the back of your head, all come together to make the teamwork aspect of the game shine. 

The one thing that really sets this game apart from other zombie PVEs, however, is the sheer amount of zombies that are thrown your way. At any point during a level you could be dealing with droves of hundreds of zombies occupying the screen. One memorable point that stands out to me is seeing 1000s of zombies flood an overpass on the Tokyo act as you prepare to defend the area; those 1000s will eventually accumulate in the area and rush your position. 

Which brings me to performance. The game is very well optimized and runs great on most setups I've seen. When I played the game on my gtx 1080/ i7 8700k on ultra settings and 1080p, the game easily sat at a consistent 144fps. The game far exceeds that on an RTX 3080 currently. There's virtually no fps drops during swarms and the game overall just runs like a charm. 

Overall, WWZ is a game that surprised me. I didn't expect much of it. I didn't have hype for it. I just went in wanting to play a little zombie PVE game and quench my thirst in the drought of that subgenre. I came out pleasantly surprised and addicted for over a year. The game is well made, it looks nice, it runs nice and delivers, in my opinion, a great, cooperative zombie PVE experience. I would say if anyone is looking for that, I would definitely recommend WWZ.

The devs clearly care about this title and are working to improve it. That being said I would still only give it a 7-8/10. Certain components of the game feel half baked at times and could be so much better. 

1) Horde mode, easily one of the best parts of the game but since its release it still only has one small map. This is something that should've been built upon long ago.

2) First Person mode, fun but feels lackluster. Aim down sight and true first person melee/vaulting/interacting would have gone a long way. Lots of actions bring you out of first person mode which is jarring and with all the interesting optics in the game it would have been nice to ADS. Back 4 blood has a far worse gameplay loop but they nailed it with gunplay and completely overshadowed WWZ:As addition of 'first person'. 

3) Rats, do I even need to say anything about this? they're a terrible enemy type and should be removed completely. 

4) Unique weapons, I like that the game offers skinned/unique weapons but they give them to you right at the start and it removes the need to level a good chunk of weapons. I feel like this sucks a lot of the progression out of the game. Like the 'normal' tier 5 variants you should have to progress to unlock them.  

5) Melee combat, could be better the instant lock on teleport fighting is a bit clunky. Left 4 Dead/Back 4 Blood did this better.",1632327811,1632327811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update to review: played a bit more and I'm switching this review from a negative to a positive. I really feel bad for the players with no regional servers since this is honestly a pretty fun game.

To elaborate: a slightly different take on L4D's formula that allows the game to cohabit in the genre rather than feeling like a worse knock-off (looking at you B4B...). Highly enjoyable in coop and the masses of zombies getting mowed down by lots of bullets or explosions is incredibly satisfying. There is a lot of gameplay here for those that want it, weapon and skill trees, horde mode, daily challenges etc. Plenty of missions too and difficulty makes a large difference. 

A caveat to mention: this game IS the older title found on other services like EGS and Gamepass, but with an added 2 mission trees, an FPP mode, updated melee, a new class and some new weapons. In other words, this is functionally a GOTY edition with all the frills (another note - there are a further two DLC that provide weapon skins and a couple of melee weapons that SHOULD have been included in the base price - very cheeky to have them as further DLC). The value proposition on this one will vary depending on how the game was obtained before. I would say for people who own the previous version, the £30 price tag is a bit steep and they should wait for an inevitable sale. Similarly for people who own this on different services and consoles. Personally, I had the chance to play and complete this during a Gamepass trial and knew what I was going into. 

Overall a surprisingly fun game. New content since the original release, fun gameplay and generally a strong recommend for new people or those who never paid full price. To those that own the game already, I would say this is a ""sale"" game. Also note that progress can be carried over from EGS quite easily, but Gamepass makes it much more of a nuisance. That, and there are potentially oceanic server issues (in that they dont have any). However, just looking at the game - its a big thumbs up for a simple, fun and undemanding experience that can be challenging in a good way.",1632318546,1632318546,True,7,0,0.537802398204803467,3,True,False,False

[h1]Let's start with the bad.[/h1]

When you're ripping off Left 4 Dead and its sequel (more specifically its Special Infected), and I can't stress this enough, you forgot to make it actually fair and engaging beyond ""I better kill whatever the fuck this thing is as fast as possible or else I'll be majorly inconvenienced by some bullshit or another, maybe even killed."" Let's look at some notes, starting with the obvious stolen components that you've failed to make fun, but you just went ""Hey remember the Special Infected from Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2? Let's make them as obnoxious as humanly fucking possible, that's super cool.""

You know that Charger ripoff you call the Bull for example? It's actually really not fun to engage him considering he can change his course of direction at an immediate basis and snatch you up no matter how off his initial course you run, which makes the point of dodging his charge completely moot. Hey, even better is when your brokedick A.I. units stand there like gape-mouthed invalids while you get pummeled to death like a pit bull and a defenseless child. Chef's kiss, gotta love that.

And you know what's really awesome is having your Hunter ripoff having little to no unique noise cue in a swarm full of screaming, guttural groan uttering zombies so he can ambush you when you and your useless A.I. bots (oh, there's a lot of a fuckheap there, let me tell you) try to put your back to whatever walls you can so he can eat your health down like a ravenous animal while your useless A.I. bots just stand there uselessly and jerk themselves off into a do-nothing stupor. That's fucking awesome, let me tell you.

The Gasbag is literally just the Smoker with its originally intended (but ultimately removed) damaging smoke put back intact, but with no tongue. That's it. And it's also extremely fucking annoying to have to deal with when he's in your Goddamn way, too. What's better is when he dies in a room where your team is stationed (you know, that team with the really brokedick A.I. I keep bringing up?) and your zombies you keep pouring in, and pouring in, and pouring in, because you people failed at making a director-esque entity that gives the slightest breather (you know, like Left 4 Dead has?) and you're stuck with the Gasbag fucking you up and no viable escape. Fucking awesome, let's just keep that. Hey, make this scrawny chode a bullet sponge for no discernible reason while we're at it.

The Infector. Wow, what a name for a special zombie... amid a bunch of other infectious zombies I guess.
It's literally just the Spitter with the added nonsensical mechanic of ""let's make you stand in one spot and take the time to disinfect yourself, because you've got the time to do that when you're surrounded by countless undead in your immediate physical proximity that will not leave you the fuck alone; have fun doing that by the way when your A.I. are fucking terrible."" How very innovative.

The Bomber (my God, you just couldn't help yourselves, could you?) is literally the original L4D Boomer, as in the beta version one that just exploded and severely damaged you. That's it. The Screamer is just the exact same as the removed Special Infected with the [b]exact same name[/b] from the Left 4 Dead series. So all in all what we have here are beta elements from a game with better execution that are more player friendly, taken from a game that clearly inspired this one, and are made to be the most obnoxious trash possible. Did I mention the rat swarms with no collective hitbox that can quite literally down your whole team, useless brokedick A.I. or not? Because this seems like the place to do that. Yeah so there are rat swarms that will fuck you up. I'm done complaining now, so let's talk about the positives. Or whatever positives there are.

[h1]Moving along.[/h1]

Let's talk about gameplay for a moment. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead, it's literally that with a class-based system and action RPG system layered on top and with weapons customization so that actually makes it stand a little more on its own; these things give this game a little bit more going for itself when it's clearly struggling with its own identity and what it tried to copy. Let me state something positive while it's at the forefront of my mind. The addition of a first-person camera was a genius move. I had this game on Epic Games Store (although for free), and playing third-person was just completely obnoxious. Saber Interactive did something good here. The guns are fun to collect (and even more fun to shoot), it's fun to level up your survivor and give them more abilities and to produce a more robust, resilient team against the undead elements. It's completely satisfying to set up perimeter defenses (another thing that helps this game stand apart) and watch zombies just get shredded to bits and electrified pieces as well, not that it matters considering the best of preparation can't really unscrew you from garbage A.I., so I never really tend to bother with them. I end up getting boned no matter what, many times.

By the way, can I ask what the point is of giving us time to set up said perimeter defenses in the form of a countdown clock, while your meth head zombies still won't leave my party alone? I see what you were going for, that whole ""calm before the storm"" bit Left 4 Dead's director does before starting a major horde scenario, but the problem is that [b]you've forgotten the fucking calm[/b]. All you've accomplished is ""the F2 tornado before the F5."" It removes any sense of tension building because there are no low points that further accentuate the high points of adrenaline and action. It's just constant, non-stop fucking around.

Oh and the overly-serious voice actors and characters are ridiculous. They're nobody interesting, charming, likable. That's about it for that.
Let's talk about character design from an artistic perspective for a moment because I feel like this is important: When Valve made Left 4 Dead and its sequel (man, I just can't shut up about that game in comparison to this one, small wonder why that is), they designed the characters to be both lively and colorful so that people could relate them to [b]actually being alive[/b], to [b]establish a visual cue that yes, these are your teammates and that it is probably not best to shoot near them, at their general direction or otherwise[/b]. It helped maintain visual beacons in a horde of greying faces and flesh, gnashing teeth and flailing limbs. It's all about the visual cues in your immediate surroundings. I have no idea why the Hell you would pillage so much except this one critical thing.

Oh yeah, as an aside, you also can't defend your teammates once you're incapped.
So you guys stole all this from a better game but left out all the parts that make it team-oriented or even playable. Laughable.

I can't really think of too many positive things to say about this game. Yes, the graphics are great. [b]Whatever[/b].
Is it fun? Yes, when it's not extremely frustrating at specific intervals because of shitty Special Infected design, or when something unexpectedly stupid happens or your A.I. members just ridiculously screw the pooch in a boneheaded way.
If you want to shoot zombies and not be so serious about it, get the game. I'm going to keep playing it in spite of these grievances because they've already got my money because [b]I am not a very intelligent person[/b], and plus it [b]can[/b] be fun. But when it's not fun, it is [b]really[/b] not fun.

Oh, and
[h1]HOW CAN I NOT PAUSE THIS SHIT ALSO REMOVE THE FUCKING RATS, THANKS.

It's a very fun COOP zombie shooter, and the progression system gives you plenty to work toward as you improve your weapons and classes.

Optimisation and PC features are great. This runs on Unreal Engine 4, so you should have some idea of what to expect. Graphically it looks great, the controls are fluid and responsive, and you get options for field of view, film grain, etc. There's also AMD FSR for lower-spec PC's, though I haven't tried it myself. On a 2080 Super and i7 6700K, I've had no issues at all holding 144fps on the Ultra settings at 1440p. Smooth as silk and feels great to play.

This 'Aftermath' version contains every single piece of content from the 2017 game, including all the weapon DLC's, the Game of the Year content, and the French expansion pack. It also includes 2 new campaigns, several new useful weapons, first-person mode, and a new Horde XL mode with even more zombies.

The general gameplay is very much like L4D; 4 survivors in each campaign have to make their way through environments filled with hundreds of zombies, while completing objectives, flipping switches, fetching items or defending against waves of 1000's more zombies. It's a fun COOP experience, and very challenging on the harder difficulties.

Each playthrough is randomised, with some areas having branching paths, different objectives, different weapons and gear, and different enemy counts. Sometimes you'll find areas filled with claymores, other times it will be hostile turrets, etc. It's fun not knowing how the mission will play out each time.

During wave defence sections, you can pick up defensive items like Auto Turrets, Manual Turrets, Electric Fences and more, and place them in areas to help fend off the hordes. These are also randomized each time, so you might get unlucky and have very few useful defenses sometimes.

There's somewhat of a stealth system too, so you need to prioritise suppressed weapons (and upgrading existing weapons with suppressors) so that you don't bring a horde of 200 zombies every time you fire your guns.

There are special infected much like L4D; you've got the Bull (charger), Infector (spitter), Creeper (jockey), Bomber (boomer), Rat Swarms, and in October the 'Booster'. If any of these catch a lone player off-guard, it could mean their death.

The negative reviews are definitely caused by misconceptions that some people had and are not fully deserved. 

The sentence ""the next evolution of the original hit WWZ"" might indeed be misleading I guess. To be absolutely clear - World War Z: Aftermath is a DLC for the original game. The difference is that it is now free from being an Epic exclusive and it came to steam as a completely new package. Would you rather see the base game for 20-30 E and the expansion for 20 E on the Steam store? It's just conveniently packed up at a good price. On top of that, there are several free updates coming soon!

People complaining that it is a full price game? The expansion is pretty great and has tons of new content, on it's own it's still 20E on Epic to do the upgrade. Basically, if you're getting it on Steam, for the extra 10E you're actually getting the full GOTY edition of the base game (which was worth 40E) + the expansion on top of it. 

About matchmaking. Can't be sure how it actually is in places like Australia but in Europe the game has been very much alive. Even over the past month I had no issues finding a full party for insane and extreme runs, right now it seems even better with full super easy crossplay capabilities. Lobbies match you automatically with PS, XBOX and Epic and if you just want to play with your buddies from a different platform it's as easy as sharing a code. I'm really struggling to find another game where it's so easy to play in a cross platform party. We even managed to find people to play PvP which has been completely dead for quite some time.

In comparison, I tried B4B in the beta and it just felt so stiff... The zombies are just meh and feel really pale in comparison to the swarming hordes in WWZ. The gunplay in B4B felt off as well. I loved L4D back in the days so maybe that's why the addition of the ADS and guns taking half of my screen feels odd. Whenever I shot the zombies in B4B I felt there's fake blood spraying all over the place and that was it. Don't even get me started on how disappointing a pipe bomb explosion was but maybe there was just something wrong with the ragdolls. It just feels so damn good when the horde is rushing and there are body parts and zombie bodies flying all over the place. You can shoot half a zombie's head off or just it's hand.. it looks and feels great and the weapons feel just right. The progression system in feels a lot better too in WWZ. At it's current state, in my opinion WWZ is vastly superior and just simply more fun.

About the launcher... EGS is just inconvenient so I was looking forward to the steam release where the social overlay is not utter garbage. I also like to have all my things in one place. I was willing to start the progression from scratch but as a cherry on top the savegames are very easy to transfer from Epic. Hell.. I even just dumped all the EGS WWZ files into my steam folder and could play straight away saving me time on the 30GB download.

To sum it all up. WWZ is just a game that I love coming back to and I'm super chuffed to see more content for it. For some reason, hitting a dozen zombies in the head one after another and/or playing a medic and helping out the team just makes me happy :D",1632261396,1632265148,True,6,1,0.543668508529663086,0,True,False,False

Apparently their definition of ""multiplayer"" is the competitive game mode. The phrase ""co-op campaign"" here refers to the entire rest of the game.

So you don't get to make your own character, massively destroying player customization and individuality, but you also only get to play as specific characters in each sub section of missions; thus you can't even ground yourself in puppeteering a specific premade character you have to switch to a completely new individual every single sub section. In a game that was originally designed to be in third person, which puts huge emphasis on the appearance of the player.

There are layers to the baffling amount of incompetence at play here.

Besides destroying customization, forcing players into premade characters does save on short term development but it also hampers the creators long term. Because now that they've created all these completely different characters with completely different body types, designing cosmetics to fit all of them is much more difficult. Which results in developers adding dozens of cosmetics into the game, but each character only has access to the few that were made explicitly for them and all the cosmetics made for characters each player doesn't like are now going to waste. Which is blatantly observable in this game too, each character only has a couple of lazily designed alternate cosmetics because the developers shortsightedly did not design them to be compatible with modular cosmetics like an actual customization system would be.

But what's truly disturbing is that the developers added so many premade characters into this game that there's now enough faces and body types for them to have made an actual basic customization system out of it. But they didn't, not only did they go out of their way to design all these completely different character models instead of consolidating it all as one customization system but they explicitly prohibit you from playing as most of them in every single mission. So they put the same amount of effort into producing a more restrictive system, then added a completely new form of restriction onto it which devalues the breadth of their own work.

What, do you think the lore of this stock copy paste zombie world is so deep and precious that you had to restrict the characters per chapter to preserve the integrity of the story? What's the story? Random humans run around a random environment inexplicably fighting off an impossible amount of scientifically illogical enemies while performing asinine objectives that could of been completed by whoever took the time to set them up before the protagonists got here; meanwhile the protagonists are casually finding weapons of mass destruction littered around the scenery and can survive blatantly devastating wounds with little duress then completely mend those wounds by just opening up a medical kit on the fly likely without any extensive training in actual medical science. I scarcely believe from a story standpoint something so bereft of creativity would be engaging the first time around let alone after players have been through these missions potentially dozens of times, since this is supposed to be replayable.

But I think it's more likely that the game is just this way simply because the developers made a very foolish design decision which quite obviously only made things worse for zero ultimate benefit.


Absolutely saddening that I was so looking forward to finally playing another third person multiplayer shooter only to find out it has possibly the most restrictive and completely irrational character system I've ever seen in the game. Which is not only a fundamental design problem in general but is exceptionally worse in a game where you're constantly looking at the character you're meant to be controlling. What an entirely unnecessary stroke of absolute folly.

The only lore I know from WWZ is from the Southpark parody, watched the movie like years ago but thats not rly anything necessary to enjoy the game, it comes down to ""lotta zombies, gotta get outta there"" plot-line. 

For <34€ you can play on (currently) 7 or so different ""episodes"" (Regions) in campaign. 
Each region has multiple levels. 
So far I have finished the first episode taking place in New York. 
The levels seem to have some kind of RNG to it making it better for replayability (mission items & loot can spawn in different locations). 

The amount of weapons is quite a bunch. From pistols, to rifles to an explosive crossbow
Lots of weapons can be upgraded by using them and ""leveling them"". 

There also are a bunch of classes to level (takes a while) and plenty of perks to unlock. 

Core gameplay loop is alright. 
If you like L4D you will most likely like this game aswell. 

Using airstrikes, mortars, heavy mgs and other stuff to slay zombies is fun though and if you don't expect the world you can def. get your moneys worth. 
For me this is a decent AAA title for an Indie-game-pricetag. 


Negatives would be:
-Climbing can be a bit clumsy 
-There is no real AimingDownSight / using scopes (yet? I hope that will become a thing in later updates). 
-You can only play when you accept their EULA (which is stated here in the storepage) which is ok but then there is another EULA which is necessary for online play which isnt listed here in the Steam store page. 
An oversight imho.
-It has gone the ""epic games exclusive"" route, something that imho only belongs to console people, but not to the PC pride.

This is exactly the same game as is on epic with the difference that there are 2 new campains with each 3 missions, in the basegame all campains had 4 missions soooo is that how greed works? Also there is a new class whatever.

Graphic is slightly better, zombies are clunckier now when shot they kinda teleport on the ground sometimes instead of having a falling animation, and gunplay feels shakier as if they tried to improve the visual and audio feedback but made everything look and sound harder and shakier? Hard to explain.

My biggest problem and why i have refunded ultimately is because you cant find a group for coop instantly and its launchday, that means either nobody wants to play this or the matchmaking sucks. You can find 1 or 2 people for the new campain but i couldnt match with 3 others to make it 4, ON LAUNCHDAY!

So if you buy this anyway, make sure you have friends at hand to play with or enjoy playing with bots.
For me that experiance is not worth 34€, if this has modsupport later on i consider getting it for below 10€ thats a good value but otherwise its a ripoff in my opinion.
