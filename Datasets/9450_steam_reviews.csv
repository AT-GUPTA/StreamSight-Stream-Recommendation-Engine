Why in DoW's II & III they shifted the entire style of the game is beyond me as I very much despise RTS games that are super restrictive in what you can build/train, along with practically hand holding you throughout the entire campaign regardless of difficulty.

THIS though - this type of RTS that DoW I through Soulstorm - is what makes the perfect kind of RTS: Base Construction, Army building, countering, deployment tactics... that creative freedom is what makes the perfect RTS, in my opinion.
Soulstorm will always have a special place in my heart, and I enjoy revisiting it every now and then even if it's just a single quick Skirmish match.

Playing it as a lil kid, I remember fondly sowing terror and despair as the forces of chaos, or the inevitable, deathly onslaught of the Necrons. Of bodily charging into danger as the Blood Ravens, or holding the line in valiant defiance as the Imperial Guard. 
But most of all I remember my good friends, Tang (who owns a lovely restaurant these days who serve the most delightful salt and pepper chips) and Diego. We met in the summer of 2014, bright eyed young lads looking to make it big or die trying, and we happened upon a shared love of toy army men. So it was we became bound, bound to each other, and strangely to this game.
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm, is decried by many, for its plethora of issues. Bizarre balance, barely functional flying units, batshit insane voice acting, equally maniacal plot, but beloved for its sheer, unbridled charm. Me, Tang and Diego fell in love with that charm. 
Many an evening was spent assailing Diego in his lair behind legions of Ork Boyz and waaagh banners, many a hour spent hunting down his last surviving ""refugee"" builder unit, many a minute cursing Tang's betrayal, or cheering on at my own triumph. 
Diego especially was something of a menace. A known poor sport, he would squirrel away builders, construct bases, and refuse to surrender even when clearly defeated. When he was ascendant he would taunt and insult, calling our mothers rather unmentionable things, and insulting Tang's growing culinary passion (I guess he got the last laugh there eh?), before shouting out terrible invocations and all manner of likely drugged speech. Tang, not to be left out, was foul mouthed as a sailor and would hurl an equal barrage of poor sportsmanship at Diego in his native tongue.
Myself, I enjoyed the simpler things in life. To savour a foe's destroyed Defiler spam, to silently pent my fingers in satisfaction as the AI (The Orklandian menace) stormed the bases of my frenemies, and of course, saving the re-plays of our matches to reinforce a revisionist version of events, as no one else ever did that and I was left with the sole truth of what happened.
In many ways, I miss those simpler times, those happier times. Before Tang was caught up in the legal incident with Miss Peller, before Diego ever made his first DOW3 map.
But those are tales for different times and different reviews.

This wasn't my childhood (that's Dark Crusade, the game that I was introduced to gaming through), but this game is great.

But, it isn't the absolute best.

But the best part is, it is the game that the DOW mod, Ultimate Apocalypse, was made for.

It takes a LONG time to get set up, and you need about 10 Gbs in total to get the whole thing, but it is so worth it! It expands the game in a way I can't even begin to dare say is bad! The mere fact that they made some factions in the game less effective at cheesy tactics, like Tau Empire stealthsuit rushing, gives them great advantage. Plus the extra rules are nice. And, this is the only RTS 40k game (mod or not) that gives Tyranids without the playstyle of Dawn of War 2, meaning structures like oldschool RTS games like Age of Empires and that. It's so good. And they play well too, not op, but not weak! And it keeps to the Dawn of War style of each faction being just as good as each other, just different playstyles to suit you.

Plus, the low cost of the game combined with the mod being no cost, AND the game being a standalone dlc, meaning you don't even need the original Dawn of War before this, makes this a must buy and download for any RTS fan.

Edit: As an extra edit, the Unification mod, which while incompatible with Ultimate Apolcalypse, adds a ton of new content to balance out all the factions and expand upon the game instead of absolutely breaking the game with op strategies.

Nothing against bringing in other studious to assist in the workload especially since GW has not changed even in these past decades still issuing punishing deadlines and crunch times to everyone even now 16 years later, But you can tell the other studio was not full of veteran devs let alone people who really had a clue what they were working on. However even despite all of that you still have a fantastic game considering you still have all of the previous stuff contained in the other expansions if you bought them (note I do believe you can still play all of them even if you didn't buy the expansions just not in multiplayer for some reason) , and the two new ones Sisters of battle and Dark eldar are an interesting bunch. 
Sister of Battle pack a lot of flame weaponry as to be expected for a entire army who likes to burn things tanks got flamers infantry flamers, melta guns, and generally can get way more use out of them in comparison to other factions who also have flame weaponry. The sisters are a bit of a mix between Space marines and the Guard you have as a general rule better tanks and more variety in the armored department and while not as strong as Space marines on the infantry side they are far cheaper in comparison. The Dark eldar are a high speed and damage faction that is able to output a large amount of burst damage and have a build system that promotes rushing down an early game opponent with some powerful units to keep up the pressure into the midgame. As I dont play the Dark eldar much I cant offer more of an explanation then that but I think they are solid. And as for the most important part of soulstorm and the reason many buy it..(drum roll)..MODS!

Ultimate Apocalypse is my go to and the mod I play even after unification's release it takes the 9 factions and kits them all out with some fantastic weaponry new buildings and more and In general is a great time so out of the two mods out there I would pick up UA-Ultimate Apocalypse there are plenty of videos on YouTube that show what both mods have to offer if you need a bit more info to understand what your getting into with the mods https://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod and https://www.moddb.com/mods/unification-mod-dawn-of-war-soulstorm both mods have a lot of love and time put into them and I would give each of them a shot",1698132268,1706301636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The plot is always about killing and destruction, without construction, protection and love. This is mostly related to the poor values ​​of the West, which is always the law of the jungle, social Darwinism, and a society without any warmth.
I digress, let’s get back to the topic. As the fourth game in the Warhammer series, this game is pretty poorly done. The plot is completely empty and boring. So many races have been forced into the game, but the units do not have many characteristics, and are full of repetition and imbalance. There are also many vicious bugs in the game. For example, when a campaign is won, the game will crash incorrectly. If you don't save the game in advance, you will just cry. Another example, when you play a game at high resolution, your mouse cannot move to the right and down, which makes the game experience very bad.
In addition to the disadvantages mentioned above, the original flaw of the game have also been maintained. That flaw is the game's stupid and terrible AI pathfinding function. So I say it again, compared to the earlier releases of StarCraft 1 and Age of Empires 2, this game is really a complete garbage. I very much regret buying this game. If God gives me a chance to refund it, I will return it without hesitation.

Instead of managing individual units this game innovated controlling entire squads that also allow some customization and attachment of leader units and support units.

Each faction has its own personality and unique strategies. The single player mode allows you to move around a map, manage defenses, fight battles with your commander and get persistent upgrades.

There are also some incredible mods that add so much more content to the game, but the downside is you will not use the steam workshop so you should be comfortable tracking down websites and installing the mods yourself.

The game is from 2003 and the title 'Soulstorm' is a DLC released in 2008. This game is the most played game in the DoW-series even though its almost 20 years old. And even though there were hundreds of players playing this game every day and you could easily join games, and you can still easily play it in the lobbies today. However, playing this game have been an exciting journey and it finally took me the 1000 hours of gameplay to beat the hardest difficulty in the game: 'insane' difficulty. So all in all, it's been a good time and I know consider this game finished and will get to pass to the graveyard of videogames with love.

[U]I give this game 10/10.

There are a million other mods, many of which make both titles anything but vanilla.

But... The game is fatally flawed and was so even before Steam, the cutscenes that you get from defeating the faction home bases, crash the game. You can generally get around this by spamming the escape key just before the cutscene starts and keep doing so until you get to the battle summary screen.

I can and am recomending this to anyone after an awsome warhammer 40k game or just someone who likes the idear of big armies fighting it out over loads of different maps.

this Game still has a good online player base nowhere near what it once was but still good considering the age of the game right my review is below sorry for the length but this game is worth it.

Multiplayer - A great part of the game, maps range in size from 2 players up to 8 players all different sizes and layouts some are over open where as others have choke pionts all over and some such as the Map 'Into the Breach' a 4 player map with a single choke piont really makes for awsome battles. the game is fairelly ballanced but of coursesome racesare better in certain ways and some like necrons are slowto get going but all are strong in thier own way, I have played all the races and can say their are all fun to use and in no way unplayerble. i would recomend before jumping into multiplayer going into the skirmish mode and having a few games on each race get a feel for them and how to build bases fast how to gain control as players who have played alot will have bases up very fast and be at your base before you know it and to finish this bit off you can also custom up your armies paint scheme and badges adds a nice touch to the game.

Campaign - Where to begin, to start with i shall say there is alot of hours worth of gameplay in it there is 3 moons and 4 planets to take space mariens, Tau and Orks start on one then Chaos and Dark eldar on one then Elder and Necrons followed by Imperial Gaurd and Sisters of Battle. The moons are just 1 province so 1 battle and each plannet has a stronghold for each faction and a decent number of provinces to fight for and each of them giving you planetry req which is basicly money for you to add certain units to your comanders Hounor Gaurd (once gained from taking certain provinces) and to reinforce provinces owned by you. it is a really fun game to play through I have played through on every race and some more than once on other difficulties.

Skirmish - I really enjoy this mode difficulties range from easy to insane from the computer, loads of maps and i mean loads, not much to say other than awsome mode lets to mess around try out new races and different play styles and new maps.

Mods - now this is one alot of people will be wanting, And for all of you i can say yes there are lots of mods for the game along with maps and more races and such which can be added, and if you fancy the idear of making maps or your own badges and banners for your armies you can there are modding tools out there which allow you to do that and it is very easy to do to get all this into the game is very simple and most mods will explain how below the badges and banners are abit harder if your new to it, I have a few mods currently installed and a couple of my favourites are the No limit mod which does as it says there is no limit to your army size when you play with this mod it is go big or go home, and the ultimate apocolipse mod which is an amazing mod with so much in units and buildings and a new way of playing as a new eliment to the game.

To boil it down, this game only gets one thing right: the ""look"" of warhammer 40k. The units and vehicles are well designed and iconic. But, that's all it gets right. 
Path-finding in this game is horrific. God forbid, you select more than 2 units at a time to move; I have watched for over a minute while my units bump into each other like awkward prom dates while trying to move from point A to point B. 
Sync-kills (the stylish animation of one unit killing another) is rarely replicated in other RTS games. Do you want to know why? Because, it looks cool, but man, is it annoying to deal with. Basically, if an enemy demon decides your space marine's head would make for a good basketball, then you're going to watch it all take place in detail. That's not the problem. The problem is this: the enemy unit is invincible while the animation takes place, and your other units don't realize this. I've had half my firing line shooting at an enemy going through a 30 second animation while the other enemies take potshots at my guys who are exploding in bloody fountains. 
The campaign is tedious. You have to take strongholds (""boss fight"" levels) which take easily 1-2 hours to complete. You have to complete a shopping list of objectives while the AI spawns infinite waves of units against your base meaning you have to inch your way through the level as you have to constantly maintain a base army as well as have your other army stumbling from one objective to another. 
It's not hard. It's just...boring. Like, I don't know how they did it but they somehow made battles involving space wizards, monsters, aliens, and desperate conscripts boring. That is impressive. 

I tried to like this game, purely because it does its presentation so well, but it does so many things wrong that I'm just not having any fun with it. If you're a die-hard 40k fan, you'll probably like this game; if you're looking for a decent RTS, then I'd recommend you look elsewhere.",1701573800,1702087779,False,0,0,0.384615391492843628,1,True,False,False

Why did they add Dark Eldar despite they cannot fight armies head-on, and prefer to raid planets with the least resistance and retreat to Commorragh once they get their slaves? They should have added Tyranids instead. Anyways in Dark Crusade when you build your structures on your territory, it becomes permanent so when the enemy attacks your territory all you have to do is build units and attack their base and it can be finished in a few minutes while in Soulstorm you to have to build it again which is tedious. The enemy stronghold in Dark Crusade is memorable because each stronghold has different objectives to defeat them while in Soulstorm all you do is attack this place and then attack that place. Oh, and they add flying units, which I barely use. But the good thing about Soulstorm is the mods for it, it adds a lot of new factions and enhances the game.

Soulstorm also adds 2 new factions which are the extremely edgy Dark Eldar, and the Sisters of Battle, both are pretty fun to play and feel a lot more balanced in comparison to the Tau and the Necrons that were previously introduced in the last expansion. 

What Soulstorm does the best isn't actually part of the game as it is, rather it's the very strong and dedicated modding scene that the community for this game has built, there are many mods for soulstorm but 2 in particular stand out:
Ultimate Apocalypse: this mod maxes out the amount of units you can have on the battlefield at once, creating a very chaotic (and very laggy) experience that is very epic, it also adds new units to the factions as well.
Unification Mod: my personal favorite of the 2, it unifies most of the faction mods that are within Soulstorms modding scene into one package while also adding in some more making the total come to over 20 new factions to play as, and they are all very well made and have different game mechanics for each one making them all feel unique and there is more to come, not only that but all models have been updated and factions have been given new units AND these new units also have custom voice lines done by VAs that worked with the mod creators. The campaign has also been updated to make it more better than it was in the base game.

Unfortunately this game does have one massive downside that bothers me and that is the load times, they last pretty long and have a chance of just not loading at all and crashing your game, even with all the modding support there is nothing to fix this, but other than that, If you just need an excuse to play more dawn of war and really love the sisters of battle or the dark eldar then I would still recommend playing this, but trust me if you choose to play this without mods then you are definitely missing out on what I would personally consider the definitive Dawn of War experience.

Steam offers no support because it is not one of their games, which is very poor customer service in my opinion. If you sell the game, you should provide support for it.

However, with Unification, this game turns into the game it should have been, and then some. Mods have kept this game alive for close to two decades. Even in 2023, with a huge selection of modern AAA games with exceptional graphics and modern gameplay mechanics, I still find myself coming back to Soulstorm Unification mod. There are also other mods such as Ultimate Apocalypse that have a more chaotic and varied lineup of units and game mechanics added, although I found UA a bit too complicated and unbalanced for my taste. Unification turns this game into something truly special. It's easy enough to install, and as of 2023 has a dedicated and talented team of people working to add new features and even more polish to it.

Despite this, I tended to favor DC bc of my bias really against anything that wasn't DC. I was told that this game was inferior to DC in many aspects. Years go by and I played this. I didn't play UA at the time, but I would soon find myself getting into that. Then Uni came out. I still didn't like vanilla bc I was stuck on Firestorm, thanks to how it handled power creep. I also didn't really like the fliers or the unit limits in SS, which is why I loved the no limit mod for both DC and SS. Uni had a vanilla balance to it, which I didn't like as much. Then I started to play vanilla to beat the skirmish maps. all of them, bc DOW SS campaigns felt more like playing those and better. That made like it better and I was playing all the races too so that gave me some variety. Playing the DOW AI mod also, made it better as well.

I came to like it more than I did previously and that mirrored my own development. When RTW get's buggy and bland, when M2TW bugs out, crashes, becomes boring, and the other RTS's I own become to much for me, DOW SS comes in. It's not the perfect RTS by any means, but it's one of the best IMO and the opinions of many others, bc of the mods that community brings out and the great base work of Relic's.",1690582868,1690582868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game is admittedly inferior to the very good campaign on Kronus with a functionally smaller game map (despite being across a sector rather than planet for some reason), lack of bonuses missions (no more fight over the spaceport to be able to attack anywhere on the map or bloodsport to be able to take 2x turns) which limits your tactical consideration in the campaign or, worst of all, no banter between commanders during stronghold sieges. The two new races aren't lacking in their personality thankfully, but I simply don't find the new caster resource race (Dark Eldar) or the other new caster resource race (Sisters of Battle) fun as their race gimmicks are lackluster compared to others that share their specializations.

Sisters of Battle - seem kinda cool. Discount Space Marines. I don't mind the faith mechanic and I enjoy some of their abilities and vehicles.

Dark Eldar - Feels like extra work for an extra resource with some alright, generally lacklustre payoffs.

Soulstorm is an interesting title, in that unlike the previous two expansions (Winter Assault and Dark Crusade) it was not actually developed by Relic, but by a studio called Iron Lore Entertainment. The two factions it adds, Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle, are fun additions to the roster of factions from the base game and previous expansions, but sadly weren't balanced the best.

Campaign wise, it is an attempt at mimicking Dark Crusade's campaign. Keyword there being attempt. Instead of a single planet, the map has been ""expanded"" to four planets and three moons. Now, I say ""expanded"" because, in total, the map has gain a whopping six more territories since Dark Crusade, at the cost of making the map a chore to try and parse out. But don't worry, because the story isn't much better. It's absolutely riddled with plot holes, and is filled to the brim with stupid characters with stupid voices all making stupid decisions. Though, I suppose it's because they have such silly voices that even to this day you can make references to some of the sillier lines and have fans of 40k chuckle at the memory.

By now, I bet you're wondering why I recommend it, let alone describe it as the ""definitive version of Dawn of War"", right? Well it's simple. Modding. Soulstorm has, hands down, the most and some of the best mods out of all the expansions. There are a plethora of amazing mods, from Ultimate Apocalypse that expands the scope of the mod by adding three new factions along with massive amounts of units for all the preexisting factions, adding everything from the smallest grot to multi-skyscraper tall titans that can shoot across the entire map and destroy the enemy base in a single shot.

Another excellent mod you could try is the Unification Mod, which works with dozens of Mod creators to combine all of their individual faction mods into a single, ultimate mod. So it does not just add two or three factions, oh no, they have TWENTY NEW FACTIONS, and have updated the vanilla factions, and are planning on adding even more factions soon.

So, do I recommend Soulstorm for it's own merits? No. If you want well written characters and fun stories in a 40k strategy game, play the base game or either of it's first two DLCs. Or Play the Dawn of War II, or one of that games two expansions, Chaos Rising and Retribution.

But if you want to have a fun time with a great community playing some of the best modding has to offer, then welcome to Soulstorm.",1686914790,1686914790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dawn of War: Soulstorm, the third expansion of the acclaimed Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War series by Relic Entertainment, takes players to the war-torn universe of the 41st millennium. As a seasoned fan of the series, I was eager to dive into Soulstorm and engage in epic battles, conquer new territories, and experience the intense strategic gameplay that has made the franchise a staple in the real-time strategy genre. Let's delve into the immersive world of Dawn of War: Soulstorm and explore why it remains a thrilling and satisfying addition to the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

[h1]Expansive Factions and Diverse Armies[/h1]
Soulstorm introduces two new factions, the Dark Eldar and the Sisters of Battle, expanding the roster of playable armies to a total of nine. Each faction brings a unique playstyle, complete with distinct units, abilities, and strategies. The vast array of customization options and army compositions ensure that no two battles feel the same, providing endless opportunities for experimentation and strategic depth.

[h1]Epic Campaigns and Engaging Storytelling[/h1]
Soulstorm offers an engaging single-player campaign that delves into the ongoing conflict in the Kaurava system. The narrative is captivating, filled with political intrigue, interstellar warfare, and the struggle for dominance. Each faction's campaign provides a different perspective on the conflict, allowing players to experience the story from multiple angles. The inclusion of memorable heroes and the choices that impact the outcome of the campaign add an extra layer of immersion and replay value.

[h1]Strategic Depth and Dynamic Battles[/h1]
The core gameplay of Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains true to the franchise's roots, providing a deep and satisfying real-time strategy experience. The game emphasizes resource management, base-building, and tactical combat. The addition of new air units, ground vehicles, and powerful superweapons introduces fresh dynamics to battles. The strategic control points on the maps create a dynamic and ever-changing battlefield, forcing players to adapt their strategies and constantly stay on their toes.

[h1]Stunning Graphics and Atmospheric Sound Design[/h1]
Soulstorm boasts improved visuals that bring the grim and gritty Warhammer 40,000 universe to life. The detailed unit models, destructive environments, and atmospheric effects enhance the immersion and create a visually impressive experience. The sound design, including the thunderous clash of battles, the booming weapon effects, and the iconic voice acting, adds an extra layer of authenticity to the game, further immersing players in the epic warfare of the 41st millennium.

[h1]Skirmish and Multiplayer Modes[/h1]
Dawn of War: Soulstorm offers a robust skirmish mode where players can engage in intense battles against AI opponents. The game's multiplayer mode provides an opportunity to test your strategic skills against other players from around the world. The competitive multiplayer scene, complete with ranked matches and a dedicated community, ensures that the gameplay experience remains challenging and engaging long after completing the single-player campaigns.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Dawn of War: Soulstorm successfully expands upon the rich universe of Warhammer 40,000, delivering a strategic and immersive gameplay experience. With its diverse factions, engaging campaigns, and dynamic battles, the game captures the essence of the franchise and offers countless hours of strategic enjoyment. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the series or a newcomer to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Dawn of War: Soulstorm is a must-play for those seeking intense battles, deep strategic gameplay, and a journey into a dystopian future filled with epic warfare.

Pros: 
Best balanced out of the games (for PVP, Skirmish, in general, etc.)
Best for Modding

Neutral:
Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle are nice to have... But they don't make or break anything. I'd rather choose other additions over them.

Cons:
Campaign does not even remotely compare to the quality of Dark Crusade
Air Units are a meh addition. Not really that well executed. They're also pretty much the only new content other than the new factions, which again, are simply nice to have but don't transform or improve the game that much.

As a fan of strategy games both turn based and real time, I hadn't  delved into this gem until I got sucked into the WH40K lore by an ARPG gem by Neocore called Inquisitor - Martyr. Ever since I've been consuming games in the Warhammer universe, more on GOG than this site, and I adore the setting as a perfect backdrop for RPG and strategy gaming.

Dawn of War is what most RTS aspire to be, shaving off the distractions and adding features that dissuade the more annoying forms of play that would otherwise make some players a complete irritation to engage in multiplayer matches. By tying resources to ""strategy points"" on the map it makes the dreaded Turtle Defence suicidal and forces players to remain on the offensive. This makes for fast paced games where the only viable defence is a good offence, and the commander who most effectively deploys limited assets across the widest territory the surefire victor.

With squad based deployment, a wide range of potential assets, and truly varied factions that utilize their own economic systems, Dawn of War provides an army for every core style of tactics and provides a range of opponents that each require you to think carefully about how best to use the strengths of your own faction against the weaknesses inherent to your opposition.

In a rather unusual turn for the genre, the factions are fairly well balanced even without significant modding, and there isn't truly an obvious choice for easy domination. The more generalized a faction is the less suited to any given battlefield role they are. The often overpowered Space Marines of the Imperium find themselves nerfed by their own diversity in DoW, and helps to pry them from the pedestal they hold by virtue of the lore which has glorified their presence in this fictional universe.

Try outshooting the Tau with your army of Blood Angels and you'll soon realize that being big and tough isn't always the best asset on the field of war.

Grimaldus aimed his mace out at the advancing hordes. Thousands. Tens of thousands. And only the very beginning. 'Do you see that?' he roared at the humans. The closest ranks flinched back from the mechanical bark that issued almost deafeningly loud from his skull helm. 'Answer me!' He received several trembling nods. 'Yes, sir…' uttered a handful of them, the speakers faceless within the masses behind their rebreather masks. Grimaldus turned back to the wasteland, already dark with the teeming, chaotic ranks of the enemy. At first, his helm emitted a low, vox-distorted chuckle. Within a few seconds, he was laughing, laughing up at the burning sky while aiming his crozius hammer at the enemy. 'Are you all as insulted as I am? This is what they send against us?' He turned back to the men, the laughter fading, but amused contempt filling his voice even through the inhumanising vocalisers of his helm. 'This is what they send? This rabble? We hold one of the mightiest cities on the face of the planet. The fury of its guns sends all skyborne enemies to the ground in flames. We stand united in our thousands - our weapons without number, our purity without question, and our hearts beating courage through our blood. And this is how they attack us? 'Brothers and sisters… A legion of beggars and alien dregs wheezes its way across the plains. Forgive me when the moment comes that they whine and weep against our walls. Forgive me that I must order you to waste ammunition upon their worthless bodies.' Grimaldus paused, lowering his weapon at last, turning his back on the invaders as if bored by their very existence. His entire attention was focussed upon the soldiers below him. 'I have heard many souls speak my name in whispers since I came to Helsreach. I ask you now: Do you know me?' 'Yes,' several voices replied, several among the hundreds. 'Do you know me?' he bellowed at them over the firing of the wall-guns. 'Yes!' a chorus answered now. 'Iam Grimaldus of the Black Templars! A brother to the Steel Legions of this defiant world!' A muted cheer greeted his words. It wasn't enough, not even close. 'Never again in life will your actions carry such consequence. Never again will you serve as you serve now. No duty will matter as much, and no glory will taste as true. We are the defenders of Helsreach. On this day, we carve our legend in the flesh of every alien we slay. Will you stand with me?' Now the cheers came in truth. They thundered in the air around him. 'Will you stand with me?' Again, a roar. 'Sons and daughters of the Imperium! Our blood is the blood of heroes and martyrs! The xenos dare defile our city? They dare tread the sacred soil of our world? We will throw their bodies from these walls when the final day dawns!' A wave of noise crashed against his armour as they cheered. Grimaldus raised his war maul, aiming it to the embattled heavens. 'This is our city! This is our world! Say it! Say it! Cry it out so the bastards in orbit will hear our fury! Our city! Our world!' 'OUR CITY! OUR WORLD!' Laughing again, Grimaldus turned to face the oncoming horde. 'Run, alien dogs! Come to me! Come to us all! Come and die in blood and fire!' 'BLOOD AND FIRE!' The Reclusiarch cut the air with his crozius, as if ordering his men forward. 'For the Templars! For the Steel Legion! For Helsreach!' 'FOR HELSREACH!' 'Louder!' 'FOR HELSREACH!' 'They cannot hear you, brothers!' 'FOR HELSREACH!' 'Hurl yourselves at these walls, inhuman filth! Die on our blades! I am Grimaldus of the Black Templars, and I will cast your carcasses from these holy walls!' 'GRIMALDUS! GRIMALDUS! GRIMALDUS!' """,1657711308,1684668894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not a day goes by that I didn't wish this game still receive support or a remaster. It holds a very SPECIAL place in my heart.

What I believe makes this game stand out from others of its kind at the time is the limited number of units. Rather than allowing players to simply overpowered units and vehicles, the game restricts the player by allowing only small numbers of units and vehicles. Every unit is a valuable resource each with their own strengths and abilities. And it's up to you to make the most of it. 

Despite my fond memories of this game, I still find it flawed in terms of balancing but still a fun and enjoyable game nonetheless. The pathfinding system for instance is perhaps the single most game-breaking feature of this game. It is frustratingly terrible, with units getting stuck on narrow places, or vehicles blocking the route. 

I would still recommend it to players, especially those who are new to the Warhammer 40, 000 universe.",1684512282,1684512282,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

9450,136602389,76561198191290311,0,7,6241,0,2987,1686409499,"If I could give a Mixed review, I would. This is a ""Mixed"" standalone expansion for a great game. I've been pondering quite long on whether to mark it as a positive or a negative review - the former I feel might be misleading, whereas the latter might be cruel. It truly is a mixed experience, with both good and bad.

Provided it's on sale or you get it in a package with all the others, and you're already a fan of the game or the setting, I think it's worth it. If this is somehow your first foray into Warhammer and Dawn of War, please just get the base game or Dark Crusade instead.

The pros of Soulstorm are easily visible. Two new factions, both with a very cool aesthetic. It introduces new units, new mechanics, new maps, and a new campaign. All of this is good - I mean, come on, it's the Dark Eldar and the Sisters of Battle. Bar a couple exceptions like the Tyranids, it also means the game has pretty much everyone from the setting, and you can pit them all against each other.

Getting it for the skirmish mode alone might be worth it to you, though that depends.

The cons, however, are hard for me to pinpoint exactly. They are hard for me to see, but I can definitely feel them. Something is *off* when comparing it to the base game or the previous expansions. The new factions feel clunky and strange, and though maybe this is because I do not have enough hours in them, I still find myself picking others instead. They *look* fun, but they do not *feel* fun.

Cool to try once, and then go back to the other ones. This may be personal opinion, but I'm sure many feel the same way. There's something tedious or stiff about the ability meters, something lacking or perhaps somehow off-balanced about the unit roster. Something about the power bar that just feels... I don't know. Gimmicky? Somehow, even the Necrons with their out-there mechanics feel better to play, at least in my opinion.

Plus, there's a notable lack in polish and a drop in quality in certain aspects. Every so often, a crusty .jpeg will greet you instead of some better-looking icon, or a unit of one of the new factions will fail to play any animation if it's taken out in some unexpected way. Nothing truly game-breaking or upsetting, but again, continuing the *off* theme of the expansion.

The variety is welcome, but it's not really good variety. It's just... variety. Not terrible, but not excellent.

Then there's the campaign, which is pretty much just Dark Crusade except worse. More tedious. It asks you to hunt down every single crumb of enemy on the map, every single battle. Combined with the slow loading times even on modern PCs, I found myself often questioning the ratio of waiting (whether in the loading screen, or for my units to sweep the map for that one last plasma generator or whatever the enemy was hiding) to playing. *Tedious* is the word. Unfun might be another.

It feels like such a small change, but it transformed the fun experience of Dark Crusade into one that is hardly enjoyable, or even frustrating. Whereas Dark Crusade's campaign had me eagerly waiting to come back home and boot up my computer to play more, Soulstorm's campaign had me eagerly waiting the sweet release of the quit button.

Is it a bad game? No, not really. But I think it does deserve its place as the black sheep of the Dawn of War 1 variants. Of the base game and the other two expansions, it is the bottom ranking for me - and many others. On its own, it's... *fine.* Playing a bit of Skirmish is still fun. It's still Dawn of War.

Again, if you're just starting out, get the base game. If you're here for the cool overworld campaign content, get Dark Crusade. But on a discount or in a pack, Soulstorm is still worth a shot. If you just want to Skirmish as the Dark Eldar or Sisters of Battle, it's good enough for that. Even if it's a bit scruffy, at the end of the day it's more Warhammer. Plus, I hear the Unification mod is extremely good, though I've yet to try it.

Do you see my hours? Do you see the enormous amount of time I've spent on this RTS game?! My friend, this is only the beginning to greatness.

Want to conquer wastelands upon wastelands of worlds with the factions presented in the 41st millennium?! Get the Dawn of War Master Collection. 

Then the mods you can install for this game is beyond this world. The best mod I'd say currently for this game is Unificaction which introduces a ungodly amount of factions to the point where there will have to be a race or faction you'd like if you played them all. 

If Blizzard RTS is no longer to your liking and want a more simple and compact game with a resource economy based on how aggressive you are against your enemies, pick up and play Dawn of War!

The single-player campaign is the standout feature of Soulstorm. It takes players on a journey through the galaxy as they battle to gain control of the mysterious planet of Acheron. With nine different factions to choose from, each with their own unique play style and units, the campaign remains engaging and challenging throughout.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soulstorm also offers a range of multiplayer modes that provide players with the opportunity to test their skills against other players from around the world. The game's online functionality is seamless and easy to use, and the community is still active to this day.
But what really makes Soulstorm stand out is its deep and intricate gameplay mechanics. The game requires a lot of strategic thinking and careful planning, which makes every match feel like a satisfying puzzle to solve.
The graphics and sound design in Soulstorm are also impressive. The game features beautiful environments and detailed unit designs, which make battles feel epic and immersive. The music and sound effects are also top-notch, which helps to create a truly immersive gaming experience.
Overall, Dawn of War: Soulstorm is an excellent game that offers a lot of depth and replayability. If you're a fan of real-time strategy games, then you won't be disappointed with this one",1676811364,1676811364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*]Crashes: The game crashes after most stronghold missions and sometimes randomly, in the middle of a mission or skirmish game.
[*]Honor Guard Units: The computer gets honor guard units out of thin air, i.e. the Orc computer player owns 3 districts, but has 9 honor guard units. Even worse: They don’t die! When you defeat their commander and his honor guard, it gets moved to an adjacent district without any losses.
[*]Bugged AI: On the campaign map, the AI sometimes gets stuck. It never attacks an enemy, even when it has strength 1 districts next to it. The Orc computer player i mentioned before hasn't left its 3 districts for over 10 turns, even tough it could steamroll its neighbors with 9 honor guard units. 
[/list]
Another major problem are the nonsensical difficulty levels. There are 3 levels: Easy, normal and hard. Easy and normal are boring because it’s almost impossible to lose because of the huge hitpoint buffs your units get. Hard difficulty is a different story. Your units don’t get any buffs and the computer player gets 20% extra hitpoints. This slight advantage for the computer makes it extremely hard to deal with its immortal honor guard units, which will be in your base like 1min after game start. So you have the choice between boringly easy and frustratingly hard.

When you combine the many new bugs and the nonsensical difficulty with the terrible unit path finding from the base game that Soulstorm hasn’t improved at all, you get a gameplay experience that is just frustrating most of the time. The previous Dawn of War addons were great, but this one is a mess.",1676792389,1676795401,False,10,0,0.664634168148040771,0,True,False,False

-> Still a big population playing the game
-> The PvE is really good, each factions a good range of units, which means hours of discovery and theorycrafting in skirmish mode.

[b]NOTE:[/b] This covers the campaigns only, not the skirmish or multiplayer modes.

Dawn of War: Soulstorm is the final expansion for the original game. Following up and expanding on Dark Crusade and the new mechanics introduced therein, Soulstorm makes some relatively minor but far-reaching changes to the gameplay, and many seem to not be for the better. Similar to its predecessor, Soulstorm plays like a game of Risk - only this time, there are four distinct planets in a system across which the conflict is spread. There are also two new factions to contend with: the Dark Eldar (which do not add much to the mix in my opinion), and the Sisters of Battle (which seem to be pretty OP, at least in campaign mode). Flying units have also been added to all races except for the Necrons - which also do not really add much to the mix; the maps do not seem to have been designed with this in mind. Mission wise, the addition of Take and Hold conditions, where you need to hold critical locations for a certain amount of time to win, is a welcome change to the normal ""Annihilate"" mission objective and does help to vary the pace.

With that being said, there are some regressions (you decide how much these matter):
[list]
    [*]I had issues with capturing points; often your army will stand around and do nothing - might have to do with army size. To be fair, I experienced this in Dark Crusade as well, just not as often.
    [*]I often lost track of my cursor on the screen, especially when it was busy - there may be a mod to address this, but nothing in the native settings.
    [*]Three warring Imperial factions does not sit well with me (Dark Crusade already left a bit of a sour taste). Surely that is not right?
    [*]The lack of characterisation of the leaders is disappointing, especially when contrasted with Dark Crusade (although Gorgutz is still funny, with the few lines he has). The interplay between warring faction leaders was a high point in the previous game.
    [*]Perhaps most importantly - your structures no longer remain when defending territory. This becomes INCREDIBLY annoying as you essentially have to start from scratch in defense missions. Why would your buildings not be in place if you already hold territory? Thankfully, this can be addressed to a degree with a mod (more below).
[/list]
These factors add up to take the edge off Soulstorm for me, but they can be mitigated to a degree with mods.

[b][u]Mods[/u][/b]

I avoided any major or total overhaul mods. My playthroughs consisted of the below:
[list]
    [*]Soulstorm Bugfix Mod (https://www.moddb.com/mods/soulstorm-bugfix-mod/downloads).
    [*]Better Camera Mod (https://www.moddb.com/games/dawn-of-war-soulstorm/addons/camera-mod-for-dow) - default is too zoomed in for my liking.
    [*]Persistent Campaign Bases Mod (https://www.moddb.com/games/dawn-of-war/downloads/soulstorm-persistent-campaign-bases-mod-v14) - this helps a great deal to reduce frustration when defending provinces.
[/list]
Ordinarily, you can only have one mod active at a time - but by using the Mod Manager (https://github.com/Fragjacker/DoW-Mod-Manager), you can bypass this by essentially making one mod a requirement for the other, so that both are loaded. Exercise caution though, as you can create problems if using this method with big mods. More help can be found at the PCGamingWiki page: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War:_Soulstorm

Finally, I experienced crashes at the end of every campaign but this helped to get the game going again: https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/krz92u/fix_to_the_failed_to_initialize_video_card_pop_up (essentially, overwrite the files in the folder from the archive, reinitialise, and go again).

As to the age-old question of Dark Crusade or Soulstorm: on balance, I would say Dark Crusade. It is a bit bland, feels like development was rushed and it lacks the charm and engagement of the previous games (in vanilla guise). That being said, Soulstorm is still Dawn of War, and you cannot go far wrong with it.

Played on Windows 11 Pro x64 with a handful of crashes.

EDIT: I also experienced fatal scar errors past a certain point, it turned out to be a problem with one of the mod files. Checking the console should tell you which file/mod is causing the error (think it was the Campaign Bases in my case), and following https://steamcommunity.com/app/9450/discussions/0/2995421083783037822 helped to fix it for me.",1675678195,1675678477,True,7,0,0.60161888599395752,0,True,False,False

Though Dawn of war dark crusade, is still my favourite but Soulstorm is still really fun. My only minor complaint is i think the campaign map doesn't look as cool as Dark Crusade. But as i said that's my own thoughts.

But overall i still think Soulstorm is a really fun game and is worth it.

+ A classic RTS game.
+ Lots of factions to choose from. ([i]With all other D.O.W games included [/i])
+ Community is still going strong.

[b] The Negative's [/b]
- Multiplayer server connection issues/connecting issues.
- The Dark Elder were introduced in this game.

[b] The Singleplayer Aspect [/b]
You can play one of [strike] had to google this [/strike] nine races In a risk turn style campaign where your one goal is galaxy dominations! You start in specific zone to your race slowly growing and fighting your way through every faction to be the last faction standing. Every time you fight a different faction you put in a loading screen and play a 1v1 with that faction on a map. Depending how many units you attack with is how easy or hard it will be to take out the enemy base. The singleplayer aspect is very fun to get some practice in for when you play multiplayer. 

[b] The Multiplayer Aspect [/b]
The majority of this game I have played I have played with friends. You can play against AI or with players depending on how you feel. It's an old game so expect connection problems every often. There's a great chance when you launch up the multiplayer tab of the game you will find online match's to join if you don't have friends just expect to get bodied for going against try hards. 

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
If your going buy this game then you better own all the other Dawn Of War 1 games because buying it alone otherwise just isn't worth it. With all the other down of war expansion games combined it's worth the price.

Sadly things did not go as well as I hoped they would. The first issue I ran into was I couldn't get the game to run at 1920 x 1080. That's unfortunate. But I still had a lot of fun with the story and the run through Dawn of War was a lot of fun. Entertaining story and the combat was great.

I then moved on to the DLC. Starting with the Winter Assault. At first I was having fun, I decided to play the bad guys and goodness, they have you jump through some strange balancing act hoops to complete missions. The story felt lacking. It wasn't as good as I remembered it. Maybe I played the good guys. The DLC was okay. 

Then I came to the spiral... I must have mentally blocked the next 2 DLCs. I could have sworn they were good but.... Both seem to have little to no story and you fight on what appears to be just multiplayer maps. It was the start of the lazy developer phase. What was considered balancing was limiting unit types and everything seemed to come across as tanky. I mean, heavy bolters against guardsman should melt them right? Think again. Not even with tech maxed. It all felt spongy. 

Dark Crusade and Soulstorm are just wash, rinse, repeat grind as you fight to secure the map for your faction. On normal the AI feels tanky, but not unbeatable. This made these 2 DLCs feel like a time sink and not as entertaining. 

I would highly recommend the first Dawn of War. I wouldn't bother with the DLC. They just try to ruin the experience you had playing the first one.",1672447201,1672447201,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Dawn of War got the formula for right on RTS to me where combat is central and fighting occurs on many fronts all the time with some large swings possible. If any complaint, it is that Adeptus Mechanicus are not in the game as a faction due to the age of DoW 1

I highly recommend the series, as it can lead to addicting hours of play, alone or with friends. It is friendly with many computers of all ages, and there are good mods that can extend how much you play this game. (Ultimate Apocalypse is my favorite mod, as it is more fluff friendly.) Recommended for those new to the universe and those who are veterans in the galaxy of war. Fight in His Glorious name, the God-Emperor of Mankind, or for the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, or even perhaps in the name of the Xenos who fight for their own ends. You decide, and you shall carve into history. 
    The story of the series is wonderful in itself, although not as grand or as well told as the first or Winter Assault. Dark Crusade and Soulstorm non the less allow for a fun twist of domination for the sector. They tie in slightly with the Dawn of War II series, but are not necessary for DoW II. 

(Note: Multiplayer comes with its own race from each game. GotY/Gold gives Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos. Winter Assault grants the Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade allows for Tau and Necrons. Soulstorm itself grants the zealous Sisters of Battle and the dreaded Dark Eldar. If you also get the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod, you receive more units in each faction, as well as adding the Ordo Maleus' Daemon Hunters and the Tyranids.)",1438460311,1672004930,True,1,1,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

Let me elaborate a little:

Soulstorm has a campaign that is a slightly increased scale rehash of Dark Crusade's. The balancing is awful, the writing is laughable and has spawned many memes, it's riddled with unfixed bugs, and there's just a general lack of quality going on here likely caused by the outsourcing of development to a third party rather than being made by Relic itself.

[b]HOWEVER.[/b] Soulstorm is the home of some extremely high quality modifications that add an insane level of detail to the game and in some cases also increase the scale to Epic 40k levels. They're amazing experiences that every 40k and RTS fan should experience, and if you have any experience with other Dawn of War games or pre-Soulstorm expansions, I highly recommend picking this up just so you can play those modifications.

Despite being the newest, it has the most issues running on current systems, with for example the campaign not being playable for me, because the game crashes when ending the first battle. From what I heard, there's other issues, from smaller to larger that I haven't encountered, but you may. 

Aside from that, it is definitely the most derivative, and is more like a unit and map pack to Dark Crusade, rather than being a true expansion in line with Winter Assault, and the mentioned DC. It adds two new factions - space marines, but women, and even edgier eldar. The campaign, on first glance, looks to have expanded in scope, but in actuality, although it claims to be taking place on multiple planets, still only really has one grand map, and the amount of provinces is still roughly the same as in DC. The last addition are ""air"" units, which are really just land units floating in the air, largely constricted by the same map accessibility limitations, but somehow with even worse pathfinding than regular land units.

All in all, Soulstorm is quite a soulless experience. Dawn of War released in 2004, WA in 2005 and DC in 2006... and then Cashgrabstorm in 2008 because I guess the publisher wanted to cash in on the still very popular game. Still though, the basic Dawn of War / Dark Crusade game loop applies, so if you get it as part of the whole DoW package, there's no reason not to try it out, just don't expect anything extra from it and go in with the understanding that the campaign may not work at all and you will be restricted to skirmish and multiplayer.

On it own though, it definitely cannot be recommended, even with its current price.

HOWEVER.
1) it's so buggy. The AI on units seems to have been broken by the studio that made Soulstorm. Units get stuck on each other far more often, but also there's a bug where cycling through e.g. builder units selects them all, without pressing any modifier or extra button. You're wondering why your building in the back isn't finished - it's because the builder unit making it ran across the map to join his friend. Also Units are weirdly sticky with targeting. The whole interface just feels broken. Not to mention the crashes and general instability.
2) The story is lazy and poorly made. This is not Dark Crusade, it's scuffed.
3) The unit balancing is poor and they even managed to mess up things that made Dark Crusade great. Persistent buildings between battles are gone, no more benefit for exploring the entire map in the story campaign. The graphics somehow seem worse, with the charm stripped.

This game, and many of the games in the series meant more to me growing up than I'll ever be able to adequately express. Dawn of War came out in 2004 and it was revolutionary, a game from that time with mechanics and graphics that blew a lot of things people were used to out of the water; rich in lore and immersive as all hell. I'm sure I don't have to go into detail about all the ways this games core mechanics were astounding, or how the Campaign was magnificent, I know for a fact there are many people who can explain all of this better than I ever could.

Many people review games based on their nostalgia and their own experiences, so I'll make the honest attempt at explaining just how much this series has meant to me throughout my life, and why I can't recommend it enough.

When I was quite young, I'd experienced quite a few traumatising incidences that made me  very ostracised growing up. I was given Dawn of War by my parents and this game helped me find an escape from a lot of the turmoil I'd felt daily, and it offered me a bit of respite where I could find none in sleep. 

I've had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for almost as long as I can remember, and through this game I actually managed to meet some of my first friends in school as they were very like-minded with Warhammer, and I was even able to get through my days easier. I'd found an outlet for a lot of my grief and anger, and it allowed me to find some form of relaxation in a time where I was nearly always debilitatingly anxious, even playing it to the point of falling asleep, something I'd often struggled with as I had, and still have quite terrible nightmares. 

I'd proceeded to buy almost every Warhammer 40k or Warhammer Fantasy game that came out on sheer principle alone, and whilst the games changed drastically, I've always been a steadfast fan, to the point that my next tattoo is going to be Warhammer related.

This game series meant a lot to me, from allowing me to make some of my first connections to people, to being one of the driving forces in my appreciation for storytelling and voice acting. Because of this, Warhammer 40k will always be my favourite franchise. 

I do wish Games Workshop would've listened to their fans, and stuck with the direction their games had started with, and managed to maintain their upwards trajectory as a company. Dawn of War 3 was fundamentally disappointing, but the first game, and the games leading up to Dawn of War Retribution will always be great games, and the Dawn of War series will forever remain a pillar of the RTS genre.",1495833391,1669371935,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]11-22-2022 REVIEW UPDATE:[/h1]

As coming back to this review I will say this has definitely earned to absolutely be my top favorite Real Time Strategy genre game out there, with tons secret stuff [spoiler]MODDING and making MODS[/spoiler] to do in this game I discovered, I've been just completely hooked on playing this game since lock-downs happened in 2020, I've come a long ways with what I discovered to do in this game.  I have much more to learn and master at, [spoiler]I even just released an update to a mod I made for this game in the Steam Community page as well. 
 It's called ""[b]J.S.T.'s Original PDF-IG From DoW-GotY DoW-S Mod[/b]"" guide page[/spoiler] you can check it out if you're curious enough about it.  :)

As for the base vanilla Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm game itself, I will honestly uphold it as something I come back to in RTS, it's a real fun way of getting into the Warhammer 40,000 lore, or at least glimpse of it that is.  This expansion also has the most variety of factions/races to be in Single Player mode, Offline Skirmish mode as well, on top with having all of the previous expansions you get to be all 9 factions in online Multiplayer Mode.  Relic Entertainment did a fantastic job at making these games, this expansion [strike][i]would probably have been so much more if they didn't leave Iron Lore to work on it by themselves, but Iron Lore you guys/gals did your best considering R.E. left you all to work on this game.[/i][/strike] especially has a lot new stuff compared to its previous expansions.

Dawn of War is one of the best RTS of all time. The animations are amazing, the graphics are dated but incredibly cool, tanks with mobile parts galore, absurd firefights with massive volume of fire and chunky, visceral sounds make playing Dawn of War and its expansions an absolute treat.

There are some amazing mods for this game, off the top of my head:
Ultimate Apocalypse (my favourite),
2gb patch mod
Titanium wars
and
Unification Mod, which combines:
Bugfix mod
Almost every race mod
Extended view cam
Stronghold Mod
and Survival, the art of defence.

Unmodded however, just get Dark Crusade, unless you intend to play multiplayer, in which case, races are locked until you buy the relevant DLCs, and this games campaign is the weakest of the DOW franchise (excluding DOW 3, which is a bad game through and through), the balance of this game in skirmish mode, excluding the air units, is better than Dark Crusade, Dawn Of Eldar.

If you can mod this game, get it, it's amazing modded, and the balance for skirmish mode is better than dark crusade, but its campaign is the worst of the bunch, and if you intend to play multiplayer, get all of the DOW1 games or use a race unlocker mod.

Main thing is it nerfs the necrons in dark crusade a bit which is needed, and I think the map layout for planet(s) conquest is better due to having multiple planets separated by webway portals for balance. However visually it's less appealing due to taking up less screen space. Oh also super annoying on defense engagements that unlike dark crusade your buildings are not saved.

Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Soulstorm is the sequel to Dark Crusade. And to start with, I will not divide this review into chapters, because it's not worth it. It is basically a copy of the previous game, the only thing different about this is that apparently the evolution in Dawn of War is going backwards. Nothing has been fixed, it's actually even worse. In the very intro of the game, one of the important characters from the previous game just dies. The Battle Sisters and Dark Eldar appear on the battlefield, and they genuinely bored me with their mechanics. Somehow it felt like they were slightly detached from the other factions (I would prefer the Tyranids). And now the Tau are wearing bright red armor. I don't know why, it looks a bit silly (and the Necrons are now black and bright blue, it also looks very strange). Battle maps were pissing me off, for some reason I can never find an enemy base, and every battle takes a lot of time by forcing me to search for the enemy all over the map, and the tiny font and shit camera don't help me with this. Cutscenes are okay, but you can quickly guess that they did not want to fine-tune them and ultimately when watching them you feel confused and bored, they lack spirit. And what about the most important asset to this game, the campaign map, now the size of several planets connected by the Eldar gates? From the first point of view, it sounds great. But you quickly notice the absolute stupidity of the AI that mindlessly rushes into a fight, and a shitty balance of the game, which makes it either too easy or too damn hard to do anything. The fact that the game is unstable and often crashes to the desktop does not help, forcing us to play larger battles again and again without end. And don't get me wrong, most of the positive things from the previous game show up here as well, but it doesn't balance with what was broken and done poorly.

The base game is fine alone, but with the free mod ""DoW Ultimate Apocolopyse"", this game quickly puts itself on par and above current games. 

It feels great as an underdog to build a steady defence that evolves into a rolling attack over enemy territory, especially against the Orks and Blood Ravens. The campaign is engaging and straightforward, destroy the enemy and reinforce your domain so they can't push back. Still, the wargear customisation and in-game battles are stellar. 

There's a wide variety of units and different factions to play around with, from the Imperium heavy armour and large unit count to the Sisters of Battle specialised units with specialised weapons and tactics. I have a lot of fun playing as and playing against all of the factions.

The only negative with the game I can find is that some non-HQ maps are annoying to see twice.

Campaign is alright, although removal of banter and map design both stick out as sore thumbs. I also regularly got crashes at the end of the citadels, which cost me in total about 3 hours until I remembered to save at the end.

+Everything that applies to the base game applies to this as well - so it's an amazing classic RTS experience
+Lots of factions with tons of unique units, mechanics, strategies and so on. And pretty much every major race except the Tyranids is playable
+Tons of maps
+Aircraft finally
+I don't have to sell half my organs and my soul to the chaos gods to have a proper army

Cons:
-The camera is very good but it's still way too close in the most zoomed out state - with a lot of units, their range is so long that you can't have the unit and the thing it's firing at on screen at the same time
-The population limits are too low in my opinion. It's way too...well, limiting. Let me amass a massive army if I want to!

The campaign is fun, with the unique missions at strongholds which are very fun and unique. Each faction has their own starting trait which you can unlock, each of them fit the faction very well. 

For gameplay, it's the same as before, just with air craft that work mostly fine. Mostly. When they get stuck it's super annoying and feels like a waste when you see your super expensive plane stuck on a cliff side. Sisters are an amazing anti infantry faction with flame throwers and are one of my favourite factions (other ones being Eldar and Guard). Dark Eldar have some very fun unique mechanics with the Slaves and Souls. 

Base game is a 8.5/10. Where it gets to 10/10 is with the sheer amount of mods.

Mods for this game are great. If you want base game with more factions, you can add unique faction mods (Deamons, Tyranids, Dark Angels, Blood Angles, etc.). If you want titans and massive battles, Ultimate Apocalypse and the many sub mods are there. If you want a middle ground with many different options and new game modes, Unification is there.

- Used artillery incorrectly.

- Overran a group of genetic supersoldiers with a endless sea of tiny ant like creatures. 
- Recovered the morale of my own men by having their commanding officer chant ""The Emprah protects.""
- Recovered the morale of my own men by having their commanding officer shoot one of them in the head.
- Recovered the morale of my own men by having them scream Russian war chants. (WAAAAGGGGHHHH).
- Used magic to fight railguns.
- Used railguns to fight magic. 
- Sent highly attractive elf-ladies with lightsabres (?) to fight literally anything and anyone. While screaming.
- Built a titan.
- Built tactical nuke launcher.

- Lost legions of tanks to individual command staff. 
- Fought robotic zombies.

I like how my first review for this was ""funny"" but whatever. Yes, bitch and moan all you want over my review but Soulstorm is the worst expansion in the series. Dawn of War 3 is more desirable than the vanilla soulstorm expansion.

First off this comes out after the amazing campaign of Winter Assault, and the groundbreaking Dark Crusade. Crusade was Warhammer at its ABSOLUTE finest. The maps were incredible, the new factions were diverse and unique, and the sandbox storytelling actually had me intrigued. Then in the online mode, there was just a mountain of ways to take down your opponent which lead to every experience being a thrill ride of fun. I played orks because I could rush the free ork tech. Spam Orky boyz at the problems i wanted to go away, and then use all my ork vehicles to hit critical targets while my opponents were ground down in my never ending green tide.

Enter Soulstorm. The campaign is nonsensical and has 1/1000th of the effort put in. The story is a Warpstorm is coming to wipe out the system and everyone has a plan to prepare for the coming end times. Seems like a cool premise like Endless Legend. However its executed horribly like when Chaos laughs that people hide in tanks ""METAWL BAWKSES"" and its just such bad voice over work you just cant stop laughing.

The maps are so terrible in every possible way. Many of them are Asymmetrical which just leads to you trying to outspam the AI to wipe out their base which is immediately next to you your own base. Its less about exploring and map control, and more like watching creeps fight in league of legends. Additionally, look at maps in dawn of war, winter assault, and dark crusade. They have tiny little details everywhere that makes each map look like an intricate and exciting place to explore. Its truly fun fighting it out. 

There's a couple maps that seems like they started to try on, but the vast majority of new maps look like they pulled them from a community map pool. They are lazy blob messes, they look gross and the immersion is ruined when you see error cubes, pink blobs, and low res textures being stretched across the map, and this happens on a staggering amount of new maps.

Next up, the game was balanced for a tried and true formula. Infantry and Mechanized combat. Infantry can be specialized to take down all kinds of opponents, and really it was just constantly equipping and gearing up your soldiers for ground combat. However, Games Workshop released small Flying Units to table top when Soulstorm was in development and demanded each faction get a single flying unit as an advertisement for what you could experience if you played with plastic crack on tabletop. The flying units pretty much negate 95% of the games diversity and it just devolves into sneaking flying units around to execute your opponent. Yeah you can ""try"" to bunker up, but now you have to build all your turrets inside your base instead of building outposts to hold resource nodes, or creating choke points you can out maneuver. Additionally, its ONE singular flying unit per faction. Theres no new buildings or defenses, there isnt a wide variety of flying units. Each faction gets their 1 flying unit and thats it. So spam that 1 unit away. Isnt it fun to only use one unit in a Real Time Strategy game, and everyone practically gets the SAME unit so all these diverse factions are now defined by ONE unit being spammed. Great design choice.

Lastly, multiplayer was dead on arrival as Necrons had balance issues for a long time. But when Soulstorm dropped, Imperial Guard were god tier. IG infantry could drop space marines and necrons like it was a cakewalk. Grenade launchers and artillery pieces pretty much locked down every faction like it was nothing, add in flying units and pretty much just cover your face because a beating is coming. The new factions were awful, sisters of battle were designed to be a close range moral breaking faction that did neither very well. They didnt have the health to back them up and having to run at grenade launchers and arty spam while trying to fight planes doesnt work well for the nuns with guns. The Dark Eldar I saw as just completely useless, I could never figure out what they were supposed to be good at. I think they were terror hit and run tactics, but they pretty much died where ever they go. They have none of the advantages of Eldar (who can turn invisible and drop people from range) and just overall a disappointing faction to play.

My last gripe was the models. In dawn of war and winter assault, everything looked like it fit together. The models look good on the maps, and the new Imperial Guard fit in perfect with the old model design. Dark Crusade, the new models like the tau and necrons certainly pushed that line, but everything looked great together and the immersion was great. Then in Soulstorm, the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar had 100x the animations and detail that made them look like overproduced modded factions next to the models of the older titles. They stood out like a sore thumb and funny enough made the game look even worse than before. The space marines seemed low res and outdated, the imperial guard seemed stiff and blocky, even the necrons and tau couldnt hold a torch to these new factions. Then you throw either of these factions on the new horrible maps, and its just a mess.

If you read this long ass review, again I do recommend this game. But please find mods to play with it. Unification Wars is a colossal project that while still plagued by balance issues is a much more fun 40k sandbox experience. But theres a wide variety of mods that do fix a lot of this crap in the game (my favorite being all the mods that REMOVE garbage flying units.)",1386899290,1660143781,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is still the same, build up base, amass army and take out the enemy. Faction capitals requiring a bit more nuanced approach, though.

You can exterminate everyone you want as anyone you want, so this is a pretty varied experience. Downside is still that controlling armies is a hassle and the unit cap cant let you go crazy. Some technical issues due to its age are also prevalent.

Soul storm acts as the definitive version of DoW. While the campaign is actually hot garbage and just lazy spin of Dark Crusade, Soulstorm balances the entire game to near perfection (Necrons still are crazy) and the multiplayer while scarce is extremely fun. Soulstorm also adds Dark Eldar and Adeptus Soriatus, both factions I don’t personally care for even though I’m a 40k fan, but they are a nice edition. The modding for this game is incredible supporting both Unification and Apocalypse (Two mods I highly reccomend) If you were to get DoW I would highly recommend you pick this up whether it son sale or not.

No other strategy game I've played has as much of a trench warfare feel as this game.  The emphasis on zone control makes for excellent gameplay and avoids the monotony of some RTS games where it is very easy to just rush the enemy base.  The unit rosters of each faction are unique and interesting, allowing for lots of different strategies and forcing you to mix up your tactics according to which faction you are facing.  The very best troops are hard to get and usually only come out in long, even matches, but serve well to break up the stalemate.  The voice acting and visual effects are great and iconic, especially considering how old this game is.

Depending on the difficulty the enemy will either barely conquer anything or actually expand its territories. Still, this game is the complete package for the original Dawn of War.

(Single player review) Every species and faction from the previous Dawn of War main game + Expansions, with two new factions and a campaign that is almost a copy of Dark Crusade. Which is a good thing, considering how much fun Dark Crusade was with the added burden of choices and a persistent battlefield. 
The two new factions possess enough uniqueness to make them viable alternatives to the series mainstays. I've personally come to prefer the Sisters of Battle over Chaos due to the Sister's faith mechanic, where faith serves as a resource for various units to use for healing and attack bonuses in addition to whatever normal abilities the units possess. The Sisters also have a much greater reliance on melee and flame-based weapons compared to many of the other factions. I personally have no interest in the Dark Eldar, but the new faction's soul-harvesting mechanic dosen't sound like anything the other factions have.
My only real complaint agianst Soulstorm is that the additions to the single player campain seem poorly planed. Firstly, there's very little in the way of additions from Dark Crusade, but this isn't automatically a bad thing. What is troublesome, however, is that the main change, a move from a single planet battlefield to multiple, dosen't allow for zoom or any perspective changes. This means you may encounter difficulty seeing areas of the main battle map, where you view your territories and the territories of your enemies, at higher resolutions. Some tactical planning may be hampered by this, but this is not a large complaint.
If you have any interest in 40k, or if you are tired of Dark Crusade, or even if you just want to see a mostly-female (not all female, for some reason) human faction (I can't tell when it comes to the Eldar, but I guess they're female, too), pick up this game.  You don't need the other Dawn of War 1 games unless you really like space marine (Dawn of War base game) or Imperial Guard (Winter Assualt) plotlines. You will need the other games to unlock the other factions in multiplayer (already have all factions unlocked for any and all single player aspects).",1389078498,1655830546,True,23,1,0.648369133472442627,1,True,False,False

The graphics may be a bit outdated by today's standards but the gameplay is still stunningly beautiful, fun, and bloody. The story line is also great and immersive. The most unique thing about the Dawn of War series is the fact that it has Sync-kills (or killing animations) for many individual units, even guardsmen and fire warriors who suck in melee!

I also forgot to mention that this is to this day the best Warhammer 40k RTS video game to come out in the last two decades. I hope we get Dawn of War 3 before i die.

Kinda.

I'm using Windows 10. The game is not entirely compatible with widescreen aspect ratios, and you will find yourself extremely zoomed in, compared with how these games used to play on 4:3 monitors. There is a fix! I installed this mod https://www.moddb.com/games/dawn-of-war-soulstorm/addons/camera-mod-for-dow/ which starts at a distance that matches the 4:3 gameplay, but also allows further zooming out (the view is obstructed by atmospheric mist effect, so it's not totally OP to do this). Some HUD elements are also stretched for widescreen, but nothing too horrific.

Crashes - playing the campaign, when you defeat a stronghold, the game will crash. The solution is to save the game part way through the level, exit to the top menu, reload save. It will be fixed. There is no auto-save, and some other crashes, so save often.

Pathing - a problem with the entire DoW1 series was squads getting tangled up in one another and getting stuck. That's probably the biggest gameplay issue of this game/series.

Otherwise, very strong classic RTS. The recorded voice lines in this series are pretty great. If you can get past the needs for modding and frequent saving, then I can recommend.

You've got the Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, and Chaos from the original Dawn of War, you've got the Imperial Guard from Winter Assault, the Necrons and Tau from Dark Crusade, and the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar new to Soulstorm itself. That's not even getting into stuff like the Unification mod... The campaign, like Dark Crusade, doesn't work like a typical linear RTS campaign. Instead, you and the eight factions you didn't choose are trying to take territory from each other across four planets. You each take turns moving your forces to different territories to attack and defend, with most territorial battles being what amount to skirmish games. The exception is strongholds, which, as the name suggests, are very heavily defended and will each take the better part of an hour to conquer AT LEAST without speedrun-esque shenanigans. 

Each stronghold has a few gimmicks up its sleeve, like the SPESS MEHREENS having a bunch of beacons to call down drop pods for defensive strikes or the Imperial Guard constantly sending convoys of Baneblade parts that will lead to a super-tank very quickly knocking on your door if you don't stop them (among way too many other things... yeah fuck the IG stronghold in particular.) Each faction has a unique power to aid in their conquests, with you getting the other factions' powers when you take their stronghold (To give an example, the Sisters of Battle can establish forward bases, essentially letting you get a head start on your base building at the start of a mission, while Orks can have their territories start to garrison themselves for free.)

Haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but from the videos I've seen there is a decent variety of strategies to go for depending on factions and map. You also get to make your own custom color schemes for your armies, a nice way of acknowledging 40k's origins as a tabletop wargame.",1654464567,1654464567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Us old RTS farts will normally refer to Starcraft 1 as ""Brood War"", which is the expansion name, to make clear that it doesn't make sense to play the game without the expansion. I believe the exact same should apply to ""Dawn of War 1"", it should be called ""Soulstorm"" instead. Because Soulstorm is a completely different animal.

The thing is, now after playing it, I realize Soulstorm is one of the best games of all time. Certainly the best Warhammer 40K videogame ever made.

Sounds like an exaggerated thing to say, right? But I think I am not alone. Just do a search for the Warhammer 40K tag in the Steam charts. See, first of all, just how many W40K games there are, and how many players each game has, and see how this game from 2008 is still at the top of the chart.

If we need to get still into more details, the levels of ambition in this game are off the charts: 4x style campaign mode, now with multiple planets, they added flying vehicles, and why not throw in yet another two factions with more unique mechanics, for an unheard-of 9 factions total. And yes, this means that the campaign narrative covers the combinations of you eliminating any of the other 8 factions, while playing as any of the 9 factions that are available.

I understand that people would like there to be a remaster of this game, but to me that seems an insurmountable task. This game, like Forged Alliance, is a great use case for Proton (in which it runs great) and game preservation. Because, let's be real, there will never again be a group of developers so crazy, with so much money and free time, to make a game like this (or Forged Alliance).

Anyway, works out of the box with all the FPS you need and more. The graphics can be improved nowadays, but keep in mind it's a game from 2008.

With that out of the way, let's talk about what this game is all about: cooking. One of our shiny new factions, the sisters of battle, will take you by the hand, as you learn new and exciting recipes. Ask our sister prior about her roasted ork. Inferno pistol will make wonders for cooking rare Eldar. Learn some new ways to flambé T'au with the help of the Immolator, our shiny new kitchen appliance. Team up with the sisters repentia and the penitent engine, to learn the secrets of thin, rare dark Eldar cuts.

Enjoy your meal!

I mainly play skirmish mode but there is also a campaign mode and a special game mode where you travel and conquer the galaxy in the game through a world map.

Custom map support so you can have a wide variety of maps.
Install unification mod for a total of 26 races.
 Also highly recomend the Ultimate Apocalypse mod and custom maps if you want more/different content after playing the normal soulstorm expansion.

Dawn of War: Soulstorm, the third expansion in the Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War series Released right in the middle of an RTS renaissance,  Soulstorm has a considerable amount to satisfy. Being the last development to one of my #1 RTS arrangement ever increases present expectations essentially higher, and I expected a serious masterpiece to cover off the mind blowing DoW: Dark Crusade. Did it convey? Fairly. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124875607

Soulstorm adds 2 new races (carrying the complete to 8), airplane, and a mission map about twice as extensive as that in the Dark Crusade development. At the end of the day, the danger map utilized by the past extension has been extended to include four planets rather than only one. On paper, this all appears to be standard toll for a RTS extension. It is more noteworthy than that in specific territories, and undeniably less in others. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631607805 

On the pitiful side, the whole mission map feels like a downsized adaptation of the one in Dark Crusade. Gone are the point by point armed force markers and domain pictures, supplanted by flickering symbols and a by and large awkward feel. Try not to misunderstand me, the battlemap all in all looks really wonderful - like something you'd set as your work area foundation - it simply feels like somebody made it out of mud. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631607713 

On the brilliant side, the designers have figured out how to remember boatloads of new substance for the type of composing, voiceover, and prerecorded cut scenes. This substance capacities in the very same manner it did in Dark Crusade; each race has an interesting arrangement of story connections with restricting races over the span of a mission, giving the game nice replay esteem. Additionally, the definite domain ""chronicles"" are back, giving every situation map a smidgen of additional character. 

Furthermore, for the top to bottom look: 

The option of airplane is intriguing however adds a tentatively low measure of measurement to the game. Airplane are simply unendingly ""jetpacking"" vehicles. Each more established race gets one new airplane unit. Unadulterated scuffle units are unequipped for assaulting airplane, and accordingly each race counters airplane with range units and their own airplane. 

The two new races, the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, are genuinely unmistakable. I say ""fairly"" on the grounds that the Sisters of Battle are a cross between the Imperial Guard and Blood Ravens races while the Dark Eldar are an alteration of the Eldar. One exceptionally intriguing expansion to every one of these races are amazing spells filled by extraordinary asset types. The Sisters of Battle gather ""Faith"" to project these spells/powers on adversaries or companions. Confidence spells are projected by certain ""Unwavering Units"" who additionally end up being the units that produce said confidence. The Dark Eldar use their own ""God Powers"" by gathering spirits, blue masses left over from murdered units or gathered from the Dark Eldar torment structures. Their spells are projected from a toolbar at the lower part of the screen. 

Dawn of War's incredible designs motor takes into account extraordinary strategic profundity. 

The AI in Soulstorm may feel somewhat powerless contrasted with that in Dark Crusade, particularly if players are utilizing their supported race from past games. More established players or RTS addicts should presumably set the trouble to high for a midlevel challenge. It feels like AI hostility in Home Territory fights was diminished somewhat, which makes things somewhat simpler. 

Online multiplayer is populated with around 10-20 games accessible to participate in the hall at some random time. Automatch highlights are incorporated, and the stand by will be more limited or longer utilizing this component dependent on the number of individuals are near. 

Girl Power!

Generally, Dawn of War: Soulstorm doesn't add anything truly notable to the Dawn of War equation. What it adds are two convincing new races and another, content-filled mission. Any fanatic of the arrangement should go out and get a duplicate. Players new to the arrangement ought to likewise feel genuinely great, however I suggest playing the past games* and making the most of their separate commitments to the arrangement prior to putting $39.99 in Soulstorm. 


+ Interesting new races, the Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle.
+ More content in the new Campaign.
+ Scantily clad warrior-women.

- The metamap feels clunky.
- AI is a little weak against good players.
- It costs $10 more than the rest of the entire series combined.

Pros
- Lotsa gameplay hours in campaign, skirmish, and multiplayer. 9 races that all play differently from each other with their own campaign starts makes an intensly replayable campaign.
- Skirmish/multiplayer are highly customizable, thanks to cosmetic changes in a suprisingly in depth army painter with even a way to add custom badges and banners (only downside is that if someone can throw in a hail hortler, they will invariably throw a hail hortler. You may see a few badges or banners you won't like), and gameplay ones with varying maps in size and theme, as well as changeable win conditions, team fights, etc.
- Gameplay is fun and is fairly tutorialized, so learning isn't hard at any speed. 
- The modding scene is somewhat famous as well as active, with every sort of overhaul and total conversion one can think of.
- due to being an old game, it runs fairly well on even low end machines. The artstyle is also good enough that the lack of fidelity can be forgiven

Cons:
- Of all the dow 1 campaigns, this is deffo the weakest. The RISK style campaign map doesn't really lend itself to good characterization, but Dark Crusade had character in spades. The map in Soulstorm is certainly bigger in Soulstorm, but certainly not better than Dark Crusade's. To further the RISK analogy, every planet is Australia, which makes planet hopping a royal pain in the ass to make planetfall on other parts of the Karuva system, so the only sensible thing to do is to turtle and build up forces for planetfall, making it rather boring, in comparison to Dark Crusade's smaller but far more dynamic campaign map.
- there are 9 races, but they are not made equal. Orks are considered by the community to be the weaker ones, space marines are cosidered passable at everything but great at nothing, Imperial guard are defensive masters, Necrons hit like a UPS truck but they manuver as gracefully as one, etc. Now this would be okay, with every race having strengths and weaknesses, if the eldar weren't *fuggin busted*. People back in the day had said that Relic were a bunch of eldar fanboys, and given this and other depictions of the eldar, I'm inclined to believe them. Fleet of foot still continues to dominate multiplayer with people playing eldar the way the orks were meant to play as, a massive death horde on rocket skates, but now you can't even really damage them. There is no bad way to play the Eldar, and it shows.
- depending on who you ask, this could be a plus. The amount of tech (in the Smash bros melee sense) in this game is deceptively large. You will get your butt curb stomped by strats that have been honed for nearing 2 decades now in the multiplayer. Good news is that they are not exactly hard to get due to most of them being down to squad composition, like space marine's high damage option being equipped with heavy bolters and stealthed scouts with plasma guns, and spamming the comissar's execute ability for a never ending damage and morale boost.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even with it's age, it's still very good.",1644422537,1644422537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The races are slightly imbalanced, however, on a big map with four plus players, this game becomes more intense as a strategy than any fast paced shooter. You micromanage like crazy, biuld units, attack, retreat ,upgrade , capture, hold, lose, take back, scout, use abilities (a mind blowing amount of them too)... And then an epic battle happens with giant Relic units and dozens of different troops and troop types. Even though DoW2 is better in physics and engine and etc. it does not have the same drive as this game... Speaking of Single player, Dark Crusade is probably the best, however for more in-depth experience I prefer the winter assault, although it is more linear.

The worst balance in RTS in hiostory: only in this game can the enemy AI build faster than you can kill him. Absolute trash.

This is truly a masterpiece of the strategy gaming world. Even if you are not really into Warhammer World but dig good strategies, you'll probably love this game. 

[h1]More read[/h1]
The immersive world of Warhammer 40k recreated in this game is definitely exciting and after playing Soulstorm you'll probably become a fan of Warhammer 40k. The multiplayer is not dead yet and you can play with other players still or set up your own session to play with friends or some randoms. I haven't encountered any cheaters during my playtime.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Given the fact it's from 2008, optimization and performance are subpar, I haven't crashed during most of my plays however if you play the multiplayer, startup bugs might occur, which abrupt a game session for some of the people in the lobby or even for all.

[h1]Mods[/h1]
Fps is capped. Image itself with the fonts doesn't scale to the modern resolutions - you [b]must[/b] tweak this yourself via mods and various tweaks.

[b]HEADS UP:[/b] 
[url=https://www.moddb.com/games/dawn-of-war-soulstorm/addons/camera-mod-for-dow] ""Better Camera Mod for DoW"" [/url] is essential. 

[url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod] ""The Ultimate Apocalypse Mod(UA)"" [/url] must be mentioned as well. This is the ultimate enhancement of the base game, which effectively adds an enormous amount of new content from the community to the game: new races, new units, new modes, unlimited armies, and the list goes on.

Personally, I believe it could be fully appreciated only if you have already been playing the base game long enough.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I do recommend buying only Soulstorm because it is the most complete and is essentially the ultimate installment of Dawn of War 1 game series.

[b]UPD:[/b] I don't believe that the very same people which brought us this great RTS game have created DOW 3, what a shame to disappoint so badly all fans of yours, Relic, in this greedy way.

Ok, I may be a bit biased as I do play the actual tabletop games.  But I will try to be as objective as possible.

I have played all 3 Dawn of War Games. I did not play the others as I have Soul Storm, as I feel this is what the other games should have been, unfortunatley Relic has deviated from the successful formula.  Soul Storm focus' mainly on building up your base, your forces, then going out to capture/contest objective points against enemy teams. While it has some research and economy elements, the focus is really more on combat and capturing points around the map. Depending on your faction , you will have different units suited to this task. Space marines are generally the most balanced, with Imperial Guard and Orks relying on vast amounts of units to fight their battles. Vehicles are also a available, and some factions vehicles really shines more against others. 

The Campaign is not bad, with a small backstory on the Kauruva subsystem. A warpstorm has overtaken the system and all the factions caught within are now engaged in a deathmatch against one another. I wont go into details about all the factions, but they got most of them portrayed correctly as far as I know (though they were missing a few from the universe, but thats ok) . The game has you taking parts of plants to conquer through small skirmishes , and grants you bonuses depending on which continents you have captured. The average play through I had was at least 10 hours per faction , which is nice as there is a lot of replayability. 

The base game is fun enough to give you lots of play-time , but the mods! Oh they really change the way the game plays, and it feels even more like Warhammer 40k! I especially enjoy the Ultimate Apocalypse and Unification mods the best. They add a ton of units to existing factions, and add new factions and subfactions. I.e Adeptus Mechanicus and Black Templars. You will have to do some downloading off steam , I got mine off ModDB, but its totally worth it if you have invested as much time as I have.

Just note, once you install these mods, they will increase the Unit capacity in-game, so likewise, will also increase system capacity. The System requirements listed will probably not be enough, but that shouldn't be a problem even with a low-end modern day computer. I'm running mine on an old FX 8370 with a gtx 770, and its usually fine, though it does stutter when hundreds of units are on screen fighting each other.

If you are a 40k fan, you must do yourself a favour and get this game. Even not on sale, its very affordable, more so that it would cost you a standard box of miniatures!",1640896907,1640897200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember when I bought Soulstorm as soon as it released on CD..hehe CD. I sound old now. I had the shiny new box with the purple casing and the beautiful purple CD that it came with. Loading it into my computer hoping my computer CD drive laser was not burned out enough to read the CD. It is a past time relaxing game for me. 

It is solid, has base building unlike the mistake of the Emperor Successor to Dawn of War 2 the [THRICE PURGED] that was supposed bring back Dawn of War. This game I still play and stream, sometimes with friends. I rage when I lose and I cry when sisters of battle burn my buildings with fire. It is with the love of fire, so I am satisfied with the destruction. The modding community has been a wonderful benefit in keeping this game alive. The developers had released the tools for the community to really improve the longevity of this work of art.

The game is neat in conception and you can tell where the developer's minds were at in production. Very few bugs, but most of the issues with this game is pathing, but I mean I could get over that for sync kill animations and voice overs. Ultimate Apocalypse Mod is probably the best mod for this game because Titans and Reavers are cool. 

My motto is ""if you like Tonka Trucks"" you'll love Ultimate Apocalypse Mod. The game really shines in squad base combat and managing your squads morale and setup against different factions. So, really knowing what to gear up against is going lose or win you that first battle. In this game, if you lose the first fight over your initial capture points, it is difficult to come back but possible. I just wish units would level up in this game and gain veterancy and be able to be upgraded to Sternguard or Exarchs at some point either during the match. Just my take on it.

The Entirety of Dawn of War RTS series brought me into this universe, and Gabriel Angelos is hopefully my Father. We don't mention the Commander of the Campaign for Soulstorm. His name is [Twice Redacted] and creates BOREALUM! 

-Just look at my hours. I could be doing something else but Speese Muhrines!
x-Soulstorms Campaign removed your ability to setup defenses for territories you conquered previously in Campaign mode. Big series minues here
-Spiffy RTS with squad based elements and moral implementation. You must always be aware of what your going against and what weapons the enemy is using against your forces. Morale no matter what weapon will kill your army no matter how strong. ***Unless you have a squad with no morale factor and those are far and few between.
-The story for the whole Dawn of War Series up to Dawn of War 2 is apart of Cannon! Awesome.
-Graphics are dates but its doable because of the quality in this series
x-Base game Sisters of Battle/Dark Eldar are a bit OP but can be dealt with if you focus on rushing commanders and anti tank units first.
-Downside is Skirmish AI up to difficulty Harder seems to die when it checks if you are stronger than it. The AI literally gives up and dies if you have more resources or units than them.
-This game actually provides actual AI difficulty. Yes, the AI starts out with more resources in Skirmish but the AI will literally beat you into the ground if you let it. Especially at insane difficulty. It is pure AI being smarter with no actual bonus rate bonuses to the AI on any difficulty. They just start out with more resources no more than 1200 requisition/ 400 power max.
-If you are still reading this I must have made this somewhat interesting to a degree and I am beyond surprised I was able ot keep your attention through this wonderful wall of text.
-Maybe if I encourage you to get the game that is good enough? Maybe, probably, who knows but just do not youtube Borealum! 
-Yes, your still here obviously and that means you should probably buy the game now.
-Multiplayer is sort of active in this game. Sort of...you needs mods to pickup the multiplayer community.
-Ok, I am done seriously talking for now. Give it a try, do not I remind you go past purchasing DOW2 that [Clearance Not Sufficient] abomination of the Emperor to mention would make the Choas gods cry in their tombs!

Soulstorm is the weakest in the series adding horrid planes that barely function and quite frankly it's only redeeming factor is the campaign fun & mods. Speaking mods, what mods are there to play? Well there's UA Ultimate Apocalpyse, except UA had all the developers that were super important- leave. All but one. So what from there? Well there's Unification Mod which is an excellent addition to the game, Unification Mod builds off everything that UA failed at / wouldn't let the devs originally do, due to leadership. Overall. 

I hate Soulstorm. Who thought it was a good idea to add Planes? Every new faction is irrelevant to me, I'd sooner just play Dark Crusade- Except. Well I like mods. So I play Soulstorm. You should play it too if you like mods.

Soulstorm isn't as good as its predecessor Dark Crusade.  It didn't improve much on its gameplay other than adding 2 new races and the ""air"" class of units which made little impact on the game.  What it did bring is a whole new set of campaigns for each race without drastically ruining any part of gameplay.

I strongly recommend playing Dark Crusade first, and if you finish those campaigns and crave more absolutely go for Soulstorm.  These two were the pinnacle of the DoW 1 series gameplay.

My other complaint, is the camera is really small, but this can be fixed really easily, you can just download a camera mod which fixes the problem. Overall, I love this game, its just great, its worth much more than its price to me. Not only that, you don't have to get the other expansions to unlock the other factions, you can just use the Race-Unlocker, which worked for me and a couple friends who have the game. Great game, must get.

Edit: There is a camera mod which widens the camera view, its great, get it. There is also a mod called ""SSStats"", since the in game stats are broken, this is really helpful. It also introduces a ""ranked"" mode sort of. Your MMR(score) changes depending on how many 1v1s and team games you win. You can also see a leader board if you go to their website.

DC is cool, but aside from Necrons, T'au and the Campaign map nothing new was added (don't get me wrong, these are already big changes from DoW1 or WA) but in SS it feels ""more complete"" for me.

Also, SS has more Mods available to it.
Even if Games Workshop doesn't like that Fans exist that do more than give them money, I highly recommend this game if you already played any other DoW title, if this is your first then I would still say go for it because its worth it, but if you get easily overhelmed, Dark Crusade has less features and feels more like a ""beta"" to this game in a sense.

Bruva Alfabusa (Creator of TTS) uses stolen art in which he creates cringe animations combined with cringe humor. I for one am glad he got shut down and his heresy ended. If I saw my artwork being used in such a manner. I'd call the hammer too. If someone is using my work and making money off it; I better be getting paid too. You'd feel the same way.

Games workshop is merely an IP holder which means they have to protect the art and safeguard a canonical lore. For this game; Relic is the Developer. Publisher is THQ which was bought out by Sega some time ago. Which is then why we had that god awful DoWIII.

But this game is one of the best; perhaps THE BEST RTS out there currently.

Unification and Ultimate Apocalypse are two very big ones that I've spent a surplus of time in. Unification is good for what I'd describe as roughly recreating a 2000 point battle, It doesn't have the grand scale or godlike units of Ultimate Apocalypse, but I'd say that is a pro or con, depending on your preference. Unification is balanced fairly well for a mod, Ultimate Apocalypse is not. UA is a massive scale battle set in practically apocalypse rules, the only issue at the moment is the same issue that plagued Epic, and that is lack of dedicated xenos titans that can match an Imperator, now obviously you won't be seeing the Imperator often, but it can singlehandedly change the tide of the game. However, this isn't an issue the developers can ever fix, as it would be homebrew for them to make any xenos have titans that large, as it just doesn't exist in lore yet (plus most appearances of Imperators occur during the HH anyways, so no xenos were really a thought).

They removed so much stuff that was already good in Dark Crusade. Even if the campaign is literally Dark Crusade mechanics but on a bigger map with slight changes, it just crashes on you after Strongholds because you get to run the game with better graphics on a better PC Setup.

I used to own this game and all the expansions way back when so my playtime is at least double what's listed here. This is by far the best sci fi base building RTS you will find. Tons of factions, game modes, maps, and the campaign isn't necessarily half bad (well soulstorm's is the weakest). I play this game nearly every day, and largely solo on Skirmish mode vs AI, and till now I find I am given a challenge. 

For solo skirmish players, you will start off going up against easy AI, and slowly increase to Insane, and once you reach Insane you will eventually switch to Quickstart start mode instead of standard. There are a variety of interesting win conditions like control the most points on the map, assassinate the commander, or amassing resources, destroy all HQ buildings, or destroy all unit production buildings which you can toggle at will. 

If you're here for the online aspect, don't bother unless you play private with all your friends. The entire community are wizened ancients who hate ""NOOBS"" and are self proclaimed gods, who have been playing for years on end and expect everyone else to get on their level.  There are a few helpful individuals and it is wonderful to see them, but a large majority are downright awful and not welcoming.

For example, if you decided to play in the company of a space marine and suddenly wanted to take over the Kaurava star system, then I, you, want to disappoint. In addition to the fucking opponents that are hard to fight, the game can offer unforgettable departures with a critical error and a complete loss of your achievements. You can either harass the level by completing all the additional tasks, or pass the game in one go, it all depends on you the main thing is to remember one thing, my dear fans of the Emperor, that you need to save the game every turn.

I have played Dark crusade to death as a child, and i am glad i could play this game 10 years later. The mechanics and game play have aged really well. In my opinion, this is the peak of the dawn of war game series (without considering mods). 
Multiplayer is still active and the skirmish modes are excellent. The only down side is that you need all 4 dawn of war expansions installed to be able to play all the races online (only two available in this version). That being said, you can get all 4 games cheap on sale.

Honestly, I'm only really playing it because other friends have returned to it and wish to play matches with me.

It's not a *bad* game, really.  It just feels a lot more barebones in terms of overall territories and content when compared to Dark Crusade, and the story is heavily nerfed compared to both Dark Crusade and the far more thrilling tales in the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault.  Winter Assault's story was especially memorable so, if that's your thing, get that one.

But Soulstorm added a few more gimmicks in terms of factions, and I suppose it feels more impressive lorewise to take over multiple tiny planets instead of one large one like in Dark Crusade.  Each of the factions from previous games are here, and the game does have blurbs when each faction's stronghold is overrun, unique to the specific faction that overran it.  The Dark Eldar pillaging Nan Yanoi has a different blurb compared to the forces of Chaos achieving the same feat, for example.

But if you're reading this, stahp.  Just get the mods, apparently, or for pure vanilla experiences I really loved Dark Crusade...  But despite the hiccups on release one can't really say this is a bad game.",1623998999,1623998999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can only barely recommend this game. If not for the fact that it has 2 new races which offer some cool playstyles then this would be a hard pass. While Soulstorm withour modifications has some problems in campaign, playing Bugfix mod merged with Persistant Bases will make for an adequate experience similar to Dark Crusade, but with more races and more challenge. Use DoW Mod Manager to merge the above mentioned mods and you are set.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Dawn of War Soulstorm is the last add-on to the game, featuring another meta-campaign like in Dark Crusade, but now with some more meta-progression mechanics and 2 new races. It also adds a light attack flying vehicle for each existing race. I'll try to go over changes and additions:

Sisters of Battle - You could think of them as female Space Marines (although in the lore the differences are huge). They are basically space warrior-nuns who love cleansing enemies with flames. Their basic playstyle is based on utilizing flamers to burn morale of the oponnent. Some enemies are more resistant to this tactic, that's why they also have access to Acts of Faith. Lvl 1 tech aAct can heal your squad, lvl 2 gives all squad's weapons ability to ignore armor of the enemy (flamers can destroy light tanks in seconds!) and lvl 3 will place a buff that damages any enemy who hurts the unit. Even though Sisters feel a lot like Space Marines at first - their focus on breaking morale and using Acts of Faith as well as their very unique vehicles make them much different to play in practice. Did I mention that they have an artilery that's shaped like church organs and their ultimate unit is a literal Angel who kills people with a giant sword? If that doesn't make you want to play them - what's wrong with you.

Dark Eldar - I gotta be honest - out of all new races I like them the least and simply didn't feel like playing them after a marathon completing every single DoW game. They are similar to normal Eldar, but even more focused on quickness and ranged weapons with some really annoying global spells. That does not mean at all that their addition is boring or unnecessary - the very fact that we get 2 more races in this update is great as it introduces more stuff for you to try and fight against.

Campaign buildings - In Dark Crusade if you built something during a mission and won - the buildings would stay if the territory is ever attacked. That's not the case in Soulstorm. It makes the game very tedious when each time your territory is attacked you have to start building and capturing points from scratch. You can still buy buildings on the strategy map, but doing that for each territory slows the game even more, plus, you'd still need to capture strategic points every time. This can be fixed with Persistent Bases mod, which I recommend doing.

Race bonuses - In Dark Crusade there were several territories that granted access to special abilities like moving twice during a turn and the like. This time each race has access to one such bonus, and you can gain acces to them as you defeat the home territory of each race. I think that this approach is better since it makes it much more rewarding to kill the enemy race off, but some bonuses are much better than others. For example Sisters start with the ability to buy buildings for an attack, which is by every metric the strongest one. Compare this to Tau's orbital cannon that is supposed to soften up defences as you attack, but in practice I never noticed it having ANY effect at all.

[b]+ More races[/b]

More about pros and cons below.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ More races[/b]
Both Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar give a huge increase to the game's replayability and the sheer amount of stuff that is in this game after 3 expansions is impressive.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Slogfest: no persistant bases[/b]
If playing unmodded - you won't have your structures persist in between missions on the same map. Have you finished a map, slowly creeping the enemy out and building out your defences and multiple bases? Well, guess what - if the AI decides to attack that province you will start from ZERO. Dark Crusade expansion had your buildings always persist as long as you win, here the mechanics slow down the campaign immensly. This is the biggest issue, thankfully possible to fix with a mod. 

[b]- Slogfest: AI multiple bases[/b]
After a few turns (and on the webway nodes) you will always face an enemy defensive force consisting of 2 large bases. This means you will have to attack with little to no Honor Guard into an already established enemy force. This pretty much forces you to play cheesy rush tactics to get at least one of the enemy strongholds off the face of the map and with how AI loves to micro around and build up random production buildings everywhere - you will need to constantly scout every strategic point and make sure that they don't rebuild. If you don't do that - you will soon drown in an insane amount of tier 3 units. I can't count how many times have I slowly started losing because my army was busy destroying some outlying bases while the other enemy launched a full-scale attack on my production facilities. This forced me to go back only to get sandwitched by 2 armies and after defeating both the time to rebuild my losses only let the enemies build up more remote bases everywhere and quickly pump out more and more fucking tanks. I hate it. I HATE IT. It's not difficult, it just makes you play the same rush strategy every game, which isn't fun when you have to do this for EVERY territory on the map.

[b]- Idiotic plot[/b]
The main Imperial Guard base pumping out Baneblades like there's no tomorrow and METAL BAWXES are both huge memes among the DoW1 community. The first time Space Marines and Imperial Guard had to fight each other was already endearing, but now they fight again? And this time Sisters of Battle fight them both too? For those, who don't know - Space Marines, Imperial Guard and Sisters of Battle are all part of the same Imperium and for the most part they should not work against each other.

[b]- Unstable[/b]
This game has a problem where it can freeze while loading after beating a stronghold mission. Bugfix mod seems to fix it, though I've had 2 crashes throughout my playthrough and I couldn't be bothered after the second one which happened after a stronghold mission.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
Honestly if you are already deep enough to consider buying this game after playing the previous ones then just buy it. It may be worse by design, but it adds enough new stuff to be compelling.

I can recommend 3 mods that may improve your experience with the game.

Persistant bases + bugfix (merge them together using DoW Mod Manager) - will fix most problems with the game, while keeping it as vanilla as possible. I've had a pathfinding/units blocking on geometry problem with this setup, but reinstalling solved it.

Unification - modifies some of the game's units and adds some on top of that, also adds some new mechanics with ability to customize some of them. Lastly it adds Tyranids to skirmish. If you already played each race in Dark Crusade and want to replay them in Soulstorm then this mod will add some freshness. One big problem in it is how sound mixing is totally broken and some sound FX will be much louder than they should be.

Apocalypse - multiplayer/skirmish mod that increases the scale of the game and adds many new units and variants - including huge superweapons. This mod is ridiculous and IMO the game's engine can't handle what it tries to achieve, especially with it's terrible pathfinding. It's still an ambitious piece of content.

I'd give the base Soulstorm a 4/10, but considering the mods the score would rise up to
[h1]6/10[/h1]

Pros-AI is pretty solid for the meat grinder don't expect being flanked but be expected to be overrun like Warhammer style. animations are superb and really are outstanding even in 2021, the amount of gore is welcoming the voice acting is ok the ambient sounds are nice and the dakka sounds are perfect.

cons-Shame the pop cap is so low, have that issue with all dawn of war games it is pretty annoying and really makes big campaign maps less fun. a bit buggy on modern pcs but you can work with it just save alot. it isn't like this game takes long to load up.

While the base game itself is very strong, the modding community is what keep this game alive for all these years.

1. The Ultimate Apocalypse Mod. if you want the scale of battle to be much bigger with endgame weaponry, mass Titan battle and see the carnage where each unit is tossed around very easily, this mod will give you what you want. Be wary that the game time for each skirmish will become much longer though as the battle scale become much bigger and more complex.

2. Unification Mod. Play this if you want more races and more units but still want the gameplay scale to be somewhat similar to the base game. While not as complex as the Ultimate Apocalypse, this mod really improve upon the base game.

Personal thoughts:
I am not the biggest RTS fan in the world, but this series was pretty good, even if the story apperantely makes no sense in this expac. I dunno, I like the idea of the 40k universe, but I don't want to read the books when there are so many of them. The game itself looks kind of standard by RTS standards, but I haven't played too many in the genre. The game also has a modding scene, which is always great to see, but I haven't tried any mods for this game. I would like to give the whole Dawn of War package an 8/10 bordering on a 9/10, this game is an 8/10 with mods.

Both will give you loads of hours of entertainment. If you like big scale battles, a lot of heavy weight units and expanded mechanics, then UA is the better choice (specially if your pc can handle it). If you instead prefer more quantity and race diversity, go for Unification Mod, which adds around 18+ races to vanilla. This doesn't mean it's lacking on quality, as all the new races have great balacing around them and are not copies of existing ones, with all of them having very unique playstyles.

Overall, if you're a 40k fan, i recommend this game wholeheartedly to you. Mod it, gets some friends and have a blast playing multiplayer and enjoying the overall chaos.

Highly recommend installing ""Ultimate Apocalypse"" and ""Unification"" mods. Unification is my personal favourite due to the shear number of different factions you can install and play (these are modular and need to be installed separately, a little bit of mucking about but well worth it). Both UA and Unification can be played with the campaign, ensuring hours and hours of gaming fun. A must buy for an RTS or Warhammer 40k fan!

(27/3/21)
EDIT: I have played another 360 hours since my original review in January and feel i need to address the latest update of the Unification mod. (5.9.1). This now includes 17 new races, a plethora of changes to the vanilla races, sfx, graphics updated and much, much more... its just awesome. Unification is a simple download and install now (no longer moduler) and they have a great, active Official discord channel that is a pleasure to be a part of.

You shuffle to the counter, scan your card, and get roughly the same meal you've been ordering for the past year. Over the last few months you've made a few variations, maybe you've added some onion rings to the mix or you're trying out that blue cheese they recommended, but it's still the same burger that you know and are comfortable with.

Then, just as you're about to leave, the guy in line behind you catches your ear. He's tall, and speaks quietly, but in the ambience of that little shop him speaking and the sizzle of grills are the only thing you can hear over the sound of cars outside. You pause.

You've never heard of that burger before.

But the chef has. He nods, and calls out something to the guys in the back, and you see a grin you've never noticed before crack across the man's face. Glancing up, you see the standard menu of the joint doesn't even have the burger the guy just ordered on it. Like it was some kind of secret they didn't want just anyone to know about.

The next guy behind that orders a burger. You've known this one for a few weeks; you get off work at around the same time. He's shorter, and a little less sharp than the man before, but the light always catches him in a soft way that washes off the imperfections most people would pick out if they saw him on the street or in a club.

It's not the same burger the last guy ordered. But it's another one that you never knew existed. The guy that comes after, broad-shouldered and neatly groomed- and far too well dressed for a seedy joint off the high-street- orders the same as the guy before last. And he asks for a side that you don't even think would be served in a burger place.

And the chef just nods. He's not surprised, and barely even pays attention to the advertised menu. In the back, the fryers hiss in protest as the orders swell in number. A fourth man comes to make his order, then a fifth and a sixth. Burgers like the ones ordered before only in the sense that they're utterly unknown and barely seem possible to make in such a small shop come one after the other, each big, strong man nodding as he takes his order. Ignoring the menu, ignoring what should be possible.

You look down. In your hands is the same burger that you've been eating all your life. You always thought it was a pretty good size. But, after tonight?

It's small. It doesn't sit right in your hands. It doesn't fill someone up the way it should.

It's just.. pathetic.

You long to be like those other men. To have a piece of meat that can actually satisfy. The kind of thing that marks an alpha male, not a pathetic loser that can only dream of the life they live.

You don't deserve to be treated the same as them. No. You'll never have a burger that can satisfy again, after seeing that glorious meal the other, *real* men have. You can't hide in ignorance, or pretend it never happened. Everyone saw you with your sad, pathetic little snack of a burger on their way out.

You'll never forget the way that they looked at you. There's a burning in your chest, that you can't put your finger on. You've felt envy before, when it came to different things that you tried to compete in earnestly. But this? Maybe because it's something that you always assumed was the same for everyone, or something that you had already won effortlessly.

But.. you don't hate it. Even with how sad you are, pitying yourself only makes that burning worse.

There is a dusting of red on your cheeks. You're not sure how long it's been there, but when you blink and remember where you are the only thing that fills your mind is the stare of everyone else in the joint. The burning gets hotter, and standing there with your tiny burger surrounded by bigger packages only amplifies how weak and helpless you feel.

Two Krootox then burst through the wall since it has been 5 minutes and the Tau player has gotten to t3, and kill everything. Because Ultimate Apocalypse is literally only balanced for the endgame, this repeats every time.

Good game for Dawn of war fans, 
interesting game as it continues after the Dark Crusade, Still the first one is the best compare to the rest of the game expansion.

Cons:
Still clunky interface as before, 
Does not save game automatically? which i find lazy for the guys you did the expansion.
The Dawn of War is still far better than this. You must save your game every time when you finish your turn.
If you do not, you will waste all the time spent playing this game.

The game is from 2003 and the title 'Soulstorm' is a DLC released in 2008. This game is the most played game in the DoW-series even though its almost 20 years old. And even though there were hundreds of players playing this game every day and you could easily join games, the owners decided to take down all the multiplayer servers. So now you can't play it online anymore. However, playing this game have been an exciting journey and it finally took me the 1000 hours of gameplay to beat the hardest difficulty in the game: 'insane' difficulty.

So you can basically double my Hours-played, if that means anything to you.

This game is fantastic, it's a shame the sequels went in the direction that they did...

This is a real RTS, with basebuilding, fast paced squad-based combat and a large array of Units and Races to use, with each unit having unique qualities when compared to its' counterpart from other Races.
Pros:
- 9 unique races with different Commanders, Infantry and Vehicle units at your disposal
- large variety between units
- Point control system for Map control (helps the flow of battle)
- Large array of maps and a Campaign mode which is similar to Galactic Conquest from SwBf2
       - Each race has a fortress that the player must siege, with unique story lines 
- Multiplayer (not so much as of 2021)

Cons:
- Franchise did not carry on this style of gameplay into newer sequels (this is an opinion and not reflective of this game or any other in particular)

Overall Great game 9/10

Only gripe is the camera control is out dated and a pain. There is a mod that can be downloaded called ZoomModSettings and it works with both Soulstorm and Dark Crusade (you have to run the game once for the Mod to detect the installs).

Quite frankly it lacks  optimization on high tier PCs, the limit of 2gb is not enough to support consistent gameplay, sometimes I get crashes, to some extent fps drops, but nothing to be annoyed by anyway, luckily it doesn't occur too often, its still playable. I think adding additional race of tyranids, would have improve the feeling of being around 40k even more, its one of the primary threats to all other races in 40k and fighting against that kind of hostile would give me better improved immersion around 40k(in mine humble opinion). I get it that apocalypse mod got tyranids introduced, to me it lack certain aspect which is balance, and fighting in that kind of environment would be more chaotic than entertaining. I would honestly appreciate a remake or a remaster from formal developers, I think the game needs it and deserves it.

DC= Dark crusade
DE= Dark Eldar           (for those that dont know)
SOB= Sisters of Battle

Negative points

Campaign:
I personally was annoyed with the campaign, at some points I found that Chaos and Necrons had the easiest time cheesing the campaign missions since there able to TP there super units. Imperial guard can also kinda do this but instead of TP they use Basilisk
It also has a somewhat lacking feeling on the voice acting for the main characters becuase it seems they just ported DC's voice lines to their respective races while only DE and SOB have any real character and thats not talking about the MEHTAWL BAWXES Firraveus Carron and the SPAESS MEREENS commander Boreale memes.

Multiplayer:
GOOD LUCK, there are poeple on here that are just way to good to be playing multyplayer casually, I dont know why but poeple with major skills in this game just decide to drop in matches and try as hard as they can to win even if their fighting players with essentialy no skill or comparable skill level. I understand you have to play somewhere and keep your gaming skills up and all. But theres no way to keep it up if your fighting againts people who have no clue as to get a proper build order or even a decent size army at T1.

Positive points.

Campaign:
Despite it flaws  it can actually be pretty fun if your playing any other race or even necrons and chaos and your not trying to cheese it. Otherwise its just Dark crusade's campaign with just more territorys to take over and 2 more strongholds to fight.

Multyplayer:
You need mods or friends who have the same skill level as you otherwise it can be kinda unfun or boring, mods like Ultimate apocalypse and Titanium wars are your best multiplayer mods since they add alot to the game.

Thats about it really, only thing I can recommend really is when you use mods like UA or TITS, other than that Id recommend Dark crusade instead.",1451583210,1606725522,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 it is good as a base game to introduce you to not only warhammer as a whole but also as an introduction to Dawn of war. I would also say however that if you enjoy the feel of the rts then look for Ultimate Apocalypse online. its a total conversion mod that is easy to get working and really fixes all of the games issues and adds lots of new maps, 2-3 new factions, overhauls all of the games factions to make them closer to lore and a whole hell of a lot more interesting. 

for instance the imperial guard gets conscripts as a super cheap starting unit and adds two new leader units that are just as cheap, these two allow you to make builders and basic infantry wherever they are so you can spread out incredibly quickly compared to the initially slow start of the base guard which is really fitting for the lore and the other changes really make you feel like just a bunch of guys going up against the forces of hell and superhuman beings.

the space marines lower their overall numbers but makes it so one space marine can not only dish out but also take quite the beating. Making them really feel like the insanely powerful tanks of men that they are supposed to be. and many other additions to all the other races as well which would make this review way too long

The Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle can feel a bit unfinished and aerial vehicles don't seem all too interesting. Also even after years of patches, this game still tends to be very buggy.

On it's own, Soulstorm is a weak expansion to a great game. Thankfully the main gameplay is so good, it's shortcomings can be easily overlooked.

Where Soulstorm really shines and what makes it worth it, is the massive amount of fan support of mods. Lots of new units, races and the famous Ultimate Apocalypse Mod make Soulstorm probably THE Warhammer 40k game to pick up and play.  It makes an already great game even more bombastic and fleshes the W40K universe out even further.

The game has all your favourite warhammer 40k races, but if you don't know warhammer fear not, you don't really need to, all you need to know is that every race has a different playstyle, for example if you wanted to go for aggressive hit and run tactics, you'd pick the Dark Eldar with their skimmer units, if you wanted to hide away and build up a massive overwhelming force to crush your opponent you'd pick normal Eldar with their invisible buildings, if you wanted constant overwhelming numbers you'd either go for Orks if you wanted to be aggressive, or Imperial Guard for defensive play, and many more options are present too. Even within each race you have multiple strategies and ways to play the game, this is arguably one of the most in depth games in this regard even to this day.

There is a learning curve, every race has different units, different buildings, different mechanics, etc, to learn, and it can take some time to learn them all, but it is necessary, it doesn't matter if you know everything there is to know about the Tau, if you don't have a clue what your opponents units do, for example if you were against the Necrons, if you haven't played them you may not realise their units can simply get back up off the ground and continue fighting even in death, or that their headquarters building can literally fly around the map vaporising your armies, or most importantly that they only have one resource instead of 2.

Speaking of the resources, its actually rather simple, each race has either 1, 2, or 3 resources, only the necrons have 1, and that's power, every other race has power, and requisition, then the Dark Eldar also have souls, and the Sisters of Battle have faith. The only ones that really matter are power and requisition, power is simple to get, you build power generators, that's it, nothing more to it, requisition is obtained by capturing command points.

The maps in this game range from tiny, cramped 1v1 arenas, to huge, sprawling terrains for up to 8 players to wage all out war against one another, there really is something for everyone.

In short, there's a lot to love about this game and I firmly believe everyone should play it, and yes, there is still an active online community to play against too, and the game does support modern high resolutions.

Word of Warning; I have been having issues lately after purchasing a HDR monitor, if I have the HDR turned on it hugely reduces my framerate, so if you're having issues try turning off HDR to see if it solves it.

The fact that this still stands up a decade or so later is a testament to its quality. This and Space Marine were the defining games for the WH40k in terms of production quality and fun.

Plays out better imho than any of the *craft games because of the focus on squad comp, armor types, and terrain bonuses. Stuff makes a little more sense and there's less focus on CPM and spam which I always enjoyed. Requisition is gathered by map control, meaning turtling is less of an option unless your race specifically has bonuses from it. Seriously, pick this up on sale the next time it does.

Pros:
 - Wildly differing armies offer a great deal of variety
 - Visceral, bloody combat that is very satisfying
 - Able to field a lot of units simultaneously

Cons: 
 - SP campaign is bland, which is ironic considering the voice acting. It is almost like the writers were in a different room at all times. If you want to get a REAL experience of what the 40k universe is like, play Dawn of War and Dawn of War: Winter Assault instead.
 - Poor unit movement. Like I mentioned above, you can host large battles but dont expect your units to move in sync like Starcraft 2. Trying to coordinate foot soldiers with vehicles by their side is a nightmare, and more often than not trying to organize an effective formation (vehicles front, soldiers behind) is going to make for a hopeless mess. Which is, in turn, made worse by:
 - Maps are too small for all these units. The ""huge"" maps that host 8 player free for alls are better suited to 2v2s or even 1v1s

The truth is a part of where DoW3 went wrong was having a small selection of races from a world that is 40k that has so many. The DoW series lets you add and keep races as you bought every progressive game in the series which was such a worthwhile marketing stragedy. With all the DoW games you unlock every race. 

Now why this game that will before you know it hit 20 years of age is still better than DoW3 and any future game I expect in the franchise, The 40k and modding community for this game is huge, there are at least triple the amount of races in the base game to download and play, countless new units, buildings and even reworking the campaign to include it all (I am a small but helpful part of the campaign mod team) 

I am nor a poet or a writer and can't spend the time to write a well written review to convince you to buy this game, all I can say is for it's price, replay value, mod community and so much content for an old game, any RTS or 40k fan is cheating themselves not getting this game, and the entire series.

The modding scene however remedies many of people's gripes with it. 

- Ultimate Apocalypse: reflecting the freedom of tabletop and intensity of in lore battles with its large armies and titanic units. The vast customization of matches help alleviate new comers, challenge experts or form unique scenarios.
- Eternal Confrontation: an experience more similar to vanilla but expands upon it with more units, rebalances and races. Giant plus for the inclusion of the Death Korps of Krieg, Mordian Guard and Arbites.
- Ultimate Unification: adds the best of the modding scene's races and compiles them into a giant moshpit of chaos and battle. Fight with the Adeptus Mechanicus, Armageddon Steel Legion, Emperor's Children and so much more.

Conclusion: On its own, I can't fully recommend Soulstorm, that title would have to go to Dark Crusade and its amazing campaign scenarios and narrative.

Pros:
-Unit composition matters, it's not just make the biggest vehicle and win
-commander units can actually sway the field of battle, though can be overpowered by a swarm of regular units
-overmap progression instead of mission based progression (more interesting to me than missions for a global conquest game)

Cons:
-cannot zoom out very far without altering the game slightly which caused my game to crash every two or three play sessions.
-Autoresolve SUCKS HORRIBLY, you will either be always playing your defensive matches, or you will be dropping to six when an A.I commander attacks your ten (fortification number) with a  freaking two

The strongholds are generally weaker, the story is very weak and the Necrons have a lack of new content. However, these problems reflect a lack of refinement compared to previous entries, more than being a bad game.

I recommend trying either the base game or Dark Crusade before thinking about getting this. The exception is if you are not at all interested in the campaign and simply want a multiplayer RTS, in which case Soulstorm is the best simply because it has the most units and factions.

+the old factions (Necrons,Tau,Orks,Space Marines,Imperial Guard etc.) are still here and we have 2 (Sisters of Battle,Dark Eldar) new factions that we can use
+we have the old units from the older games and we have new units too upgrades are still here too (we have air units now for some factions)
+a bigger campaing map its really similar to the campaing map in Dark Crusade but bigger instead of fighting on 1 planet you fight on 3-4 diffrent planets now the thing is that in Dark Crusade that 1 planet had tons of regions but in Soulstorm you have a few diffrent planets with like 5-6 regions each still its great it looks huge and its just cool
+suprisingly multiplayer is still alive people are playing im not sure about other Dawn of War games cuz i have not checked their multiplayer tabs i just did skirmish with the AI or played the campaing but in here i wanted to look at the multiplayer real quick i was 100% sure that no one would be playing i was wrong
+the game looks plays and sounds great

-moving huge armies is still hard they can just stop moving,get stuck on stuff its better to move every single unit one by one thats more effective
-the game can get repetative and boring you can download mods on the internet but ive never really tried it so idk how good those mods are if they work at all and shit either way 2-3 battles each day is more than enough if you play anymore youll quickly get bored and 1 battle usually lasts 30 mins anyways so each day 1-2 battles is like 1-2 hours of gameplay which is more than enough but even then after a while you might get bored it does become repetative

it sucks that the pathfinding was never really ""fixed"" in all 4 Dawn of War games moving a ton of units at once was always a problem some would make it to the enemy lines and start fighting the others would get stuck on something or they just wouldnt go all the way for some reason idk why this was a problem in all 4 games but luckily its not something game breaking you can either move every single unit one by one or just keep spamming right click and sooner or later your units will stop looking at a random rock on the ground and actually go and fight anyways the game just like all the other Dawn of War games was really fun suprisingly the multiplayer isnt dead people are still playing the game idk if people are playing the other 3 Dawn of War games i did not check the multiplayer section in them but in here i did check it and well people are still playing which is great anyways TLDR the game just like the other Dawn of War games is great its fun and if you like Warhammer 40k and real time strategy games then you should buy this game its really good",1599070508,1599070508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ignore my Steam time I have this on CD-ROM and have played over 10k hours. (Yet somehow I still lose ""noob only"" games)

The base game has 4 awesome, completely different races. Every battle is different because it's a different combination of races, teams, opponents, and map. The expansions added 5 more races so now the combinations are just endless. And that's what keeps you coming back to this game. 

The game is the perfect combination of micro and macro and it punishes turtling - which is why it's undisputedly the best RTS out there. Yes that's right - it's better than Starcraft, C+C, even Cannon Fodder.

Every race has awesome units and loads of interesting abilities that can turn the tide of battle. Every battle can have its tide turned back and forward multiple times if you have a good match of good players. The new flying units are a bit meh, but good to have. 

Sisters of battle are a Space Marine variant but with enough differences to make them fun in their own right. It took me 11 years to zoom in and realise that Repentia sisters are quite hot. The mek thing is one of the best units in the game.

Dark Eldar are probably the weakest race in the game, but they have some interesting quirks and can be fun to play. But the last thing you want is to get these when you go random race.  

The campaign isn't great which is a disappointment but who needs that anyway. This is multiplayer heaven, even if you just comp stomp. 

Dark Crusade is better, but this brings completion and it's the one everyone plays. DOW2 is Ok but changes the core to be more micro focused, which is fine if you like that. But this is better. And forget about DOW3, that game was so bad it killed Relic. Buy this game and see the peak of Real Time Strategy.",1526044110,1597553650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is a bit silly, with forces loyal to the Emperor slaughtering each other for no real reason, while there's plenty of xenos to purge, but there's plenty of hammy dialogue that's birthed several memes (METAL BAWKSES!) and is very enjoyable as well. A true 40k experience.

Honor guard costs a fortune, cutscenes are boring and stupid, and characters like Gorgutz dont have the same charm as they did before.

Ultimate Apocalypse is the mod you want if you think the base game is just too bland or you're just bored. The addition of aircraft doesnt really fit the engine or gameplay of Dawn of War, and they're just lightweight tanks that can pass over cover.

You no longer retain bases in territories you take, you only keep the parts of your base you have paid for with requisition, which is extremely limited to only turrets, generators, and level 1 buildings. As if the game wasn't enough of a slog already with units taking a hefty amount of requisition, your base will now take a significant investment of requisition in order to be able to hold up against enemy attacks, which have occasionally spiked to 10 strength assaults despite the enemy having no territory, leaving my 3 strength base that I thought was safe completely screwed. The only solution seems to be to wait dozens of turns until you have enough requisition to invest in both units and buildings for your claimed territories, assuming no 10 strength assaults body slam you out of nowhere during the process, making the game an absolutely boring grind where you go nowhere. Also, you will rarely ever see higher level infantry/vehicles unless you purposefully delay the game in order to obtain them, but what is the point if you don't retain that on the next defense? The stronghold missions crash the game immediately upon completion, too, so you can say goodbye to 30 minutes-1 hour of gameplay unless you saved right before completing it. The game only has these issue fixed upon installing mods, but you can only use one mod at a time unless they are fused together, so you are going to have to play with some issue regardless unless you want to invest your time in fixing a game that should have had these game-breaking bugs/features in the first place. Necrons are still bull, the new Faith feature introduced with the Battle Sisters factions feels like a gimmick and doesn't fit into the gameplay too smoothly, and some of the units feel useless to the point of never even training any, especially when you consider the addition of aircraft, which can pass over all terrain, move fast, and can render training some other vehicles or infantry pointless when you can just spam aircraft at the enemy base. Really, don't get this game unless you are going to install Ultimate Apocalypse.

The lore is amazing, the game overall, is amazing, the graphics still look decent today, the gameplay enables multiple gemaplay styles (the snowballing humans vs the short term necrons), that represent their history and personality, lore-wise. 

Even though I feel like some lore ""adjustments"", were made (eldars back despite their almost destruction, the necrons back after the ""Great Sleep""...), overall I feel a good level of respect of W40K's lore. 

Little mistakes: Ork with morale... Doesn't make sense, but well, for the sake of game's balance, I understand.

Video Game Review by Lost Vikings 2 aka. Scorched Ground

GAME: Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Soulstorm
DEVELOPER: Relic Entertainment
GENRE: Strategy, Base-Building

⚠️PLEASE NOTE: The Statements made in this
review are based upon personal opinions
and personal experiences with the game.
So these do not necessarily apply to everyone.⚠️

⚠️It is implied that this game is played on the
average difficulty level for the difficulty rating.
This only applies to games with different difficulty
settings of course.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 HOW MANY PLAYERS 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Singleplayer only
🔲 Multiplayer only
✅ Singleplayer and Multiplayer
✅ Cooperative with other people ⚠️If you play with others against bots⚠️
✅ Competitive with other people ⚠️Deathmatch PVP⚠️
🔲 Local Multiplayer only

🔲 Multiplayer is different from Singleplayer
✅ Multiplayer is a minimal part of the game

🌀🌀🌀 DIFFICULTY LEVEL 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Anyone with at least 2 brain cells can beat this game
🔲 Easy
✅ Generally not too hard
✅ Challenging
🔲 Difficult
🔲 You will lose a lot... and learn from mistakes

🔲 You cannot lose this game and there are no obstacles
✅ There are some parts that are notably more difficult
🔲 Difficulty varies extremely throughout the game
🔲 This game is unfair and frustrating

⚠️This only applies to campaign mode/bots. Generally it
is really easy to exploit the AI in this game to the point where
the game becomes really easy. However, in campaign mode
there are a handful of maps that under certain circumstances
(Enemy Power and your Race / Enemy race) can be very
challenging to beat.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 GRAPHIC DESIGN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Your Eyes will bleed
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Average
✅ Solid
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

🔲 Graphics do not matter in this particular game
🔲 Very Unique and/or strange, but fitting

⚠️The graphics are pretty low quality overall, in some
places worse than in others. Despite that I feel
like the graphics aged pretty well, just like other
old games like Half-Life.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 MUSIC DESIGN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Your Ears will take a beating
🔲 Bad
🔲 Fitting, but not memorable
🔲 Good
✅ Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

🔲 No actual Music
🔲 Game consists mostly of ambiance sound/music
🔲 Music plays only at select parts of the game

⚠️Oh my god the Imperial Guard music gets me really going.
But the other music is excellent too. It really sets the
atmosphere.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 STORY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 This game has no Story
🔲 It has a Story for the sake of making sense

🔲 The story is full of holes and/or makes no sense
✅ There is a Solid Story, but it's not groundbreaking
🔲 Well Written and Enjoyable
🔲 Amazing and Coherent
🔲 You will dream about the story at night

🔲 The story is the main focus of the game

⚠️Basically, a dozen of different races investigate a huge
♥♥♥ portal and decide its worth keeping. So they have to
exterminate all the other races to claim the portal. Well the orcs are
there too, but they couldnt care less about the portal. It's basically
a huge game of Risk with 9 players.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 You can run it on a calculator
✅ Average
✅ Above Average
🔲 Good specs
🔲 You need the newest stuff

🌀🌀🌀 GAME LENGHT 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Finish it in one session
🔲 Short
🔲 Average
✅ Long
🔲 One hell of a Journey

🔲 Contains grinding/farming
🔲 Game has no end

🌀🌀🌀 FUN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Hard not to fall asleep
🔲 You could be playing better games
🔲 Fun at times
🔲 Generally Enjoyable
✅ Genuinely fun most of the time
🔲 You might lose track of time playing this

✅ Game can become repetitive
🔲 Game has multiple Gameplay elements

⚠️The one thing that annoys me is that often times
your territory borders 2 or 3 different other players
and you have only one hero to move around with. So you get
attacked by 2 players each round and have to
play the same map with the same enemies over
and over again until you eventually wipe them out.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 REPLAYABILITY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 A one time experience
✅ You might play it again to test out other ways to play it
🔲 You might play it multiple times because it's that good

🔲 Steam Workshop
🔲 Steam Achievements
✅ Active Modding Community
🔲 Lots of customization options
✅ There are many ways to play this game
🔲 Game offers a lot of secrets to be found
🔲 Game goes on indefinitely
✅ Game has multiple endings

⚠️You gotta beat the campaign mode 9 times.
Once with each race. This is fine however, since
each race plays out differently so it does not
become overly repetitive. Also: the races in
campaign mode are kind of unbalanced.
Orcs and Tau are basically cakewalks while
Necrons and Dark Eldar are pretty difficult.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 BUGS 🌀🌀🌀

✅ No bugs that impact your gameplay
🔲 Minor bugs that are mostly just nuisances
🔲 Some bugs can severely impact your gameplay
🔲 There are some gamebreaking bugs
🔲 The whole game is a single bug

🌀🌀🌀 STABILITY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Frequent crashes and FPS drops
🔲 FPS is mostly unstable, crashes may occur
🔲 Game is very unstable from time to time
✅ Game is generally very fluid, but FPS drops and stutter can occur
🔲 Game works like a well oiled machine

🔲 Stability can vary extremely
🔲 Steam-Workshop objects and Mods may cause instability

🌀🌀🌀 PRICE 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Free
✅ It's a steal
🔲 Can't complain
🔲 Slightly Overpriced
🔲 Not enough content/polish for the Price
🔲 You might as well burn your Money

⚠️The amount of potential time you can have
in the campaign mode is very high for the
price tag.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 MICROTRANSACTIONS 🌀🌀🌀

✅ None
🔲 Cosmetics
🔲 Gameplay-Affecting
🔲 Microtransactions make the game easier
🔲 Microtransactions are oppresive and diminish fun
🔲 Microtransactions are needed to have any fun

🌀🌀🌀 SHOULD YOU BUY? 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 No, don't bother
🔲 Maybe, better wait for updates
🔲 Probably, better wait for a sale
✅ Yes, Full price is worth it

🔲 The game is not finished yet

If you've ever played Dark Crusade, it's very much like that.  But, in case you haven't, in Soulstorm you choose one of nine factions to lead to victory over the Kaurava system.  The system is divided into territories spanned across 4 planets and 3 moons.  Each faction starts controlling a certain number of territories, whereas the player starts with only a single territory.  Each faction must then battle it out for control of each territory in the system.  You defeat other factions by conquering their primary territory, known as their stronghold.  

In Dark Crusade the campaign played out in much the same fashion, but over a single planet rather than a system.  Furthermore, the backstory for the planet and each of the individual territories felt much more fleshed out in Dark Crusade.  The reasoning for the presence of each faction was better explained and the entire game just seemd to have more personality.

Aside from this, Soulstorm is really just more of the same.  And that's great if you're a Dawn of War fan.  It's great to finally see the Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle) added to the game and the gameplay works just as well as it ever has.

Ultimately, I would recommend this game but only if you enjoyed the other Dawn of War installments.  If this is your first introduction to the Dawn of War Series, I would strongly recommend playing the other games first.",1419184640,1589502921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The replay value is phenominal with dozens of maps to play on and different strategies for each faction. Multiplayer is great too and you can play as teams or free for all.

GAME: Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Soulstorm
DEVELOPER: Relic Entertainment
GENRE: Strategy, Base-Building

⚠️PLEASE NOTE: The Statements made in this 
review are based upon personal opinions
and personal experiences with the game. 
So these do not necessarily apply to everyone.⚠️

⚠️It is implied that this game is played on the
average difficulty level for the difficulty rating.
This only applies to games with different difficulty
settings of course.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 HOW MANY PLAYERS 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Singleplayer only
🔲 Multiplayer only
✅ Singleplayer and Multiplayer
✅ Cooperative with other people ⚠️If you play with others against bots⚠️
✅ Competitive with other people ⚠️Deathmatch PVP⚠️
🔲 Local Multiplayer only

🔲 Multiplayer is different from Singleplayer
✅ Multiplayer is a minimal part of the game

🌀🌀🌀 DIFFICULTY LEVEL 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Anyone with at least 2 brain cells can beat this game
🔲 Easy
✅ Generally not too hard
✅ Challenging
🔲 Difficult
🔲 You will lose a lot... and learn from mistakes

🔲 You cannot lose this game and there are no obstacles
✅ There are some parts that are notably more difficult
🔲 Difficulty varies extremely throughout the game
🔲 This game is unfair and frustrating

⚠️This only applies to campaign mode/bots. Generally it
is really easy to exploit the AI in this game to the point where
the game becomes really easy. However, in campaign mode 
there are a handful of maps that under certain circumstances 
(Enemy Power and your Race / Enemy race) can be very 
challenging to beat.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 GRAPHIC DESIGN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Your Eyes will bleed
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Average
✅ Solid
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

🔲 Graphics do not matter in this particular game
🔲 Very Unique and/or strange, but fitting

⚠️The graphics are pretty low quality overall, in some
places worse than in others. Despite that I feel
like the graphics aged pretty well, just like other
old games like Half-Life.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 MUSIC DESIGN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Your Ears will take a beating
🔲 Bad
🔲 Fitting, but not memorable
🔲 Good
✅ Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece 

🔲 No actual Music
🔲 Game consists mostly of ambiance sound/music
🔲 Music plays only at select parts of the game

⚠️Oh my god the Imperial Guard music gets me really going.
But the other music is excellent too. It really sets the
atmosphere.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 STORY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 This game has no Story
🔲 It has a Story for the sake of making sense

🔲 The story is full of holes and/or makes no sense
✅ There is a Solid Story, but it's not groundbreaking
🔲 Well Written and Enjoyable
🔲 Amazing and Coherent
🔲 You will dream about the story at night

🔲 The story is the main focus of the game

⚠️Basically, a dozen of different races investigate a huge
ass portal and decide its worth keeping. So they have to
exterminate all the other races to claim the portal. Well the orcs are
there too, but they couldnt care less about the portal. It's basically
a huge game of Risk with 9 players.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 You can run it on a calculator
✅ Average
✅ Above Average
🔲 Good specs
🔲 You need the newest stuff

🌀🌀🌀 GAME LENGHT 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Finish it in one session
🔲 Short
🔲 Average
✅ Long
🔲 One hell of a Journey

🔲 Contains grinding/farming
🔲 Game has no end

🌀🌀🌀 FUN 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Hard not to fall asleep
🔲 You could be playing better games
🔲 Fun at times
🔲 Generally Enjoyable
✅ Genuinely fun most of the time
🔲 You might lose track of time playing this

✅ Game can become repetitive
🔲 Game has multiple Gameplay elements

⚠️The one thing that annoys me is that often times 
your territory borders 2 or 3 different other players 
and you have only one hero to move around with. So you get 
attacked by 2 players each round and have to
play the same map with the same enemies over 
and over again until you eventually wipe them out.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 REPLAYABILITY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 A one time experience
✅ You might play it again to test out other ways to play it
🔲 You might play it multiple times because it's that good

🔲 Steam Workshop
🔲 Steam Achievements
✅ Active Modding Community
🔲 Lots of customization options
✅ There are many ways to play this game
🔲 Game offers a lot of secrets to be found
🔲 Game goes on indefinitely
✅ Game has multiple endings

⚠️You gotta beat the campaign mode 9 times.
Once with each race. This is fine however, since
each race plays out differently so it does not
become overly repetitive. Also: the races in 
campaign mode are kind of unbalanced. 
Orcs and Tau are basically cakewalks while 
Necrons and Dark Eldar are pretty difficult.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 BUGS 🌀🌀🌀

✅ No bugs that impact your gameplay
🔲 Minor bugs that are mostly just nuisances
🔲 Some bugs can severely impact your gameplay
🔲 There are some gamebreaking bugs
🔲 The whole game is a single bug

🌀🌀🌀 STABILITY 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Frequent crashes and FPS drops
🔲 FPS is mostly unstable, crashes may occur
🔲 Game is very unstable from time to time
✅ Game is generally very fluid, but FPS drops and stutter can occur
🔲 Game works like a well oiled machine

🔲 Stability can vary extremely
🔲 Steam-Workshop objects and Mods may cause instability

🌀🌀🌀 PRICE 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 Free
✅ It's a steal
🔲 Can't complain
🔲 Slightly Overpriced
🔲 Not enough content/polish for the Price
🔲 You might as well burn your Money

⚠️The amount of potential time you can have
in the campaign mode is very high for the
price tag.⚠️

🌀🌀🌀 MICROTRANSACTIONS 🌀🌀🌀

✅ None
🔲 Cosmetics
🔲 Gameplay-Affecting
🔲 Microtransactions make the game easier
🔲 Microtransactions are oppresive and diminish fun
🔲 Microtransactions are needed to have any fun

🌀🌀🌀 SHOULD YOU BUY? 🌀🌀🌀

🔲 No, don't bother
🔲 Maybe, better wait for updates
🔲 Probably, better wait for a sale
✅ Yes, Full price is worth it

🔲 The game is not finished yet

🌀🌀🌀 ADDITIONAL NOTES 🌀🌀🌀

But, it's worth it even if you don't want to wait for a sale. You'll want to have all of them so you can play with all the races in game.

I suggest taking it to the next level though with the Ultimate Apocalypse mod + accompanying additional map packs that got ""Apocalyzed"" (their personal edit to various maps to actually allow you to zoom all the way out like you're naturally used to doing in modern RTS's). Having played nearly 2k hours worth, I truly feel this is the way its meant to be played. It adds so much onto the experience &, personally, I find the AI remains a satisfying challenge on the hardest difficulties. Best of all, it's pretty authentic to lore (as far as it can while also maintaining some semblance of balance).

Without the mod, it's still a great game, but it's a product of its time. Graphically, it hasn't aged all that well, but the most frustrating thing will be how close the camera is locked in. Maybe it's just that frustrating for me because Ultimate Apocalypse spoiled me by fixing the camera, but it makes a HUGE difference.

Gameplay is based on squad system instead of single unit (like in starcraft). What this means to an ordinary RTS player is that if you are not very gifted in terms of APM but can make quick decisions on fast-changing RTS battlefield then you have better chances in squad system RTS, then in more challenging single unit RTS, where you need to micro more precisely and you have much more subjects to control.

Story. Well, to be honest, this game is for infinite hours of skirmish battles and not for campaign. Dark Crusade delivers much better campaign in every way. In Soulstorm we don't have in-vox commanders' brawls during stronghold mission, we don't have our buildings in defense missions and now we have Megaman style strongholds instead of neutral territory with unique tasks. Combined with having to destroy every enemy building rather than just the HQ (like in Dark Crusade), it drags on to the point of tedium.

All in all, Soulstorm is satisfying RTS game for a countless hours of multiplayer skirmish battles. Although moving from the first Dawn of War game, that even has place in cybersport hall of glory as it was one of the WCG 2005 official games, adding more and more races made some of the match-ups questionably balanced (however, the vast majority of players still blame the eldars and fail to notice imbalance in other match-ups).",1586864241,1586864241,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

-Areas you control no longer save their buildings following a capture or attack, forcing you to either pay req for  forward structures or forcing you build a new base from scratch.
-The game is overall much slower, earning req and capturing territory takes a much longer amount of time (Mainly due to the victory condition being changed from destroying the HQ to destroying all enemy structures.
-Many parts of the story are nonsense (See Boreal's speech and Imperial guard's baneblade miss-shipment, as well as the simple fact space travel is supposed to be impossible during a warpstorm yet some of the stronghold abilities work off ship travel)

Now the question then stands: Why a positive review?

Because Soulstorm is home to the biggest mod of Dawn of war: Ultimate Apocalypse
Ultimate Apocalypse is to Dawn of war as Brutal doom is to the original doom, except much bigger in scale, adding two new factions to play with (Inquisition and Tyranids) as well as increasing the amount of units to play with by a thousand fold, as well as adding titan scale units and expensive super weapons.

It is a great classic which has pretty fast paced combat and a large variety of victory conditions you can use which keeps it interesting despite playing it for so long. For this game I would definitely give it a 9/10 with the only part that the game that could use a tiny bit of polishing is with unit movement (VERY rarely a unit gets stuck randomly).

It's all right?

Positives: Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle seem cool, although they each have a largish number of new mechanics and no real solid explainers for those mechanics. Air units are cool, but some of them are crazy OP, and the AI does not handle them well. They also don't 100% make sense, since they just hover...not how airplanes work IRL, but it's ok I guess.

Negatives: Shows its age. Every once in a while you see an asset or texture that has, like, 6 pixels (and I was playing at 1440p!). There's also just in general a lot of OpenGL fuckery going on that you can see super well given the passage of time. The campaign is mechanically the same as the one from Dark Crusade, so just because it's a solar system rather than a planet don't go expecting anything fancier. They also took out a few cool things like when you conquer a region, you get to keep the buildings you built, but then they added a few things like webway gates and arguably better powers, so that feels like a wash. There are three campaign difficulties. Easy is where you can probably speedrun the campaign in two hours or some shit. Normal is where you have to put in a modicum of effort, but you're never really in danger of losing a single battle. Hard is where every battle you get curbstomped by an AI that starts with more stuff than you could build in the first fifteen minutes. There is no middle ground.

I want to note quickly that the skirmish AI seems to have gotten worse since Dark Crusade (the campaign AI is bad too, but then it was bad to begin with). I played a game against the Dark Eldar where they built two combat units ever. I went to their base to destroy it, and it had all of the builders and all of the plasma generators, but nothing else. Why? No goddamn clue. The AI also loves spamming heroes and non-reinforced units, but I think in 6 or 7 games I only saw like 5 reinforced units (this is playing at campaign normal, because I don't like getting curbstomped). I have no idea why it makes such poor decisions.

Using Steam Play/Proton on Linux, I had it crash twice in 5 hours, so just FYI if you're on Linux. It didn't crash in battles, but it did crash in the campaign interface, so stability will hurt you. No idea if that's a game thing or a Proton thing, but just throwing it out there.",1584983349,1584983349,False,1,0,0.439253240823745728,0,True,False,False

Two new races aren't really worth (they are boring).
Campaign  is the same as in Dark Crusade, but boring, because of worse cinematic intro/outro when dealing with attacks on enemy fortresses. They don't carry the same W40k vibe like in previous games.

Play Dawn of War and Winter Assault for story, play Dark Crusade for skirmish and conquest style campaign.

Singleplayer: If you are fine with an AI that cheats and cheats blatantly but is very very stupid, you might like the single player experience of this game. The harder campaign missions pit you against multiple AI. These missions will tend to revolve around whether or not you can rush one of them and kill them before they can get started, it leads to very fast paced game play which is why I like it so much. You also get to buy starting units and buildings which let you get into the fight even faster. Persistent bases from Dark crusades are gone which is good for the overall balance of the campaign as it gives meaning to purchasing defenses and stops you from roflstomping the ai or building defenses for an hour. One glaring flaw in the AI is that on the world map they rarely leave their starting worlds meaning that after you conquer your own starting planet their is nothing stopping you from skipping turns repeatedly to save up resources. I suggest you try to win in as few turns as possible to challenge yourself and improve the experience.
Multiplayer: I have played one multiplayer game and it was awful. These older dawn of wars have several bad mechanics that make the game play very frustrating. A few examples: 
1) Vehicles force infantry to get out of the way whenever they move this includes vehicles that 'certain' races have which can jump jet across the map, thereby providing an invisible barrier you cannot cross for several seconds and tangling up your infantry in a traffic jam while they get shot. 
2) Melee units can't do any consistent damage as a competent player can just tell his units to run away. Even if your units start swinging if a unit moves too far away before the attack animations finish they don't take any damage. Effectively melee units are worthless except to force enemies to move instead of shoot.
3) The game play tends to be very vehicle focused due to several other mechanics that I won't get into.
4) The game is very clearly unbalanced, this is inevitable with an asymmetric game, but the balance could be a lot better than it is. As it stands, Eldar is the most over powered race I've ever seen in an RTS (except for maybe Yuri from C&C:RA2), having several abilities which give them superb mobility for few or no downsides. 
TL;DR if you are a masochist that likes unfair older RTSes, and can put up with occasionally clunky controls. This is a good game for you.

This game will suck sometimes. Sometimes the AI will be rude, and stomp you so early. Sometimes your friends will rush you, and make the game no fun at all. But then other times, you'll have a fight you don't think you can win. The odds are against you, seeming insurmountable. Then, you'll catch a break. A vulnerability in the enemy will make itself apparent, and if you grab it, exploit it, and turn it to your advantage, you can take the upper hand. There is nothing as satisfying as starting the round as the underdog, beaten up on by your opponent, and ending it by smashing those who hurt you to teeny tiny little bits.

Lesson being: Losing will set you free. Each loss is just another reason to win. Another strategy gained from your enemy. Another weapon in your arsenal in the next fight.

This game adds Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle to the races from Dark Crusade.  Can't speak to Dark Eldar--the Sisters of Battle have a ""Faith"" mechanic that takes some getting used to, but they're fun.  They also add flying units to everything, but those are mostly pointless.  The campaign feels mostly faceless and storyless--there's no special challenge maps like ""find the servitors"" or ""defeat only with the units you have"" like there were in Dark Crusade, and maps don't keep the buildings from your last playthrough, which makes defenses more interesting, but also ruins any sort of sense that you're fighting over genuine encampments.

I recently went back to Soulstorm for the challenge of beating the campaign on the hardest difficult. I played as the SM becaue they are generally the most balanced and versatile race. Spent a little bit of time in the skirmish mode with the other races but not a whole lot. Cant speak on the multiplayer as i did not go back to it this time. Had an all round great experience revisiting the series.

Some things have not aged well though. The pathfinding can be a bit frustrating sometimes. The campaign can get a bit repetitive when you are having to defend a province for 4 or 5 turns in a row. This means having to play the same skirmish map repeatedly until capturing all the provinces around or wiping out the other races on that planet. It is generally agreed that the campaign in Dark Crusade more engaging and is considered the highlight of the series. I would have to agree with this.

The voice acting is stellar and really makes you feel like your in the 40k universe! Even though a lot of the lines get repeated throughout battle many times is did not bother me at all. The races are very diverse and there is plenty of variety for different play styles. There is loads of replay value in learning and becoming proficient in all the races. The character models and animations still look good today and there are mods available for improving the graphics. There is a mod called turbo mode that enables widescreen and the ability to zoom out which are both excellent additions that I would recommend. There is also of course the Ultimate Apocalypse mod as well which is massive and adds a ton of units.

Overall the 50+ hours i spent revisiting Soulstorm was well spent and I would still recommend this game in 2020 to both new and returning players alike. ""For the Emperor!""",1582166904,1582166904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then DOW II came out and everyone was like....lets play some Soulstorm.  I recommend picking this up if your a fan of the series or even just an RTS fan.  A few things on this game for the few out there that may not know already.  The short version of a very long story is that the team working on this game basically got between sixty or seventy percent complete and then were flat told great work guys but after this is done you are all fired.  Due to that happening there are quite a few mistakes in the game that persist to this day from things as large as things that will crash HQ battles if you get a little to creative or clever (like destroying the Tau guidance beacons before you get your base sent in so that you are not racing a timer) to little things like Carron's Daemonic Ascension having Eliphas' name in it.  For those of you like me who are not millenials this game came out right when gaming as a whole was starting to shift to the millenial mindset so where Dark Crusade was based on the harder you work the better your game went and patience, Soulstorm is all based on ""I can beat someone in ten seconds better than you can.""  It is all rush tactics which is why your base structures no longer stay when built during battle and honor guard prices absolutely skyrocketed.  Small changes were made completely based upon rush tactics to make things more challenging for rushing as well such as a province getting two bases now at a strength of five instead of six and since bases don't stay now enemy attack strength in defensive battles is based upon the general and his/her honor guard instead of the strength of the province he/she is attacking from.  Overall this is what I would say to answer most of the common questions.
Is Soulstorm worth buying? Yes
Is it as good as Dark Crusade? No
How are the two races that were added? Worthless.  The Dark Eldar have crap morale, as in the elite of elites in the army topping out at 300 and the vehicles are made of paper.  Yes they can be very powerful in the hands of a practiced player but so can any faction.  The Sisters of Battle are absolutely terrible if you play multiplayer millenial style (rush rush rush look I can beat you in three seconds better than you can beat me in three seconds) and grossly overpowered OG style (No rush timers, map divide restrictions, true skill based matches).  
Should I go pass this game in the franchise? No, actually hell no.  DOW II and on are trash games that are way overpriced for what you get, especially Retribution and the developers have already pulled the Blizzard and abandoned the game with public apologies completely blaming listening to what fans of a younger age wanted.  Blizzard at least had the balls to outright blame millenials DOW III did as well but in a hint hint way.  Multiplayer is still strong in Soulstorm and back whereas it is basically dead on DOW II and furthur outside of a very small, extremely dedicated fan base.  That is pretty much it, my score 7/10.",1579979664,1579979664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Winter Assault brought new factions and 2 new campaigns. Dark Crusade gave Dawn of War a new flavour with a meta map playing like Risk but maps are fought in RTS. Soulstorm's only new features are 2 new factions, flying vehicles, a new campaign, and retweaked gameplay elements.

There are 7 playable factions in Dark Crusade, Soulstorm brings in 2 new factions; Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle. All factions have their own advantages, disadvantages, significant playstyles, and starting abilities. Upon defeating an enemy stronghold, your playing faction will gain said defeated enemy ability in the single player campaign.

Chaos
Advantages: Diverse Infantry, Strong morale, chaos magic, morale depleating abilities.
Disadvantages: Expensive buildings, some infantry and vehicles are more expensive.
Significant Playstyle: Diverse infantry allows for very versatile playstyle.
Starting Ability: Collect all resources from every territory regardless of connection.

Dark Eldar
Advantages: Fast moving infantry and vehicles, invisiblity, buildings self build, anti morale attacks, regain morale abilities.
Disadvantages: Buildings take up plenty of space, infantry and vehicles are relatively weak.
Significant Playstyle: Hit and run tactics meaning strike key locations rather than mass infantry/vehicle assaults. 3rd resource; souls for powerful abilities that regain morale, damage enemy morale, or cause widespread damage.
Starting Ability:Travel through any webway gates in meta map.

Craftworld Eldar
Advantages: Fast movement speed, teleport via webway gates, or ability, invisibility, thin narrow buildings that take up less space, inexpensive infantry and buildings. 
Disadvantages: Weak infantry and buildings.
Significant Playstyle: Hit and run tactics, fast movement speed and high damaging weapons encourage great use of playstyle.
Starting Ability: travel up to 3 captured territories per turn on meta map.

Imperial Guard
Advantages:Useful attatchable commanders, inexpensive infantry, fast renforcements, use of building as bunkers, arguably best and most versatile vehicles, and best relic unit; The Baneblade.
Disadvantages: Weakest infantry units, weakest morale, low hardcapped elite units not effective without commanders, large numbers, or vehicle support.[b] *BLAM!*  CALLING IMPERIAL GUARD WEAK IS HERESY! [/b]
Significant Playstyle: Mass infantry, attrition assaults, vehicles are a staple.
Starting Ability: Anything bought with meta map requistion is cheaper.

Necrons

Disadvantages: Only builder units can capture strategic points, slowest moving faction, slowest production and renforcements, vehicles are weak and difficult if improperly used.
Significant playstyle: Only one resource is used, capturing points reduced production time, durability and good morale is suited for attrition.
Starting Ability: some garrison and honour guard can be recovered

Orks
Advantages: Fast production and unit renforcement, good durability and morale, cheap infantry, strong melee, most buildings have machine gun emplacements.
DIsadvantages: Least accurate ranged units, unintelligent units won't fight unless ordered, must build plenty of banners,[strike] Relic unit; the Squiggoth is not very manuvarable, weak againt most relic units, and painful to use [/strike] [b] WUT ARE YA TALKIN' BOUT HUMIE GIT? DA SQUIGGOTH IS A MIGHTY BEAST DAT WILL KRUMP ALL YA HUMIES, POINTY EARS, SPIKY BOYS, AND WUT ELSE. NOW LEAVE, YOU AIN'T GUD ENUFF FOR OUR LIST!

STARTIN' ABILITY: WHEN WE CAPCHUR A PIECE OF LAND, OUR GROTZ AND BOYZ  WILL SLOWLY COME TO GUARD DAT LAND AND DEFEND! [/b]

Sisters of Battle
Advantages: Mix between SM and IG; cheap infantry, fast reinforcement, good durability and morale. Versatile and powerful vehicles.
Disadvantages: Relic unit; Living Saint is not powerful in damage, use more as support unit. Commanders have mediocre health but make up with faith abilities.
Significant Playstyle: Flamers and meltas are a staple, morale destroyer with flamers, melee units are powerful, 3rd resource is faith; generated by buildings and some units, to use as abilities offensively, defensively, or support.

Significant Playstyle: Shoot at a distance, elite tier units can either be a more battlesuits and an elite gunship, or better kroot units and upgrades.
Starting Ability: Moon Cannon that weakens defenses.


The story in Soulstorm is almost a carbon copy of Dark Crusade, we have an array of factions flooding to a system with the intension of getting rid of all other factions. The Imperium of Man is at each others' throats again (even the inquisition). The story has some lore contradicting themes such as the 3 factions of the imperium using xenos technology; webway and tau moon cannon, craftworld eldar not tricking enemies to fight eachother, sister of battle fighting aliens and demons despite being the armed wing of witch hunters etc.

Comparing Dark Crusade, there were some major downgrades, character dialogue interactions during stronghold assaults are gone, some voice actors not returning, 4 planets make meta map awkward, and wargear choices are very goofy looking even by 40K standards such as Vance Stubbs holding the plasma gun sideways like a gangster.

Despite Soulstorm being arguably the least impressive of the 4 first Dawn of War games, what made Soulstorm memorable were the memes it spawned; yes the voice acting was bad, but it was so bad  it's good, Indrick Boreale has a very laughable accent that made him speak weird. ""Batul Brothas!"" (Battle Brothers!), ""Spehss Mahrens"" (Space Marines), ""Blud Rehvens"" (Blood Ravens), ""Empra"" (Emporer), ""Steel Rehn"" (Steel Rain). Not to mention being the baldest and fewlish man in the imperium. Firaeveus Carron screaming ""METAL BAWKSES!"" when he sees Rhino Transports. Vance ""Motherf***ing Stubbs being a fan favorite in Soulstorm because he is the only likable characters other than Gorgutz, and being hailed as the manliest Imperial Guard member 2nd to Sly Marbo, and also sending away 100 baneblades out.

Modders have created mods such as Ultimate Apocalypse for Soulstorm featuring more units, more factions, and bigger battles to fight.

My first choice was Adepta Sororitas and while they turned out to be as weak as ranged factions, their playstyle is still mimics that of Adeptus Astartes. For throwaway maps it wasn’t that big a deal, but on story-missions sometimes it was hard. Worst one was the mission against Astra Militarum. When you and the AI start on equal you can suppress their expansion by the virtue of having human player powers. But their home-base starts already at maximum strength and once scripts allow it, they harass you with attrition. I lost or abandoned the fight several times, until I noticed why exactly my dumb experimental tactic i used on some plain maps has worked before. Adepta Sororitas Rhino transport has a ton of HP, costs about nothing and while it shoots like ork towers — a lot of animation, but only one low damage bullet once in a while, and their unit cap is ridiculous. I just flooded the map with stupid transports and overwhelmed any Baneblade thrown at me. From that moment i employed this dumb and boring but effective tactic every time I got in trouble. While aesthetically interesting the rest of Adepta Sororitas units are pretty weak and boring. The new Dark Eldar are cool, pretty effective and well balanced. Necrons this time started to talk in cutscenes, which is stupid, but whatever.

The rest of the game is exactly the same as Dark Crusade. Padding skirmish maps, powerful bonus squads, pretty upgrades for the leader, cool home-base fights with cutscenes and different goals, and three (!) Imperium factions at war with each other and with not much explanation. There are new flying units for everyone, and a new titan for Necrons. But the flyers at this scale are pretty meaningless and Deceiver is really meh. Global map looks like several planets and that’s cool.

Somewhere in the middle of my complete walkthrough i’ve installed an FoV mod, and after that it’s impossible to go back. The game was never released on consoles, and even if we consider the possible reasoning that 2004’s average hardware was not being able to process such tiny amount of fully 3D units at minimum settings, this expansion was released in 2008. Nothing prevented the devs from unlocking the camera, the mod looks like it wasn’t that hard to create. After tasting proper FoV, unmoded version feels painfully claustrophobic and unstrategic. You can’t make adequate decisions, when you lack information, and the game’s friendly AI is pretty pathetic on its own.

For anyone who likes Dark Crusade there’s no reason to not like this serving of more of the same.",1578959604,1578959604,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

I have updated Soul Storm to the top and downloaded mods that allow me to dedicate more memory to the game. This way the game does not crash, in fact you can play with Titanium Wars now pretty sweet :)",1523219286,1578171279,True,0,0,0.427714735269546509,0,True,False,False

Build up your base, you army and duke it out. Like Star Craft or Halo Wars. While there are Characters such as Chapter masters, Archons, etc. the most effective way to beat the game is to play to your army's strength ex: Space marines, build Space marines and Dreads, IG hunker down with infantry and kill everything with your tanks. Chaos, build up Space marines and Demons with defllers. This game captures the 40k table top in such a way that people still play to this day. It isn't graphic intensive, can be played offline the campaign is great you have to kill every other army wiping them out or driving them out of the solar system you're trying to take in the name of your faction you have chosen. The factions in this game consist of Space Marines, Chaos, Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle, Orks, Tau, Necrons, Eldar, Dark Eldar. You can make your own color schemes so fan made armies can be made such as ANGRY MARINES and the pony marines (look them up xD) However in the campaign your stuck to set chapters for each army, Blood Ravens, Black Legion, Bloody Rose, etc. etc. the game plays like Rock paper scissors, each army has an answer for something another army has, even adding Planes into the mix. The battlefield awaits will you help the imperium and purge the xeno, kill the heretic, and slay the mutant or will become the imperium of mans down fall as you play Xenos or even the heretic astartes.

Soulstorm introduces two new races, the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar. Both races are okay on their own but don't feel as unique as the Necrons or the Imperial Guard from the prior expansions, and many fans would've preferred some of the more unique races to play as such as the Tyranids. Alongside that, Soulstorm also recycles the RISK style campaign from Dark Crusade. But they somehow made it worse by making the UI more cluttered and having significantly worse writing and voice acting. The campaign feels like busywork to go through as a result and you're better off just replaying Dark Crusade's.

So why is this recommended? Well, since Soulstorm was the last expansion it contains all of the skirmish maps and races from the prior games. Plus some new stuff. It was also modded the most, with several extremely impressive modifications made exclusively for it. Such as the famous Ultimate Apocalypse mod that significantly increases the size of the battles you undertake. There's even a mod that allows you to play the original campaign and Winter Assault, in Soulstorm with its new units. As a result its easily the most ""complete"" one to just jump into skirmish or multiplayer in. It's an expansion that's largely only good due to the past work of Relic and not the new developers, and only benefits from being ""the last expansion"" and having so many mods for it. As a result it's recommended from me just for that reason. But as a stand-alone experience it's easily one of the worst 40k games.",1577600367,1577600416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Soulstorm is considered by many to be an inferior expansion to Dark Crusade due to it's recycled and overly lengthy campaign, the failure to bring Tyranids into the game and many gamebreaking exploits when the game was first released. 

Still, most of those issues are now fixed and Soulstorm is definitely the most balanced version of Dawn of War. Where Dark Crusade have both Necrons and Tau being very overpowered at every stage of the game and the cheaper teching costs allowed races such as Chaos Marines to fast tech to T3 and overwhelm opponents with elite units, Soulstorm has none of those issues and while the balance is not perfect, each race all have highlights.

My most memorable moment from that game was sending two squads of berzerkers after some imperial guards and a chimera. Some of the guards jumped into the chimera and cornered themselves.  My berzerkers' voices got looped and kept screaming ""BREAK THEIR BACKS! BREAK THEIR BACKS! BREAK THEIR BACKS!"" their voices overlapping before cracking open the tank and killing everyone inside.

After the game, I told everyone what had happened with my berzerkers' voices and we started discussing how fucking scary that would be... Being stuck in a tank that can't escape and these giant armored men swinging massive axes that sound worse than chainsaws into the tank and GETTING THROUGH. Except, chain axes aren't all you hear, you just ""BREAK THEIR BACKS!"" getting louder and louder as new holes and gashes are chopped into the vehicle and you have nowhere to go. Your weapons do next to nothing against their armor as they fire random shots into the now massive holes on the tank.  The engine is long disabled, the crew is either dead or just as stuck as you are, the turret is dead because there's no power and the men scream ""BREAK THEIR BACKS!"" as everyone around you makes futile attempts to fight back before one of the armored men gets through the hatch, hacking at the nearest man then shooting several more before anyone can react.

Fucking terrifying.

The other expansions of Dawn of War were very good and well done, Soul Storm is absolute rubbish. I recommend the other expansions and avoid this one. The campaign tries to copy what Dark Crusade did, and just did it very poorly. The race balance is horrible, most of the game code is not optimized and lags horribly, especially when flamers are used, where the other expansions don't have this problem. Aircraft where slapped in so lackadaisically it borders on parody. The voice actors for these new units, factions, and characters are so bad, that mods for this game have better voice actors.

The only reason to get this expansion is for the excellent mods and the large player base, which this game has the largest player base of any of the Dawn of War games by a significant margin. Why people would play this expansion over Dark Crusade and/or DoW II and its expansions or even DoW III is beyond what even the seers can devine.",1396552909,1576277912,False,3,0,0.442928910255432129,0,True,False,False

But if you're looking for an actual review... Here goes!

Pros:

Larger battles compared to DoW II and DoW III
Awesome modding support
Much more replay ability

Cons:

Old graphics
Buggy and prone to crashing
Modding is a must to make the game really enjoyable

More detail...

Compared to Dawn of War II and III, this is a bloody masterpiece!

With the larger maps, army sizes, and less captain of a squad feeling, the game has an overall much better feel for the universe of 40k. The awesome battles than can be made between your favorite factions in 40k, and seeing Necrons, Eldar, Imperium, and Tau all on the same big map fighting for resources is just pure awesomeness. 

The mechanics are also much more simple, and learning each faction takes a game or two, and then you pretty much understand how they work. Each faction is very similar, so its mostly the few unique things like Tau battlesuits or Necron destroyers that make each faction really stand out. 

Sadly the real meat of the game is hidden under mods, but luckily it doesn't take long. The mods for this game are pretty extensive, and the most infamous of these being Ultimate Apocalypse making into Supreme Commander with 40k. 

Also the game is rather buggy, and in my 200+ of gameplay with mods, i've crashed over 15 times being a mixture of pushing the engine too hard, and just looking at the menu the wrong way. 

All in all the game is fantastic, and if you're a 40k fan wondering wether this is better than DoW II or DoW III, this game will beat it any day! But for the real fun, you will have to mod the game, but that's not very hard luckily.

The race customization with no profanity filter to be spotted aids in making each playable race more personal (and humorous) when playing with other folks. The gameplay is simple, fun, and does not induce and salt- matches can easily be created again once your previous one is ended. 

Each race is so different to play with, though similar in base building mechanics enough to be able to pick each up on the fly when you want to try something new. There are plenty of maps to choose from, and plenty of ways to go about winning. Remarkably, even defensive playstyles are feasible, though can end up in incredibly grueling and long affairs when played with other people! The massive squadrons from each army that engage make battles a great treat. You can feel the weight of the war when you choose to send out a large force to engage the enemy. Being able to play with bots and change difficulty settings along with which races you are pitting yourself against adds an extra dimension of fun whether you face off those bots with friends, or face off your friends and the bots both!

Someone who knows even a little bit about Warhammer 40k will understand the strangeness and oddity of the story.

Buy this game if you enjoy 40k, DOW1 and its following expacs are some of the only good 40k video games.

Pros:
-Mods, lots of awesome mods.
-Base game is still fun, campaign is a good time.
-AI is a good time, especially on the hardest difficulty.
-Leave scarring and bodies on max, play Imperial Guard vs Orks, and just watch as thousands of dead guardsmen liter the streets like the true Imperial General that you are.

Cons:
-The unit pathing is terrible
-The standard camera is awful, can make you sick, first thing you should do is get a camera mod.

The big additions to the Warhammer 40K family are, once again, two more factions and a nonlinear campaign based on a Risk-style turn-based tactical map. Here, the two new sides are the fanatically religious Sisters of Battle, a group of pissed-off space nuns who take Catholic guilt to a whole new level, and the sadistic Dark Eldar, who chow down on souls for fun. The Sisters are most notable for such downright spooky units as the Penitent Engine, which consists of a heretic strapped to the front of a crucifix bot loaded with flamethrowers, and a faith resource that juices what amounts to battlefield spells. The Dark Eldar are almost as memorable, due to a nifty slave-and-demon thing going on with regard to units, and a new soul-essence resource that powers enemy-blasting combat abilities. But even though these features give the factions plenty of personality--particularly the Sisters, whose Canoness leaders screech loony battle cries like ""Witchcraft, heresy, and mutation!""--neither brings much new to the table when it comes to gameplay.

I vastly prefer the original DoW, WA or even DC to this installment. The two new races both feature magic, and it just doesn't fit well with the other races. It's unbalanced somehow.

The AI is atrocious. Units getting stuck in terrain, units not engaging in melee even when told to, units disobeying orders, units doing nothing.

The campaign has some of the worst grind I have ever seen. Each stronghold map is a gruelling, minimum 2-hour snoozefest with waves upon waves upon waves of enemies hurled at your forces. These missions are heavily scripted and are really terribly boring.

The flyer units fit neither the engine nor the theme of this game, they were a complete waste of time and developer resources.

I'm starting to think that there is an upper limit to the usefulness of various races. Sometimes, more really is less.

I wanted to like this game. But it has all of the problems of its predecessors and offers no original design or solutions.",1565812520,1565813352,False,1,0,0.362105011940002441,0,True,False,False

And that's good, great even, go ahead and have a blast, as this is probably the greatest 40k experience you can have outside of tabletop.

But if we gotta talk soulstorm, there are a few points to touch. Rebalancing is a big one, especially for the campaign. You no longer keep all your structures built when fighting in a region, so the game becomes less of a secure-and-hold slog, and more dynamic. Warp gate missions are a nice change of pace, and don't suffer from a lot of the faction imbalance of the special maps in Dark Crusade. The new factions are aight, not exactly my style but they are well made. Flying units are a thing now, instead of only skimmer/jump units.

Soulstorm added 2 new playable factions, the dark eldar and the Sisters of Battle ""Sororitas"", in addition to aircrafts for every faction, a new legendary unit and global, map wide spells for the new ones. All in all it was ""okay"", but a little of a disappointment, because the single player campaign wasn't as good as in the predecessor, repetitive and boring - at least for me.

That being said, the modding community stayed active. There is a big mod called the ""apocalypse mod"" (Link below) that is still to this year (2019) played like hell. The installation is a bitt fiddly, the stability a little off. But: and this is a big but - it reworks every faction and adds new ones. You get tons of tanks with the imperial army. You can select chapters with Space Marines, your god with Chaos, Plague Marines - oh and not to forget: Titans. Yes, Titans. That shoot nearly across the entire map. You can crank up your video resolution and zoom farer out. This thing is played more than Dawn of War 3 thanks to this mods. So please check it out.

Soulstorm also takes away a lot of the Warhammer lore during the campaign,for example the Imperial guard having such an easy access to the super heavy Baneblade with numbers up to a 100 when lore wise a IG regiment getting a hold of barley one of those is a rare thing, also no attempt was made to balance the various factions out.

While the campaign is a step down from Dark Crusade, it certainly does a few things right (such as supply lines, and re-balancing of the factions).

While some may prefer the sequel to this game, Dawn of War 2, for its complex and engaging tactical skrmishes, there is still a place in my heart for the large strategic scale of Dawn of War 1.

What makes Dawn of War as a game is the aggression in place of civilization building like other real time strategy games such as Age of Empires. There are no villagers in Dawn of War. Besides builders, one will be presented with a wide range of purely military units to use at their disposal. In place of building farms for workers primary resources are either from simple buildings that generate them passively or, more importantly, from capturing points around the map. Territory is a huge part of Dawn of War, and the aggression to take said territory is essential to staying relevant economically. Some territory points even confer special bonuses such as unlocking special ""relic"" units, making these critical to getting the upper hand over your opponent (who would also very much like that same point for his or her self.) This aggressive play makes the game much more exciting than many other RTS games.

Dawn of War is a staple of the RTS gaming scene, and rightly so. It speeds forwards at a breakneck pace and huge scale until all that's left is a single victor standing atop a thousand thousand bodies.

The gamplay is as fun as it was the previous games and it adds two new races to expand on the diversity of race choices. In terms of units in the game they added aircraft for every race. (Necrons have the attack scarabs being more the aircraft based unit but no new aircraft for them.) As nice as it is to have aircraft units, it ain't quite the overhaul of units I was expecting like soldiers, vehicles and hero units. The story feels a bit more flat than normal; though I'll play Soulstorm's story again over dawn of war retributions campaign. And the one character I've gotten to enjoy out of all the rest has got to be Indrick Boreale (insert your Boreale memes here). And lastly the soundtrack is still awesome to hear. 

Overall the game is still fun to play even if the story isn't as good as the last, but if you really want to amp up the fun to 20 I'd suggest downloading the mod Ultimate Apocalypse for soulstorm; trust me it's worth a try.

He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die.

Yet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse.

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.

Being constructively critical, if you wanted to make a 'better' game, just flesh the components on this game out a bit more.  Grow the campaign map, add a few more units, increases the number of units that can be used in the field, etc.  You might experiment with increasing building limits for making defensive fortifications or making using a unit more painful.

Settled in the grim, futuristic setting of the Warhammer 40k universe it features heavy violence, marginal humour (with the orcs) and a dark atmosphere.
The base building is as simple as ever, you start with your HQ and your builder unit and build various military building, towers on control points and energy generators to progress thorugh the tech-tree. Unlike other rts-games dow is entirely focused on small skirmish-fights with relatively small armies (compared to Total War e.g.).
I personally enjoyed my time with DoW: Soulstorm. The two new races: Adeptus Sororitas and the Dark Eldar are a welcome addition to the roster of races. Although I have to say the Sororitas feel awfully similar to the normal Space Marines. The support of the modding community via nexusmods gave the game the longevity for me. With the race-combiner-mod you can have like ten or more races added to the original roster of races which improves on variety of gameplay. 
I highly encourage to at least check out what the mod creators have to offer: There is really good stuff out there. 
Summa summarum:
Soulstorm is a very simplistic, combat oriented oldschool-rts with base building which is not nearly as balanced as StarCraft is but if you are looking for a casual rts-experience I highly encourage to get this gem.

I really love this DLC for what it is: an expansion which introduces us new races to play with. And as before we're in for a treat because the [i]Sisters of Battle[/i] once again provide you with an environment that requires a complete overhaul of your combat strategies due to the specific nature of the new tech tree. For example; the battle starts with commanding units which are sent out to capture the first strategic points and they will be joined by the Sisterhood at a later time. You still use the regular ""attach squad"" options, but having these go solo at first?  It's something else.

I think the Sisterhood is an awesome addition to the flock, however...  I do occasionally wonder about some of the infantry and vehicles because it just looks weird at times and maybe slightly comical. Making me wonder how serious this faction is being treated. Something my girlfriend always brushes off as me being silly, this is actually her favorite faction to use when we sometimes play together.

But yeah... Missionaries who can capture strategic points and after doing so pray to the Emperor: ""[i]Hail to the Emperor for giving us this point[/i]"", it sounds really funny ;)  Exorcist units (a vehicle) which look like driving organs, only there's no music coming out of the massive pipes but a barrage of missiles that can lay waste to the heretics! It always makes me grin a bit when playing with the Sisters of Battle.

[h1]Not the best in the series though[/h1]

Unfortunately there are several problems which don't really help for our enjoyment. The sound engine seems to have had an overhaul and because of that the game sometimes misses those brutal (sound) effects which made some of the other titles stand out. That battlecry in the very first introduction movie? Goosebumps!

It also doesn't help that the tutorial session suddenly features a different narrator. That alone isn't really a problem, but it gets annoying if the tutorial itself skips over important aspects of the game and leaves the player to figure those out for themselves. For example: No where in the Sisters of Battle tutorial will it tell you that you can attach commanding units to your squads, which is actually a [i]crucial[/i] part of the units strategy. That's sloppy.

As for the campaign... the gameplay is basically the same as that of Dark Crusade; you need to capture land in order to become stronger and defeat your enemies. Within that sense it sometimes feels as if this is ""more of the same"". Definitely fun to have and play, but not as good as previous titles.

Soulstorm takes Dark Crusade and injects it with steroids. There are 2 new races to play. Instead of conquering one planet, you are on a quest to dominate an entire solar system. Necrons are still the best, IMO.  They did nerf them a tad by making you control more points in order to have faster production. I will do a run through with the other races as soon as total Necron domination is achieved.  It's a shame they destroyed this franchise (Warhammer II and III) by making it a complex RTS RPG. The simplicity of this game is what makes it so addicting. The characters are fantastic and so are the animations. The stories and voice acting are actually great!  Don't sleep on this game it still stands the test of time.
