If you don't have people to play with getting this is pointless its a really empty game.
You can build some stuff and make some money but once you have kept a few generations of pigs your set money ways for life.
Crops are pointless and because you no longer need money so is everything else.
This game has potential and it has not been abandoned but thats exactly the same as I viewed it in OCTOBER 2022 when I first played it 

Its kinda starting to die and just changing visuals and adding pets is not going to do much its just way over priced for a game that has not gotten of its butt since 2022 I came back to it in 2024 TWO YEARS and its just the same game.

They dident focus on adding anything that actually adds game play hours after about a week of game play I realise im only playing because my friend is after two years its still barren and the road map is still MEH 

Its great its not dead Kinda 

I might change this if they ever add any game play that adds more than 30 mins to the game till then its just a mid game that's not worth the price 

Save yourself the boredom and just get the multiplayer for subnaughtica or slime rancher or just play raft theres tons of realy good multiplayers out there now we dont need to hold on to indie stuff that's hardly fun anymore.

Considering all the great games out there that have gotten less money and have a smaller team working on them its actually kinda sad this is what I came back to :/",1709033537,1709033537,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let us start with what I really like. I like being a lumberjack. I like chopping down trees, sawing them into boards, and sometimes I like building things with those boards. I think it comes rather natural to me. I first discovered this talent when I played Ultima Online fy hunnit years ago. Ranch Simulator really scratches this itch.

My first Ranch Simulator game was definitely real life. I built too much fencing and had to take out a loan, and then my chickens died. So I quit and started over. That was fun!

My second game is not over yet, and you know what annoys me more than milking a cow and ending up stuck against a fence? I built this awesome ranch house, but I cannot paint it any color, at all. I mean, at least my barn is red, but the house? Nope. It's... pine-colored... Better not have to pay money for a DLC to paint my house. I swear to God.

All my chickens, and their chicks, are alive. Except for the ones I turned into delicious chicken salami sausages. Blue cheese is where the money's at. Get you some dairy cows. Milk them for all they're worth. Make cheese. Pigs start small and then they just grow giant. I was afraid the male pigs would eat the young, so I stuck them in stalls in the barn. Do not want to find out by having all my piglets et by a dumb pig.

I love and hate the pickup truck. The handling is atrocious, but you can stack a lot of boards in the back of it. You can also put at least two pigs in the back.

Oh, I almost forgot, I had to WALK my first dairy cow all the way back to the farm because I had no way of transporting her. It was a test of my patience. I almost made hamburger several times. Get a livestock trailer!

I do not have a combine yet, but I feel like I have plateaued somewhat.

This game is an absolute gem, offering players a delightful escape into the serene world of ranching.

From the moment you step foot onto your virtual ranch, you're greeted with breathtaking vistas, lush landscapes, and charming farm animals that are just waiting to be cared for. The attention to detail is impeccable, from the realistic weather effects to the adorable animations of the animals.

What truly sets Ranch Sim apart is its immersive gameplay experience. Whether you're tending to crops, raising livestock, or exploring the vast open world, every moment feels meaningful and rewarding. The sense of accomplishment when you see your hard work pay off is unparalleled.

But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Ranch Sim is its ability to evoke a sense of peace and tranquility. After a long day, there's nothing quite like escaping into this virtual oasis, where the only deadlines are set by the rising and setting sun.

In conclusion, Ranch Sim is more than just a game – it's a therapeutic journey into rural bliss. Whether you're a seasoned farmer or a city slicker looking for a change of pace, this game has something for everyone. Prepare to lose yourself in its beauty and charm for hours on end. This game its can be play solo or playing with friend, on this game we had a poor farm player must be managed that money to got high farm. Better Add some building or facilities, more human npc on city, expansion map, more farm tools l, etc about farm and hunt.

The features suggestions are in 3 categories :
- short term
- mid term
- long term

The features with a ⭐ are keys features or priority that can allow sometimes other features to take place.

Short term features :

- ⭐ MORE ITEMS :
We need more items (a lot of items are already in the game but I don't understand why we can't use and place them, as usable items or even just as a decoration) there's tons of items in the hardware store like squared water tanks or in the pre-built houses, why can't I build a chair or fireplace or any basic object from pre-existing modeled objects in the game? The items are already in the game ! You just need to make them available for players, is it so hard to just pick like 30 items created for the houses, and make them available for decoration ?

- PATHS
I don't understand that we still don't have the ability to just create a simple path or road, even a tiny ground path to make a clear distinction with grass. Most games of this type or base building games have that basic option

Mid term features :

- INTERIORS
Apart from the gas station, the general store and the hardware store, all buildings in this little city are closed. This is terrible that with already such a small map, the buildings are not even open. The map feels dead.
The bare minimum, should be to be able to visit each store, even if there's nothing to buy, but to make every place open to visit, with a NPC merchant in each store, just to give it more life. Such a ""blocks"" city feels like a game from 20 years ago. And the effort to just design a few dozens interiors is not big compare to the result and such a different vibe it would give to the city.
A good example : Medieval Dynasty, all the houses and building are open, from any village. And it makes everything just more real.

- NPCs WALKING AROUND
In addition to a few more interiors available, a crucial feature that would change completely the look of the town, would be to add a few NPCs walking outside, just walking around the city. No need to implement something very fancy, with a schedule and complex life for NPCs, we don't need something at the level of RDR2, but just NPCs walking around the town in circle would be a great start and would give much more life to the city. And then, why not making them talk between each other, buying some stuff, walking with things in their hands etc. Do it step by step.
Again, a good example is Medieval Dynasty, the only fact of having NPCs around makes the game more much alive and you don't feel alone in the game.

- WEIGHT SYSTEM
It feels very strange the weight system is completely broken in this game. If you drop even just a little object on a car, it feels like the object is 500 kilos, but some things that are supposed to be heavy, like metal, concrete or even animals like bulls, feels like they don't weight anything. A realistic weight system should be implemented, that would affect cars, animals, materials and buildings.

- ⭐ SURVIVAL FEATURES
Something I really don't understand, is that we spend all our time feeding pigs, cows, chickens, we give them water and taking care about their basic needs, and the animals are even sleeping, but our character... he don't need to eat, don't need to drink, he can work day and night and is basically a robot. It breaks all coherence.
The basic survival features should be implemented in the game. And I mean basic, we don't need something complicate, just start with the need to drink, eat and sleep and it would be amazing.

Also, a good addition would be a stamina or energy system, so the character would not be able to work like superman and would spend energy along his tasks, so it would become interesting to manage the tasks in the day to not burn the energy too fast.
There's a huge hidden potential as soon as you implement that, because we could imagine that doing all manually (feeding with bags, water, manual grinder etc) would take huge amount of energy to the character but would be cheap, and at the opposite, using machines, big tractors and this kind of stuff would be expensive to buy, but it would be even more worth it not just because it's faster, but because it takes much less energy, just like in real life.
And of course the weight system mentioned previously, would directly impact the energy system, the more carry heavy things, the more you get tired quickly.

- ELECTRICITY SYSTEM
I don't understand the concept of having to fulfill all cars and machines with fuel, and having to refill at the gas station (which is realistic and good) but... at the same time, placing a light anywhere, or placing a house anywhere, magically makes electricity appears from nowhere. Is it not supposed to be an off grid ranch ?
There should be the necessity in the game to have some electricity, from solar panels or from the grid, but then we should have to pay electricity bills.
And we should have the choice between using the grid or having our own electrical system, and THEN, the possibility to install everything, the cables, the generators etc...
A good example : Sons of the Forest.

Long term features :

- MORE ANIMATIONS
In consequence of more NPC's walking around, more survival features added and more items (like chairs for example), it should be a normal addition to have more animations, for example drinking, eating, sitting, skinning a prey (even just a basic movement, instead of nothing) and overall, more animations to make the game more realistic and alive.

- ⭐FAMILY & WORKERS
In addition to NPC's walking around the city, we should have the capacity to talk to some NPCs to convince them to come and work on our ranch.
And if we have a good relation with a NPC, we should be able to marry and have kids. That's basic ranch life.
Having some NPCs working for us and paying them, would be awesome and would give us the opportunity to put some NPCs at the most repetitive tasks.
These NPCs could even have a skills system or speciality.
And of course, we should take care of the workers and making sure they have food, they have a bed, and are paid.

- ⭐ BIGGER MAP AND NEW MAPS
The size of the map right now is extremely small. Even a map double this size would already be the bare minimum, right now it's below minimum.
The actual map should be at least 2 to 4 times bigger, even if it's just nature, with forest and moutains and nothing more.
THEN, if you don't want to do just the minimum but actually a good or great game, you should have 2 to 4 maps, with a city for each maps, with different stores and products to buy for each map. I don't think it takes a huge time to design like a big forest and a few mountains, where we could actually go around with our horse or go hunting.

- ⭐ HUNTING
Hunting in this game feels like a joke, no offense, but there's no hunting, it's simply going out of the car, taking your rifle and shooting a deer that is already in the middle of the road. The AI of the animals is non-existent. They just run around with no awareness of the players or cars around. Just adding a basic code to make the animals at least, run away from the player in a perimeter of 50 meters would already be a HUGE improvement to the game and would make it much more fun.
I don't know, take a game like the Hunter or RDR2 and implement just 5% of it, and it will be fantastic.
Just having animals that are scared of us and run away would be good.
Having the ability to carry the animal in our pick-up would be better.
Ability to skin and take the fur of the animal to do something with it would be fantastic.
And also, in coherence with the previous point of bigger map, the animals should not go around like robots, they should remain in big forests far from humans, so it would add a great vibe to hunting, because we would need to go in areas that a properly deep nature, to go hunting.",1708296168,1708296168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros-
1. I like the variety of livestock types the game provides. I
2. The ability to make the ranch exactly how you want layout wise is really nice. I like being able to customize the setup with fences and such. 

Neutral Thoughts
1. The weather system is fine, but it would be nice to have some sort of seasons and/or weather information panel displayed somewhere. Sometimes it is snowing and my character is out there running around in a tank top. 
2. The graphics are fine, but not outstanding. Lower range when compared to other similar games. I don't think this impacts my game as much, but just something to note. 

Cons-
1. My character seems very lonely. There are no NPC's to interact with, besides the limited interactions with some store clerks/quest tasks. I know this isn't what the game it about, but may make it more interesting. 
2. The breeding system is not great. For instance, every one of my chicks born is a hen. Almost impossible to get a rooster. I understand they did this because roosters and valued so much higher in the shop than hens, but not really how nature works. 
3. Limited number of crops available to grow. You also have to use planter boxes for the garden plants. Wish there was a way to till them in the ground. 
4. Limited crop plots. If you have ever played another farming simulator, this will be very evident. 
5. A single log only makes 2 wood planks. So tedious. 
6. The wildlife could act a bit more wild-lifey. The deer just hop around aimlessly waiting for you to shoot them. 

Wishlist Items -
1. Seasonal impacts on crop and garden growth. 
2. When you scroll over a livestock animal, more information such as sex and age would be helpful. 
3. More ranch buildings and items available to build. 
4. More livestock breeds.
5. The ability to chick the chicken that keeps attacking me every time I collect eggs. :)
6. I wish the breeding mechanic was a little more realistic. At this time, a male will only breed with one female a day. If you've worked on a farm, you know this to be quite unrealistic during breeding season. 

Some other wishlist items they already seem to be tackling in upcoming updates, so I wouldn't list them here. 

Overall opinion - The game is worth a buy. If you are in to very relaxed independent (maybe even soothing) gameplay, this is going to be it for you. If you are really into farming, like you have a much higher interest in farming equipment and a bit more realistic crops and farming mechanisms in your game, you will be disappointed here. If you are just in it to make a bunch of money and breed a bunch of animals, and are okay with the relatively lower graphics and realistic features, I think you will enjoy it enough to get your monies worth.",1707760431,1707760431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played this game with 2 of my friends and it was an absolute blast we had fun with all of the games vast mechanics from building to cheese making. However, where the fun stopped was when the unreal engine 5 update came out. We were a bit upset that our old save would no longer work but we were excited to have all the fun all over again. We were even more upset when upon launching the game and attempting to join each others session that either, the game did not run at all or it crashed within 2 minutes of 'gameplay' (by that I mean severely low frame rates with choppy looking textures). We tried several common bug fixes such as restarting our computers and the game, verifying game file integrity we even went as far as uninstalling and reinstalling the game. This was sadly to no avail. This was a massive letdown to us all, we went from being excited for the new unreal engine 5 update to having it robbed us of the game we once enjoyed. I have attempted to play the game every 2 weeks or so since these issues to see if patches have fixed the issues but I've had no success so far.

There are a couple of frustrating bits though, animals that don't wake up, a box truck that if you fill it with goods either freezes the game at selling points or just keeps flipping over ( I would recommend using the car transporter trailer, which is great for transporting almost everything except animals). The box truck is however good for transporting the livestock. I would recommend giving the game a try, just expect some frustration mixed in with your enjoyment!

The main problem being simply how little you can do in a Ranch Sim game, that for some reason have farming and... oil prospecting elements?

You are limited to basically taking care of cattle, pigs, chickens or horses, and then use their very limited amount of produce, like eggs, milk, and meat, to be refined into into either cheese, sausage or meatballs, and that's pretty much it, nothing else to do.

I cant even consider farming, hunting, oil prospecting or beekeeping due to how little you can do with them. Farming almost feels like an afterthought due to how limited it is, lacking crop variety, and the complete inexistence of any refining process; Hunting feels like a forgotten aspect of the game, that could easily be removed; Bee keeping and Oil prospecting being basically idle money generators.

One of my chickens, my Rooster and a chick died with no explanation, they had food and water and I check for poop several times a day so idk but it was a huge blow and I haven't been able to afford another rooster yet. The vehicle uses an insane amount of fuel and the AI traffic is beyond annoying, if it went any slower it would be stopped. I have had to take to driving round them on the grass at the side of the road so I don't die of boredom. Milking the cows is awkward as sometimes it traps me between the cow and an object and sometimes it glitches me through the wall. Also whenever you open the door or gate the cows make a beeline for them and you have to slam it in their faces to stop them getting out. I have only found one NPC, an old woman, with quests, the other rancher has no quests for me She wants me to shoot foxes and I can't afford to keep buying bullets to do it (because you get accosted by bears and have to shoot them too) or else bring her pork and eggs. I cannot afford a pig yet so I can't do that one either. If a bear aggros on you you cannot run it off, one chased me for ages, I managed to get inside the hardware store and it somehow found its way inside and killed me. I have everything ready to make honey but I have not been able to find any bees and also I cannot carry the smoker and a frame at the same time so annoyingly you have to run back and forward to vehicle several times to get any. It would also be nice if the trees grew back, it looks much nicer with them in the background. I will update this review in future if I change opinions once I get my head above water. Also I wish we could move furniture and troughs and stuff, currently you have to demolish them and rebuild them which is annoying.

I decided to try it being that it has been out for several years now thinking it should be plenty of time to develop and work out bugs. I honestly couldn't be more wrong.

I'll start with the negatives as that's what really people should be aware of.

[b]No auto save[/b]
You better make sure to save regularly manually. How you don't implement this feature from the beginning is beyond me. Nothing worse than doing several hours of work to realize most of it is gone when the game crashes. Before the developer blames my computer I can assure that my system wasn't the cause for the crash. AMD 5800X, RTX 3070, 128gb of RAM, 2TB Gen 4 NVME dedicated to games only, no OS on that hard drive. Bought a vehicle and the game crashed.

 [b]Driving Physics are terrible[/b]
You're driving on ice the entire time, god forbid you have a trailer and have to make a turn. The trailer whips like crazy. Both keyboard and controller driving is not a fun experience. There's no finesse or throttle modulation what so ever. Hooking a trailer is a royal pain. The game could really benefit from having gears. Even if it's just drive and reverse that are controlled with the throttle button and braking is done on a separate key. When using farm equipment with a controller the throttle key is the same key to activate the equipment. It's a different key on mouse but make it a bindable key. Nothing about driving in this game is realistic.

[b]No dedicated server support[/b]
Playing with friends is a pain because if you start on your save or someone else's you're SOL if you want to play for a bit alone. I saw on the Steam forums that someone (possibly a person on the development team) recommends sharing save files. Could it work? Sure, however that is the biggest headache to manage if several people are trying to play the same game. The idea behind it is just asinine.

[b]Vehicle bugs[/b]
Vehicles parked dance and float all over the place. It is to be expected in the very beginning of the game but a game that has been out several years should not have this many bugs when you have to use vehicles as often.

[b]No keybind changes for controller[/b]
I get alot of PC gamers use M/KB, how ever with how bad this game is to drive on keyboard a controller aids it to some degree. If the game does change keybinds for controller it was not allowing me to do it.

I'm sure it sounds knit picking and I can go further into negatives about this game but I don't think anything will get changed. These are the major things I noticed that make me not want to play the game.

Now for the positives

[b]Character Creation[/b]
The character creation is pretty good. It's limited but overall good

[b]Building[/b]
The building is probably the best thing about the game. It's interactive without being overly complicated for no reason. It's not the type that as long as the materials are in your inventory something just pops up. It takes the right amount of time to collect materials and plan out your build. The models seem well put together and make sense to the game. Nothing seems out of place with how the models look.

[b]Harvesting Materials[/b]
I've seen several reviews of people complaining about the hunting and guns however it's a good aspect of the game. When you start your ranch it's a bit grindy to obtain starting materials but it's to be expected in this type of game. The process of cutting trees and creating planks is fun. I would like to see concrete and metal be more interactive than buying a prefab bag or sheet of metal. Mixing the cement with water would be a good way. Metal is what it is as I don't see it being a mining sim to dig and melt ore to obtain metal.

If you made it this far thank you for the time to read this long winded rant. Overall the game needs a lot of work and I can not recommend someone paying full price for the game. The amount of time that has passed that this game is out and the amount of basic features the game is lacking makes the game not worth $25. If in the future they implement stuff like auto save, and the ability to create a server without having to purchase a second copy or over pay for some garbage rented game server I could see the game progressing. As it sits today the game is fun for a couple of hours when you're bored. Just my opinion.",1706111175,1706111175,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My chickens from the tutorial ended up dying, even though they had food and water. Admittedly, I DID forget to open the door to the small chicken coop after I built it so they were never able to go inside. Maybe the elements killed them. Or a predator. It is a mystery.

I built the small two-story house. The only issue with that is whenever I want to go downstairs I have to crouch because apparently our character is TOO TALL for the stairwell opening (not going up, just down). Weird, that.

EDIT: This only seems to happen if I'm ""too far left"" in the stairwell  going down (not that there's a lot of room to
maneuver anyway). As long as I make sure I'm to the right as much as possible I don't get stuck.


The graphics are serviceable and have gotten better since the game first ventured out. 

At this point I would like to see a focus on improving the base game. The gas station, for example. You can get gas there, and that's it. The inside of the gas station is empty and you can't go in. Seems like a wasted opportunity. Should be able to go in and buy stuff there too. Would be nice to see all the buildings expanded upon and with more options related to them, like being able to talk to the counter guy at the burger place.

I've also noticed that if you get too far from ""home base"" you can't cut down any trees, so I'm wondering what happens when I run out of available trees to cut. Guess I'll find out when I reach that point. 

EDIT: Hope to see replanting/regrowth of trees at some point, but I realize that there are lots of other
ways to make money - I just haven't pursued any yet. :-)

It would be nice if vehicles in the showroom would rotate.

If you're into arable farming, it's kinda lame however. Growing wheat in order to feed animals was hardly economically more beneficial than just paying to fill the grain silos themselves, after you've forked out for fertilizer and spent time cultivating, sowing and harvesting the land. I literally grew wheat once and then abandoned that part of the game. Horses, although cool and fun to ride and bid for at auction, have limited interaction capability apart from riding. You can't breed them either. There are also a couple of weird bugs, like fertilized chicken eggs not hatching after a while. Vehicle handling is also a bit on the wild side.
Having said that, I did have fun getting rich selling moldy cow cheese and micromanaging my bred farm animals! And building in the game is good. You can choose prefab farm houses that you supply the material for and then, once complete, spawn furniture and have a nice lived-in feel. Or you can build your own structures, although the lack of ability to repaint or texture the brown wood is a bit disappointing.

Roads are a bit wonky, and traffic are just empty husks moving at 10mph. There is virtually no AI to speak of. It is a very simple game, but tedious. Moving animals to separate males from females is obnoxious, the animals immediately head for any open door or gate the instant it is opened. You cannot tell gender until the animal is old enough to breed, and they do so nearly instantly. There is a large lake but no use for it, the hardware store is tedious to get into and out of, there is a random franchised burger joint in a small town buying local meat, when it should be a mom-and-pop diner, weird town design and layout that is ultimately pointless and is just set dressing. At $25, it is overpriced. This is a $10 game. Buy it on sale if you know what you're buying. I don't regret the purchase, but I'm glad I bought it on sale.

This game would be improved with more realistic terrain, more realistic roads, rain actually watering crops, and more appropriate set dressing. It would be improved with simple UI fixes, like showing what gender the animal is since birth. Even better would be a more rigid animal moving system, improving vehicle handling, increasing the amount of planks you receive from a piece of wood, removing the grass from underneath placed structures (there is a lawn mower, so we already know grass can be trimmed, do it automatically so it doesn't grow through the floor), and improving the animal behavior so they're less robotic ""must go through open door right this instant, stop eating, a door is open,"" and improving the gunplay and wild animals so the hunting aspect is a little more immersive, worthwhile, and engaging, rather than ""drive around until you find an animal and poof it into meat.""

If you're into arable farming, it's kinda lame however. Growing wheat in order to feed animals was hardly economically more beneficial than just paying to fill the grain silos themselves, after you've forked out for fertiliser and spent time cultivating, sowing and harvesting the land. I literally grew wheat once and then abandoned that part of the game. Horses, although cool and fun to ride and bid for at auction, have limited interaction capability apart from riding. You can't breed them either. There are also a couple of weird bugs, like fertilised chicken eggs not hatching after a while. Vehicle handling is also a bit on the wild side. 
Having said that, I did have fun getting rich selling mouldy cow cheese and micromanaging my bred farm animals! And building in the game is good. You can choose prefab farm houses that you supply the material for and then, once complete, spawn furniture and have a nice lived-in feel.

i hope Toxic Dog's Developer can read this message from an actual developer too

There are some issues in the game that need to be fixed and I hope you will take my feedback into consideration in the first place

game play: 

1- Car & items must be similar to reality that means you have to increase vehicles prices and reduce items price
and the profits should be the same 

2- i play the game with my own friends and its very kinda weird to share the same wallet
and i think you have to split wallet for each player and its not hard ( and there another tip its not important but its old fashion that the money are 3D and can be Storing it in such a safe that will be much more fun )

3- i think you have to add some bars or a restaurant that we can actually hangout and change the mod and have fun ( its boring to just work we are not slaves )


Errors and Graphics and Optimizations:

1- i can tell, my car starting to do break dance after loading my last save cause i storing some wood and even if i stop it which is impossible, i can see my wood or egg etc, stuck in the (car , wheel , etc) cannot be attach or remove 

2- animal are so provocative and stupid ass, It is as if they were intending to make me angry. They are watching carefully and waiting for the right moment for me to open the barn door for them. They are quick to get out of it and smart, but when I enter them, even though the door is a thousand miles wide.
They were behaving so stupidly and crashing into the edges of the door, to the point that I couldn't bear it and killed every animal that came out without mercy.

3- graphic are kinda nice but i don't know if its epic?
i feel even if with epic its like medium ? what i mean in that, you must upgrade streets graphics and building and environment, the most easiest thing in development is the graphics cause i am working at a game its not hard for you


4- Optimizations its so Disgusting with due respect for you guys 
i can run rdr2 with 2k ultra settings at 120fps, how the hell i play Ranch simulator at 14-53 fps?????????????
and my friends pc is 1060 he barely could reach 20 fps at very low settings? and guess what ( graphics is shit in the end )




work on these and the most important thing is Optimizations and Optimizations and Optimizations and Optimizations and Optimizations and Optimizations OptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizationsOptimizations

I also found out that there are people who give out quests  around the map and give you some dough upon completion. There is one man though, who I call Old Man Wrinkle Bum, that gives out the most exquisite quest of them all, Treasures of the Ancients. This quest gives you $2500 and it comes back every so often. 
     After collecting some money I decided it was time to buy some material for two oil rigs. After finding that liquid gold I built the rigs, gassed them up, and let them work for me. Passive income! I like it. There is quite a bit of money to be made with these things. With more bands stacking up in my bank account I went on to build a barn and buy 1 male and 6 female pigs. (Big mistake, definitely should've gotten a little less females. Did not know that the great pig death wave of '24 was gonna happen) These pigs were the best, they were loved. I fed and watered them every day until eventually I noticed something. A pig was pregnant! After a long few days the pig finally had some babies and I got to watch them grow.
     When the pigs started having more babies I realized I needed to make a silo and a windmill to easily fill up the troughs with food and water. I just simply could not keep up with feeding them. While waiting for enough money to buy the materials I saw that I failed myself as a rancher. I neglected to feed the pigs that day. One of the pigs was dead, and then another, and another. Multiple pigs had died because of my incompetence. From that day forward I swore I would never let that happen again.
      I skinned the dead pigs and filled about 6 coolers worth of meat. I went on down to the burger restaurant and sold the meat for 1.9x and got almost $9000. Now that is epic.
     Anyways, I'm really rambling on about this game so I should stop. The bottom line is that this game is really fun to play. I would highly recommend playing with friends because it makes the game easier and way more fun. Yes there are some things and little fixes that I'd love to see but the game is still great considering the fact that it's so new. I can't wait to see what the future has for this game. Thanks for reading my long review.

Really? I know it sounds a little nitpicky, but when there's a limited amount around your ranch, not being able to regrow trees or anything is a little absurd to me.  Sure you can purchase what you need from the store, but for me at least that takes a little bit of the fun out. My biggest concern is that at the time of this review I have found no real road map, and the developers haven't seemed to be very active with the community. And after being burnt by Valheim, that's a huge red flag for me.

Some of the things that need improvement to make it playable without frustration:

- an option to turn off head-bobbing. For people with motion sickness, 1st person might be unplayable. Sometimes drastic camera movements occur while driving, so be aware if that is an issue for you
- make at least small objects movable. It doesn't make sense that I cannot move a wall light after having placed it once (you can only destruct and rebuild - without reclaming any material)
- UX needs some improvement. You pick up logs with the left mouse button, but if you want to insert them into the table saw, you need to press E. Accidentalliy clicking will pack up the saw immediately and drop the log. Better continuity of controls would help a lot
- some involuntarily comic situations - there's a store with an (un)helpful lady telling you to use the self-checkout. If the store's closed, she can be seen through the window, sitting and the counter,  same expression, unmoved by her nightly freedom, just awaiting to continue her fate as a one-sentence NPC in the morning
- town feels reaaaally empty
- dialogues are lacking
- if you're playing for the first time, building blueprints is hit and miss. As you don't know (and can't see) which sides need to be accessible, you might end up placing constructions in a wrong orientation. You cannot fix it, you have to destroy and rebuild (with new material)
- radio doesn't seem to work
- it does not make sense that plants don't receive water from natural rain, not even from downpour during thunderstorms. It can rain all day, but if you get home you'll might still see your plants drying out
- lack of item descriptions - you won't know if you buy a package of seeds for 10 tomato plants, or for 100 unless you hold it in your hands (it's ten), same for building, you won't know if a planter box holds one plant or ten until you build it and try to fill it

That said, I did enjoy playing it, but the frustrating bits are...frustrating. I think I'll come back to the game after some more QOL updates.

Positives:
- character customization is great! It's always a big plus if you can play female characters and have the same range of options for all genders
- the landscape looks nice and believable for the setting (albeit a bit empty). ""Waking up"" to a crisp blue sky almost feels real and is relaxing
- the devs seem very involved and accomodating
- great potential
- harvesting crops and seeing growth is fun, as is getting livestock
- I like the customization options that are there even for chickens, and your car
- driving is hilarious
- being able to do everything yourself (sawing logs, collecting them, building, having to drive to the store  to sell your wares)

If the devs keep on working on it, this game definitely will be great in the future. As of now, it doesn't feel like a 1.0 version, but like early access. I hope future updates will adress the remaining issues and fill the game with life.",1704116998,1704116998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It runs like absolute horse poop (like the ones you have to clean). Good luck trying to get it above 60 FPS...

Game's generally a 5 or 6 out of 10. Handling feels like you're driving on ice. It also feels like there's a delay from the moment you press to drive forward to the moment you actually get going. Driving with trailers is a nightmare as they're really skittish.

Apparently, trees don't regrow and I didn't see any way you can replant them.

Quests seem very limited, and there's no real guidance on what you should do first - like I don't know, achievements that earn you cash as you progress through them such as ""build your first coop, get your first egg, hatch your first egg, sell your first egg"" so on so forth... 
Once you're done with the tutorial, you're on your own - I mean I like that in a lot of games, but sometimes just a small idea of what you should do would do it good.


For now that's all I can think of, but I'll probably update this as I play more/it gets more updates (hopefully!).",1704043682,1704043682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The deer fling themselves into traffic with reckless abandon and hitting them is like running into a brick building. Animals can breed through the walls of the barn and fencing. When you load the bed of your vehicle, everything you put in is basically super-glued down and you can do a triple barrel roll down the side of the mountain with no hard feelings and everything still in place (including animals). Once, I bought a car trailer and the rear quarter of it clipped through the edge of the building. Nothing I did could get it out so I spent the rest of that game just going around it to get in and out of the store. I got mauled by two bears at the hardware store in the tutorial. You can't pause the game even if you're playing by yourself. Every time you open a gate, every animal in the pen turns to face you and starts zombie-shambling toward the opening. When you skin an animal (especially pigs) they EXPLODE like a meat landmine and chunks of pork get flung EVERYWHERE. It's HILARIOUS. 

It's incredibly satisfying to build your ranch empire up from nothing, breeding your stock and processing animal products into cheese and sausages to sell. I've only played single player but I think having a friend and dividing farm chores would make for a fun evening or three. I'm reaching the point in my second save that I have a solid production line and predictable income, and at this point I am at a bit of a loss for what my ""next objective"" is- after the tutorial you're released to do your own thing and build up the ranch as you see fit. I've built what I want and my trajectory is clear- I suppose at this point it's a matter of amassing a fortune. 

I love everything about this game. Its programming quirks have given me several good chuckles, but it's nothing game-breaking and I'm still having a lot of fun. I may have just about run my course on it unless I find some other thing to do or build that I missed (or if I can con a friend into playing with me), but I think 60 hours is a fair amount of gameplay for the price.",1704041056,1704041056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I really liked the hunting aspect.  As an avid player of similar types of games I can say that I hope the developers of this one will continue working on it.  The interactions with objects in the world were much less complex than I have seen in other games.  That is a plus.  But some improvements still need to be made.
Some of the major things that still need work include, vehicles behaving as if on ice.  Kinda fun when you are just playing around, like drifting almost.  But, when you really need them to drive correctly it can be very frustrating.  Also, the vehicles need a low gear.  They take off like a rocket and stop on a dime.  Hunting is way too easy.  Animals make no sound as they approach most of the time.  Maybe OK for deer or rabbits, but bears are not stealthy.  There seem to be no seasons and it rains every day.  You can't make roads or do any landscaping.  Prices on things are illogical and have no basis in reality.  I could go on.
Bottom line is that the game has potential but needs some real work to be recommended.

The game is ok but many bugs, building is finicky when placing things straight and getting fencing to go straight, could do with the use of a grid, weather is terrible although they said they fixed it, it doesnt seem to be any different, rain and bad storms 99% of the time which makes you not want to play as it is so miserable. There as been so many request and ideas put to the dev to improve the game but i do not think a lot of them get listened to. You can place lights around your farm but the problem is you have to turn them on one by one when going back into the game every time, so if you have lots of lights it is a pain. Trees do not grow back even if you leave a stump.  The game is very laggy even on a good computer and played on a SSD drive. I give the game 5/10 could be better.
Not Worth the sale price, repetitive and boring, buggy, glitchy, unfinished and before any of the bugs that  have been around for ages not fixed or addressed they say there adding cats and dogs

Pros:
-Tons of fun if you get some buddies to play with you
-Building mechanics are easy to use and fairly easy if you've played games like Rust.
-The Ranching is easy to pick up and get busy fast if you don't pay attention to your animals.
-Since I bought the game devs have made updates regularly and listen to feedback.

Cons:
-Vehicle physics make driving a pain at first.
-Not very many side quests so it gets repetitive once you have an established ranch.
-Chopping trees doesn't give enough wood IMO.
-Shooting mechanics are a little weird but you don't need them all to often anyway.

I had tried my hand at Farming Sim 22 after watching a LGIO video about it, but I found it a bit too farmy for my liking. That said, my wife thought this game might be a fun experience for the both of us, so I decided to give it a whirl. After a few hours I can honestly say I really enjoy it! My wife and I have been having a lot of fun with the game thus far, and as the game is in Early Access I can only assume it will (hopefully) get better as updates roll out.

PROS:

- Large Open Sandbox-style farmland to build on to your liking.
- Fun base/farm building mechanics akin to ARK?Valhiem?similar
- Decent prefab building options for players not interested in custom base building
- BEEKEEPING!

CONS:
- Very little direction after the tutorial
- Very basic quest system that can be exploited for easy money
- Janky physics at times resulting in frustrating, allbeit funny item placements
- far too easy to pick up placed tools, leading to the player replacing and restarting production.

I'm sure I'll have more to love/hate as we play more of the game, but most of my gripes could be fixed with a patch in the future. All in all really loving this experience and enjoying the casual gaming time with my wife.

They make good money, but make sure you buy the auto grinder and sausage maker and lots of Ice-chests. Also do not put your water or feeders in the fence as the pigs or any other animals will climb them and they will escape from the fenced area, and that is a pain to deal with.

Sound Effects: The game could benefit from more sound effects, especially for dialogue.
Player Needs and Health: Introducing player needs and the risk of death would add depth to the survival experience.
Economic Options: More ways to make money would enhance the gameplay and add variety.
Radio Fix.
Inventory Improvements: Allowing players to carry more items, like logs and animal products, would improve resource management.
Melee Weapons: Adding melee weapons could diversify combat strategies.
Interactive Objects: The ability to interact with objects while holding a gun would enhance realism.

Look, I REALLY wanna love this game! I really do! It has so much potential to be better than farm simulator, but I can't. There's too many things that need fixed, or changed. I've only got 15 hours on record, but, I think that's enough time to make a semi accurate review. For starters, the driving needs a complete overhaul, especially for keyboard users. The fact the vehicles are almost ""brake locked"" until you build up a high rpm, makes its almost impossible to accurately hook up to a trailer, or similar equipment. I just spent almost 10 minutes trying to hook onto a trailer I just bought! I wasn't able to do it, which is when i decided to save, quit, and come here to review. Secondly, the trailer handling UI is terrible! If you have to use brakes on your vehicle while moving, even in my full sized pickup and the small trailer, the trailer shoots to the side and almost always spins me out. Not to mention, when driving through the woods, your vehicle is like a heat seeking missile to any rock, tree, or deer in the area, always stopping you dead in your tracks. Your vehicle flips way too easy. If you get it pinned between 2 things or you land on a guardrail? Have fun getting it off!!! You can flip your vehicle, but, it just sends your vehicle straight up then back down in the same spot! That needs to be fixed. When it rains, it should fill any water buckets, troughs, and gardens/fields but it doesn't. Make the targeting with guns more fluid. It's too jumpy and hard to aim accurately. Even when changing view, your character doesn't look down the sights, they look to the side of the gun. You have no way of knowing where you're shooting. One of the most important things in my opinion, is resource re-spawn. The trees should grow back after a certain period of time. I'm on day 18 in game and the trees I cut down on day one, still haven't come back. I believe they should if you haven't built anything there. That's all i can think of for now. If any, or all, of those things happen, my rating will go up accordingly.",1701830182,1701830182,True,11,0,0.65027153491973877,0,True,False,False

Now we finally got the long awaited 1.0 release with the big switch to Unreal Engine 5, and i still sit with the feeling that this game could be so much more. It could be that I hyped up the 1.0 in my head too much and was therefore unreasonably dissapointed that it looked exactly the same as it did when I last played it. The only upgraded visuals i noticed were the sunrays at dawn.
The upside is that the performance is noticably better, at least when it comes to number of animals on the farm. If you dare to try farming the game slows right down when you go to harvest. 
When it comes to farming it feels like it's just tacked on and not really thought out enough. It's really annoying to cultivate, plant and harvest with the vehicle physics being what they are, wheat is really not worth it to grow as feed for your animals, since when you get to the point where you have granaries on your farm then money is not really an obstacle anymore. The sunflowers look nice so I just plant them and let them stay there, not sure if they wilt after a time or not and if the do I'm not replanting.
The world still feels kind of empty, there are at least random cars and campers on the road now, but the game is still completely dead silent, there is no ambient sound unless it rains. And right now the radio is broken but that is a known issue and will hopefully be taken care of.

Like I stated in my original review below playing multiplayer really helps out with the pacing in the day, Playing this time around with my gf we could pretty quickly grow our farm to the point where we had everything and more money than we knew what to do with. It would happen fairly often that her game just shut down so there is obviously still kinks to work out in the multiplayer.
What the game lacks now is replayability, I want the ability to decorate my farm, especially I want paths and roads to layout my farm better. 

That was a lot of negativity, and while i keep my Thumbs Down, I want to press the fact that the devs are very much active, the game will improve and I will definitely come back to it again after a while!
===========================Old review=========================================
All in all I really like this game and once the kinks are worked out I can see myself sinking many more hours in it, but in it's current state I cannot recommend it, I would however watch out for updates, because there is a lot of potential and the devs do seem to listen to the community!(the snow was a mistake)!

cons :
- The optimization is pretty bad, if you have 10+ animals there is quite a bit of lag.
- The vehicles handle bad, and they really like to flip over, which can be quite amusing, but ultimatley annoying.
- The world is empty, there are a few building spread around the map, but they are empty and dead. In a hunting cabin in the mountain there's a man sitting with two guns, I assume in an update he will say something or be useful for something?
- There is very little to no sound
-Getting water from the well is really really annoying, there is a perfectly good sink in the house, why can't we use that?
- You can build your own house, which is cool, but there is no furniture so there isn't much point in building it
- The barn only has one big door and you can't build a wide one so if you put stalls in them it becomes very cramped

pros:

- The animals are well made, and the babies are very cute!
- The pacing of the day is good, I only played miltiplayer though and I can see there being to little time in the day when you have to do everything yourself.
- Character customization is good and have a lot of options
- You can color your cars pretty much any color you want",1642188897,1701795325,False,52,1,0.761336266994476318,0,True,False,True

Still the cars. Attempting to accelerate or back up at a slow enough speed to hitch a trailer is extremely annoying as no matter how gently or briefly i push the excel/reverse i still go from 0 to 10 resulting in going to far forward or backwards ending up usually running over the hitch of the trailer and pushing it out of alignment. Next are the livestock, it would be fantastic if when i open the door or gate to an enclosure that all livestock within didnt B line straight for the exit. The goats... well i dont know if i just dont have a high enough system to see the full graphics or if infact the goats are mildly demonic with only the white space where there eyes should be....they have no Iris or even a pupil. Just an even more blank look in their ""eyes"" then their usual blank look. And lastly it would be nice to know the genders of each animal by their names, the little symbol, mainly for unmatured offspring that way one could seperate the males from females before they mature and breeding gets out of hand while youre away on a mission or tending other things. I know i said the last thing was last but this one is lol. The logs!! when sanding them down they are plenty wide enough that in theory one could get 4 out of each log. Its easy to lose interest in the game when so much of it is spent cutting down trees and sanding these huge logs to get only 2 thin planks per one. i do hope that with the animal/ pets we get in the future they are useful, such as if you take it out hunting with you it alerts of nearby predators or perhaps can be trained to herd the livestock or guard the land from wandering predators. Also being able to put down straw or bedding in barns would feel more realistic and immersive. Cant wait to see what comes next. I do enjoy this game when im not focused on logging. The building and blueprint layouts are really cool and i do like that i can place down the silhouette before building, makes it easier to decide locations and designs of buildings.

I love what has been done with adding a new town & updating the general store. I hope to see the gas station updated with the possibility to go inside and speak with a clerk the same as the general store. I adore the idea of the town full of new store options, hopefully NPCs to see walking around & more to talk with. Im excited for pets too! There is still so much potential to this game that so much more can be done with it. 
I love everything about the vehicles like having to fill up the tank or the fact you have to start the car before driving it, i like the radio as well and the paint we can apply. 
No fall damage is amazing! Thank you pls keep that.

My cons; 
Driving is difficult especially with a trailer attached. 

TREES... i HATE the fact that we cant go anywhere to chop them down anymore. 
Cant kill animals by hitting them.

IDEAS THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE GAME;
i would suggest allowing us to get licenses so we can chop trees anywhere, allow trees to re spawn/regrow back, allow us to plant normal trees & start and orchard! All those would surely make a lot of people happy.

As for adding licenses, this can be applied for killing deer/bears/wolves or even the idea of fishing in the game. 

Gravel to make paths or drive ways. 

WAY MORE FURNITURE. we have the ability to build a home or shed but not a lot of furniture to put in our buildings making them less homey & sad. 

Character customization... Maybe more hair options and longer hair for females? More clothes as well.

Maybe you have to repair your car slowly over time? 

I dont mind the idea of eating & drinking, going to the bathroom & sleeping to maintain your character. It would give the houses more of a reason to be used and make the game more real. 

i have so many more ideas but idk if these comments even get read by the creators. I like this game so much and im girly af but the idea of marriage & having a partner who helps you farm would be interesting. 

(Once the tree issues are updated or fixed ill change my review to positive.)",1701576572,1701576835,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would like to suggest a backpack that can hold 12 meat in a cooler that can be in a back pack. I've killed many many wolves and they are still laying around in the woods. The hunter can always walk back to his vehicle and load the wild meat in a trailer to be sold at the general store or the hardware store. Just a thought. Also it would be a great idea to have a companion Dog for out homes and yards.

Thank you Travis Overland

I like the Ranch Simulator, it needs some work and I can give some advise on that. First off, the gas doesn't last long enough. Also, As far as buying a new vehicle,Now, yes we can resell our old vehicles, that is really nice. Waiting for the updates for Goats, Sheep, Bees and fields. Soon I'll have more idea's that may make this nice game a bit better. I love the game. I've made so far $140,000 game dollars and it mostly goes to feed. I due have an issue. Since it says when you put up a silo your food troughs will fill up with feed. That is not true. I had 2 silos and neither one of them worked. Is their a fix in that soon? I been buying 30 feed bags a week and wasting money on feed constantly.
I do recommend this game, I have Cows, Pigs, and Chicken's and 2 homes on the ranch.
Yes the Silo's work perfect now, thank you. When can we have a Dog in the truck or farm as a companion?",1648327743,1701185420,True,0,0,0,5,True,False,True

The game feels incredibly incomplete. The building and decorating tools are *extremely* limited and the landscaping tools (planting trees/shrubs, placing paths) are non-existent. The lack of angle tools for fence-building leads to major frustration. Manually stacking dozens of items (which needs to be done constantly) is a tedious chore because there is no snapping. There is no progression path, there are no money sinks, there is nothing to spend your money on once you have everything up and running, the economy is grossly out of balance. You cannot pause the game, even in single-player. The vehicle handling is awful and making even slight steering adjustments can send you spinning out of control. The game doesn't save the state of the lights, so every time you load the game up you have to go around and manually turn on each individual light. The farming is pointless because you can just refill your feed silos with a single click and the return on investment for the farming equipment is poor. The horses are pointless, because you can't breed them and training them does not yield enough money to be worth the time that it takes. 

Honestly, I could go on for quite a while, but these issues already far exceed what should be able to be said about a game that has ""exited"" Early Access.

Pros:

- The game offers a lot of freedom and customization for your ranch. You can choose what animals to raise, what crops to grow, what vehicles to buy and what buildings to renovate or construct.
- The game has realistic graphics and physics, as well as dynamic weather and seasons. The animals have different behaviors and needs, and the environment is full of wildlife and resources.
- The game has a variety of activities and challenges to keep you engaged. You can hunt deer and bears, fish in the lake, trade with other ranchers, explore the map and discover secrets, and more.
- The game has a friendly and active community, as well as regular updates and patches from the developers. The game also supports mods and Steam Workshop, allowing you to customize your experience further.

Cons:

- The game is still in early access and has some bugs and glitches that need to be fixed. Some players have reported issues with the multiplayer mode, the animal AI, the vehicle controls, and the performance optimization.
- The game can be repetitive and grindy at times, especially in the early stages. You may have to do a lot of chores and tasks to earn money and resources, and some of them can be tedious and time-consuming.
- The game can be challenging and unforgiving, especially for beginners. You may have to deal with harsh weather, predators, diseases, accidents, and other threats that can harm you and your animals. You may also have to learn a lot of mechanics and systems by trial and error, as the game does not have a comprehensive tutorial or guide.

Overall, Ranch Simulator is a fun and immersive game that lets you live out your ranching dreams. It has a lot of potential and room for improvement, and it is suitable for fans of simulation and sandbox games. If you are looking for a relaxing and realistic game that lets you create your own ranch, you may want to give Ranch Simulator a try.",1701087322,1701087322,True,26,0,0.727753162384033203,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐✩✩✩ (2/5)

Ranch Simulator presents a mix of building, farming, and hunting activities, but its overall execution leaves much to be desired. For those intrigued by the concept but wary of its shortcomings, it's advisable to consider this title only during a significant sale.

The building mechanics offer a basic foundation for constructing your ranch, but the lack of depth and limited options may leave players wanting more from this aspect of the game. While it provides some initial enjoyment, it fails to evolve into a truly engaging experience.

Farming in Ranch Simulator is straightforward but lacks the complexity and variety found in more established simulation titles. The limited range of crops and basic agricultural features may appeal to casual players but might not satisfy those seeking a more immersive farming experience.

The inclusion of hunting adds variety, allowing players to explore the wilderness and track wildlife. However, the hunting mechanics lack the depth seen in dedicated hunting games, and the repetitive nature of these activities may not hold the interest of all players.

Graphically, Ranch Simulator falls short of delivering a visually striking experience. The rural landscapes lack the polish and detail seen in more refined simulation games, contributing to the overall feeling of mediocrity.

Considering the game's limitations, it would be prudent to wait for a sale if you're interested in trying Ranch Simulator. While it may provide some casual enjoyment, the lack of depth and innovation makes it difficult to justify a full-price purchase. With an emphasis on budget considerations, Ranch Simulator earns a modest 2 out of 5.",1700994385,1700994385,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You can craft and buy everything day 1. You only need money.
So the game is just about finding the way to get money efficiently and unfortunately, the best way to make money is to construct two derricks and get a passive income of 1K per day. (For instance if you hunt all any animal on the map which takes a significant amount of time, consumes bullet and gas for the car), you get around 200 or 300$ a day. 

DO NOT TRY TO PLANT TOMATOES. 
You basically handpick tomatoes one by one and you can imagine how much you sell a tomato...

There is no goal except making money to buy things that help make more money (not all the time tho)
And in the end, the money is only used in order to buy horses but there is nothing you can do with them, except try to train them and make a profit. Spoiler alert, read a guide cos the system is broken. 

To train a horse, you need to run in a circle and jump over obstacles.
If your horse is too slow, then it is not possible. High end horses are too fast so you can't turn enough to jump properly.


You can build a barn, did not find any use for it. 
You can build a house, did not find any use for it. 

You basically just build things to make your ranch look like a ranch but any building is entirely useless which is quite unfortunate. 
Ho and be prepared to spend hours in front of the saw to make planks.

I wish the devs put a little more effort into the game and its progress curve as after a couple of hours, it simply feels like you already saw everything and there is no point in keep playing the game.",1700940930,1700940930,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The things I like. I like the gameplay, what you can do for your little farm, and the various ways to get money and just have fun. You can raise livesstock, grow crops, chop trees, hunt wild animals, keeping bees, make animal-based products, even drilling for oil! This is definitely the number one reason to get this game, and I've noticed that it hasn't changed much for a year from earlier Steam guides. 
It all feels extremely chill, with lots of save points across the maps, and you can easily change the daylight cycle to make days longer or shorter. Some of the controls and ""feel"" might be off, but I was used to them after about 5 hours into the game. A lot more explanation to the players would be nice, especially the prices of produce and what to expect. Hemorrhaging money for lack of knowledge is not fun.

The things I don't like: plenty. The Unreal Engine the game relies on does three things, one is overheat my laptop extremely easily, and two is that it's very poorly optimized. I have a Geforce GTX 1650 Ti, and I have to turn it down to the lowest settings just to play the game. I know it's below the recommended specs, but not everybody has time and money for a high end graphics card, especially when my CPU and RAM goes above and beyond that.
The third is that the actual engine itself doesn't even run well, because I just spent about 10 minutes dealing with my buggy UTV that flies, glitches out, and does all sorts of things a motor engine should not do. Even the ""roll over"" feature just doesn't fix it. It's an example of just a lot of bugs with this game that can get really annoying at times, and I hope the devs fix them in time.

Yet, I recommend it because it's just fun. I sank 15 hours into the game, and want to play yet more. I can't wait to revisit my money-making bees and oil drills, because the core gameplay is that good! So, get this game if your hardware supports it, and I think it'll be fun with friends because that's what I nominated it for in the Steam Awards.",1700842680,1700842680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, thank you and congrats on the game, I love it!  

Great depth ranching life, lovely landscapes.

I would like to leave my feedback on some things that I think would make the game even greater if you are interested.  

Lovely in-game houses, but this game makes you want to build your own, that's why I've customised a whole house, but there is not enough furniture to make it feel like a home.  Could it be possible to add some more furniture, for example, kitchen, chairs, double bed and a bathroom?

Also, thinking about who plays solo, would it be possible to give us the option to hire employees or have children, to help with the work around the farm? There's just so much to do (not complaining).  

Another thing that playing for so many hours I noticed would increase the quality of the game play, an inventory, or be possible to carry anything inside the coolers lol. That would come so handy for building, carrying the planks, paint etc...  

One more suggestion. I miss physiological needs, such as hunger, thirst or dirtiness. 

Talking about dirt, would be lovely if where the pigs are there will be mud (or is it shit?!) :D Imagine.... <3

Another thing that would be so helpful, animal enclosure (fence) that is ready in square and round shape, that could be increased as we wish. That would save so much time, especially because I find it difficult to work with the fence we have right now. 

I have many more suggestions, like wardrobe change in-game. But I know it might be too much xD 

Anyways, finally, what about an auto save? 

I recommend this game, it's so good. Definitely has so much more potential.

1-FPS problem makes the game insufferable, especially when you build a large farm with a lot of animals.
2-They should add more npc for more different quests and interaction.
3-On the multiplayer side pings on the map should be seen by everyone to communicate easier.
4-After you reach some point you feel pointless and bored of the game, at least thats how i felt like. Maybe new quests, animals, crops can fix this issue. Also planting crops don't pay the effort you give they sell to market too cheap.
5-Trees needs to regrow after you chop them, or when you left the log at least.
6-The river at the map is unusable, you can't even get close to it. Maybe they can bring fishing system, boats and a fisherman as a new npc to sell the fishes. 
7-Map feels a bit small after a while maybe they can add another town. When you reach the end of the map a tunnel leads you to a new town with new farm, new npc and new biome. It can have different weather conditions, crops, animals also.
8-It definitely needs a better ui asap, this ui feels so primitive. For example to check your budget you need to go the escape menu. It should be seen on the main game screen. Also they should add health bar.
9-Guns' mechanic is horrific, They need a better ADS and hipfire system.
10-The game needs either autosave system or a save system when you buy/sell something. It feels too bad when you see all the things you made for hours didn't saved.

No : Controller support you have to map your controller to certain letters pain the @ss

Driving: Clunky, hard to stay on the road

Does not require food or water, only for the animals.

Graphics: Not great, Not TLD either.

Not much tutorial.
Not much info on anything.
Can not build any where but your designated ranch.

The awkward first person view that had some issues when picking up / placing items when carrying something has become a serious chore because the new pretty boxes make it harder to see around. Looking around is slow and clunky, and for some reason you can't aim down the sites of the rifle in first person, so you have to switch to third for an aim indicator. This was funny before, now it's just annoying.

Driving in 3rd person feels like you are not in control of the camera. When (when, not if) you flip your UTV, the camera goes into some weird direction. All the NCP cars look like they have hydraulics (bouncing up and down the roads), and your own car feels that way over just about any terrain.

The new town looks cool and has a lot of potential, but right now is empty. They also removed the ability to take multiple quests from one NPC, which is annoying.

I like the combinations and food crafting; it's easy to get into a nice daily rhythm (wake up, milk goats, milk cows, make cheese, etc.) with enough styles / ease of making money that you can probably find something you enjoy doing. I like the variety of vehicles; there is a surprising amount of non-farming vehicles for a farm / ranch game.

The music was pretty great, if strange. Of course, the update broke the radio, so there's that.

Hints for new players: Buy a lot of coolers (you can put almost anything in them) and several pans. Trailers are great for logging (if you put the tailgate down, the UTV works in the early game). Honey / bees are good for early game cash. Animals will try to escape pens and barns so you might want an ""airlock"" to keep them from getting out. Pigs multiply like rabbits. Go to the settings and change the day length to longer, otherwise you end up spending early game sleeping more than doing anything else.

It has become one of my go to games when I just want to chill out and I guess, enjoy the nature aspect of it. Although the weather isn't the best I've seen in a game, you kinda can just push that aside because it doesn't affect you in any real way of the game play, as well as some glitches here and there but that's early access for you, I haven't experienced anything game breaking and there are regular fixes/updates and the team keeps their gamer/followers up-to-date.

The tutorial. Yes, the tutorial. It takes 10 minutes to teach you basic controls and where to buy stuff, but it never teaches how to ranch, farm, hunt, or sell. You will learn nothing after completing the tutorial.

And now, the most important part: the farm and hunt system. No matter which weapon you use to hunt and which part of the body you shoot, you always get the same price when selling.

I kept waiting to see it evolve, but I never felt like it did.  The upgrade from UE4 to UE5 DID make it look prettier and run better (great decision). 

There's maybe 15-20 hours of content if you take your time. And that's playing it solo.  I actually expect you would spend much less time if you played with friends because it's honestly so limited in what you CAN do.  There are basically 2 types of farming: container and tractor.  Nothing in between. 

I spent most of my time raising pigs and goats.  Once I built the premium chicken coop the chickens were just... there.  Eggs and chicken sausage were a nice little supplement I checked every few days.  

I just described about 70% of the gameplay.  In two paragraphs.  You can hunt deer, bears, and wolves.  You can do a few quests for a handful of the folks around town.  MOST of your ""interactions"" with the world is through computer terminals with an NPC standing nearby staring past you. It ends up feeling pretty flat and dead as a world. 

And for me, the fact that single player doesn't allow me to pause... it grates on me because it's such a basic feature that is just ignored. When I went looking I found where it was said ""well, the game was meant as co-op and you can't pause in co-op.""  Like that is the only way people SHOULD play their game.  

I wanted to like this game so much.  But honestly, there is neither lore to keep me interested or enough variety in game play to keep me coming back.",1700574458,1700574458,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The prices of animals, crops, and items seem to be arbitrary and unrealistic. There is no clear logic behind these numbers, and they make the game feel unbalanced and unfair. It would be better if the game had a more realistic and dynamic economy system. 
  Another issue that I encountered is the vehicle handling. They feel too heavy and sluggish after mounting something in the front or back. 
  Also building system is not very user-friendly or intuitive. It is hard to build a more regular shape when building a fence, it would be much better to snap the fence posts to a grid or align them to a straight line. Manually adjust the angle and the position of each post, which is tedious and frustrating. I wish the game had a smarter and easier building system.
  Despite these flaws, this game still has a lot of potential and charm. However, it is important to recognize that the game is still in development and the features may change in the future. There may not be a lot of playable content at the moment, so it is best to wait for an update before getting into the game.

• Freedom of Play Style: You can be a profitable ranch regardless of the type of ranching you want to do (pigs, dairy, garden/crops), although time until profitability will differ between them.
• Freedom of Building: You can design your ranch however you see fit using prefabs and blueprints. Has a decent selection to choose from. 
• Interactions: The interactions between player/animal or player/environment like collecting your own eggs, capturing your own wild bees, and milking your own dairy animals are one of my favorite aspects in this game. 
• Scenery: While it doesn’t live up to the RDR2 vibe, the rural mountain landscape is beautiful in its own way. I miss the deciduous trees though from the original UE4 map. 

Cons:
• Limited Progression: Only 2 “tiers” of progression - beginner equipment vs updated equipment (no actual automation). While this will not really affect the imaginative builders, for those of us looking for a challenge or progression-led ranching game, this doesn’t quite scratch that itch at the moment. Hopefully future updates will remedy this. 
• No Server Hosting: Max of 4 players in co-op, no permanent server ids or server renting/hosting for additional players. 
• Wonky Animal Models: I was hoping they would be polished up before the actual release. Pretty sure they are free downloads. Chickens are decent though with the recent rework. 
• Too Easy: Easy money (pigs or oil), few challenges, and very few ways to spend and/or lose money. 
• Grind Heavy: Due to a lack of automation, most systems (even the updated ones) are very grind heavy, especially any meat or wood production.  
• Quick Gameplay: If you’re only looking to run a profitable ranch, it takes about 2-3 hours at most with minimal infrastructure and input. 
• Oil Rigs: The addition of oil drilling doesn’t make too much sense to me, as it is a cheaper and more efficient way to get money than anything else in game. No point in farming or raising animals if you go that route.

TLDR: Despite the con list, Ranch Simulator is worth it for those that enjoy interactive farming/ranching games. I wouldn’t say it’s worth $25 yet until there is more content, progression, and overall bug fixing BUT it’s definitely something I’d recommend trying if it goes on sale. :)",1700413064,1700413064,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- There is a radio in car but it dont play at all
-  Key binding is weird and when you remap it the on screen instructions still show hints of using old key
-  Building wood barriers in straight line is impossible due to buggy build system. It is driving me nuts when I want to build rectangle farm area.

Firstly, the game [u] still has some bugs [/u] that can be quite frustrating at times. These range from minor glitches like items disappearing, to major issues such as the game crashing unexpectedly. While the developers have been actively releasing updates to fix these bugs, it's still a point of concern for players.

Another problem is the presence of [u] flying vehicles [/u] , which can sometimes disrupt the immersion of the game. Seeing cars flying through the air certainly breaks the realism that the game aims to provide. It would be great if the developers could find a solution to this issue in future updates.

Lastly, there is the peculiar occurrence of [u] animals made of bricks [/u] . While it's unclear why this happens, it can be quite comical to see bears , wolfs or dears made entirely out of bricks roaming around the ranch. This might seem like a minor issue, but it does detract from the overall experience of the game.

Despite these problems, there are some positive aspects that make the game enjoyable. The potential for fun gameplay with friends is a major highlight. The game allows you to team up with your friends and work together to manage a ranch, which can lead to hilarious and memorable moments.

Additionally, the sales system in the game is well-implemented. You can raise animals, grow crops, and gather resources to sell and earn money. This adds a layer of strategy and economic management that keeps the gameplay engaging.

In conclusion, despite the bugs, flying vehicles, and animals made of bricks, Ranch Simulator is a game that is recommended to all lovers of this type of simulator. With its potential for fun multiplayer gameplay and a well-implemented sales system, it promises an enjoyable ranch management experience. [u] As the developers continue to update and improve the game, it has the potential to become an even better simulation game in the future.

If I was told I can only play one more game, and when I was done I would die, I would choose Ranch Simulator. It may have only been hours, but it felt like forever. 
I know everyone talks about the driving, and it DOES need a lot of work, but the building and demolition... That's where things fall apart. 
First, to finish the tutorial, you are instructed to tear down the old house. To do this, you have to begin on the roof, and remove every block before moving down.
Every. 
Single. 
Block. 
Windows have to be removed from their frames before the wall can be demoed. Doors too. The handrails have to be taken off the balcony separate from removing the floor.  Did you miss a piece of debris on the floor? Too bad, because you can't remove a block of floor until the entire floor is 100% empty.  
The building is almost as tedious, but at least it's broken up by long stretches of harvesting resources. You'll chop down trees for 3 logs, that you saw down to 2 boards a log. You'll need 6 boards per foundation. 
And remember, you have no inventory. You can carry a single item at a time. Need 3 logs? You're making 3 trips. Yes, you have an ATV, and there are trailers to buy that would make it take fewer trips... Honestly though, other reviewers have covered exactly how bad the driving is. It doesn't make it any easier, it just takes fewer trips.
Most of the 2.5 hours of time I've spent playing this game was in the tutorial, and I can't say I'm looking forward to spending any more time Simulating a Ranch. The game has potential, but the mechanics all seem to need work. 
There's also player hosted multiplayer, and much like everything else, it needs work.

There are issues. The biggest ones are polish of basic game mechanics. Driving is very poor. The physics do not make sense and it's almost as if the vehicles are driving on ice with no traction. The trailers swing in a fashion that's quite ridiculous. If you run into deer, they are stronger than the most expensive pickup trucks. If you hit a deer, your truck will come to an abrupt halt, and the deer will continue eating off the ground and go about their business. There are also odd clipping bugs in the game where your vehicle will inexplicably get stuck on an invisible object. You cannot turn venison into jerky or sausage. 

The relative cost of things is also a bit unusual which leads to an overall imbalanced game in terms of progression. 

When building things like fences and buildings, there is no easy way to align structures without having to place an object, tear down the mock-up, and start over. 

You cannot build sheds even though the game starts off with a shed. 

The hunting isn't actually hunting. A single handgun shot to a doe, two for a buck. 4 for a bear. There's no actual stalking or need to be quiet or approach animals slowly. They just run around in erratic circles. If they run away, they invariably turn around right back toward you.

I think there are a lot of small improvements with basic game functionality that would make this such a better experience overall. That said, as it stands now, it's worth purchasing. It is fun, just with many annoying quirks.

You play the tutorial, which is nice, but after you finish this you don't have a clue what to do next. Of course you can watch lots of videos, which give you an immense amount of tips and tricks, but to be honest: they scare the heck out of me. All those huge farms at a time where I am having problems coping with 2 chickens.

The other thing is that there is no way to pause the game. That means that if you encounter a problem or you just want read something to help building this ranch, you must end the game - otherwise the time runs on and on. This game is made for multiplayer, but since I am not schizophrenic (and I don't have friends, who play these kind of games) I just play alone, but then I must have a way to pause the game.

It was/is fairly simplistic. You can raise chickens, pigs, cows, and goats. You have to build pens and can build some structures but the offering is simplistic. They have fully furnished farmhouses you can ""build"" (which consists of delivering wood planks you can cut and other materials you have to buy). There's a small selection of cars of which most are not really worth grabbing with low, low prices (I'd love to buy a pick up for $2k).

As EA progressed, they added some interesting things (greenhouses and small crops) and basic farming (definitely will not compete against Farming Simulator). Then they decided they needed to upgrade the engine from UE4 to UE5. They told us it would take a lot of time but it would be worth it. They also threw in the idea of adding...oil wells you could make money off of?!

Six months or so later, they released that UE5 release into an unstable branch. Some visuals were updated but it still looked...average. But now, we had oil rigs to make passive income from!

Meanwhile, the upgrade to UE5 introduced a new physics engine and a bunch of weird issues (cars feel like they're running on ice, many things will go flying, cars can drive up trees). Everything else was the same (including bugs from the previous version like the fact that eggs laid by chickens that were fertile would ""forget"" they were fertile when you reloaded your game.

But the weirdest thing was that they announced they were going to exit EA and go gold...with bugs and all. They promised more updates but instead of fixing glaring issues which make the game LESS playable than it was under UE4, they want to give us pets.

This game really should be still in EA or treated like a beta game release. It's just not worth $25 in its current state. There's stuff to do but it's grindy and it's more because you just want to set up your ranch than it is about completing an objective. Instead of the above (odd) decisions with recent and future updates, they could do a quick bug pass to fix the outstanding issues and satisfy all of us who helped fund them through EA while ensuring new players won't have as weird an experience. Instead, they're trying to get pets to work in-game. 

I would steer clear until they sort out those issues or else catch game on sale for $10 or less.",1699700020,1699700020,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- This game is pretty good. I love the somewhat free form building. The environment really pulls you in. The ability to choose male or female, and the clothing they wear is pretty cool too.

- Some of the rough and bad. Controls are a real pain; especially driving. Its a nightmare actually. Animals that attack you free roam among the town.

I've had my eye on this game for some time and have managed to just miss the sale prices... until this week. After playing for a couple days I can see why there are such mixed reviews of this game. It has a truly casual feel but lacks a lot of refinement.

 PROS:
- Casual play style
- Diverse Livestock & Farming
- Building: preset structures or customize
- Learning curve isn't too steep

CONS:
- Vehicle physics is comical at best
- Market: prices aren't well thought out.
- Economy: prices are fixed and don't change
- Quests: there are some but barely a days play worth.

GAME NEEDS:
- Vehicle: Physics & Pricing reworked
- Objectives: Time based (daily, weekly, monthly...) orders to fill for rewards.
- Quality: poor to excellent crops & livestock with scaling values.
- Depth: There is nothing driving this game other than one's desire to play.
- Property: Defined lots & expansion options.
*I could go on and on with ideas on ways to make the game better but... in the end it's their vision.

I miss the days of a game being released to the public when it's finished and when Beta's were play tested for free. This game is clearly in beta and not worthy of retail sales. With that being said, I could justify maybe paying up to $5.00 (USD) or less. I can not recommend buying this beyond a cheap curiosity.

Here's a basic recipe for making salami at home. Keep in mind that the process involves fermentation, which requires strict adherence to food safety guidelines.

Ingredients:

4 pounds (1.8 kg) pork shoulder, coarsely ground
1 pound (0.45 kg) pork fat, coarsely ground
1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns, crushed
2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed
2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon curing salt #2 (sodium nitrite)
Natural hog casings
Instructions:

Begin by mixing the coarsely ground pork shoulder and pork fat in a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, combine the red wine, kosher salt, sugar, crushed black peppercorns, crushed fennel seeds, paprika, garlic powder, and curing salt #2. Mix these ingredients thoroughly to create a spice blend.
Pour the spice blend over the meat and fat mixture. Use your hands to mix everything together thoroughly. Make sure the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the meat.
Cover the bowl and let the mixture marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours to allow the flavors to meld.
After marinating, prepare the casings by rinsing them thoroughly under cold running water. Soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes to soften them.
Stuff the seasoned meat mixture into the casings, ensuring that there are no air pockets. Twist the sausages at regular intervals to form individual links.
Once the sausages are stuffed, tie off the ends with kitchen twine and prick any air bubbles with a sterilized needle.
Hang the sausages in a cool, dry place with good air circulation, ideally at around 55-60°F (13-16°C). Allow the sausages to ferment and dry for about 4-6 weeks, depending on the desired level of dryness.
Check the sausages periodically for any signs of spoilage, such as mold or off-putting odors. If you notice any signs of spoilage, discard the sausages immediately.
Once the sausages have reached the desired dryness, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to several months. Slice and enjoy!
Note: Maintaining proper sanitation and food safety practices throughout the entire process is essential to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. If you are unfamiliar with the fermentation and curing process, consider seeking guidance from an experienced butcher or charcuterie maker.",1637974485,1699518369,True,0,0,0.474751442670822144,0,True,False,True

The fun things about the game were the pretty smooth progression and expansion. But as you expand, the terrible optimization makes the game run ungodly poorly. When the game runs poorly, some items can't be interacted with, the car physics go absolutely crazy, and the driving isn't any good even with the game running smoothly.

Just disappointing, but if you go in with the 1h = 1€ idea, it is tolerable enough.

Edit: The audio design is also probably the worst I've heard in a long time, if not ever. There's absolutely no ambient sound.

would love it if if all animals didn't charge open doors instantly. I find the animals get jammed up so much running for the doors\gates its impossible to close the gate until they all escape, also a nightmare trying to gather them all.

The driving is like driving on ice with ice wheels without a steering wheel and thats not even talking about using a trailer. There has just been to many times the trailer send the car half way across the map.
The hunting is that bad it just shouldnt be in the game. you cant even aim down the sights like in the trailer. if it was a protection the where you had to protect your cattle it would be awesome but you just occasionally can come across a bear or i think its a wolf maybe coyote?? 
Its ok this game was in early access for nearly 3 years so am sure they will fix it straight away... not.
the 9 quests - yeah theres only 3 quest givers with 3 quests each and they are bugged so the thing you are looking for just wont appear if you have more than 1 quest added at a time
Theres no dedicated fullscreen so you cant get more than 30fps. The game always opens in a tiny screen and you have to change the settings before doing anything else

Swinging armchair on the porch !

Optional random events (wolf attacks that kills life stock), Natural disasters (storms)
Eletric power management 
Land management (Tax, purchase land, terraforming)

Needed Improvements: 
Progression tree / locking tech
Regrow / plan trees 
Driving 
Icrease field size (Field management)
Horse breeding (auctioning for sell)

Buildings:
1/2 Fence tile 
Equipment shelter barn (side half barn) - where we can hide harvester and other equipment from rain

There's almost no audio in the game which makes it feel hollow.

Driving is BEYOND horrible.

Getting Multiplayer to work was a nightmare (took the majority of my 'play time' to be able to connect to my wife's game) and the integration with steam is quite bad.

Chopping trees is dumb. You press E, the entire tree falls over, press E again and it instantly turns into perfect logs. Then you chop it into planks. Chopping a single log into 2 planks takes longer than felling the entire tree. This in particular was an extreme disappointment to me, as most similar games have far more in-depth logging/forestry options.

Building is extremely basic for a SIM game, it feels more like an arcadey survival game (Grounded, Valheim, Etc), but without the functioning systems that make those fun. In Ranch Simulator, it's slow, boring, clunky. --- I do want to acknowledge that the end result can look good though.

The movement animations are so bad. When you jump, you flail around weirdly and your legs kick straight back. It looks weird. 

Opening the build book with the flash light on is like getting flashbanged IRL.

FOV Scaling makes some stuff impossible to read.

Shop menu/navigation is terrible. Things that should be in certain categories are absent. I.E. buying the chicken egg basket - this is only visible under 'all', and is not considered a 'tool' or 'farming item'.

The font for quests/completing shopping purchases does not fit the game at all...

For a simulation game, the systems are barebones (and even that doesn't go far enough  to describe how empty everything feels IMO), not engaging, boring, and plain. There's a gross lack of actual simulation to begin with. Everything is just Press E Simulator. Also, it is the opposite of immersive, which is a problem for a sim.

***No horses.*** - EDIT - I am incorrect here as per developer response.

Gunplay is bad. Reloading is unresponsive. Wasn't really expecting something in-depth like theHunter, but I was expecting more.

Most of the stuff in this game is done better in the Farming Simulator series, theHunter, or other similar sims.

I could go on about I encountered in this game rubbed me the wrong way, but I think I've described enough.

Edits - Softened some of the harsher language that resulted from being extremely disappointed, and focused in on review points. I play several sims that do each element far better and was hoping for some sort of incorporation of them all with fun gameplay elements. I simply feel let down by nearly all of the mechanics in game. They exist, but they're not fulfilling (in my opinion).

I would have loved to get lost in the game, particularly since co-op exists and I love these style of games with my wife, but unfortunately this one (in its current state) is not for us.

Additionally, the game lacks quite a few major features that you would think would just be an easy add to the game. For example, you rely heavily on wood (obviously), yet it limits you to only be allowed to cut the trees down on your property. To make matters worse, trees can't be planted and they don't auto-regenerate. This means once you finish off the trees on your property, your only option is to pay a crazy rate to get lumber from the store.

Other key features that it's lacking- There's no way to see your property boundaries. It's all a guessing game. The best way I've found around this is just to see which trees you can cut down and which trees aren't allowed. There's also no way to expand your ranch, no new plots of land to purchase. I'm hopeful though that this is something that will be added in later releases.

Hunting options are limited. You have only 3 animals to hunt- Deer, Wolf, and Bear. For a part of the game they hugely advertise, it's crazy how lacking the experience feels. You also have only two options for weapons- a revolver and a rifle. There's no difference in ammunition types, no difference in types of weapons... Just a revolver and a rifle.

The building isn't terrible. The worst part is that you can't move or edit items once they've been placed, so if, for example, you build a trough in a place or position that you don't want or like, your only option is to destroy the trough, lose half of your materials that you put into it, and move rebuild it where you would like. For a game that feels limited already on the available materials, this is a huge issue. 

Honestly, I feel like the game is passable for the price and probably would be a recommended from me were it not for the crashing and lack of auto-save. At this point I've put in 20 hours total, but after the total amount of work I've lost, I'm probably more around the 12 hour mark, which is VERY frustrating.

- Lighting in this game makes no sense. A candle gives off light equivalent to super maxed out flood lights. 

- No clear indicators in the world of where your co-op people are without opening the map.

Gameplay gets stale quick. Combine that with all the bugs, I don't suggest this.

Update (as of Nov '23): Overall it looks better and plays smoother than it did, and I didn't get randomly teleported through the universe. That's great. The world is still essentially empty - there's the handful of store NPCs that are useless since everything's through the computer screen anyway, and that's it.

The world is devoided of life, and even the stores are empty like my brain.
Other than that, the game keeps crashing - I lost two new games in a row prior to writing this review.

The error is this:

So, maybe I'm ranting a bit, here.
But this game is no more in Early Access, so ofc I'll rant AND apply for a refund.
If this is the quality being considered acceptable for the [unreliable] product that has received the GO light, I can only wonder how many mid things could have been awaiting for us diving further in the game.

For sure, I'm not wanting to discover them, wasting ~13€ in thin smoke.

One can argue that 13€ is very cheap, and it really is, so I should keep this product rather than return it.
13€ is very cheap, yes.
Sum it up with the monthly 11€ of Spotify. the 30€ of Netflix, the 60€ for my ADSL line, the house bills, the fuel + maintenance of the car needed to bring me to work, the average cost of the life in this fifth world country where I live in, and so on, and you'll likely see that even a 13€ expense in the household balance isn't SO cheap, after all.

Apart from the price tag, in my forcibly limited playtime I've encountered some inconsistencies:
[list]
[*] you can ram wildlife fauna with your golf cart or whatever it is, with NO effects at all;
[*] you can ram trees, RVs, rocks, cars and other physical obstacles with your vehicle without any damage;
[*] you must shoot twice a single deer with your revolver, even with an headshot, to kill it;
[*] when you managed to kill a wild animal, say the aforementioned deer, you can skin on site [*] you'll get some meat pieces, that you have to pick up and handle one by one placing it somewhere, but NO skin nor extra raw materials at all;
[*] sometimes the said animals will flee directly in your direction - yass! come here, right to your daddy, cutie!
[*] if you buy something from a store, like two 5kg concrete bags from Hardware Store, the items you just bought are placed ab mentula canis in an outside area of the said store, and neither piled up;
[*] and can we talk about the complete emptiness of said stores? Apart from the color machine, the HW store is a bunch of random (but on topic, tho) assets aligned on the perimeter of the room; you can peek inside shops, thanks to the windows, only to see how much the interiors are devoided of anything (like with the fuel station) apart some other random and very sparse assets;
[*] if you buy a chicken or a rooster, you have to place it on your vehicle flatbed, without a chicken cage nor any little decoration that would have enriched the overall experience, instead of having to treat animals just like they are inert flour sacks;
[*] not only you can't till small patches of soil with an hoe, having to resort to greenhouse planters instead, but the fields you can plow with machinery are pre-made rectangular shaped area - more hand-holding that this, you can maybe found only railroad tracks, I guess;
[*] don't make me criticize the chaotic driving mechanics & overall feelings that arise from that. Really, don't;
[*] and I hope that forestry would be implemented, at some time, at least to give your axe some usefulness after you have cut down all of the trees that were available for you;
[*] tree cutting animation: a single axe swing, and that's all. Tree trunk cleaning & parting animation: nothing, just press and hold E. Stump removal animation: again, hold E whilst you dream about an actual animation that could have been there. Also, removing stumps is pretty useless, apart from cleansing the land to build on it, because trees can't regrow and the stump won't give you any scraps or sorta either;
[*] overall, the demolition of junks and things with your crowbar won't give you any scrap/material back;
[*] oil rigs. I mean, are we building a ranch above the Gobi desert? I know that you need fuel even to run your table saw, because manual handsaws are something that had probably existed only in 3rd century B.C. in rural Turkistan, but having to drill for oil by sentiment, in a Montana-like landscape, seems a little too sci-fi for my tastes;
[*] you have a nice ruined windmill in your ranch. Why renewable sources of power & fuel are so hard to accept, my dear muricans cowgirls and cowboys of the XXI century? Burning oil for everything doesn't seems very pretty, even if I can imagine that living without a 864982498 HP jeep or an energivore humvee isn't very enticing;
[*] having Unreal Engine 5 makes us yell ""YAAAAY! IT'S BLEEDING EDGE! TOP NOTCH TECH!"" in ecstasy and with starry eyes. UE5 gives striking lightning storms, yes, I get it. And some other pretty special effects too, of course. But pairing those with the 2015-era overall quality (my blonde character seems a poor old white-haired grandpa!) seems to me that it is like having a Chevrolet Camaro but driving it like a Fiat Duna. Honestly, IMHO it is just some easy marketing effort for the gluttonous kiddos and tech-above-all enthusiast out there;
[*] why the fans of my rig seems like C-130 propellers when I play this game? Even that unoptimized mess of Starfield (nor Farmer's Life, just sayin') didn't manage to make my PC ready for takeoff from the desk.

The following are some of my observations & problems with the game:

- The town, buildings etc DO NOT have any lighting at all. When it's dark out, everywhere is completely dark. No street lights, no interior lights. The workers and townfolk are all sitting in complete darkness...

-Driving is horrible, it is no different than driving on legitimate ice all around. The NPC cars are super weird as well, as they will spawn nearby and jump on the road, drive very slowly.

-Character animations are incredibly bad and robotic. Your movements are stiff, the animations are janky. There is no fall damage and horrible physics. Cars don't get damaged or give damage when you hit something.

-Furnitures in built homes don't work or don't work as they should. The double bed doesn't allow another player to sleep together with you. You can't break these furnitures as well as it will also destroy the house...

-The map and town feel desolate. There is no thought given to their design and purpose, everything is just made with premade assets and slapped together. UI is horrible and far too simple, most often also broken.

-Worst of all, it doesn't let you play without making or linking Epic account.

Game is alright enough to play despite these flaws but they severely drop the enjoyment you could get.

DO NOT BUY... Why because it says ""1.01 Release"" on their promotion and all but when you enter the game you release the game didn't take down the ""Early Access: 1.01"" in the top left corner of the screen. Mind you this might change with a patch but that's the LEAST of the issues.


DETAILED:
To explain why I say do not buy in detail, literally from simple systems like quest fulfilment, clipping, and goofy inconsistencies with mechanics. When you finish the tutorial you can see NPC with two quests, first one giving him 8 meat and the second one giving him a rabbit. The issue is that you can't drop off any meat until you talk to him about the second quest. 

Clipping in the context of cars, where you and other objects are fine but when you flip your car because the first one you get from the story/tutorial is horribly unstable for driving straight. Thus leading the car to be upside-down which you get out and hold 'r' to flip the car but if you are too close to a tree, the car climbs the tree by clipping its body/frame through it. This just shows they haven't tested ANY of this. Plus at this point there isn't a way to get the car back. No parking space or going to the car shop to recall the car from what I understand, maybe there is but there is a guide inside of the game warning you when your car gets flipped upside-down but nothing on recalling/respawning the car.

Even with in the tutorial, you need to break down the old house and for some odd reason they made the breaking down animation play with maybe half of the building. Why this is annoying is you go from literally running through and left clicking things to break them down but then you get stuck in animation for the same object/part of the house you just broke down...

Overall, I ask was any of this game tested? Its systems are terrible since they feel in Alpha stage, and I truly hope this game grows since its ideas are interesting. At this point though, I'd suggest anyone looking at this game to just play other games that scratch the itches from other games.",1699086305,1699086305,False,6,0,0.492212057113647461,0,True,False,False

Alot of improvements came with the upgrade and Unstable Branch, has a much smoother feel overall. I will list the positives and negatives and my personal thoughts. 

*** POSITIVES ***
1. Very Relaxing and chill game.
2. The animals are thought out well, you actually have to care for them in order for them to become healthy.
3. Alot of fun and different ways to make money. 
4. Graphics with the Unreal 5 update are awesome. 
5. Crops are very thought out as well, takes time, and care to get the best healthy yield. 
6. Very stressfree, no hard or painful puzzles or quests. 
7. Allows you to actually run your own Ranch and interact on a personal level with the animals and land. 
8. Much better and more personal than farming simulator in my opinion.
9. Different Stores and Sell Points depending on the items you want or the items you are trying to sell. 


*** NEGATIVES ***
1. Vehicle Handling is absolutely horrible, every vehicle almost feels it is on ice skates. 
2. Small Trailer slides from side to side like its literally on ice and that causes you to loose control and wreck sometimes. 
3. All trailers have similar issues. 
4. Wild Animals act as though they have severe ADHD. Very predictable and spawn in generally the same areas. 
5. Map is very small
6. Tree cutting animations are very simplistic. 
7. Economy is mildly broken and fixed.
8. Limited amount of Vehicles and Trailers. 
9. Hunting Rifle which I assume since it shares the same Caliber as the Revolver is a Henry 357 Lever Action has a very weird First Person animation.
10. Some of the movement seems buggy at times. For example when you are trying to pick up eggs or clean up chicken poo your character sometimes does a shuffle dance when your trying to focus in on the object. 


*** MY SUGGESTIONS ***

1. Re-work Vehicle handling metas
2. Re-work Trailer handling metas
3. Add additional Vehicles/ Trailers 
4. Smooth out Player Movements
5. Fix the very dark lighting inside some of the stores
6. Total Overhaul and re-work of economy. Prices should fluctuate off of simulated supply and demand.  For example gas prices should fluctuate and in turn the price for oil will adjust accordingly. 
7. Shotgun should be added
8. Fishing would be really neat if thought out and done correctly 
9. Increase map size by 2 or 3 times its current size. With that add additional properties or buisnesses you could purchase such as a restaurant, butcher, garden center, ect. 
10. Add more AI owned businesses and AI people. 
11. Add Vehicle Damage. I feel some people drive around recklessly because there is no consequence for doing so. 
12. Increase Vehicle Prices. 
13. Add a Employee Management System that allows you to hire and manage Employees. (PLEASE dont make it like the travesty another Farm type game did) 
14. Improve tree cutting animations 
15. Increase Wild Life Amount thay spawn and have them spawn randomly around the map so it can not be telegraphed. 
16. Animals should die if hit by a vehicle.... currently you just bounce off them. 
17. Add ability to make Wine, Bourbon, Vodka, Moonshine.  Would be really cool since we already have grapes in there. 



Overall this a great game, I know it is in the early stages still but it already has come a very long way from its start. It is relaxing, fun, and gives you a sense of pride when you reach a certain point. I highly recommend extended the day and night time to the highest it will go, because you hit a certain point that there frankly is not enough time in the day to tend to all the animals and your ranch. That is why having a functional Employee Management system would help those of us that Ranch Solo...... 

Be well my friends and Ranch On!!!!!!!

I have about 45 hours into this game. I bought it during early access.  This game has a lot of potential but after playing the new beta for an hour or I am disappointed with their decision to leave early access.  This is not a refined game but a very complete demo showing some great ideas and showing what ""can"" be done and a vision for a good game.

I assume that by leaving early access the developers have decided to release this version and move on.  Regardless of what the developer might say about their intentions I have witnessed too many times game that leave early access and are abandoned shortly thereafter.

This is why I can't recommend it at this time.
1. The vehicles and driving mechanics are quite unstable.  
When the game first came out the developer added a ""flip"" option in case your vehicle turned over.  I assumed this would be a temporary fix until something more permanent was developed.  With the beta the vehicles are even more unstable than they were before the beta.  In fact the ATV is constantly flipping and is very difficult to control.  In the previous version the ATV would not flip unless you did something stupid.  Now it flips all the time.
2. The map you see in the beta and will see in the full release has been improved to give the appearance of a town.  It adds some character but this seems like a ""lipstick on a pig"" effort to make the game appear like it has more content or ""world"" than it really does.  Certainly without this, the game is a very good demo in my harsh opinion. 
3. Lack of ""things to do"".  There are some production chains that seem quite well thought out like cheese production or sausages.  But there are no production chains for the immense farming and gardening.
4. Lack of quests.  there are only half a dozen quests to do. There is no variation.  There is no purpose to create a complex production chain for the purpose of fulfilling quests.  The basics are there but there is simply no ""Content"".  For example a good quest is granny likes bacon and eggs in the morning.  great. But the restaurant has no quests?  How about something like deliver 1000 sausages.  Give me a REASON to keep playing.
5. Oil wells? What random thing does an oil pump have to do with ranching?  This was a random and incomplete addition to the game.  I feel like there could have been something you could do with the oil like maybe an interactive POI that lets you refine the oil or something.  Again doesn't really fit with the theme of the game but at least make it more than just a money making feature.
6. MOTION SICKNESS.  If you suffer from motion sickness avoid this game.  There is no way to turn off head bobbing.  I would call this ""drunken rancher simulator"" even though there is no alcohol involved.  The camera dips left and right.  Don't drive vehicles in first person or you will have a headache even without motion sickness.  I have been drunk and this is the best drunk simulator there is.  This is my beef with all gaming developers.  They try to make things feel natural but real life is not a gopro attached to your head.  in real life our brains smooth things out.  I have driven ATVs in very rough situations and never does my vision flop around like it does in this game.

Summary

Is the game fun?  Yes it is a very fun ""EARLY ACCESS"" game but it is not ready to leave early access and NO I don't recommend it. (I would recommend it if it stays in early access).  If the game continues to get updates and new content after a year I may change my recommendation.

For now my biggest pain the the lack of any ambient sound, its like total silence. You are in a forest, game desperately need some background noise like birds or crickets, something. That would be a huge addition.

Update - It has been months and still not a single bird sound or wind. Nothing really so i change my vote to downvote.
In a relaxing game like this ambient sound should be one of the priority yet you get a completely silent game, sometimes not even the interactions like opening a door makes sound.

Once they add some ambient noise and sound I will reconsider changing my vote back to positive until then i won't even bother playing it.",1674067471,1697836312,False,0,0,0.65584266185760498,0,True,False,True

I have tried and tried to give this game the benefit of the doubt and tried to be understanding given that the development team is small. However, the core systems of the game are just as broken today, roughly two weeks away from FULL RELEASE, as they were when I first got the game. The vehicle system still feels like you are skating around on skis, even though they have ""improved"" it multiple times. The physics engine is absolutely atrocious along with most hitbox locations. When you look around in first person view it still feels like you are drunk, the camera whips back and forth just like the vehicles do. The farming system isn't even working as of the last time I checked and the gardening is pointless. All you can do is sell your produce for a small profit. The animal husbandry is bare bones at best with very little to do with the ""products"" you gain from the animals. You can make beef or pork meat products and cheese. The goat meat is still not able to be used and the wild meat from deer is just sold as is. Why not have summer sausage? I have enjoyed playing this game with my wife in co-op for many hours, but the idea that the developers are going to release a game that is so still early in it's development cycle is absurd. They just switched to UE5, that engine alone has many of the systems they want to use built into in when you use it. If it took them a year to switch over to UE5, why not use the tools the engine gives you to help improve your game so that you can make good on your promises. Now, I am an indie developer myself, and I know how hard it is to make a good cohesive game so I feel for the developers. However, leaving early access is just irresponsible when you don't have the basics down let alone a cohesive experience.

The guide can be a little simple and some players get confused how to make items with the milk/meat - I recommend checking a guide for help.

Dont do what I did when I first played and cut down the entire forest basically to make money. Theres plenty of good ways to get started - either by chickens, piggies (I prefer), or fruits... def dont need to cut down trees for lumber to sell for crap.

My only CONs with release of unstable...
- They limited the amount of trees you can cut down, you cant go anywhere to cut down trees. Its now only around the farm which I think is dumb. I dont want to buy lumber later in the game to expand my... ""Processing"" ... plant. 
- Rain/storm water does not water plants when exposed to the outdoors. Falling rain should water the plants.

Alright devs, I hope you read this because I came into this blind and I want to give you my first impressions.  This game definitely gives me the hands-on farming experience I was looking for, hatching my first chick felt like a genuine achievement, and tearing down all the old buildings to build my own was fun and rewarding.  You've also been doing regular content updates and fixes, which is great.  Overall, I would recommend this game to people....HOWEVER

First thing I noticed (and something that I haven't seen mentioned on other steam reviews strangely enough) is the lack of sound in a lot of areas, or just bad sound design in general.  It just sounds far too quiet, there's no ambience, if you walk five feet from the sawing table it goes dead silent, and the sound of your own car is just a constant flat droning noise.

The general handling of small objects can be a little painful at times, especially eggs, making it so your selection 'snaps' a little would help, but there's also the problem of the camera swaying sometimes when you turn (which makes sense realistically but my god is it annoying).  On a side note, LET ME TURN OFF WHATEVER MOUSE ACCELERATION AND SMOOTHING YOU'VE LOCKED ON PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

Fence building is just a bit shit, there's no auto size-adjusting final piece to complete a paddock, so you just have to kind of...get them as close as you can, which is irritating.

Driving...I don't think I need to explain myself on that one.

Accessibility - as someone who is visually impaired, there are some things in this game that need serious improvement.  Like finding BEES dear god its impossible.  And the one time I did find one I got immediately mauled by a bear.

There's also a ton of quality of life improvements that could be made to the game in general, and yes that's how early access is, but I've seen a lot of early access games 'release' into '1.0' and they're still just as janky as they were when they started.  Please don't let this be one of those games.

So yeah, I'd say a solid 6.5/10 at the moment,  I look forward to see what you add and improve next!",1672509869,1697539005,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,4,True,False,True

It's like some executive who never plays video games heard that Stardew Valley was a hit but that it was in low-tech pixel graphics and hired some programmers with the directive to make Stardew Valley, but 3D and realistic.  They even directly ripped off the basic premise of Stardew, with you inheriting your grandfather's old, rundown ranch because you decided to get away from the grind.  But they never bothered to check what it was that actually made Stardew Valley endearing, and just decided to nix any story or NPCs.  The only people you run into are lifeless mannequins who all work at places like the real estate office or the store, and have names like Real Estate Agent or Store Employee.  No dialog options, no story.  You guys all your merchandise from a computer terminal.  The streets of town are devoid of life except for dreary cars that drive slowly down the road with darkened windows, presumably to hide the frozen zombies inside.  Honestly, driving through town feels like the setting for a horror movie.  I've rarely felt more lonely.

Soulless lack of story/setting aside, the game mechanics are rather clunky.  You're stuck in 3rd person view, running is kinda drifty and awkward, for some reason I carry my chickens by the throat like a demented 4 year old, the hunting is nothing more than point and click, the animal animations are...well, let's just say the animals in the old claymation Rudolf the Rednose Raindeer move more realistically.  Oh, and the driving is so floaty and drifty that you might well be on the moon.  Just moving around and doing stuff is a chore, even when you're not actually doing chores.  And there's no real progression to the gear or technology, just a price tag, so as long as you're willing to grind you can get anything you want.  That can be nice, I suppose, but it removes any incentive to progress or feeling of accomplishment. 

I dunno; it's a pretty game, but everything just feels so sterile and soulless.  I like the premise, and I have played all sorts of games in this genre, so it isn't like this just isn't my kind of game.  Maybe if they update it enough to make the controls feel good and bring in some characters with backstories we can get to know or something I'll give it another go, but as of right now it just feels like lifeless and clunky.",1697505955,1697505955,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Love the concept of the game, needs to improve in the following

Beef stock - Need to be able to be customized.
Need to be allowed to make a field anywhere on your property.
Fences need a better way to lay them out and place them. 
PAINT! being able to paint would be a great idea
Back to fences on my propert alone I  have wooden fencing, metal fencing, barb wire, and electric fencing just some ideas.
PLOW!?!?!?!?!? you can get everything but a plow...... strange. 
This game could also use a box leveler even if you can't flatten the hill maybe just some of the bumps for  smoother drive.
We can buy concrete but can't place it for a stone wall? or even make a straight path way?

As mentioned this game has good framework just needs to have more added to it to be great.

I found out my cattle die due to rendering, They had food and water but if I go to the other side of my property or build on the other side my cattle, or all animals will die from starving or thirst. Some one had mentioned on you-tube that its like owning farm animals your check on them a lot. As someone who does own a ranch I check my animals at least twice a day and not every 5 minutes to ensure they eat and drink. I also would like to see some more added features in the future as mentioned this game to  me was a 50/50.  Still worth a shot if it gets updated.

To chop trees or process wood. Feed the animals.

It takes a little time to build up, which isn't a bad thing with the early stages of development in the game. The town is pretty sparse and empty. The driving takes a bit to get used to, and as a farm girl there are some things lacking in the current state such as proper names for animals, and waking up at 8am to start the day, I wish! Don't buy this if you're wanting a more developed game. There simply is not a lot to do yet aside from butchering animals and making meats and cheeses etc, but if you're the type that enjoys farming materials, the game is a fun play through in it's current state. Excited to see where this one goes and I've been tagging along for each update for several months now. 

Things I'd like to see: 
Difference in animal breeds - One breed for meat production, one for milk production or egg production, etc. to make it more realistic. Like, you'd rather have a holstein for milk production than a hereford.  **Has been added
The ability to castrate your male animals for a fee, or have a veterinarian office
Breeding Cattle **Has been added 
Breeding Horses
Proper animal Names - piglet, boar, sow, (and when it gets there cow, bull, gelding, stallion, mare, filly, colt)
Traffic *has been added & roaming NPCs (*Quest NPCs were added)
Rodeo and/or Racing
Some sort of small plot farming, so you can grow veggies and add them to your recipes when you're cooking *has been added 
**UPDATED REVIEW** With the new UE5 Update, things are coming along so well for this game. Things have been added which do make it more realistic. There are still some odds and ends to be addressed with vehicles.",1630876557,1696182357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For a game that is in early access, I am impressed and I can't wait to see what more comes to the game.",1695783554,1695783554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Specs are more than capable, to say the least.  The game does not completely lock up, nor does it crash in the conventional sense.  The game is still ""active/alive"", but no inputs do anything of any kind.  Whatever the character was doing at the moment it occurs, will continue, endlessly.  Walking somewhere?  You'll just keep walking until you hit something (or it hits you), as an example.  

Seems that more work is/was needed on this, to say the least.

Assembly line style tasks, wearing a bikini, shooting bears, naming animals after your middle school bully knowing full well that animal is going to be slaughtered in a few days. THAT'S RIGHT MELANIE, TRY TO TAKE MY MARKERS NOW THAT YOU'RE SALAMI! - anyways!! It's fun, it's fun alone and it's fun with friends. You literally take care of animals, make sausage, cheese, curd, meatballs, sell eggs, veggies, animal products. You get to customize on your land any type of building you want to do! You can build a house for yourself or move an air mattress into a barn and sleep with the cows!  

Have you ever died from a hen attacking you because you touched her fertilized egg?  You can in Ranch Sim!!!  You can also kill your friends!! [b] In the game! [/b] 

Also if you don't want to rush, you really don't have to. There are no bill collectors except for the food and water for the animals, and gasoline. If you want to just go hunting for a few days and stockpile wild animal meat outside of the hamburger shop in order to sell for a higher price, no one is going to tell you that you have to play the game a different way.  You really can build how you like, you can build the premade barns, houses, chicken coups or you can design something that is easy for you to manage and you can even paint it!
It really feels like a sandbox sometimes and you have so much you can do at all hours of the day, that you really don't have to change up the game times in order to have things to do!  

My only downsides are I wish you could skip the tutorial sometimes.  After playing for almost 900 hours, I understand how buy a chicken and put the car together. I'd really like to skip that part.  (although I have created a bunch of saves just after finishing the tutorial for this, i wish you could just do it in game.)  

These next ones are just ideas and not necessarily cons to the game as is. 
Being able to lift and move tables/beds/etc after you place them down as they're smaller objects, instead of having to tear them down.  

An easier way to kill chickens. 

I'd love to have the wolves/coyotes? try to get to your animals if you don't have them properly behind sturdy fencing.  

It could be cool to grow herbs and add vegetables and seasonings to meats and cheeses.

I really do love this game. I'll soon be chopping down every single tree in game to see what happens!

at 38 hours I've built a massive farm, using all three crop fields, have all the vehicles and horses. have animal paddocks and animals. its now just repetitive chores day after day, feed the animals, collect the milk/eggs, process the meat, into sausages, sell the dried stuff, harvest the crops, sell, although after I have got all this there is nothing else to do, no other goals, or missions. it is a good game, could use maybe a market /economy feature and larger map/more area/ shops/ items. 
the only bad bit is the fertiliser, makes no difference and is expensive/difficult to gather.

-the running simulation is awful
-i watered my plants in the morning, two hours later a heavy rain started and humidity of the plants lowered to %66. so not even a single raindrop didnt fall beneath my plants and they were outside!!
-there were a lot of food for chicken, in pen, outside of the pen, in the food box. and two of my chickens died because of hunder. without even a single egg..
-i can carry eight of planks at a time but i cant carry tomatoes. i should carry tomatoes and logs one by one. so i can understand it for a log but what about tomatoes? 
-destruction mode is awful, i can deconstruct everything in the house if i stand middle of the home. it doesnt make me feel like im breaking something. it was just like putting a pin on a board.
-i think the most realistic thing in the game is preparing planks. you put the log to the saw and it takes 10 seconds to make it a plank and of course you dont spend this 10 seconds waiting there; you can run to the forest to bring another log. 
-the car, actualy utv was so annoying at the beggining but when i lowered it's voice it was so beautiful to drive in a forest and majestic landscape.

well right now i wouldnt play this game since there are much more succesfull similar survival games. i hope it will be developed nicely and we will brew our bears in a few years. good luck fellas!",1693942258,1693942258,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Me and my buddy spend HOURS on Ranch Sim doing lots of different stuff. It can get a little repetitive sometimes tho. Things we would like to see changed/ added (I am just going to list as many things as we, my buddy and I, can think of in case the devs see this haha): 

- The ability to move and or destroy the tent
- A better system for placing items down so that items can align better (if you have OCD or just like things aligned and straight... be prepared to spend hours on placing objects down) 
- A count for the materials we need- for example if we place foundation for a fence it would be cool if we could see what we need and how many of that item in the top corner or something
- A system that allows us to connect the lights so we can turn lights on all at once or in groups
- A little description when buying things that says what the item can be used for 
- The ability to pet the animals lol 
- The ability to lead multiple animals at a time 
- The ability to carry more than one log at a time 
- Recipe book of some kind 
- Increase in speed of harvester 
- The ability to move objects once placed 
- The ability to move outline of object once placed 
- A option to ""quick place"" logs and planks when loading them in vehicle 
- More people for multi player 

It may seem like a lot but the reality is the game is already great. Its not like the game is unplayable- these are just things we feel would enhance the game quality! We cant wait to see what else is added!!

EDIT: As of 8/29/2023, I have to change this review and not recommend it. The game has become so buggy it's practically unplayable. I haven't been able to get it past the start screen without it freezing my entire computer, often forcing a restart, and my computer handles much more graphically intensive games quite easily. This game has become a train wreck. 

Vehicles sometimes get stuck on fences and such, and if they do flipping them often won't free them so they're stuck forever unless you go back and reload the game. This can also happen to trailers. 

The day/night cycles are WAY too short. The day isn't nearly long enough and the nights last too long and are too dark, the days should be longer and nights shorter. In the weather vein, I've had a thunderstorm and fog every single day cycle, which is just too much. Those need to be spaced out a LOT more, maybe a thunderstorm once every seven day cycle or so. 

Two planks per log is too few, I think five per log would be a decent number. You have to completely deforest the entire ranch to build much of anything. 

Metal and concrete are too expensive for the small amounts you get and how much you need for basically everything, especially when you're starting out and money is hard and takes a very long time to earn. Maybe make it easier to earn money doing odd jobs or requests for people in town or at other ranches? The ability to auction off some of your livestock maybe?

I would like the ability to unsaddle my horse and let them roam around without a saddle on in their corral. A saddle stand/wall mounted saddle tree would be a neat building project to add to the game for their barn. Horse breeding for better stats would be neat too, especially if you could auction off the horses you bred. Different horse breeds would be nice, especially if you could add donkeys/mules to the game. 

Ability to paint the barn/buildings - as much as I do like the weathered barn look, it doesn't make sense for something just built and some of us would like to spruce it up. Also the ability to put down flooring for the barns would be nice, or add wood shavings or something as bedding in the stalls. 

The car controls are wonky. As. Heck. 

Slightly more fun stuff: I would like to see sheep and goats in the game, especially the ability to shear the sheep for wool and either sell the raw wool or refine it into wool cloth to sell or craft various things out of, such as making your own bedding/unique clothes, perhaps with dyes bought at the general store. 

The ability to raise and train calves as working oxen would be awesome, especially if you had carts you could attach them to so they could help you haul lumber and such around the ranch. Draft horse breeds, mules and donkeys could also fit into this category or simply be variations of it. 

Smokers to create smoked sausages/jerky would be nice! I love me some good jerky. 

Cats would be nice to have, especially if you could occasionally find a stray cat in town to adopt and bring to the ranch, and of course things for the cat that you could add to your ranch/house, such as cat trees you could build and beds, feeding dishes and such. Especially if they implemented a mechanic where rodents could get into your granaries or other areas, having cats around to keep them away would be handy!

In a similar vein, dogs! Different breeds of dogs for the ranch to perform various tasks, like warning you of approaching predators by barking, helping herd other animals and just to be a companion by your side, and of course the ability to build doghouses, beds, bowls and other things for the dog, maybe even handcrafting leather collars out of hides from your slaughtered livestock? The leather from the hides could also be used to craft things like custom saddles, harnesses for working animals and such! 

I know the entire crop system hasn't been implemented yet so I don't have much to say on that front until I see some of what they have planned. 

A way to level the ground for better building/planting would be nice, I don't like having weird gaps under part of my barn wall because of the hill. 

Ducks/geese would be a fun addition, and the ability to build a pond for them. Maybe raising meat rabbits too? 

There's lighting issues and other fixes that need refinement but I think those will come with time.",1646329423,1693370134,False,0,0,0.73063737154006958,0,True,False,True

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Ranch Simulator - Build, Farm, Hunt is a game developed by Toxic Dog and published by Excalibur Games

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Ranch Simulator - Build, Farm, Hunt overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good open world simulation game and to play in short bursts

SULY SULY! Hi im Rems and this is my opinion on this game. 
Super fun, grindy, and a relaxing game. If you don't like grinding for money, building, farming, and gardening then this game is not for you. If you do then you are in luck. This game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL and pray that it continues to be updated as i genuinely enjoy playing it on my downtime. I would also like to recommend some things to add to this game or be updated in the future which would be.....
-stats for hunger, sleep, bladder, and maybe stamina
-more decor items for the homes and/or outside items
-the mechanics of animals body's walking as well as wild life. 
-being able to place the middle part of the barn without back or front (so I can park my tractors and trailers under them.) 
-Horse training jobs
-types of breeds of horses
-maybe even catch and tame wild horses? 
-swimming as of right now you fall through the water and can drive through it. 
-make roads and pathways
-passive ways for income 
-option to plow anywhere on the map to farm
So for now this is where I am at with this game I may edit this later after this update coming in September to review the changes as well. I do wanna say that some people do and don't like the fall damage and no damage to cars, trailers, trucks, ect... but for me i don't really care, but for the ones that do maybe a option to turn this on or off kinda thing? either or I totally recommend this game to ANYONE. SHOOT if you get it lmk, I could definitely use friends to help with my farm and theirs. I hope this helps with your decision!
HAVE SUPER FANTASTIC DAY/NIGHT!

It is a good game. It is also an addicting one. Waking up every day to tend your fields and livestock has a good ""wholesome"" feel to it. I know. I put air quotes because...sarcasm. You absolutely slaughter animals in this game. You have to, because they will die otherwise. I suppose you could play this without delving into animal husbandry but you'd be cutting yourself short. It's more than half of the entire concept of farming.

Now to the things I dislike/need to change/be added: (<---I would gladly pay for these things)

- Fencing. Oh my gawd. FIX. IT. Getting stuck inside, on top of and a few feet from fences is gut wrenching when you haven't saved since you last slept. The work around is to save frequently. That's...just not good enough guys. Fix it. Also...the placing of fences should work like...how places walls/fencing work in games like The Sims 4. Simplified toggles, drags and clicks.

-Destroying things. There should be a prompt: Are you sure you want to destroy this? This would work better if you could click and drag to select multiple objects, because that would be intentional but when it comes to switching tools and accidentally deleting a whole building...man. Or a more simplified idea: have the option to redo/backspace/undo your last action when building.

-Pigs....should not ever be able to climb on things like they can in this game. How in the world would a 650lb swine be able to walk up the side of a table and then over a fence? They wouldn't.

-Castration should be an option: because pigs. I'd pay for this service in the general store or even the tools to do it myself. Only drawback? It's not reversible.

-Horses should be able to breed and they need their own buildings. The barn is suitable sure, but we need one or two building options specifically for them. If you choose to forgo a horse barn, you could build a horse shed in the pasture for them. Would be nice to have tack options to buy, even premade designs. Then just a little page for selecting your available tack in their profile page. Or having an object tied to your horses that names them and tacks them up all in one go.

-Chickens: The mechanics of chickens needs a revamp. They are able to sometimes walk through walls. Which, is not good man, not good. The egg basket should have the option to deposit the eggs into the ovoscope to fill slots and then to deposit them all back into the basket with a button/command. Remove their ability to stand on top of the chicken feeder. They poop in one spot and you have to physically move each of them out of the way to get to the poo. There should be more breeds/colors. We get three options. I know the work around is to place the feeders outside of the fence/area but how realistic is that?

-Poop: There's a lot of sh** in this game. A service that would clean this up would be easy but awesome to have. Or, the composter should work like the silo/windmill and auto suck up the poop in a certain area, which you could toggle on just like the silos/windwill. Then pick it up and rotate it around your animals or...put on in each area. Boom.

-Driving mechanics. This is wonky. Ya'll know it. Work on that.

-Weapons. We don't have enough options.
-Quests: We don't have enough quests.
-Maps. This map is okay. But having two more options from the start would be fantastic.

-Lumber - The option to sell logs like planks at a discounted rate. Obviously unprocessed lumber would be worth less. The wood cutters need something to auto feed them, either another buyable option or a setting on the more expensive one. Also, automatically shutting off after a few moments when not loaded would be nice. I know that last one might be asking a little much but...I'd like that a lot.

-Build/Map/Terrain: We don't have the able to change the terrain on our property. Again, like in the Sims 4 you could add the option to paint the terrain, even with just three or four options: gravel, grass, dirt, concrete. Having pathways around your property would be super amazing. Grass should not be able to grow through concrete/gravel/dirt options. 

-Buyable Objects: There aren't enough decorative options, nor are there enough shelving, meat drying options, etc. I would like to be able to purchase a home furnished or unfurnished with the option to buy and place things in the rooms. Big ask, but seriously. Would be AMAZING.

I would pay for any or all of things in a purchasable DLC as I know several of my friends and family would as well. Heck, I'd gift it to some of them myself. This game has a ton of potential just laying there waiting for the devs to make bank off of.

Thank you for your time.

Second, it's pretty dry and empty BUT I get it's Early Access and things are still being worked on.

So, to the Devs:
- Night time is SUPER DARK.
- Lights (car lights and player's headlamp) SUPER BRIGHT.
- BluePrint Book - text is super small. Impossible to read at night with lights.
- Not enough wildlife to hunt. Economy needs a buff because I need to sell things but that requires to have things to sell. 
- LOVE the physics and the fact there is NO FALL DAMAGE! Leave that alone as well as vehicle takes no damage! That's ok! Being able to drive off the highest mountain and take no damage is fun.
- ADD AN INVENTORY PLEASE!
- Have a ""bulk-apply"" when building. Having to individually select items for building is annoying af.

That's it for now. Will be doing a stream and recording season with some friends this week for the MP aspect.

After the massive cost of all the equipment ( around 6k ) and growing the wheat and then harvesting it with a lot of clunkyness ( harvester getting stuck and tractor reverses at 0,01mph with the gran trailer attached), and the finally getting my full trailer  to the granary which awaited to be filled, i couldn't find a away of unloading my trailer and then noticed on the granary i could fill it with a cost of only $200.

To add insult to injury after i returned with the wheat that i could not unload ( but i could sell at the shop ) i found all my animals bar 1 cow dead , all starved to death even though they had full water and full troughs before i set off to collect my harvest.

The game could be a lot more fun if it wasn't so clunky, I already mention about the harvesting and harvester getting stuck on the smallest bump but the driving aspect is a lot to be desired too. 
Reversing of trailers is a nightmare as they soon jack knife without giving you time to recover, The steering is way too sensitive and you can soon find yourself on your side or doing a full 360 with all the bumps in the road.

I know i have only payed for 40 hours but that 40 hours was enough for me to quit the game and wait again for more updates with the hop a lot of the clunkiness is taken away, I play mostly Farming Sim and wanted a break from it which is why i got this game but as it stands at the moment finding another game  is my only option.

I do hope that the devs do take on board the players concerns and fixes them because this game could be a ton of fun to play without the clunkiness.",1690805062,1690805062,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When we play these types of games, our play styles are very different. I like the building aspect of it, while he likes dealing with the animals (hunting, etc). Because of this, when I play alone, I tend to use a ""creative"" mode. That mode doesn't exist in this game. It's a simulator only. The animals are always on. There is no peaceful mode. Most survival games with animals, or mobs include one, these days. It just extends the audience for the builder types. If you like a 'peaceful' mode, don't buy this game. It's not there. If that's not your style. I would say, definitely buy this game, but not at $25.  I grew up on a farm. Animals could be a problem. But there were never bears at the hardware store. I also like games where modders can be active. These days the modders add all the things, we wished the original developers would have included. That also doesn't seem to exist for this game.

I think this is a very ""closed"" game. Niche ONLY. The developers had an idea of how game play would proceed, all other ideas, dead in the water. So, no modding community. No peaceful mods. No settings to tweak. So, what do you get? You get a game without a hot bar. So, when the bear comes to kill you at the hardware store you have to hit the tab key and find a weapon on a wheel.

I wanted to spend a decent amount of time playing this game before posting my review. 

I was looking for a game where I could cut down trees, hunt, build and farm. No people to kill or zombies (just dangerous animals)...there is shooting.....driving cars.....Jump Button...No fall damage...No eating....No Drinking....No harm from elements...

From the looks of it, that was this game, and why I decided to purchase it and give it a try. I only read a few comments before purchasing, and I do not regret spending the money on this game by any means. 

In the beginning, it definitely does start out slow, so just go in with that mindset and expect to GRIND. It took me a little bit to figure out what I could sell at the stores, and where to put my goods when I want to sell them. Part of that was just because I was rushing and not really looking around. If you need any assistance with selling items or item prices - you can find info on trusty old Google. Also, I thought it was horrible at the beginning because I didn't realize there was a flashlight ( press 'L') :D Nights were horrible once it was pitch black for a little bit...but the sun does always rise :)

BUILDING/CRAFTING ::
The building system is pretty easy to get the hang of. I like that you can setup the blueprint first and then build using the wood. This way you can see the idea before wasting the time and using wood. When removing, you only remove the blueprint then. Comes in handy when you have to cut and then use the wood saw, over and over and over and over and over again. 

Items usually snap (somewhat) and then you can rotate them.....I will agree with the post I read....it is extremely annoying that I cannot make perfect square fences, so I decided to go for rounded fences....so far it's doing all right :) 

Besides not fully snapping, there could be more items to craft...


HUNTING ::
Hunting is pretty easy and bullets are low enough cost to be able to purchase quickly in the beginning. Selling meat is one of the quicker ways to make money. 

My biggest issue is that I can't find predators easily....are they hiding from me!?!? lol

It sucks when you get killed by a predator and haven't saved recently..... HINT:: buy a camping blow up bed from the hardware store and keep it in your car so you can save frequently without having to go back to the ranch. 


I think they should add fishing ;)

FARMING::  -- haven't gotten to that yet. will update in the future


DRIVING::

Driving is tough to get the hang of...but it is nice that you can flip the car whenever and wherever.
Maybe I just suck at driving? haha

More options for upgrades would be nice.....but its not the focus of the game so I get it....I don't have enough money to spend to be able to buy more cars or upgrades yet anyways...LOL

Also regarding the cars...... don't make the same mistake I did and sell the car your g-pa gave to you....you will get it for 1/2 what they sell it for....



OVERALL::

This game so far has everything that I was expecting. Definitely blew my expectations. SUPER excited for the updates coming.... THERE WILL BE PETS!!!


If you get this game, don't expect to quickly get through building homes, barns, coops, etc.... focus on buying bullets and selling meat. Go to the hunter and get the hunting rifle. Also, if you take out a loan to buy animals, make sure you have a barn or coop ready to go for them...otherwise they will die outside. 


But seriously, get this game....it's worth the money and time :)

-----------------------------------
I understand it's early access, but it's a chore to play. 
The main reason being you don't get any materials back for demolishing objects. That means you can't build for fun. Everything has to be planned and prepared exactly, otherwise if you want to change something, or the last section of fence doesn't fit or you want to move or even rotate a chicken coop you need to start over from nothing, and it's TEDIOUS. I spent way too long planning and preparing to build a fence than I did making it, and that shouldn't happen <b>especially</b> in an early access where your (i would hope) wanting to get people interested in the actual gameplay aspects. 
Making construction so punishing if you make a mistake just put me off building. And if I'm not building how much of the game am I missing out on? 50, 60, 70%?

The animations need a lot of work, but generally everything else looks good. Hit a deer with my car and it T-posed 10 feet in the air and just dropped back down. 
VERY micromangement heavy. You have to cut trees, chop them to logs carry each individual log to the workbench to turn it into only 2 planks, then manually carry the planks to your building. So tedious.
Tutorial is confusingly short. Repair your car, visit the shops, buy chickens, demolish your grandfathers house, tutorial over GLHF. Like I don't want hand holding for the entire game, but what now? 
No survival stats so sleep, food water for your character doesn't exist but does seem to for the animals - never explained. Other animals?, hunting?, farming? no explanation. 
Can't recommend it at this time, but hopefully it will get some QoL improvements and be ok.",1649620686,1689514698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really love this game and wish I didn't have to go to work or sleep so I could just keep playing.  For actual game-play, it is fun and enjoyable. Chopping down a tree (which there is a lot of) is not annoying, because it only takes 1 swing to chop it down, and another to make logs.  This makes a tedious task less repetitive like what other games have done.  Again, although I have played for over 20 hours at this point, I only have chickens and honey production and I just get excited knowing there is so much more to expand on!
All that being said, it is pretty clear it is still in early access, but I am so happy I saw the details for the upcoming update they are planning on to enhance and add even more content! If the developers are reading this, I would like to say my 2 biggest updates ideas are 1: The lighting at night.  It is PITCH BLACK without your head lamp on.  Maybe have the other cars have headlights/brake lights? But again, an update will be dropping within a month or two, so maybe this has already been addressed. And 2: more options for building our own freestyle buildings. I LOVE the barn and how there is the front, end, and you can pick how long you want it by adding middle parts.  I Am trying to build a large garage that I can park all my vehicles and trailers in, but I cannot make something where the door is wide enough for the trailers to fit!  More options and variety would be amazing.  (P.S. I also really like the greenhouse parts... nice open windows to let in natural light!)",1689112290,1689112290,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

The auction system is a bit funky in that horses always get bid up by the NPCs to be overpriced. By the time it takes to fully train the horses, you will still sell them for either a loss, or maybe a max profit of $200.

Eventuell die Kapazität unendlich machen beziehungsweise es so machen das am Tag Geld abgebucht wird und das Silo sich automatisch wieder befüllt . Was mich sehr stört sind die lichter die man alle einzeln anschalten und wieder ausschalten muss . Wenn es da die Möglichkeit gäbe  das die Lampen ab einer bestimmten Uhrzeit angehen und morgens um 8 wieder aus wäre das viel angenehmer . Was mich ebenfalls ein wenig stört ist der Stall . Man kann ihn unendlich lang aber nicht in die Breite bauen . Mir persönlich fehlt es das man ihn auch in die Breite erweitern kann . Alles in einen ist es ein mega Spiel mit sehr viel Potenzial spiele es auch sehr gern aber halt im Single Player . Wäre schön wenn ihr das ein wenig leichter gestalten würdet für User die gern im Single Player unterwegs sind.  Achso eine Hoftankstelle wäre auch was schönes Bauen ->Tanken->bezahlen.  Hoffe das das spiel weiter entwickelt wird , denn es hat wirklich sehr großes Potenzial und in meinen Augen macht das Spiel auch sehr großen Spaß.",1686247244,1686247244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The ranch is beautiful, I am sad that your ill health took you before I could learn what the heck i am doing.
But I have been here 30 days and just finished building my house, got two goats, 10 soon to be 20 chickens, and darn good with that riffle.   I am finally making a small profit  without having to clear land for  the old farmer man just to make ends meet. I tell ya sir, he is one grumpy guy, won't talk to you till the job is done, ain't got no time for small talk I recon. And he Damn sure isn't getting no place on building that barn of his.

It’s exactly the sort of game I enjoy, I’ve inherited a farm from a deceased family member and have to build from almost nothing to get it running strong. The graphics of this are fantastic and a lot of the mechanics feel very true-to-real-life. Like how costly it is to raise animals vs the return on investment you get. And ESPECIALLY the cost of farming holy cow. It’s one steep bill to get all the equipment needed to get going. 

A few things I feel can be improved on is the controls. Right now it’s pretty darn impossible to drive around with a controller joystick, which is what the official steam deck layout has you use. It’s just telling the game you’re using wasd and it makes turning and such an all or nothing endeavor. The game needs native controller support IMO 

It also needs a PAUSE BUTTON. What if the baby starts crying? Can’t just ignore the baby, that’s frowned upon by the government. (And ya know bad for the baby) but if you don’t go back to your tent to save and then exit the game (which can take like 5 minutes depending on where you are), time will March forward and oooooh boy if you need to pause in the middle of hunting have fun being murdered by a bear and losing the entire days progress anyway.

For building I wish you could make your own crop plots(crops that need the tractors), but we only have the 3 spots built for us in the far back of the ranch. Being able to pick our own spot would be nice AND having a grid option to help people build their buildings straight would be lovely. I know some may not care about it, but for those that do having the option to turn a grid on would be wonderful.
2nd hopefully we get more build-able options, for me I would like it if they had greenhouses already build for us like they do with the houses, but we have the option to free build as well. Also would love some arches for the beginning of the driveway(as if you were leaving the ranch) so I could connect it to my fence to make it look nice.

Does it make fun? If you like grinding or get the multi player to run propperly.

It's pretty much a mess. 
Not fully a thumbs down because it still kinda makes fun but i don't want this to get a thumbs up neither.

As long as you play alone it's quite fun for a few hours as long as you don't plan to explore the map.
Many people experience their livestock getting stuck and starve in front of the filled trough and you don't want to be too far away when this happens.

In multiplayer you need to pay extra attention because every player besides the host might fall through the map or be launched into the sky making you lose your expensive car. 
Tractor indincluding machines fell through the ground? It's gone! 
You accidentally drove into an invisible alpha wall and the car - loaded with thousand of dollars of equipment - glitched through? Well... that belongs to the void now.
Someone wants to remove some placed deco stuff inside one of the house presets? Better hope the game stays in sync or thousands of dollars material and everything inside just vanish. 
Some objects just disappear others spawn out of sight after paying a shit load of money for it.

BTW don't think there's actually a guarantee to get support when reporting bugs.
Multiplayer bugs are always blamed on the player's internet connection (eventho no other game has this problems), if you get help it's mostly just an annoyed mod posting the same pre-made bot command over and over no matter if it actually fits the problem or not and if you don't know english you better screw yourself or you'll get banned for not using english.

If you're really really lucky you get yorself to talk to the publisher's staff or the one mod that actually does more than posting commands or delete random posts for no reason.

Maybe the port to UE5 will help at least with the bugs.",1685094562,1685094562,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

Perfectly scratches that farming/ranching itch that we havent been able to get from other like games. The act of raising cows and goats has been the best for me. 

Milking actually takes effort, its not just click and done.
Making cheeses and meat products equally takes effort (and for some ALOT)
Animals gradually grow, they dont just hop from baby to adult. I love this so much as i love watching my livestock grow up.
Has a few bugs with desync in multiplayer but thus far it has all been hilarious, and thus far only occurs when someone who isnt the host drives into the ranch with a car (and even then its not all the time, but having trailers hitched to vehicles makes it much more frequent, so un-hitch trailers that arent in use!)

A few things i would love to see in the furture is the ability to breed and raise your own horses, play with a genetics system to breed the best. You can buy horses and train them as it is right now, but ive found more often than not you actually lose profit when training them up to full and selling them. So having the ability to breed our own horses would be so much more rewarding and worth the effort that goes into training.

Another smaller thing, the ability to make butter. I think playing with a mechanic to churn butter could be fun, at least until working up to something more automatic once you tire of it.

For right now, expect to grind out limited resources for a very low profit margin. Keeping livestock, which is the point of the game, is cumbersome and expensive with high loss due to death and again, very low profit margins.

That being said.. The well is absolutely dreadful to use. its the worst feature in the entire game. You have to move your mouse in circles to move the bucket up and down? thats really, really stupid. can't you just maker a fkn button for ""up and down""? too damn simple right?

one of the most profitable ways to make money is boiling, especially early game. but it takes more time trying to fill a god damn bucket of water than it does to actually make sausages and boil them. this stupid ass well and the way it works is the biggest turn off in the game. come on devs, do you even test the freaking game? do you want to sit there for hours doing circles with your mouse? i dont fkn think so. if you are testing, i have to ask. do you hate the people playing your game? are you trying to turn us away from your game? the well is a retarded mechanic. go test it out, try to ""grind"" using this dumbass building. ""oh i have to do circles with my mouse for 15 seconds just to get a god damn bucket of water"" your funny. thats hilarious thinking that was a good idea. fuck me sideways

I absolutely love this game. True open world, a bit of a grind, but relaxing and the graphics are gorgeous!
I have played about 6 hours so far, and have been progressing along slowly, but mostly due to playing solo. I have since invited a friend to play (I bought them a copy of the game) and it's a lot more fun playing with a friend.

Things I enjoy: 

-The building system. It's actually fun to bring wood to different places to actually build the structure, and see it go up.
-UTV. The all terrain vehicle you get when you start is SUPER handy! It's actually decent on fuel as well and can carry quite a bit of cargo
-Music. The music is very nice. I don't mind it at all!
-Overall gameplay. Honestly I like everything about the game, my only complaints are just small things to make the game a bit more polished
-Growing system is pretty simple to understand

Things I would love to see improved upon:

-At night when you go to town, the other cars have no head or tail lights. I would love to see this added to the NPC vehicles so it's easier to see them and not crash head on at night
-PC vehicle lights. I find the light are VERY bright on the PC vehicles, which can also be an issue. I'd love to see the intensity of the lights turned down a bit to chill on how bright it makes things.

This game is still in early access and needs a lot of work but seeing progress so far since I bought it we are getting there. Expect desync, stupid bugs, gone items flying into space. It's still better state of bugs than farming sim which has a lot of DLCs xD.

I can't wait for next update when they will move it to UE5. Graphics are not worst, not the best. They started from total poopoo-ready-assets and now it's much better. There is a lot of grind when working on animals, loading or unloading your goods.

Graphics are great in some places, bad in others.

Not sure I'd recommend it in its current state, but I think it's got a lot of room to grow as long as the devs aren't cashing out on the current version and fleeing. If you're willing to let the game grow, then get it on sale.

For devs:
*The game world doesn't feel 'lived in'. Stores are very weird feeling and bare. Store ""owners"" sit behind the desk in the middle of the night when the store is closed...
*Player animations are just...odd. Staring at my player it's like a caveman lumbering around. People don't move the way the player does.

Honestly it doesn't feel like they've put effort into it. Probably another forever early access that will be abandoned in few years.

Pros:
Fun to mess around
Cool bullet physics, they sometimes bounce off which is something I truly love no matter how unrealistic it is time to time.
Worth the 1.25 USD I've spent on it thanks to being a Turkish citizen. They've also increased the game 2.5x in my region for some reason.

Cons:
Absolutely zero QoL in every aspect.
Everything is bound to E key so... bad.
If you accidentally try to demolish something, no way to cancel.
Bad gun mechanics in every way. Can skip reload by changing weapons.
Somewhat bad animations
Awful purchase UI but compared to other games with similar layout, not too much different (House Flipper is a bit better in comparison)
Empty world with empty houses, like there's no furniture in it.
Game loop is literally; gain money, buy things that make money, sell the product and buy again.
I remember playing this game when it first released back in 2021 and I can certainly say that nothing feels like changed. I bet someone with adequate skill can do everything they've done in 2 years in just a week.

Lots of features have been added over the years since original release which is great. It's a sandbox type of game so you can really do whatever you want. Hunting is a fun thing to do on the side of farming. Car physics are comical but sometimes leads to unfortunate bugs of vehicles getting stuck in the air (and never coming down). Quests from NPCs offer helpful monetary starts at the beginning of the game when you're clawing for a dollar. 

However, as a crazy horse girl, I was hoping the horses system would be a bit better. There's no breeding and the horse is constantly trying to run away. The auction system is a bit funky in that horses always get bid up by the NPCs to be overpriced. By the time it takes to fully train the horses, you will still sell them for either a loss, or maybe a max profit of $200.

I Love the way this game is going and how the mechanics to start working and figure out. 

Fence sizes would nice to complete a padlock, some more options for house building plans (also furniture if building on your own) as well as maybe premade Animal padlocks plans to build also. Terra-forming the land options? Could add in breeding options of animals to throw off different colors....I think I'm getting way ahead of myself, but I listen to what others look for and communicate what we would enjoy better in the gameplay. 

The Burger joint has maybe little more you can do, specially if any meters are added to keep yourself alive is in the future. Options to build in town with other town buildings, or plots that one of your friends can buy and build their own farm that can add in or out of game to connect with possibly to help or hang out while online. 

***With that said should have options for anyone playing the game to save and also enter with a server that the other player doesn't have to be online to continue building, feeding, etc with password to get in as I was always getting kicked out and everything I did was gone that I worked on several times which became frustrating.***

Adding more towns to visit maybe different themed areas to venture to as doing the same quests over and over gets repetitive. (More expansions to do this) More recipes for cooking. Could also maybe add in mining caves to mine to build? Butcher shop? Craftsmen shop to build things like buildings, furniture, etc. More equipment choices. Options with planting that give you a feeling of achievement to what your working on, maybe level your planting up with doing this. 

I play with a farm on something called a G&S system on another game that I love that is like this in a way, as other try to create more that is like it but this old way of working your way up gives you more pride in what you do.

 I see great potential for this game to expand and build out into something amazing. 

Fishing with leveling would be great to be added into the game with a fishing boat and recipes to cook it. Give little more options to character clothes or options to make them in game, sheep for wool, spinning equipment to make yarn and dyes. 

People love to connect together and build, play, farm together and its hard to find good co-op games to enjoy along with the realistic feel of a game to decompose, or strive to work together to build a great place.

All in all I would pay a subscription to this game if a lot of these added features would be added in to create more content for others to enjoy as well and bring in endless options.",1679542954,1679542954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The in-game help menus are very thin (how to...)*.
Your player gets stuck a lot (usually on top off something), and unlike other games there doesn't seem to be an ""unstuck"" option, which means if you are stuck on a fence, or a cow...you cannot save the last day's activities, which is very irritating. Similarly, buying multiple vehicles/equipment often and rather stupidly places them on top of each other at the shop area goods bay, and it can take a while to drag things apart from each other. Very clunky.....not good.
 *e.g. planting crops in fields, making cheese

Also, building fences seems very complicated to get the ends to match up.
Mysterious chicken deaths....not sure why as they seem well fed and watered 

The biggest 3 problems (for me) are the player getting stuck on top of things, lack of quests/side quests and lack of farmhands...it should be possible to hire a fruit picker etc/....it's a very lonely game with no humans to interact with.",1679355320,1679355320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Time just fly's by while your cutting down trees, building animal pens and house, out hunting or catching rabbits smoking bees from hives or at the auction buying horses. 
A few things I would really like to see would be more Furniture to making a custom house, flowers  for the garden beds and garden fencing, food you can actually eat. Kinda feels weird having to feed my animals but not myself. Possibly fishing in the lake???? Being able to paint the garage (if you keep it) and the well. More crops to grow, and cooking recipe's to use them in so instead of planting and harvesting lets say tomatoes you can now make sauce and use your wheat to make spaghetti or pizza. Also allow the pig meat to be made into small sausages or pepperoni that would be cool ahhahahahah. 

One big issue I have been finding while playing multiplayer is sometimes when i go to get out of my truck i will get superman'ed across the map and end up on the edge while the truck is where i flew from and have to run all the way back to it, As well as the truck slightly moving on it's own making it hard to put things in, and if you leave the trailer attached I hear them banging together and sometimes see it.
 
All in all, This is an amazing homestead game for anyone looking for a getaway to your own ranch. I would highly recommend this game to everyone, and look forward to seeing where this game goes. Hopefully with some of my suggestions.",1679306502,1679306502,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Vehicles in this game take a good bit of effort to unlock and are absolutely essential to the progression and navigation of the game as a whole. This has been an issue for over a year and many (even temporary) solutions by the community have been suggested (such as a simple vehicle reset with prerequisites to avoid exploits). 

The developers have been responsive about awareness of the issue, with in depth methodology about their testing, but the lack of any attempt to implement a way to actually play the video game has yet to happen. They're working on an engine update (from Unreal 4 to 5) and some mechanic rewrites to fix it, but until it's fixed I can't recommend an effectively unplayable game.

Some things I would suggest:
-fruit trees and maybe flowers
-more wildlife and biome diversity to create a more immersive ranching experience.
-a town: right now the area is spread out with very little interaction with any NPCs outside of just shopping which is done on ATM style machines. 
-ability for dogs and or cats on your farm. 
-making the UTV less reactive and touchy when going over hills so you don’t fly all over 
-ability to pet your animals or interact with them more then just milking and watching them get pregnant. 
-more decorations for your home to make it more customizable instead of cookie cutter repetition. 
-NPC traveling and maybe visiting your ranch with some conversation dialogue

I appreciate the game and have a lot of fun as is but would definitely love to see some more features in game to make the experience more immersive and encapturing. Keep up the great work!",1678099674,1678099674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, this is probably the glitchiest game I have ever played in my life. And I don't mean just annoying glitches, I mean glitches that make the game unplayable. 

For example, while trying to seed a farm plot, my tractor and seeder freaked out and started flailing and crashing into things and nothing I did would fix it. 

Additionally, I've purchased items like the water tank that just decided to stop working. I try to connect a bucket to it, and it just won't fill up. Other water tank worked fine, but the second one just stopped.

Chickens die left and right with no rhyme or reason to it even when they are in the coop, food and water troughs are full, and I regularly clean up behind them. 

Really hoping this game is fixed and improved soon.

Now, let me tell ya, this game is the real deal. It's got all the trappings of a true-to-life western ranch, from corralling cattle to chopping down trees and building fences. The game puts you in the boots of a rancher trying to make it in the rough and tumble world of the Wild West, and let me tell ya, it's no walk in the park.

The graphics are mighty fine, with gorgeous vistas and realistic-looking animals that'll make you feel like you're out there on the range. But it's the gameplay that really shines. There's a real sense of satisfaction to be had from growing your ranch, from buying new equipment to taming wild horses and breaking them in for riding.

But don't let that fool ya, partner. Ranch Simulator is a tough game, and it'll take all your grit and determination to make it to the top. You'll need to manage your resources carefully, plan out your days, and stay on top of your chores if you want to keep your ranch running and make a name for yourself in the frontier.

All in all, Ranch Simulator is a rootin'-tootin' good time that's perfect for anyone who loves the Wild West and wants to experience life on the range for themselves. So saddle up, grab your hat, and get ready for a wild ride, partner!",1676434355,1676434355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like how different and simple this game is. You can basically play it like YOU want. Nobody tells you what to do. 
You have to remember this game in still unfinished so bugs and some minor cons are here and there. But for like 15 euros what I paid I feel I got enough. I wait next big updates with smile.
I like the map too. It is simple and good size. 
Game is most fun with someone to play with. I play with my gf for example. 


-First thing might be to add respawn button(last place you slept maybe) because you get stuck a lot when milking and controlling animals.
-Second thing that would be nice is ""push animals"" mechanic because sometimes they are in front of door or something and they don't move.
-Would be nice to have cats and dogs in the game to get more living environment to your ranch. Like you could own 2 cats and 2 dogs max. 
-Sheep would be cool animal to have in the game. 
- Chainsaw would be nice to have. Maybe it would cut tree and make logs with one action only.

These two are little bit away from ranching BUT I think they are in some way cool ideas.
-Maybe some forest business would be nice. You plant forest for some small area and then it grows few days and you cut it and sell it. 
-It would be cool to be able to buy some minor business. Like the gas station for example. Maybe you can buy it with 5000$ and then everyday it costs 25$/day to maintain. Every week you could get like 525$/week back. 
.Fishing would be nice too. Maybe even have a boat to fish with

There are aspects of the game that remind me of Garry's mod how you freeze things in place the people who made this game have put a lot of time and effort into everything you see in game and you can see that, its polished and pleasant to play runs smooth and has a vast amount of things to build / sell / buy 

i would like to see a few things going forward personally but if not still would play the game. 

1.
If you take a sleeping bag to the selling point ( burger shop) you can save and then just keep loading and get a different x0.0 on the menu so you can cheat the system with a simple reload - this would be better if it worked off the game time and not just reset. 

2. 
I would love something to spawn when you make a huge purchase with all your stuff in like a crate, as when you buy 30 sprinklers and things. It takes a long time collecting them all and placing them in your truck or trailer. 

3. 
Animals walk slower than your character speed them up so when pulling on the rope you don't have to keep stopping for them to catch up 

4.
Be able to move or remove the tent on the ranch - or move it to the outskirt of the ranch as its in a spot where the space could be used better 

5. 
have bigger containers the cool boxes are good but maybe make a end game container that holds a ton of things as 12 items isnt the best, would even be nice for storage units that could be built to put eg. white / blue mold pack in them next to your cheese stations. 

6. 
Be able to re stack metal - and or make a way we can store materials in a material storage unit like the log unit but for the other things metal - cement - planks 

--------------

Now looking at this list don't think the game is bad the game is amazing, just would make quality of life better and a little less grindy, i love to grind but its a thing that is apart of this game fully and needs a little later game easing with some new toys to help you a little. 

if your on the fence like i was about this game don't be grab it its good and well worth the money they are asking, really is a good game to chill on and you will find yourself playing for hours.

From an overview the game is decent from taking care of live stock to hunting and of course building your ranch. As with all games there are a few bugs and the development team does update an fix some every so often which is a plus. This game also supports controllers (Xbox - PC types) although since the normal buttons can not be changed adding the controller can add aggravation because of the overlapping of buttons. (as a side note if you do use a controller you have to assign each button since its not auto assigned with a template in game) I don't know if a wheel works or not might be something to try to make the driving a bit easier. 

I like the building aspect of the game from logging to building. The hunting aspect needs a little work and a good hunting rifle would help a great deal and adding of an icon ""scope"" at the end of the mouse point to see what you are aiming at would be helpful as well. a down side to hunting wolves and bears is that you can be mauled and killed if you shoot an miss... Then the game says ""you've died"" reminds me of the 1980's games ""Game Over"" lol. Then you have to exit the game and reload it because at the time of this review the ""go to main menu"" button doesn't work. Taking care of animals is a bit of work since the food an upkeep goes fast the more animals you have. The animals can die if you don't keep up with them and if they do die you can then process them for meats an cook with other foods grown in your greenhouse or gardens to increase or decrease the value of profit when you go to sale the final product.

I assume I’m in the minority, but one of the major criticisms I’ve had personally with Stardew Valley and other similar games is that in addition to farming, it expects a bunch of other unrelated tasks and interacting with NPCs ad nauseum, and god forbid locking progress and features behind these tasks. Those games are still good and have their purpose! But I have been searching long and hard for my “weird little freak hermit that occasionally descends from their mountain hideaway with a chest freezer full of sausages to pawn before scuttling back into solitude and nobody questions this serial killer behavior” simulator, and I’ve finally found that.

That being said, I fully support the devs in whatever vision and ambition they have for their game, even if it includes quests and NPCs, but I would be extremely charmed if they kept it possible or at least left in a mode to simply free-farm as the game is basically presented now.

The game is not without its flaws, the driving in particular being the most egregious. Inputs are delayed and the vehicles are incredibly floaty at any sort of reasonable speed, but this is somewhat reasonably compensated for with a quick way to unstick yourself from a predicament as well as having no damage system to the vehicles. Still, in a game where there is a lot of space to roam around and a lot of stuff to haul, it sticks out.

My other gripe is that opening gates is like opening the Walmart doors on Black Friday. It seems like every animal in a ten mile radius makes a beeline to go through it, blocking you and whatever it is you might be trying to move through it and escape. I’ve had to basically fashion airlocks for my larger pens and it kind of breaks up some things I’d like to build and operate.

But with a grain of salt, it's early access, and overall I love the game so far. I look forward to seeing more potential crops, animals, and products! I have only played solo as of now, but I can only see the experience being enriched by like-minded friends and there’s plenty of space to spread out. I’m reviewing this as someone who was looking desperately for a no-frills farming game, so if you’re looking for a story or grand experience or lots of world interaction, this is probably not the game for you (yet!!). But if you just want to shut your brain off and hit the ground running (or more likely, hit a bump, backflip, and slide 200 feet on your front bumper before smashing directly into a deer), then I can definitely recommend it.",1675120465,1675120465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However when your animals wont even stay in the pens, they climb, glitch and pigs literally fly over the fences...  it is no fun to spend your whole game time chasing after animals that are bugged out the whole time.  The vehicles are fun if not a little psychotic in handling.  Farming could be improved significantly than just having 3 allocated spots to farm.

The trailers bug out the game. I have had them stuck on random roofs and throw our vehicles and players across the map.
I would really love more customization and furniture options for the Ranch things like Barns and the House! 
I would also like to see improvement in the descriptions of things. There's not much of a manual for anything in the game, its just constant guessing and hoping. 
Fishing would be super cool!
It'd be super nice to be able to hold more than one thing in my hand. It's so time consuming picking up every egg one at a time and having to put them on the thingy one at a time to find out which ones are fertilized or not.
I would so gratefully appreciate a mini-map.
Possibly a ping system, to be able to see other people's pings.

that's all for now <3

.
10 hr update!
I love this game, I play with my bf and our friends and we are addicted.
We have 3 vehicles and are constantly cutting down trees for fencing.
Suggestions:
1. Id like to have more people be able to join my session. 4 is just not enough :(
2. Possibly a cook book or a way to give instructions on how to use what machine on which food? I had chicken and was able to put it in the meat grinder but wasn't sure where to go from there so we just sole the grinded chicken.
3. Pathways and Lamp Posts. Id love to make some cute pathways and lamp posts to light up certain areas without I don't have walls in.
4. String lights would be super cute
5. I would like to use flowers to decorate as well.
6. Ranch Pets ! Dogs/Cats!

Please keep updating and building on this game, there is so much potiental here!

Things that would improve the game imo
- More lighting in builings and shops that turn on at night
- ambient sounds not just rain, it breaks the immersing game play
- Rain watering plants and filling up water troughs
- NPCs to either buy from a stall from us, or request goods at your ranch stall
- More animals to hunt, or foraging e.g mushrooms, truffles
- I'd like to interact with animals e.g pet, build friendships
- A feature to map own farm from birds eye blueprint so we can plan where to put things
- Fencing that can be squared off better, then selectable to place down and copy same fence 
- Skill points, and ability to harvest more wood with a higher skill or axe
- Demolishing the existing houses should give you timber, concrete and metal to use
- I'd also love to have sheep dogs that you could train to herd animals :) 
-I also think it would be pretty cool to move animals from pens to rotate as they eat the grass. 

I would totally recommend buying and supporting this game, i have played one player and co-op mode total 12hrs in 2 days so far, alot of fun.

Bigger coolers for sure.
When opening pens, every animal runs like crazy to get out, pleeeeeese change this to chill mode so I can get more animals in without all them escaping.
Bigger fuel tank in the mower.
In the Hardware Store, please the opening needs to be on the side of the road, not behind.
Motorcycles or sporty cars, maybe a semi truck for logs, like the log rack, where you can place more than like stacking.

- More missions would be fun
- Pigs not escaping from pens 
- Option to have your wheat, etc farms where you would like, instead of the pre-designed ones
- The way the tractor works to change, instead of having to get in and out of the vehicle to change the driving speed restriction
- A larger area of the farm for you to play with, mainly the road leading up to your farm, would be nice to have a building there 
- Vehicles that you are purchasing to not be reflected in the current weather conditions, aka if it's raining and dark, you can't see the vehicle
- More options with the bank? seems like a wasted building if only needed (if at all) in the first few days
- Making money is too easy.
- A handheld wheelbarrow or something for moving multiple small items around the farm would be nice, instead of having to use a vehicle, or one by one manually moving
- Driving the Harvester up the road to your ranch, it can get stuck
- Falling through the world sometimes, but at least it realises this and respawns you back on the Ranch.

The size of the trees and the amount of wood that comes out of them are disproportionate, this should be made proportional. Add the ability to save more than one character. It would be nice if a fire and fire mechanics were added to the game. Fighting fire on the farm will add a new challenge to the game. Since the number of NPCs that can be interacted with in the game is very few, you are left alone at one point. This loneliness should be eliminated by increasing the RPG elements, in this way, trading etc. will be more fun. Lockable day-night cycle. Lines can be added to use animals as guides during construction. The road must be built. Seasons and seasonal items should be added.

Arabanın üstüne konulan eşyaların araba gidince havada kalması düzeltilmeli. Oyuna mutlaka arabalara takmak için motorsiklet taşıma aparatı ve motorsiklet eklenmeli. Duvarları istediğimiz ölçülerde yapamıyoruz bunun değiimesi gerekiyor. Yüksek bina yaptığımızda eşyaları yukarı taşımak için vinç ya da asansör tarzı daha kolay bir yol eklenmeli. Büyük bir duvarla küçücük bir yalak ve-veya bir lambanın odun maliyetinin eşit olması çok saçma, bu düzeltilmeli.

Hazır evlerde var olan mutfak, şömine, dolap, masa, koltuk takımı gibi şeyleri kendimiz ev yaptığımızda da kullanabilmeliyiz. Ata yük yükleyebilmeliyiz, en azından uyku tulumu taşınabilse yeterli olacaktır. At arabası eklenmeli. Vahşi hayvanları evcilleştirebilmeliyiz ve derisini yüzmeden taşıyabilmeliyiz. Haritada birden fazla işaret konulabilmeli ve haritaya konulan bu işaretlere isim verilebilmeli. Bir mini harita eklenmeli.

Oyuna bir ateş ve yangın mekaniği eklense güzel olabilir. Çiftlikte yangınla mücadele etmek oyuna yeni bir mücadele ekleyecektir. Oyunda etkileşime girilebilecek NPC sayısı çok az olduğundan bir noktada yalnız kalıyorsunuz. RPG öğeleri arttırılarak bu yalnızlık giderilmeli, bu şekilde ticaret vs daha eğlenceli olacaktır.

I'm a HUGE Multiplayer! (Bought this game 5 times for my kids etc so we could play together.)

The Desyncing seems to be an on going dragged out issue with no end in sight of being fixed. I've read posts from a year ago that were complaining back then.
Anyway, this ""desyncing"" causes Major issues to Multiplayer. Logging in and out constantly to avoid the loss of cars, farming equipment and so on. By constantly I mean about every 2 to 3 game days to avoid issues.

""Desyncing"" of the store bought items between the multiplayers is horrible. IE: Milking machine for the cows, parts on the machine disappearing for friends invited. 

Using the Blueprint option to build items on your farm also causes more issues. Whether it causes ""desyncing"" or not has yet to be proven.

I'm not suggesting that you don't buy the game or play the game. I am suggesting that IF your plan is to play with family or friends that you hold off and see if this ""Desyncing"" is actually something that is going to be fixed. 

I have a brand new pc along with upgraded video card and a wonderful proc. I also use Fiber Optic and should not be running into this issue at all. ESP. with a sandbox game. I did lower all the graphics even though I run smoothly at EPIC and no change was found. (Normally, I run graphics on low in Early Access to discourage these types of issues from bothering me but this ""desync"" is beyond tolerable.

Things I did to try and fix issues:
Updated Graphic Card Drivers (No brainer)
Window Updates (No brainer)
Steam Updates (No Brainer)
Changed settings on Graphics card to allow me to choose settings rather then it automatically setting things up.
I even reset my modem before login.
I had friends log out around 18:00 game time. I slept in the tent then did morning saves. (I originally thought maybe they were spotty saves.) That didn't make a difference either. 

Again, single player go for it. Occasional hiccups can be tolerated. For hardcore Multiplayer this isn't the buy right now. I myself will be watching to see if the Dev's figure it out. I am also hoping the Dev's build the game they want to build and do not stray to far into the thoughts of gamers, As that can make for a crap game sometimes.",1673377752,1673377752,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1.  Optimization is horrible yet the devs would rather add content than work on that.  They say they are now porting to UE5 but I seriously doubt that will help any.  
2.  About that content:  I agree that early access devs should get some ideas from the community, but these devs went overboard with that.  They have put so many community ideas in the game that its made the game a cluster____.
3.  Economy:  No matter what I do I always basically have the game ""beat"" by day 10.  The economy is extremely overpowered with very little to spend it on so you end up owning everything very quickly.
4.  Speed of things:  Animals breed at 2 days old, have a litter every other day, and only take a few days to grow to maturity.  Crops grow from planting to harvest in 12 in game hours.
5.  Quests:  Repeatable daily quests that reward too much money in a game thats suppose to be a simulator.  Not to mention one of those quests involves finding 3 things that the ""ancients"" left behind.  I guess the ancients revisit us every couple days to leave their treasures laying around.
6.  The devs:  They dont respond to criticisms of the game.  You guys didnt respond to any of my criticisms on the forums so dont respond to this review.
7.  Not a simulator:  I know that word is in the name of the game.  This game is not a simulator, the things Ive mentioned in this review kill any thoughts of the game being a simulator.  It's more of a fantasy game in which you raise animals.  Name of the game should be Fantasy Ranch.",1673273531,1673273531,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You need to take care of your plants & chickens & cows etc. (milking the cow, watering the plants e.g.) Then when you earn more money, you can upgrade your ranch by buying better equipment, building bigger barn, buying bigger truck etc. 

It is a good farming simulator if you like chilling game but one of the problem is you can only carry one log / one stack of wood plank at a time and building a door needs like 10 planks so to build a house I just have to run back and forth to carry one piece of wood at a time which is so frustrating.

I really hope the game can add in a skill tree like what we got in RPG to level our character. Thus, when we are newbie, we can only carry 1 log but as we level up by purchasing more skill points, we can carry more/ have better driving skill/ run faster etc. to add more in-depth customization to the game. 

Moreover, it will be awesome if we can cook the ingredients that we harvest and sell it in our grocery store in the farm. e.g. processing the wheat into breads, milk into butter, fruits into juice, beef into burgers. Thus, we can choose to sell the raw meat or processed final product for more income. We can also be a cashier to ring up the customer or can hire employees to work for us. 

Hopefully later on the game can add in more outfits & furniture to let us spend our hard-earned money. For example, when we are rich, we can buy a luxurious bed/ expensive stereo/ paintings to decorate our house.

Which seems like the devs are using assets similar to other games like  Farm Dynasty or Stranded Deep, which worries me to see. As it shows these devs might have certain limitations on what they can offer and are developing the game just for a profit, not out of passion or a desire to offer something truly unique. 

Only the devs can prove me wrong in time I suppose. So I’ll patiently wait to see the end results once the game has been fully released in order to change my recommendation.

What I want to see in future updates for Ranch Simulator :

1. Light Improvements for vehicles and buildings.
  
2. Animation improvements for chickens,deer,bears,character,etc.

3. More varieties for the environment like boulders, plants, parks, trails,statues,etc.

4. More NPC’s and some that are doing activities (jogging, cutting grass, etc.) 

5. Bars with activities for players at night.  (Darts, pool,etc.)

6. More homes for the town.

7. Better parking areas for some stores.

8. Custom pathway/ Road way for the farm.

9. Trophies for deer,bears and wolves. The game revolves around three elements of Building,Farming and Hunting. Yet I don’t see an option to collect the racks from a buck or being able too decorate your farm with trophy mounts of animals you had hunted.

10. More animals to be seen like ducks, mountain lions,etc. 

11. Build log cabins.

12. More ways to custom build/ pieces.

13. Survival elements like Hunger and Thirst.

14. Hidden items to collect - I really enjoyed going around looking for hidden treasure for a quest line. Wish you can do more of it. Eastern eggs or something
.
15. More resources to collect and use for crafting like metals.

That’s all I can think of. At the moment the game seems like it’s pretty bare bones despite being able to craft a decent amount of stuff and animals you can raise. Even though you can see vehicles and NPC’s in the world, it is just boring to go through and it easily breaks my immersion.
As the vehicle’s driving around are going nowhere but in circles.  And the npc you can see are just sitting around doing nothing while their homes are empty. There’s really no meaning to the world other than to work on your farm that can be a bit of a drag with the amount of grinding you gotta do.  While there’s nothing else you can do in game to take a break other than shutting it off and start playing something else.",1673203241,1673203386,False,5,0,0.540519952774047852,0,True,False,True

When I first saw the game on Steam, I thought to myself ""Oh boy, another farming simulator - just what I need."" But little did I know, this game would lead me down a path of self-discovery and ultimately result in me purchasing a real-life ranch.

As soon as I started playing Ranch Simulator, I was hooked. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is incredibly immersive. I found myself lost in the world of ranching, managing my crops and livestock with precision and care.

But the best part about Ranch Simulator is the sense of accomplishment it gives you. There's something truly satisfying about watching your ranch thrive and grow under your careful management. It's a feeling that I just couldn't get from any other game.

As I continued to play, I found myself daydreaming about what it would be like to own a ranch in real life. And before I knew it, I had put in an offer on a small piece of land in rural America.

Now, I'm a proud ranch owner, living my best life and thanking Ranch Simulator for giving me the push I needed to make my dream a reality.

This game has a lot of potential, but still needs quite a lot of improvements. I look forward to play it when it is more polished, because as of now, I find it a diamond in the rough. Here are some of the things I found by playing just 1h:

[b]The player character[/b]
The character moves too fast in normal speed, so it looks like I'm rushing everywhere instead of normal walk speed. Imagine you want to pee but the closest toilet is close enough not to run but far way enough that you need to rush to it. That's what it felt like going around doing the tutorial tasks. Then the sprint looks like you could beat Ussain Bolt in the Olympics! :D I would prefer a much more realistic character movement speed to immerse the player in the farm life. 
When doing some actions, like [spoiler]demolishing the house[/spoiler], the character accomplishes a lot with a single swing of an arm. I think it would be more realistic if the arm swing affects a smaller portion[spoiler] of the wall or object you are trying to demolish. It took me just 5 minutes to demolish an entire 3 floor house.[/spoiler]

[b]The vehicle(s)[/b]
The initial vehicle has a weird behaviour. When I press the accelerator button, it takes half a second for the vehicle to react and then it goes in a forward burst of movement really fast. It's not a smooth acceleration from the start. I'm not sure if this is intended behaviour or not but it makes it a bit annoying when trying to park in a specific place. Reversing doesn't have this problem though, it's smoother. Also the turning of direction is too fast! I struggled to control the vehicle in the road because it turns too fast. I'm not sure if it's because I'm playing with keyboard and mouse, but it's very challenging to keep the vehicle in the road lane. Also the lights at night are super bright, especially the breaking light casts a really strong red light!

[b]Other game mechanics[/b]
I was sad to see that a HUGE tree only yields 3 logs and each log only yields 2 planks. I was left with a feeling of ""where's the rest of it?"" :)
The wild life does't seem to recognise some buildings. One time a stag was trying to go in the vehicle store.
The store UI needs some polishing but it's usable. I would like to see it more user friendly.
The access to the hardware store is on a side that has no road (unless I missed something).

[b]Overall[/b]

Though there are a few things i'd like to see fixed:
-Most importantly: Add street lights! This game is so overbearingly dark at night that you'd think it was a horror game. Only thing you can really do at night is rush to the nearest bed. 
-Make hunting more consistent. I hate having to drive in circles waiting for any animal to stumble into view of the road. Maybe a wooded area that has a higher spawn rate of animals?
-Make the initial house tear down much less tedious. After the first floor it should autocomplete. The building mechanic is a ton of fun otherwise.
-Just please make nighttime less dark! It's a huge pain to navigate",1672915831,1672915831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

be nice if you can have dogs and cats in this game. Be nice to have clade stales and paints horses in the game as well. also the training  ring is a bit too small to make turns well with the horses. horses turning not bad  but they could get their turning a bit more worked on.

One of the things I love most about Ranch Simulator is the freedom it gives players to build and design their own properties. The inclusion of blueprints for walls, windows, and other structures allows players to truly make their farms their own. My wife and I have had a blast playing in co-op mode, working together to design and build the farm of our dreams.

But what really sets Ranch Simulator apart is the dedication and care that the developers have put into it. They are constantly releasing updates and listening to player feedback, which has resulted in a truly enjoyable gaming experience. I can't wait to see what they have in store for the future of this game.

In short, Ranch Simulator is a must-play for any fan of farming games or anyone looking for a creative and immersive gaming experience. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!",1672839821,1672839821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The economy could be balanced and some advanced processing could make it more effective to actually process food... you will make more money just selling pork than processing anything into sausage or cheese, or than you would make with farming or eggs... you kind of have to want to do the other things... they make money, but if you are driven by profit vs time spent, just kill pigs... it has some glitches, nothing even remotely game breaking... the building and seeing your designs come to life is very satisfying. The mechanics are a blend of a lot of games... some Car Mechanic Sim, some Hunter Sim, some House Flipper... a bunch of management games... it takes what works from those for doing what this game needs to do, and it really works... the driving takes getting used to but if you manage your speed and steer with the terrain, it becomes enjoyable... offroading is well done... the immersion is fantastic.  You really do feel like you are running a ranch. The inventory system is outstanding and different from any other game... everything has a real world representation and storing stuff is a matter of stacking actual items and not just filling a database with names... pretty much every complaint I read about in these reviews is addressed in the game, the game does have a solution, but it is not always easy to find and the game could use more ""help"" descriptions or an intuitive tutorial... The daily chores give a solid sense of accomplishment every evening. But it is a bit of a grind, and could use some late game automation to make a large ranch viable for  a single player... it needs a balance of economy, money is too easy to come by and never drained... it has quests you can repeat which make you so much money that ranching becomes unnecessary... it needs some kind of financial drain that makes you have to go get more money. But as far as a relaxing, immersive experience that is exactly what the title suggests, it's a home run. The devs are responsive and seem to care about the players as much as their product.

This game is bad. It objectively is.  
Nevertheless, It has given me a ton of silly, stupid fun

-It has a ton of technical issues: 
Like the problem with joining your friend's server making you jump through hoops to fix it, or falling through map. 
(The developers also aren't very helpful, giving some vague advice on every therad tha mentins it.) 
 
-The game design is non-existant:
It does not incentivize ranching in the slightest. 
The most effective way to play the game is by murdering every animal you come across. 
The progression system is confusing and all over the place 
Towing those stupid pigs is nothing short of a chore.

Nothing will take away jumping down a cliff with a flamable-fuel trailer-hooked melex while shouting yeehaaw with my friend.

Ranch Simulator is an Early Access game that give you a chance to work a Ranch and bring it to life.

I enjoy that I can pop on and figure out Milking, Cooking, Farming and Hunting. As it is Early Access these are very barebones and hopefully will be fleshed out more as the game is developed. But as it stands it is still an enjoyable game to pass the time. 

Pros:
Good game to just sit and relax with.
Animal Husbandry is pretty good.
Ranch Management makes you think.
Graphics are good.

Cons: Driving feels like a Racing game controls was slapped in.
Building is very limited.
Town needs more buildings/interaction.
Farming is very barebones and the 3 fields given are not the same size/elevation
Multiplayer can be a bit glitchy/buggy (i.e. non-host can't use fuel cans/equipment)

There are quite a few small critiques that I've come up with for the developers to consider while I've been playing. They're things that can be improved on or changed if the devs see fit. If some things already have plans for future updates/the full release, then they can just be ignored lol. I also just don't want to seem like I'm back seat game developing ToT
These aren't in order of importance, just in order of what I can think of. 

1) To start, the layout of the map is huge! Especially for all that's there currently. I spend a lot of time going to and from places, especially when I need to go the gas station, then the hardware store, then the general store, maybe back to the hardware store when I forget something, then back to my ranch, etc. I can see where if more things are going to be added in the empty spaces this can be ignored, but if not, these kinds of buildings should be closer together. Especially since they're retail locations, it just makes sense.

2) I was surprised to see the gas station was completely empty on the inside, and almost completely run down all over. Again, I can see if the devs have a plan for it saved for later, so it's another thing that can be ignored, but I think adding some extra details around it would make it feel less convenient. Also, making that second gas tank usable would be a great help. It would speed up the process when I have multiple jerry cans to fill. My first critique is also applicable to the gas station because it's kind of in a weird spot, away from everything else.

3) The speed of the cars driving around is insanely slow. My character runs faster than the cars drive lol. I think making the cars a little faster would be nice to see.

4) I know this would be some work to add, but adding neighborhoods for said cars to drive around, pull into specific driveways, etc would be cool too. I joked to friends when I first started playing that it felt like the game took place in some sort of rural purgatory, and these cars were destined to just constantly drive with no beginning and no end for all eternity lmao.

5) The hardware store doesn't have a parking lot, or an entrance that makes sense for vehicles to enter. Driving into the back entrance on dirt doesn't really make sense to me. It would makes sense if the large door next to the pick up area was connected to a easily accessible parking lot. I've gotten stuck in that back entrance (which honestly is kind of a skill issue on my part LMAO but still) and have had to clear out the trees in that area to get stuff like the vehicle trailer out of there. An easy fix would to just be taking away that fence by the road.

6) This is kind of small, but adding logs to be bought would be nice, because sometimes I like how some trees are placed and want to keep a tree for the aesthetics but I need the wood. So either adding buy-able, unprocessed logs, or adding a feature to plant trees anywhere would be a nice feature.

7) A creative mode would be fun! Unless I've missed it somewhere, I think it would be fun to add a creative mode with unlimited supplies and make it quick and easy to demolish things.

8) There are quite a few rocks/trees I've found that sort of float in the air. There is one specific rock that I got stuck on on the hill to the hunter's cabin. I swerved to not run into a wolf, drove off the road, and got stuck on top of the rock. I couldn't back up off of it, couldn't drive forwards, and the ""flip car"" option didn't help. Fixing some of those rocks/trees would be nice.

9) The very start of the rancher's driveway has a bump that makes my car fly into the air and flip over if I drive normally over it. I have to slow way down to avoid flipping. Flattening that bump out a little would help with that.

10) The pieces of ancient treasure are in strange spots to me. There's nothing of importance in those areas, and the helmet and dagger are so far away that I, at first, thought those areas would be off limits since they're more up in the mountains. I just assumed there'd be an invisible wall stopping players from going up there. The goblet not so much since it's right off the road basically, but the other two are in super weird spots.

11) Being able to get rid of the tent after building a house would be nice. I like to build a garage near the entrance, and it takes up space near the entrance of the ranch.

12) Adding people in the burger place or just in the retail shops all together would make the cashiers seem less desolate. It's weird walking into those stores and the cashiers are just... there, not doing anything. More people would make it seem more realistic.

Tbh these things don't make the game unplayable, they're just things I think will improve the overall game play. Like I said, if any of these things already have plans, then the devs can just ignore them lol

""Hidden Valley Ranch"" has been the talk of the town according to best burger. Grandpappy couldn't make it work but dammit we're doing it. 

Two things annoy me a lot. 

1. Why do all pigs dart for the door/gate when opened. This is so bad some sleeping piglets slide toward the door while sleeping. Getting pigs in and out of the barn has triggered a led fueled sausage party twice now. 

2. Auto save needs to be implemented ASAP.

High priority wish list. 
Linux preferred or windows self host MP client. 

I love my self hosted FS22 server so do my friends. 

General wish list. 
-Fix flashlight from making building book unreadable. 
-Add a lock function to equipment. I'm tired of accidentally picking up table saws and grinders. 
-add a meatball setting or sausage setting. I'm tired of not being able to regrind the meatball if I accidentally pick it up. Alternatively, allow us to be able to regrind meatballs. 

-add craftable light switches. Having to turn on every light gets old. 

That's it as of now.

My initial impression of the game is underwhelmed at this time due to the following reasons. Perhaps more will unfold as I dig into it more. But I just wanted to point out a couple of things so that the devs and potential players can be aware of a few particular points about this game. 

Honestly, 4 hours in and I don't really think this game is ready. I have a pet peeve with games like these that release the concept of immaculate building designs that have 2 roof pieces where you can't even create a normal looking roof system. The fun for me is in the design and construction of the building. I can only do a gable roof then when I create a foyer entrance I have a gap in my roof because the gable doesn't connect to the main portion of the roof. They have pre-designed structures but that's boring to me. I think that they really need to invest a lot more focus on the building aspects of this game. Add the appropriate roof pieces. 

I do enjoy the resource gathering, chopping down trees, then cutting them into planks using the power saw. They did well to place a stacking system so that you're not just moving around one plank at a time, which I thought was the case at first. 

The graphics are mediocre which you know whatever. That isn't that big of a deal to me if I can have fun building stuff. Also, controller support would be a most welcome feature on this game as there is a lot to do in it and it gets tiring using the keyboard and mouse. 

I don't really have much more to say about it at this time except that it's not really drawing me in as some of the other reviews gave me the false impression that it would do. But I will follow it and try to put some more time in it and update my review once some updates have come through. It is early access, so I get that and I understand not having a perfect looking roof in a game might be considered a little nit picky. But the design/build mechanic is supposed be one of the defining features of the game. Ultimately, not bad, but in dire need of some polish. And I understand that game design is more complex then cooking eggs and bacon. So, it's not an easy job. This is a pretty ambitious concept which I can appreciate. Therefore 5/10 not all negative.",1670714955,1670715228,False,2,0,0.541715621948242188,0,True,False,True

I have a few notes/ suggestions that I would love to see implemented to improve the general experience of the game

1. It would be so nice if we could get a buildable light switch to actuate every fluorescent light the player has built! (Or even if it actuated every light in the game that would be a huge time saver) If I want to turn on every light in my ranch I will end up spending an estimated 15-30 minutes each time I load up the game

2. If possible I would love to see the farm fields be creatable instead of the three fixed plots we got in the last update. Whether that could be implemented through the build menu or just tilling up dirt with your tractor so you could have as much farmable land as your heart desires

3. It would be nice to have a header trailer for combine headers. Combine is damn slow (as it should be) but I spent a whole lot of time driving my combine all over gods creation to get my three headers from the hardware store up to my ranch (or if this isn’t possible I would also be happy with a trailer that could better accommodate the new farming equip (tractor with implements attached get super stuck on the car trailer and the combine doesn’t have the clearance to fit and either gets hung up or high centered when attempting to lid on to trailer)

That being said I love how this game is a sweeet spot between simplicity and complexity. I wish I had a game like this as a young man as I could see myself living in it for days at a time. Could best be described as ‘the Minecraft of farming games’

The tutorial sets you on a path to raise chickens but the economics of chickens is hopeless because they eat way too much to make a decent profit from selling eggs. They are also very time consuming to tend. 

The gameplay then pushes you toward hunting instead of farming. The deer run like the wind ... and wastes a large part of a short day to catch up with them  . 

The store interface is very basic and it does not give descriptions of items and their purpose until AFTER you buy them. 

The little ATV that you must use to accomplish any buying and selling is maddeningly difficult to steer as it weaves back and forth constantly. 

The entire game needs a LOT of polish. Needs a time scale adjuster to slow down play and lengthen the day. Why does it get so dark at 8pm every day ? Is it perpetually autumn ?  The game needs a pause button. 

The parking area at the hardware store is very awkward to access and wastes a lot of time in your short work day just to get in and out of the loading area. 

The lights you build to let you work at night (after 8pm) are too dim to be very helpful. 

The road traffic needs an option to turn it off.

A tutorial on greenshouses, bee hives, and making products for sale would be VERY helpful to set the player up for success.

Let's start with the pros:
- I was pleasantly surprised with the character creation. Sure, it's a bit limited but there are a decent amount of options and I do very much appreciate that. More clothing would be fun, or even a clothing store.
- No matter how many times you crash your car and how many trees you hit, you don't get any damage and your car couldn't care any less. Nor could the other road users or animals you hit for that matter.
- The tutorial is not too long but it does give a decent overview on how to play the game and some money to start with.
- I like the way the game looks. The background with the mountains looks very relaxing and overall it looks solid.
- Quests are great. I so far found 2 places, an old guy next to the river and the hunter, both of which give quests. It's very nice to have the option of earning some extra money. I do miss seeing what the reward is beforehand, but could be I just didn't see it and it was there? Anyway, I think this is a great addition.

And then the cons...
- ROADS, this game is in desperate need of roads! Why is it I can apparently design a building, roof, foundation, walls, you name it... But I can't put down any paths or roads?
- Fences... I'm pretty sure the person who designed the fences in this game did it with the intent to drive people nuts. And it worked. You can only make fences snap on one side. So too bad if you want to build the other way. Want to build it straight? Yeah, good luck figuring out when it's straight. From this angle it sort of looks good... Oh but the other angle seems wrong... Let's just try again... Over and over and over. Do you have a mild case of OCD, this game is not it for you, keep on looking!
(On this topic btw, why not make it so that if you want something straight or want to turn 90 degrees, to make it so you can click a button or ctrl or shift or something to make it 'snap'.)
- Driving, oh good god the driving... There is only 1 word for this, horrible. I'm a person who likes to be careful, avoid hitting others, don't go too fast, take my time... Yeah, I gave up on that in this game. Just bash through, hope for the best and usually come to a complete standstill with my car flipped over because some teeny tiny tree was in the way. I read someone say the car feels like it's programmed to hit every single tree and it really does feel that way. And even if you want to stay on the road, the speed makes it pretty much impossible. Me driving around usually goes a bit like: 'okay slooowly, slow, slow, NO SLOW! Darn it, oh I'm so sorry, I hope I didn't break your car, oh watch out, WATCH OUT, where is the damn break when you need it, go backwards, NO, backwards! Oh... Well I guess I can fly over this fence, that works I suppose. Who am I to disagree....
- I'm a bit confused why I can't pick up things once I build them. Like, if I want to put my chicken coop somewhere else, too bad, nothing to do, only thing you can do is break it down. Even small stuff like fences. And even when I want to build something and put the blueprint down, can't change that either. Nope, have to go to demolition mode and then build it again.
- The game to me feels a bit tedious after a while. I'm not sure this is true, I've only played 6 hours so I could be wrong. It seems the focus is mainly on keeping animals (which makes sense ofc) but it just feels boring. I'd love to be able to name my animals. Have some more options in caring for them. So far it seems all you do is build an enclosure, buy animals, feed them and water them, hope they breed and rinse and repeat. But again, it could be there is more to this game, I'm sure I haven't fully seen all the options yet.
- The amount of things you can make feels very limited to me. I know that's not the main focus of this game, but considering there are so many options in house building, why not also give some more options in other things? For example, multiple different options for fences, maybe some flower patches, maybe a dog with a doghouse?
Also, I broke down the fences and entrance arch thing, only to discover that as far as I can tell there is no replacement for that. I tried putting fence gates instead, but since they don't snap in place and I can only attach fences to the right side it gets ridiculous.
- Hunting... I'm from Europe, and guns here are already not exactly a common thing. So when I have to try my hands on hunting in a game, I tend to just sort of, freak out. Not the game makers faults really, they said very clearly hunting is one of the things you do. I must've not read that though because I did not like the wolf that attacked me at all and by the time I figured out which button it was to get the gun out, I was already dead. Second time I didn't really fare any better, making me reconsider my attempts on making some extra money. Not my thing, I'll just stick to chickens. (although to be fair, when you grab a fertile egg, chicken mums go mental too and they pack a punch, so really, vicious game :P)
- Also, did I miss a health bar somewhere or doesn't it exist? Considering the many things out to kill you in this game, a health bar sounds like a must-have.

It could very well be that my expectations for this game just weren't on par with what the game actually is. I guess I was hoping for more farming and less hunting. And I will admit I come from having house flipper as my number 1 favorite game so I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to customization and building options. So maybe I'm just not the right public for this game :) Anyway, the game definitely has potential and some good starts. Right now I would not recommend it, but like I said, that might just be because it's not my taste.",1670454250,1670454250,False,4,0,0.558823525905609131,1,True,False,True

It allows the player to build freely on their property, including blueprints for things like walls and windows in case you'd prefer to design your own buildings. You also have free range of the world to hunt and cut down trees for extra wood. The layout of the buildings in relation to the ranch is a bit confusing at first but grows on you over time, and eventually those hairpin turns become quirks of the trip instead of annoying directional distractions. The actual ranching aspect of the game is also nice. You can buy chickens, pigs, cows, and goats to raise and either slaughter or use to get produce. At stores you can buy products to help you along, such as meat grinders and milk buckets. The graphics are very nice, even if you have a slower computer and need to put them down (like me). The first and third person view options are also useful for driving in reverse versus doing things on the ranch. Now to get into some of the specifics:

Pros:
- beautiful graphics, even on low settings
- variety of animals to raise
- multiple ways to play (ranching, hunting, farming, etc.)
- free range on your ranch to build and design it how you like
- free car at the beginning, negating any unnecessary walking before grinding for a car
- good control mechanics, using mainly left click and E as interact buttons and WASD for movement (including driving)
- variety of products to buy from the stores to make your job easier as you get enough money to buy them
- gas is not ridiculously expensive like it often is in these types of games

Cons:
- sometimes the controls in first person mode can be difficult because the character sways from side to side as you move the mouse, often causing you to misclick items
- there are few directions on how to actually utilize the products from the stores and how to get your ranch going after the tutorial
- driving controls are very sensitive and sometimes cause you to run into trees
- metal is extremely expensive
- you cannot rebuild the arch at the entrance to your ranch if you remove it for any reason
- you cannot rebuild the garage if you remove it for any reason
- bears sometimes appear in store areas
- deer will literally change directions to make you run into them
- animals eat a lot of food compared to how expensive it is to buy it
- you cannot sell some items back to the stores

To go into a little more depth on the cons:

When you go into the build menu, which is very nicely put together by the way, there is no explanation on any of the builds. While this might seem unnecessary for stuff like houses, things like preserving bins would be nice if they had a little more detail in the descriptions (for raw or salami or cooked meat, etc.). It would also be nice if you could change your view to be wider once you have a blueprint selected, since a lot of the time you can't see the area around what you're placing (important for things like connecting fences).

Another serious problem I've found is the price of food. $30 a bag doesn't seem like much when you start with over a thousand dollars, but after you buy animals you'll quickly realize they eat a lot. Chickens' eggs sell for very little, and with hens only laying once a day, they're not a great method of making money. Pigs, being the next animal up in price, are much better. They can be bought and fed until they're big enough to be slaughtered for profit meat. The problem here comes with the feeding part. Two pigs (a male and a female) eat about one bag of food a day. If the female becomes pregnant and has 4ish babies, you're suddenly going through three bags a day. Add chickens into that (eggs increase the selling price of meat), and you're using up bags as quickly as you can buy them. Eventually you'll run out of money, be unable to buy more food, and lose half or more of your animals to starvation before they're ready to be slaughtered for profit. Either the price of food needs to be decreased, or animals need to eat less, because right now it's incredibly hard to get your ranch off the ground.

Speaking of that, there's no directions as to what to do after you complete the tutorial. Nowhere in the game can you easily get information like how eggs increase meat profit, boiling sausages on a stove increases profit, there's a drying room in a ranch house, animals die immediately once their food bar runs out (which can be within a day), you can't sell back concrete or metal, etc. It would be nice if you could complete some sort of notebook within the game that has these things written down so that not everything is so hard to learn.

The barn design is another thing that bothers me. The stall doors only open/close from the outside, so getting an animal to stay inside while you close the door is really hard. You cannot make the floor anything but grass, so eggs get lost and water piles up from the rain (even though you have a roof). The windows cannot be closed. Side doors only open in two separate pieces--you can't latch them together like in real barns and make it a single piece door, so opening and closing it can be a chore. The barn is peeling in paint and old-looking as soon as it's built, which would be fine except everything else the player builds looks brand new. It'd be nice if the barn reflected that too. Some animals are a little big for the barn stalls, so it'd be nice if you could expand the barn more than three times (which is already a small barn to begin with) and have bigger stalls.

Notes for the developers:
- make food less expensive or make animals eat less
- make it possible to sell back things like concrete and metal
- make it possible to sell unprocessed wood for quick cash
- make the barn stall doors able to be closed/opened from the inside
- make it possible to close the barn windows to prevent rain from coming inside
- add a flashlight (it gets pitch-black at night and you only have mounted lights and your car's headlights)
- make it take longer for animals to starve (like maybe more than a single day please?)
- make eggs more profitable or make chickens produce more so that they're actually worth having around
- add instructions on how the rest of the game works beyond the basic tutorial
- make the barn have an actual floor (and maybe add buyable bags of shavings for the animals)
- make the side barn doors able to be one piece instead of two
- fix the field of view in first person mode so that holding items (like bags of wheat, for example) and viewing blueprints doesn't block the view of what's in front of you/where you're trying to place it
- fix the weird swaying motion that makes it hard to click on things in first person mode
- PLEASE make built items moveable! I should be able to pick up and move a small table, like come on
- half of what you got from building something when you break it should be more like three quarters, especially if they're immovable once placed down
- I've also experience a lot of having to click items three or four times before it registers (which isn't my mouse or computer because I've never had that problem before) so maybe see about looking into that

Overall, I would recommend this game, especially in early access, because I think it has a lot of potential and is fun to play right now. You can easily sink six straight hours into this game. But be warned that there are a lot of little frustrating things that can be improved (and hopefully will be) as the game progresses in development.

1119730,127940610,76561198043705219,0,3,401,0,401,1670183469,"Let me start off by saying -- I love the concept of this game, seriously, I really do love it. It is so much fun to build and play with friends. I can't wait to see in a year or two where this game ends up. It has the most amazing bare bones potential (like a much more fun, creative. and open world version of Farming sim). However, despite the amazing amount of potential, it currently sits as a very aggravating and difficult game to ignore the bad and just play for the fun. My reasons are as follows: 

1. Tedious (example: one hit chops down a whole tree, but you have to hold in a button to cut it up into pieces to carry, then you can only carry 1/8 pieces and then tediously arrange them in the back of your vehicle instead of just click and go, meaning it takes me 10-20 irl minutes to just arrange a couple of logs into the vehicle and a whole day cycle, forcing me to drive at night, then you get back to manually feed logs one at a time into the sawmill; 1 piece giving you only 2 planks. It would be so nice to have an option to move all the logs into a holder that can slow feed into the sawmill so you aren't wasting hours just trying to get enough planks to build growing beds, which take 18 planks even though the log holder which is much larger only takes 12 planks, make it make sense; and don't you dare hit the same button you've been using up to this point, it folds up the whole machine and you have to start over again)

2. Glitchy (example: the steering controls are absolutely garbage, I know it's one of the more difficult things in every game to get right, however, you feel like a teen learning to drive in a golf cart -- touching the gas thrusts you at 100mph in a direction and turning takes continually holding in the button hoping it will eventually start turning, but you don't, so you have to hit the brakes and slide for a bit before stopping then turn the wheel before hitting the gas again and starting the process over; pretty much you spend 8 minutes getting yourself unstuck and 1 minute of actually driving to the location. The NPC/other cars on the road don't have headlights, or any AI at all, they bounce/gyrate/flip/slam into each other for zero reason or just block up a whole road because they just randomly float into the air and flip upside down and never move again. You get to a point where you just decide to run everywhere, but you can only carry one single item back and forth)

3. Grinding for days just to afford anything (example: Everything in the game is so expensive to buy with little return in profits, for the sheer amount of work you have to do to make it start to work, you blow through your money just buying the bare essentials. In the 8 in-game days we played, the 2 chickens and 1 rooster plowed through about 4 bags of feed. This forced us to spend most of our time hunting bears, deer, and wolves to get enough money just to take care of the chickens, gas for the 1 vehicle, and gas for the sawmill to get the planks to continue doing ANYTHING bare essential in the game, but most things, even the 2 LAMP OPTIONS to have, y'know, light in the game, require Metal which is very expensive. Don't get me started on the expense and confusion of concrete being in kg but the blueprints just show a number, nothing about kg)

4. Confusing (example: The blueprints of chicken coops show how many chickens they can fit, but they didn't start with the bare minimum and work up, they were just tossed onto the page in random order. 2 of the coops did the same exact thing yet they didn't have the same amount of building materials, which caused me to look it up trying to figure why someone would go through the hassle just to build a more expensive coop that didn't do anything more. The well is useless, I thought it would let me refill the water faster or auto feed the water troughs, but no, none of these are it because the yellow water containers are endless, so I would leave the yellow water containers against the chicken coop and refill immediately. I still don't understand what the point was to build it in the first place other then to waste money and time. When I tried to use the well, it didn't work no matter how much I rotated my mouse causing this to feel like a combination of all the above issues. There is a huge lack of explanation in the building book or tutorial how anything actually works. Trying to sell items was aggravating because the NPC just said, ""Selling is beside me"" or some vague nonsense. It wasn't until later we realized it meant the pickup area for your goods was the same as drop off for selling. Why not use the same kiosk to sell since you buy through it as well? Or why not say, Selling is done in the loading/unloading area of the parking lot? Why won't it just load your bought items into your vehicle that you have to park in that designated area? It takes so much time to turn and twist items to fit in a huge bed of a truck. I know this game totes itself on realism and sandbox play, which is great, but focus on the FUN things we all want to do like farming/gardening/animal husbandry/de-forestation/destroying/building and less about, ""Hold on, I have to pick up each seed packet and rotate it into the truck for 10 minutes before I get home and just rip it all out onto the ground so I don't have to waste another 10 minutes carrying one item at a time so I can enjoy gardening, building, or tending to the animals oh wait while I was talking its nighttime and I can't see because there are zero lights in this game, not on the buildings, not in the streets, not the other cars, just the sunbeam attached to your vehicle or the sunbeam attached to me that won't let me see any details of things in front of me like my building book or any objects which turn pure white in my sunbeam flashlight"". Also, the chickens eggs, it is almost impossible for me to see any difference between the fertilized and unfertilized eggs, I have to check them on the useless Ovoscope and put them in the basket just so the basket could tell me which it was. Handling the eggs made me so nervous because I put so much money, time, and resources into protecting them and they can be broken just with an accidental click of the mouse or keyboard).

Nothing in this game is intuitive, you have to look up guides or reddit questions just to figure out how to use something or if it's even worth it. I'm sure this game will come out of this early access looking a lot better and hopefully leave a majority of these problems behind. I don't regret buying it (especially because it was on sale) and I will return to it someday. Until then, I'm leaving this review because it was my honest experience and I hope I can come back and fix it later.

Certain things about this game suggest to me that this was made by a single developer or small team that is/are starting out in development. Animations are simple and game play is the kind of repetitive that you'd expect if you were playing something put together from a bunch of canned/premade modules. Also there doesn't appear to be any story beyond the introduction with the game seemingly a true open game (within limited bounds).

Changes still that still need to be made:

Larger sales parking area at 'Burger Place'. 
Farmers market
a way to find the premium market prices from the ranch. Probably a TV channel or in game computer access/internet.
The rifle gun sighting needs overhaul.
Animations (addressed in latest post)
Hardware/Country Store delivery (with extra charge)

I've already got over 80 hours in the game, at least 60 of that being in the last week. I do wish there was more to it though. It still feels like it is missing out on so much more. This game has a lot of potential. I think it is great that crops are being added and that more animals have been added. Would love to see cellars added to make wine. I wish there was more products/ recipes to make. I also think it would be cool to see neighboring ranches to do quests and sell for, maybe thats already in the game but I havent found it. I wish there was more buildings to build and more custom options. I also think fishing could be a cool option to include. Mostly want to see more cooking and creating implemented and I love that I can do everything myself, but wish there was options for more automation, because when I first started out I made the mistake of leaving all of my pigs together, therefore they kept reproducing. I had over 40 pigs and it kept me busy, but it was also extremely time consuming and I had to keep buying more and more coolers and processing it all into salami took forever even with the electric grinders, wish there was an option to load more than just one piece of meat at a time or maybe the option to build like some type of conveyor belt. I play mostly solo so when I have that much meat it takes a lot of time and can be overwhelming. Anyway these are just suggestions, hopefully the Devs see this and take it into consideration.

Running a ranch without any training,
Building and painting while its still raining,
Chickens that can't fly even though they have wings,
These are a few of my favorite things!

Grinding up sausage and making some cheese,
Exploring the forest to find some more bees,
There aren't any seasons, it's always Spring,
These are a few of my favorite things!

Chopping down trees and stacking the wood,
Remembering to refill the animals food,
Keeping crops watered and cleaning drop-pings,
These are a few of my favorite things!

When the wolf bites,
When the bee stings,
When I'm feeling sad;

But I still love it, and dammit if the jank isn't part of the charm.

Sure it's just a matter of time before you have more money than you know what to do with, and there's no end game or really even any objectives past ""Build a bitchin ranch,"" but there's something to be says for sitting down with the boys, having a few beers, and just ranching the shit out of this place. Kinda captures the ""just build shit"" of old school Minecraft, and any game that manages to make grinding sausage fun is doing something right.

    This is my first ever review of any game, but I fell in love with Ranch Simulator. Are there things that could be worked on, absolutely, but the idea behind the game for all intents and purposes is absolutely amazing. For a new, small developer; excellent work!!!!! i would buy this game as is for damn near any price. I've logged almost 300 hrs on this one game. I'm not very fluent in some computer terms so please bare with me. I will list some changes that might improve game play and and just make it that much better. 

   The List 
 1. Building materials such as brick and steel would be a nice addition. having choices for foundation and and walls.
 2. Having household appliances to interact with and use. 
 3. Furniture that we can build or buy.
 4. Horse mechanics could use a overhaul. being able to rope and herd animals on a ranch is quite essential to the smooth running of said ranch. Example, Red Dead Redemption 2 by Rockstar has good horse mechanics.
 5. The rate at which time passes could be slowed down a little bit. you run out of time with still a load of work to do. That's for real close to simulation!!!!!
 6. A deep freeze for storing meat and a refrigeration unit to haul to sell point.
 7. Being able to buy food items needed for recipes if not raising that particular item ourselves.
8. Sawmill to haul logs to would be a welcome addition to the game as well.
 
    Overall, Ranch Simulator is the kind of game that I've longed to play for some time now. Excellent work you guys and keep up the good work!!!!

It wasn't a short bathroom break so I had to quit to the menu in order to go.  Also my computer crashed this morning after playing for an hour, no auto save and I only saved like 15 minutes in.

Downside first:

Ranching is difficult & expensive.  Even if you inherit grandpa's old ranch, buildings need to be replaced or repaired, equipment needs to be purchased, livestock bought, etc.  Don't expect to make a profit for the first few years.  Therefore some startup funds are needed.  In RS, they are desperately needed.

In ranching, land is the most valuable asset.  Acres and acres of open grasslands for your animals to graze: cattle, goats, sheep or whatever, they need to graze and they need lots of space.  Livestock do not live in barns.

If you grow crops, they do not go from seed to harvested fruit in 1 -2 days.  If you plant cabbage in the early Spring, they are not ready to take to market the next day.  Same with honey ...  Crops/honey need several months to mature.

In Ranch Sim world it rains twice a day - like clockwork -  sure would be a good idea to use all that rain ...

The above items lead me to seriously wonder if the development team knows anything at all about farming/ranching.

Positive:

If you like to dress in western clothing, drive an atv or pickup through the woods, and have a shooting gallery full of animals - then, Ranch Simulator is your game.

As I said in the beginning, RS is an Early Access game.  There is plenty of opportunity to turn this dark comedy into a real Ranch Simulator - profitable for the company & enjoyable for the players.  Unfortunately, it has a long way to go before it can sit in the ranks of the other simulator games.

A few notes:
- The way the characters stand and hold stuff/tools/chickens sooooo stiffly is hilarious, but I'm assuming this will be fixed later on. Right now they look like aliens pretending to be humans and failing miserably.
- The driving... lol. It's so hard with the camera not staying static in front of the vehicle. I laugh here because my friend crashing us into trees never gets old. I'm honestly torn between wanting this to be fixed or not. Thank god we have an option to right the vehicles if they tip over. 
- Yes, there's a LOT of rain, but what bugs me the most about it is that the plants aren't watered by the rain... Why do I have to water plants when it rains? (I put the planters outside, not in a greenhouse btw) 
- There's not a whole lot to do really (there IS but there isn't really). Found a few quests, but I'm assuming this will also evolve with time.
- I'm hoping they add more ways to get resources than having to buy them. It'd be nice if we could grow out own feed or even recycle part of the old buildings or garbage. Gathering things or fishing, something, anything... lol
- Some of the graphics are a little low quality, but for an early access, it's passable.
- There are a few glitches in multiplayer, where my friend will see something I don't. Not sure why.

since purchasing it i have spent 45 hours already on it.

There is certainly things that the developer needs to work on but the game is in EARLY ACCESS
for example: descriptions on items, maybe an indication of whats needed to do certain things.
a little bit more work on building issues like getting parts to click in place if close to its position rather than full free form

loading of vehicles with items, should have the ability to click into place - rather than free form 
as there is some issues with trying to load things onto vehicles straight.

there is some issues with building where walls will not align properly despite it showing it is on the blueprint.

For the future:

❀ I hope finding bees will become easier.
❀ Content for the caravans up north, why are they there? 
❀ Vehicles easier to drive, they're very sensitive and most of the time I'm hitting trees.
❀ Chickens loves to be stuck on the doors/feeders. Have to go move them at least few times a day cycle.
❀ Building made a bit easier, making perfectly straight fences etc. Was really difficult. Always something was off and something didn't snap on place etc. 
❀ More tasks and quests!! They're life savers when starting the game :) Also maybe map indicators for the npc's who gives tasks. 
❀ Dogs and cats?

So, for the sake of this review, I’m giving it a “thumbs down” with conditions. If I were to give it a numerical rating, I’d say it’s 2.5 out of 5 stars. I can’t recommend it, but I can’t totally crap on the game either. I know how hard game developers work, especially if they’re independent and have minimal staff. The game was released March 4, 2021, and it’s still showing as “Early Release,” most likely because they are such a small studio and can only do so much as far as additions, updates, etc. Toxic Dog Games also has 2 other games, but neither one involves simulation/crafting/building. There’s a lot of things that need work and the game is far from complete, but I’m going to attempt to give a better explanation behind my review and let people decide for themselves.

What I’d add/change:
A repair option instead of just demolishing everything. I mean, your grandfather left you his dilapidated ranch, you should be able to repair the structures you want to keep for half the cost of building it new.

Ladder – so you can build/demolish taller structures like roofs, etc. I can't even finish my house because even building stairs to make an attic won't let me finish my roof

Additional storage buildings

Additional decorations for your house, barn, etc.

Additional blueprints, like another garage (especially one you can attach to your house)

Animal enrichment – toys/snacks for your animals so they don’t get totally bored. Providing salt licks for your goats is a great example and they would attract more deer for hunting purposes.

Adding other animals – yes, I realize this would be getting into Farming Simulator territory, but adding more animals, like sheep and horses would benefit any ranch

Planks: 2 planks for each log? Maybe you get more planks if you buy the upgraded table saw, but even Minecraft gives you 4 planks from a basic crafted log block. IRL, a standard log can produce over 100 board feet of lumber

Concrete: Concrete is way more expensive than planks, but the reality is that concrete is actually cheaper than wood in today’s economy, so perhaps reduce the cost of concrete.

I’m sure there’s more that will be added to this list, but for now, I’ll end it here by saying don’t buy the game at full price – wait for it to go on sale for about $10-$15 – the holidays are coming up in December!

I'll continue to play it until I get my $$'s worth...and then carefully study any other games this dev puts out before I buy from them again.",1664757056,1664757056,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The good?  You can kill bears, wolves, deer, and livestock to sell the meat and get yourself feed for the rest of your livestock to produce more livestock because livestock.  You can build up the ranch to look how you want it to look (to a certain level) and just enjoy playing with other people.

The bad?  The driving mechanics are all over the place, cannot grow ANYTHING except for livestock (other farming sims exist that allows for both livestock and crops btw), you are starting off with almost nothing, you can almost get nothing based on which day of the week has a special for you.  You spend more time running back and forth to the gas station than actually building up anything, playing in single player does not allow for a revival (you have to wait for one of your friends who don't have the game to join you just to revive you) all the POI's are spread out way too far (why does it take an hour in game to go to a feed store, and there is no road to connect to the gate at the hardware store?) there is currently 0 mods to help this game expand and become more fun.

If you love to work for game play, then this game will have that covered for you, especially after a long day (or night) of working at your real job.  You will have the most fun just struggling to get that $30 bag of feed per day, and if you are starting out, then you are just simply screwed!

If you want to play another farming simulation game, I would suggest to not come to this one for the time being.  Maybe come back to the game once it is out of Early Access.

REVISE 1; So, I've managed to get further, animals die within 12 hours in game time if they are not fed, and the well is a HUGE WASTE of time!  You have to ""manually"" crank that by having your mouse rotate in BIG, SLOW circles.  Not many people have the space for that!  I have to use a pillow to even attempt that!  Also been trying to figure out how to use the grinder and (like everything else you buy) there is no guide in how to use the grinder.  You just feed it meat, and the meat falls to the ground.  Forever lost.  I may bump this up to a 1.5 star if there was a small tutorial or guide to use the items that you buy (minus the food since that is self-explanatory).  Still a fairly bad game, more so when you have such rediculous tasks like ""CRANK THE WELL"".  Just have me press WASD to crank the well wheel!  It would at least be a mini game in the game and hold some level of fun instead of friends fighting on who gets the water.",1661976555,1664730131,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. A Perimeter line and the option to craft the log fences for it.

3. Items for inside the house, kitchen counters, cabinets, dining table,  chairs, couch, lamps, wall art. ...etc
4. The ability to level the ground. Maybe using a shovel?

Not only can you buy and raise animals but you can also put your factory simulation skills to the test and create your own efficient pig death machine! That's right, the ability to stream line the production of things like sausage and cheese in a factory setting while simultaneously raising a ranch can now be yours.

I desperately want to give this game a positive review. The game itself has a lot of fun features. I was happy to see that farming animals is not the only way to make money. The quests have a lot of potential in the future, and to my surprise for an early access game it performed exceedingly well! 

However.. the advertised multiplayer which is built on Epic Online Services is atrocious. The game asks you to sign in every time you visit the main menu which is annoying but can be avoided. The biggest blocker for me is that my entire friend group including myself were not able to play together. The session based multiplayer is broken, and after following the FAQ guidelines, and discussing this with the support team in Discord there was no resolution. I told them I'm going to hang up the game for now until it's hopefully more developed down the line. Good luck to anyone else, this is a fun game and it has a bright future.

[UPDATE]
After having a handful of helpful conversations with the Ranch Sim team I was able to sort out my multiplayer issues. It seemed like the fix was a combination of walking through the provided FAQ and some tinkering on my own side.

TLDR; Solved issues with help from the Ranch Sim team, completely recommend this game even in it's current state. It's insanely fun, and the team pushes frequent updates.",1660432703,1662994194,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,True

I'm talking a consistent 15fps, 20 if I'm lucky (which doesn't change if you turn down your graphics to nothing). We killed most of the pigs but still didn't help. Even then you still have to make a cow farm, a chicken farm and a goat farm. So there's really no way to get good fps if you want to make an actual farm.

1. The ability to neuter animals. Specifically pigs. They get totally out of hand. LOL

2. Snap points to easily stack or load stuff with a keyboard key to switch to manual placement. 

3. Stop the animals from all gunning for the gate when you open it or at least add a delay so you have time to close the gate ;-)

4. Fix multiplayer issues such as animals visible for one person but not the other (i.e. animal no longer in that spot but still visible) and not seeing cut grass when joining a friend.

1. Larger map. 
2. Change/add quests. 
3. Hotkey items instead of using the option wheel. Use 1 thru 9 or ability to.
4. I read crops are coming, so yes yes yes add crops.
5. Eating and drinking or starve and dehydrate to death.
6. Make the tent removable.
7. Fix unloading firearms when you load a game.

3) If you want to play the beehive update, you best spend several days hunting for bees prior to buying animals for the ranch, or you will have to neglect the care of the ranch to hunt for the bees
4) To assist with the previous issue, it would be nice to hire some hands to help with the ranch
5) The ability to breed and sell horses instead of just training them which is tedious and boring

-Unreliable multiplayer.  Half the players couldn't connect (some couldn't start game) due to multiple issues
-players falling through the world
-vehicles and tools lost because they randomly shoot into space or fall into the world, with no way to recover or reset them
-Animals just randomly die (even when fully fed/watered etc.)
-vehicle steering is hilariously bad and frustrating
-camera while driving will induce seizures if you decide to go down a hill
-gun play is extremely awkward.  Close range targets often result in the character shooting the ground or itself regardless of targeting.

It is fun to build in this game, it's fun to hunt in this game, it's fun to have animals and have the money you make actually make sense, the pricing in this game is awesome they did a great job with that, visually it's a very beautiful game. I really want to love this game bc it's such a good concept, and im hoping by the time everything is finished it will be amazing. however things I think need to be improved upon as someone who grew up on a ranch;

There needs to be tack for the horses, that comes off and is stored in a horse trailer or a tack shed, hitching posts for horses, the ability to take off the saddle, the ability to take down the jumps in the round pen (ranching has really nothing to do with hunter jumper as that is an english designated riding style NOT a western one.), Roping practice, the Ability to start horses from the bottom when they have low stats, putting pack saddles on, lunging, grooming horses, ground work, using your horse to gather livestock, drag calves to branding etc. Ability to have more than one horse and breed them and sell babies and papered and non papered horses with different stats, The auction house should give you the ability to purchase different animals not just horses and get good prices for culls out of your herd, there should be a fall shipment, a semi comes and you load your calves and lambs on it for the fall and depending on the year get different money for them per head. I can't stand how small the cattle are, the herefords are tiny, in reality those are 1500 lb cows, I know bc we own them lol they are far from small. There is no chute to work cows, no cedirs to get them all on the same ovulation to put them out with the bull, etc, no vaccines, no cows that need calves pulled, you cant band male calves to make them steeers. also Herefords are not milk breeds, they are a meat only breed, Jersey's are milk breeds and can produce several gallons a day. The florida cracker that looks like it was based off a Holstein would be a better model for a dairy breed as theyre built like a dairy breed. 

Domestic pigs largely use farrowing crates to have babies other wise they kill them, either by eating them or smashing them, breeds like the Kune Kune which are hairy are breeds that can farrow in the field.

I'd love the addition of dogs, Livestock Guardian dogs that you train to stay with the animals and kill wolves and fox that could come onto your property and kill your animals. Cattle and sheep dog breeds for gathering animals with cues you can use to push them places like up to upper pastures, etc.

Ducks, quail, phesant, turkey would be welcomed but im not too bothered by just the chickens i think theyre done well and the fact they just lay eggs anywhere is so realistic, the roos get mean, etc. the only thing I would add is ask to add in a blue egger, you could use the brown chickens to lay blue eggs as Cream Legbars, then a simple egg genetics would be awesome, Blue + white = baby who lays blue, blue + tan = baby who lays green, white + tan = tan, etc blue is dominant in all eggs and that's true to real life, it would be a fun addition, but again doesn't break me. I would like the ability to sell chicks and hatching eggs per dozen for a different price, you could ship them out through mail or just at the general store. 

Fairs would be awesome. 

Crops which I know are coming, I just hope it wont be just wheat and corn bc you really need grass hays, Brome, Orchard, Timothy, and Alfalfa and the ability to do large and small bales, bale feeders, etc. 

The way you sit on the horse is so weird also, its incorrect posture and the horses run more like how dogs run.

I'd love to be able to cook also but that one really wouldnt bother me if it never came into the game.

I know that sounds like a lot but those are things that would launch this game into being more realistic and an actual competitor to Farm Simulator.

All in All, if I ignore all of that I can  usually sit and play this for a few days straight then hang it up, It's a pretty relaxed game with fun things like animals attacking you that makes it enjoyable.

Definitely needs more stuff on it and things to do, once i have all my animals, and the auto feeder, waterpump, and milker. i just notice all im doing is putting milk in pans and putting them into a cupboard (For cheese), and mincing meat for sausage. 

Needs more Variety. so i hope the Crop update gives us something.

Also needs a way to show the Gender of baby animals, i have over 100 Pigs because they give birth to groups between 2-6 and cant get to the males or females in time before they Breed. I only started off with 2 pigs.

Cars Flying through the air crashing into everything and glitching out like we are in HELL! This only happens to visitors that join the a game, Internet connection is wired with over 700MBps and 30MBps upload on both the Host and Visitor so its not an internet issue, Tried swapping save game file to visitors computer so they can host the game and still same issues every time! We lost a UTV with $1000 worth of product that just flew in the air and never came back, never re-spawned on our farm which i thought was apart of a past update... This game is practically unplayable in multiplayer still!!! Also this game is getting soooooo boring! even with all these tiny updates i still have no goals other than buying more animals or building a house, there is nothing new or fun to buy, all the vehicles are boring, bland, hardly customizable. You cant do anything but turn lights on and off in a house, The animals still glitch in and out of their fencing/barns and are like zombies always trying to run out when i open a gate or door.. The NPCs are sooooo useless as they only sit there and do nothing but look at you which makes this world feel so lonely.. This game is lacking sooooooo much content and for being in beta over a year already is disturbing, this game is still no where near a beta release! I've played over 140 hours of this game waiting and waiting for some good content and major game overhauls to get this where it should be by now. Please hire some more Devs or something because its going to be another year + until I even think about playing this game with enjoyment. Please PLEASE MAKE THIS GAME BETTER IT HAS SOOOOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL!!!!

My criticism/feedback would be that in-game information feels lacking.  Three of my chickens died despite food and water.  I assume I didn't clean their coop enough, but I have no way of knowing the tolerance for this; there's a food and water bar but not a poop-hygiene one, for example.
This also includes not knowing the cost/benefit of various livestock options.  I don't know how much the different products sell for so it's trial and error.

I dont play multiplayer.
Yes it can be repetitive and a little glitchy, but it is what you make of it and the glitches can be funny. 
Don't know why i seem to be a deer magnet?! 
The only glitches i have is the inability to open and shut gates without pressing it twice, and i have a door that i can walk through without opening. (As i found out when Sausage the pig escaped) 
Love the fact its very hands on, you want to build a fence? Go cut down a tree, carry the log, cut the log, pick up the planks, carry the planks. I have completely rebuilt my ranch a number of times and its getting bigger and better. 
Only thing i dislike are the horses, and i'm a horsey person. The glowing yellow eyes, the fact you cant do anything with them but ride and whats with the tack on when not being ridden. Horses in fields running round with saddles on, urgh. 
At the moment (i hear its coming later this year) there are no crops, this is a milk/cheese, meat/sausage/meatballs and egg making game, although you don't have to do any of that you can just raise pigs for meat which i believe is the fastest way to make money.

 carrying a bunch of supplies we had just bought.  The player was able to log out and get back in, but the cart and supplies were gone.

Understanding it's early access, we tried to find a workaround, like console commands to regain the items, but found none.  There also seems to be only 1 save slot, so we can't go to an earlier save.   So we're stuck with a game where you're supposed to earn money and buy items... yet you can lose them to a glitch at any moment and have no way to get them back.  That makes it pointless to even play, and early access or not, that's not acceptable.

Be it from revamping the layout or seeing how high I can make my cash stores, trying new tips and tricks on how to be more efficient as a single player with (often far too many animals because I forget to thin the herd) to actually produce things like sausage, meatballs, cheese. So while it's my cuppa because I like things I can just meander around on. There are pros and cons to everything.

Pros: 
* The devs are great about keeping to their road map and as a whole listening to the community and what they want from the game.
*Plenty of space- Grandpa left you a massive piece of land that actually goes back farther than you think for building.
*Variety of activities and animals with more constantly being developed!
*Solo playable - It's all about your managing the time and now with the feature to extend the day light hours and make the time tick by slower in game, you can achieve a lot more.
* If you like simulators or farming games then you will love this game, it has it all and the ability to make everything kinda custom to you building and vehicle wise between free build and colorization makes a world of difference. So if you are a builder or someone that loves animals ( Just remember you -do- have to kill some of them though) this is a good one for you. Side note if you are a horse lover and just like plodding along on a beautiful beastie, well that's another plus.

Cons:
*Sometimes there are bugs (As you know, early access and beta and new games usually have) Usually the bugs are small and easily patch fixed. The devs are good about staying on top of it. It's only a con because there -are- some bugs that appear. Most of the bugs are rather harmless though and more annoying than game breaking. 
*It is semi grindy. ONLY when it comes to 12 pieces of meat in a cooler x 4 million pigs and 22-26 pieces of meat per pig lol. So like most simulation or survival games, you will have to grind and in the very beginnings with the small amounts of money that you get? It can be a bit stressful, but I promise once you get past the first time it's a breeze and there are tons of tips and tricks  to make it seem less grindy.
*Rain for days. I only put this as a con because there is no way to limit the amount of rain storms you get. Seeing as they plan on implementing planting and harvesting etc, the rain being gone or turned off would be a bad thing, but limiting the amount of times a day you're getting drenched and/or the scenary is so  dark you have to mess with the gamma just to not use the headlamp would be amazing to see changed.

Other than that I would say, if you are looking for a game that kinda gives you an all around ranch experience that you are able to add your own twist on.. This is the one to try. Plus you can always join the discord and find ranch hands, I'm just selective when it comes to gaming with others.

Something like a wheelbarrow so you transport more than one wheat bag, plank stack on foot 

The ability to separate metal like with wooden planks so you’re not running back and forth with stacks of 2 

The ability to load livestock young in to vehicles

That being said, there are a LOT, and I mean,  A LOT of glitches that break the game.  Some of the glitches make it fun, others make this game unplayable.  Maybe in the future if they fix more of the problems I could recommend it, but right now I cannot, in my right mind, recommend this game.

Funnier glitches: Your car won't break...  That being said, you can literally drive a car up a cliff-side if you're talented enough.  That was hilariously fun.
Trailers in multiplayer for the person not hosting the game might flip around like crazy.
Cars in multiplayer have the chance of bucking around.
Cows (haven't seen other animals) have the chance at nighttime to float around with their eyes closed

Game breaking glitches that make the game unplayable:
Gate Doors meant for foundation houses don't work the way they are supposed to work.  One of them you can phase through, so can your animals.  Don't use the gate doors ever for a custom barn house.  (Seriously, unless you want to lose your cows/pigs/chickens because they phased through a door, DO NOT do it.)
Sometimes getting hit by a car in the game will shunt you 300-500 meters away from where you were hit.  This is bad.
The bullets are slow enough that if you run at the thing you are chasing, sometimes you can kill yourself BY COMPLETE ACCIDENT'.
You cannot reset a quest or abort a quest despite there being a button for it.
In multiplayer if you stand too close to a trailer or car that has a filled up back end, you start dealing with a 'yoyo effect' where you bounce off the vehicle over and over again.

----
Pros: Hilarious glitches.
If you're into that sort of thing, it's easy to earn money in the game.
The building system is easy and intuitive to use. You can even lay down your own blueprint.
The game is overall promising, it just needs more polishing.

Cons: With some of the glitches being as bad as they are, the game is not very playable for long.
You can earn money too fast, leaving you with nothing to do except grind more meat, dry it, and make more money.  This is boring.
You can't abort a quest with the current issues with the game.
You can repeat special quests over and over again and make more money than what you can feasibly spend it on.
(I can repeat the Ancient Treasures over and over again and make a solid 2.5k as often as I desire).

If they fix the glitches and make it harder to earn money, or even make it so things you buy have a higher value, then this game might be quite the gem.  Right now, I can only hope they address a lot of these bugs, in the meantime, I cannot recommend this game.",1657854444,1657854444,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 1. It is definitely easier to play with more than one person. That way as your ranch grows it easier to manage. Instead of only having that world available to the one person who invites everyone, once they join the game you should make that world available on their end as well. That way they can do everything you can. I.E. save the game, go to auction etc. just as you can. 
2. Breeding horses! I would love, love, love that. 
3. Being able to have a farm of some sort so you can make your own grains to feed animals/ cook with.  
4. GTFO with these deer man.... make them walk instead of just jumping everywhere. It can be fun to see sometimes but just not all the time.
5. Possibly making the vehicles easier to manage as well. Its either stop or go no in-between.

Short Version: buy this game as it recieves consistent updates and is already in a finished level of gameplay. Less bugs than most 1.0 games and quality game play. 

Now for TLDR version: this game is incredibly fun in it's current state. You start with little money and there is some grind involved (though not too bad and is fun to grind). You build up your Grandfather's dilapidated farm and make it your own. The devs have added free building to go with their very quality pre fabricated buildings. You can now build the ranch buildings of your dreams for the most part including houses and barns amongst others. The animal breeding is quite fun as watching your ranch grow from one hen and one rooster to 40 chickens and 27 pigs along with 18 cows is extremely rewarding. Also you earn the most of your money by using animal products to make milk, cheese, and meat products to sell. This is also an enjoyable process. They have also added a quest system that is fun and engaging. These are a good way to earn some money early game. I can't wait for the September update with agriculture too! Seriously, buy this as you won't be disappointed. For gameplay vids I recommend checking out GameEdged videos on YouTube. 

To surmise: very few to no bugs, fun gameplay loop, replayability is there, multiplayer capable (I haven't tried personally), easy 50+ hours playtime  though can definitely be into the hundreds of hours as they continue adding multiple things. I personally have 200+ hours as most is played offline. I rate games on a dollar per hour basis so 10/10.
Take care and enjoy this masterpiece!",1657587233,1657587233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, I still recommend it. I really love the idea that they're putting out there and I know it's not a farming simulator, but I think it'd be cool to have crops still since there's unfortunately not too much that can be done. This could also just be due to it being in EA and that's fine too.

However, I think it's too early to be in EA. I spent 2.6 hours on this game and finished everything that could essentially be done. Added with what the other reviewers are saying-it's good bones but it's just that. Bones.

Additionally, I spent so much time gathering resources for a house and I can't even decorate the house? It comes fully furnished which was utterly depressing. I assumed I could build my house myself and/or if I bought blue prints for one, I could build my furniture and and paint it however I desired, etc.

One of the first 'quests' you do is to demolish a dilapidated house that was left for you however to demolish it you need to start from the roof and work down 3 storeys destroying Light fixture > Wall paper> Sheet panelling > Wall frame, 4 different clicks for one wall frame. It takes about 15-20 minutes to remove the full house.

Next the buildings require say *200* wooden planks, you have to pick each individual wooden plank up and put it in the right spot on the building, however you can't path through them once they're placed. 

Might be more fun with other players but as a solo player there's just very little reward.

Is it because you can glitch the physics engine and launch ATVs to the moon? If so a dev should build a game based off of that because clearly it garners interest.

Anyway, to sum this game up you spend an hour finishing the annoying tutorial and then building a pen to hold your pigs. Aaaand that's it, you're basically done, congrats. The game becomes a waiting simulator. 

Pigs are the most profitable thing to breed, and once you realize that it makes the rest of the light content useless.

Why build chickens when I can just put those resources into more pigs? Therefore all those chicken coop buildings? Yup don't need to touch any of those.

Same with cows. I mean I guess you could breed cows... and milk them... for fun... but money wise it's pigs pigs pigs. 

At the end of the day what this leaves you with is the choice of managing a progressively larger fence filled with pigs, or messing with chickens or cows for less pay than you'd get managing pigs. 

It's such a weird design choice. Where's the rest of the content? Why can't I grow crops to feed my animals with? And if I use higher quality crops that I did a good job growing, it bolsters the stats and value of my animals? Why are pigs an inherently more profitable animal than chickens or cows? Aren't all equally important and therefore valuable ultimately?

Why can't I show my animals at a weekly or monthly ""showing"" of the biggest cows or pigs or whatever in the neighborhood?

Why can't I skin animals and salt the skins and sell those? Where's the tannery mechanics?

A great game. There are some glitches here and there in early access but overall amazing. I would maybe add a bit more to the story and a bigger map with more characters...maybe if your friends could have separate farms on the same ''server'' would be cool too.

往後有做更新修復後再來重新做評價

新手教學給得很足沒有什麼大問題
問題就是都已經上市一年多了bug還是一樣多
車子開到一半突然掉地圖外車子還無法召回，前期車子沒了只能選擇再花一小時從頭再來
和朋友露營睡覺起床也被瞬移到異地，莫名其妙
對於這遊戲原價台幣300多元真的有些偏貴

希望製作團隊能夠去重視修復一下bug，否則就是越玩越新累
修完之後再來去想怎麼去擴建其他遊戲玩法
而且商店都離得太遠了...(聽說原本還更遠)

如果這些BUG都修復完畢我再來改好評...


以下GOOGLE機翻，希望開發人員能看到：

Give a negative review for now
I will re-evaluate after updating and repairing in the future.

The novice teaching is very good, there is no big problem
The problem is that it has been on the market for more than a year, and the bugs are still the same.
The car suddenly falls off the map halfway through and the car cannot be recalled. If the car is gone in the early stage, I can only choose to spend another hour to start over.
Camping with friends, sleeping and getting up, and being teleported to another place, inexplicably
For this game, the original price of more than 300 Taiwan dollars is really a bit expensive

I hope the production team can pay attention to fixing bugs, otherwise, the more you play, the more tired you will be
After the repair, I will think about how to expand other gameplay
And the stores are too far away... (I heard it was even further away)

If these bugs are fixed, I'll give another review...",1656184356,1656184567,False,1,0,0.483322709798812866,0,True,False,True

If you took all the jankiest elements from the current champions of jank - Gold Rush: The Game, The Infected, Subsistence, etc and cobbled them together, you'd have this game.

Some of the gameplay mechanics are just comically bad. Some examples (by no means exhaustive):

- To use the well you need to rotate your mouse about in huge circles to turn the crank instead of just pressing a key.
- When you're driving downhill the camera will inexplicably pan behind you.
- When you contain animals in a barn/pen as soon as you open a door they all bolt like you opened the door and threw in a flashbang.
- Driving a vehicle in general is farcical. It really has to be seen to be believed.
- The world is utterly empty, the only people you'll come across are 5 or so static NPCs sat in chairs.
- Animals to hunt are far too rare, and their spawn/respawn are unreliable and buggy.
- Chicken farming is utterly broken. Not only do they eat more food than pigs, their products are near worthless.
- Everything is a chore. Get in a car, press F to start it. Why not just have it auto start? I'm never going to just sit in the car to listen to the radio. Maybe realism lol? Ok then why does the generator on the table saw auto-start when I refuel it?
- Vehicles move like they're stuck in mud, forget gentle movements to slowly reverse to connect a trailer, it's all stop or all go.
- Parts of the UI are garbage. E.g. Picking up planks is the same button as dropping planks, and the same button as picking up the table saw. So unless you click precisely picking up planks will turn into a pick up/drop loop and picking up the table saw.
- Constructed elements can't be moved, only destroyed, and you get back maybe 15-20% of the resources.
- Saving your game is laughable, you can only save at ""save points"" in the world like a 90s super nintendo game.
- No ability to pause the game.
- Night is way too dark, car lights are way too bright.
- Your initial golf cart buggy can store more items than the large pickup truck as the wheel arches in the pickup prevent you placing stuff near them.
- Storing fuel cans on the roof rack of your pickup truck prevent you from transporting livestock in the back.

However, despite all this ultra jank it's still a kind of fun game, I think because the core game loop is engaging. It's kind of like how a really bad film might be entertaining, because it's funny bad.

This game is to PC gaming like Clayton Prince's ""Black Ninja"" is to movies.",1655051062,1655051062,False,43,16,0.6210518479347229,0,True,False,True

However thats probably because Ranch and farm are the same in Wales and not the same in NA. So if you think you are going to actually be working a ranch, herding cattle and working them, using horse back and training horses to do more then jump a set of hurdles, well like me you will be sadly mistaken and feel misled by the title. You can buy beef cattle from a general store as opposed to a sale barn or auction which the game needs both. It has horse auction. The next update you can grow wheat and harvest that so again far more farm then ranch as the only crop would be hay really. However the game has a ton and mean a ton of potential. It offers the ability to build your own and not just use prefab so thats nice, Has some quest that are goofy but and a little fun. The hunting is a nice change and a welcomed one. You can have some fun with the game this far as i got on the sale and have gotten my moneys worth out of it by doing a little pvp with my friends and silly  stuff. If you are part of the working cowboy life then i wont recommend this to you as a ranch sim but a farm style game i will!!

Chickens eat WAY too much for real life type or even in game, hard to keep alive in beginning. 2. Fruit trees????? Love to see them. 3. Paths and Roads that we could make on the farm. 4. Horses: they are awesome btw, thanks to whomever suggested and got them in game. I think they should KICK, BUCK, REAR and the ability to take SADDLE OFF and lead like rest of animals, hard to have more and would LOVE LOVE LOVE to breed them and have PAINTS/ APPALOOSAs  5. TREATS???? would love to be able to give all animals a treat of some sort. 

6. DEER......Ummm NO NO NO NO NO sorry but that is not the way deer act at all....please calm them down n not frolick??? wow maybe was supposed to be a JOKE? lol 

Now, I have seen all my suggestions in other games, so I do know they are DOABLE and I know that you talented people were/are able to make the animals have a thinking of some sort to try to get out of pens n such so AI is doable as well, maybe affection towards their human???? Im not sure on that really but the whistle doesn't work 100% for me rn. I think if yall were able to add my suggestions plus I heard you are adding in gardens n tractors possibly and fields of some sort like the one farm on here.....YOU COULD HAVE the ULTIMATE RANCH/FARM game of the year!!!!!  I have sooooo many hours of play into Medieval Dynasty and I suggested a few things to them, but I think you could even get me totally on this game instead if just a few of my suggestions were to make this game. I have not read many suggestions so I apologize to anyone who may have suggested same as here or to the game makers I apologize for taking up your time to just additionals but this game could out do THE SIMS 4 even imo....except the stupid stuff imo of vampires and weird stuff lol. Don't add that.

Love the character customization, I wish they had more options for makeup, hairstyles and clothes, but I get that the look of your farmer isnt a priority. Other fun things they could add- I would love to be able to name my animals. I realize thats a farming thing, you dont name food, but I am very fond of my pigs and I call them Herb and Myrtle and it would be cool if I could enter that in. If you're looking for realistic, you should also add a Vet and vaccines and pregnancy checks and such. Guessing isnt as fun... Also, it would be nice if you actually incorperated actual breeds, instead of just ""This is a pig. This is a cow. This is a chicken.""  Maybe include a little information about each breed? I would love an option for sheep or milking goats. I would love to be able to choose my breed.  Variety is nice. Maybe an exotics option, such as game animals or the ability to cross breed. I would love a hobby farm option, maybe include rabbits and smaller breeds, such as a Kune Kune/Miniature horses?  You guys need to tweak the fence building so its more like building walls, the fences dont click right and its really frustrating.  Driving. Oh my gosh. That needs some fixing. The controls are too fine tuned until they glitch, any time you pick up speed you go off the road and crash into things, its very clunky and needs work. All in all? This game is awesome. Without all these things that could be improved, its hours of immersive game play and building and I really enjoy it so far. Not to a point where I think its worth 20 bucks...  It's certainly no Farming Simulator. I got it on sale for 15, otherwise I wouldnt have bought it. But its getting there.

But in this case I had to go ahead and leave a positive review because of the contact I had with the publishing team.  I encountered a small bug (item stuck in the back of the UTV) and shot the publishing team an email to let them know.  In less than 12 hours they had fixed the issue, sent back a corrected save file and were courteous and professional.  Again, I've played enough EA titles to know this is certainly not always the case; sometimes the team just doesn't have time to respond quickly and sometimes the dev/publishing team is just nearly hostile to the community.  So I really appreciate the attentiveness and interaction that this team has with it's growing community.

Regarding the game itself, I nabbed it on sale for around $16USD after the May 2022 content update and it's completely worth the price tag with the content available so far.  Some highlights of things I enjoy:
- The building mechanic and list of available parts (both prefabs and custom) were more extensive than I thought it would be and the snapping system works well.
- The graphics are lovely; from the animal models to your own character; the buildings, the landscape, etc.  Watching a sunset from the front porch of my farmhouse is so relaxing!
- Animal husbandry is rewarding; I love seeing chicks and piglets being born!  The feeding/watering mechanic is straight forward and not tedious.  I have gotten stuck a time or two milking my cows but it's easy enough to wiggle out of the barn wall, lol.  I've only just started getting into horses but that's been fun as well so far.
- Driving.  I hated driving at first since I felt like a hit a tree every 5 seconds.  But now that I've gotten used to the way the UTV handles and once I realized there was no penalty for hitting every other tree now I feel like my vehicle is a Skyrim horse, able to scale mountains and take me anywhere I want to go!  Need to get down the mountain from the hunter cabin quick?  Just gun the engines, jump a rock and soar your way majestically down in a physics defying tumble to land in front of the general store.  *chef's kiss*  Completely unrealistic but 100% fun.
- Questing: they aren't the most creative quests I've ever run in a video game, but it's nice to have a bit of extra cash flow in the early game and grabbing that rabbit by the scruff for the hunter is so cathartic for me, who fights to keep real rabbits out of my vegetable garden.  I wish nabbing them was that easy!

And since no game is perfect, I have some things I'd like to see changed/fixed/implemented:
- EDIT: I previously stated the hunting system was unbalanced in comparison to ranch products; I've reversed that statement now that I have a healthy amount of animals on the ranch (I experienced pig-splosion!).  The wild game is still a bit easy to shoot in my opinion though.
- If you save your game with bullets still loaded in your gun, you lose those rounds on a re-load.  Not a big deal since bullets are cheap but annoying enough to notice.  Also the reload speed is a tad slow.
- I'd love to see the option to actually pause on a single player game.  I have a 5 year old and when I have to go afk it's annoying to not be able to pause the game, especially with the disappearing bullet issue mentioned above.  Hopefully they add that down the line!


Overall if you like chill games that let you build, keep livestock, and explore beautiful landscapes pick up this title; I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Especially with the additional content they have on the roadmap!",1654087793,1654175565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The character design option was very misleading, because once you start the game, it's as if you're going from high tech trailer mode into almost a 2D version of gameplay; your character sort of 'jogs' when walking, and sprints like a maniac when running.  The graphics are lacking and appear to be a very basic layout from a generic online generator.  The photos of the game are not in any way even close to what the actual game looks like (even on default settings), and night time is so dark that it's almost impossible to see anything, which I almost believe might be intentional so you have to literally wait 2 hours until daytime so you can continue, then you can't refund the game.

The whole game revolves around meat and cheese. There is little else to do. You can do limited building but is hindered by a lot that is wrong. The grind that you face leads you to reach an end game of a better home, chicken coop, or vehicle. That's it, and then you have this nice stuff but are now left in this hollow world. It has nice mountains, that's about it. There are barely any shops or NPCs at all for that matter. 

Pros
-Nice mountains
-Decent character creation

Cons
-Lack of content
-VERY SMALL MAP
-Animal AI is awful
-Weapon animation/sound is cheap
-Most of the UI and models feel like it's in a purchasable package (classic early access release and abandon feelings here)
-No story (not really a big deal but there is no depth in this game)
-No farming
-The mechanics are super janky when it comes to loading items
-bugs galore

If this is the kind of game you are looking into, I'd recommend farming simulator 22 or 19. If you just want a better hunting game, try theHunter: Call of the Wild. 

Not sure how this game ended up in the very positive unless over half of these reviews are dudes just high out their minds and need brainless grinding and filling in their imagination with the rest.

If I can have a television and there is a refrigerator in the house, why can I not use the refrigerator or purchase additional ones in which to store meat and dairy products? As it is, I'm working with 6 hand-held coolers to store my meat. A few things I'd like to see in future updates: more sound effects and music (the game is way too quiet), some ability to grow my own food including animal feed, additional and more unique farm animals such as alpacas, sheep, dogs, and better instructions.  I went through three table saws before I realized the orange status bar was not a wear/use measurement but was for gas. Yeah, there's a message that comes up when the gas runs out.  But I didn't want my table saw to cop out on me in the middle of a project so at first I wasn't letting it completely run down before selling it back to the shop. There also needs to be a place (like the sink) to fill up those loogli water coolers, or at least tell us somewhere that the water will run out.  My pig died because it ran out of water and I had to read a Forum to figure out why the water stopped refilling.",1651868700,1651868700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One of my favorite things about this game is its developers, they consistently are updating and responding to anybody who has issues, with a nice update road map to be able to track all future updates it makes you want to grind to stay ahead of the curve.

tips for players: reduce number of animals to reduce lag, calm down when driving to avoid bouncing into a tree, do the quests! they are fun and a good way to get started. keep a cool head the game might look easy at first, but with some time managing and good teamwork you can easily make it work, Good luck!",1651535623,1651535623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Speaking of which, the fact I can rear, no not rear stop it, bring my animals up, visit the coop after 8pm when they're fast asleep to clean up the poo, feed & water the troughs & then steal the eggs to use my ovoscope to determine which eggs are fertilised, and which eggs to put into my sausage salami mix. Brilliant. Pigs get SO phat, all that extra meat all I'll need is some more tomato sauce in the kitchen. Building is very 'structured', simple but effective.

Or something. But I digress. Want to build an abattoir and use stun guns, pistol or rifle to kill that big rooster that has served his purpose? That big phat hog that can barely walk anymore? Well, now you can. Hunt deer, wolves and bears? Yes you can. Now, a few negatives. Last night I collected 51 pieces of 'wild meat' from the aforementioned animals. I can sell it, yes. Why can't I cook it? Use it as feed for my pigs? They'll eat anything. Also, the constant storms. Way over the top, if I wanted to listen to rain, thunder & lightning all day and night I'd go to Blackpool. Or Wales. Maybe. One last gripe, there's so much to do, but I get 12 minutes of daylight per 'day'? Come now, this isn't GTA Online, this is Ranch SIMULATOR. Give me an option to turn off storms that works, the current option isn't an option. That works.

 First of I'm going to talk about the things I love in the game, and then I'm going to talk about things I don't like in the game.

- The game is very successful as a farm life simulator and as a construction game.
- It's not just a farm game, it has some missions, npcs and venues in it. And there are things like car and home customization in the game, as well as hunting mechanics. 
- Co-op gameplay is very enjoyable and there are no big bugs in the game.
- Game is  still evolving, and its producer is paying attention to the feedbacks. 

 So about the negative things 
- Co-op requires epic games account.
- Can be laggy sometimes.
- Animations are not very polished.
- The mechanics of driving might be better it's little bad. And you are immortal when you are driving a car. It's just feels weird.
- It's hard to manage the economy at the start of the game. The game gives you 2 options as you grind for meat or wait for the eggs, milk etc.",1650655861,1650655966,True,28,1,0.738152205944061279,1,True,False,True

A couple of things need improvement: I read another comment with the same issue about the driving controls. The car swerves really far to the left and to the right when you only click a little. It's really hard to control and keep on the road. Especially rounding corners. 
Another thing is that when given a task or trying to do a self lead task, there is no direction or help on how to achieve it.

i cant tell you how manny times i have flipped mu vehicles but boy was it funny, thankfully its easy to flip back over.
would love more clothes and hair.

some basic fixes like i had a trailer i bought spawn on the roof so i had to save up and buy another one since i couldnt get it, now it reminds me of my wasted money as i drive by XD
did at one time my friend was in the starting car at night got out and was teleported a ways away, made for a tense trip back but she and the car were fine, it didnt happen again,

Needs slightly wider roads, and a much more realistic parking lot, fix the roxs and the line thickness please.

When demolishing, have it drop some supplies back, maybe not the rotting wood like the original house but like a newly built chicken coop shouldn't just disappear. Or when picking up poured grains, maybe have it return half a sack or something.. Maybe have a job where the rotten metal or wood or something has to be thrown out or scrapped for cash or burned to get rid of it.

Also please fix the pricing, why is the trailer $2,100 while actual vehicles like Pick Up and SUV are cheaper?

Make stars at night to make the night brighter.

If I am selling an item i just bought, I should sell it back for the same price. Like I bought a bucket (speaking of which, why are there 2 similar steel buckets and a wooden bucket for the same price?) for $8 and then sold it a minute later for $4, not fair, didn't use it, didn't take it off the store property.

Add pets.

More NPCs to make it like a lively town for solos, fun little interactions, etc. Maybe customers that want eggs or meat from us? And maybe other cars on the road or something.

More materials like brick or something. Also add a pick axe so we can use the stones to make brick structures or something along those lines.

Also as an alternative to just putting a plank or whatever into a blueprint, maybe an option where we have to build each individual wall, like putting nails and screws, measuring and cutting, and whatever else is required to build a house if we are too lazy or too bored of just cutting logs and placing planks.

Add fishing.

Maybe add flashlight to be purchase instead of it being part of the person, also have the batteries run out and to be purchased from the store possibly?

Also have the option of electric wood saws and maybe have a thing where we have to buy an extension cord and connect it from the house or generator. Speaking of which have a choice of us buying and installing light fixtures in case we want to build a shed or garage or something.

Add a edit pavement feature for players so the drive way to the ranch isn't curved and can make small roads on the ranch itself maybe.

The ranch name sign should be more revealing and more exposed so players can know about it.

More realistic stores.

That said, I just came off of a Stardew Valley high and went hunting for something more realistic. I love Stardew, don't get me wrong, but I wanted something to expand upon that idea. I had looked into Medieval Dynasty and Farmer's Dynasty (which I hesitate to get either because I would want to create my own character), bought Farming Simulator 22 and promptly got it refunded because it wasn't what I was looking for, and tried replaying the lovely My Time at Portia. Something was still missing, and I found this gem of a game. It had an open world, livestock, stores, and so much potential.
And that's the key word, potential.

[b]The open world feels empty. [/b] Besides the 2-3 quest givers and the shop owners, this world feels almost post-apocalyptic. It doesn't feel particularly lived-in, and I'm a little sad I can't go have a burger at the burger shop. Who is the guy serving? Where are the customers? Can I have the two trays of food if no one else is coming in?
I like how this game approaches building by giving you a set number of objects to craft in order to make walls, fences, coops, etc, but [b]it feels so tedious chopping wood and buying metal/concrete[/b]. I spent quite a while trying to find an axe for mining, and a cement mixer or a furnace to make those objects before realizing I just had to buy them. Which, considering I'm in the early game, is impossible for me since I only have $45 now. It also takes me out of the immersion just slightly, but not enough to say it's jarring.
I haven't encountered any bugs other than some clipping errors when I go into the small farmhouse and when placing blueprints, but I consider those minor and they don't detract from the experience.
[b]The tutorial under-prepared me[/b]. I had no idea horses were even in the game until I looked into discussions, I didn't know what else to do after demolishing my house, and I still feel lost in the world

I want to praise the developers for the [b]stunning visuals and the little details[/b], like the radio, the gas station (just the entire gas station, I love individually filling my ATV and the jerrycan separately!), the little details in the houses, everything that lets you appreciate the game. The quests are fun even though I've only done two so far, and I hope to see more of them.

The game needs more content true, but it's cheap and they are slowly but surely adding more to flesh it out, this is a slow burner, but I've already had enough fun in this game to justify the price, anymore is a bonus.

Some refinement of the animals behaviour is needed, we need more predators in the game, there needs to be some kind of end game that can continue indefinitely and the usual aspects of ranch farming that are not yet in the game.

tl;dr -- It has annoying mechanics that won't fully manifest for hours, and once you get to them it becomes worse than a grind. It just sucks the fun right out of the game.

1.) The animals, once you get to that point, will run (I mean they bolt) for any open gate or door they can find. IT's like their entire purpose is to just run away as soon as they can. This is not representative of domestic animals, especially cows. They will tell you something about double gates or whatever, but the animals become incredibly difficult to deal with because you spend the entire day trying to get them to cooperate. Which leads me to the next problem...

2.) A second in real life is a minute in the game. That means for every 1 minute real time an hour in game passes. This makes a full 24 hour cycle, 24 real minutes. Which is too fast. You will spend most of that 24 minutes fighting your animals. I should be fair and note that if you want to slaughter them, it's a lot easier to do that, as you just enclose them, feed them, then shoot them No need to chase them down, dead animals don't run ... 

3.) The ability to slow down time and pause has been ""high on their list"" for _months_ and it is still not there. They continue to say it has something to do with multiplayer. Fair enough. A simple check to see if a person is connected to a server and if not, enable the ability to modify time or at the very least PAUSE. I know that pausing will not break a single player game because I use process explore to suspend the process .. and it causes zero issues for me. 

4.) The driving is ... absurd. You get kind of used to it, but the fact that they have an option to ""flip vehicle"" is because you will eventually lose control and flip the car over and then have to flip it back. 

5.) The flash light and headlights are way too bright. In fact the lighting in general is kind of off too dark for indoor lamps and too bright for headlights / flashlights

6.) I hope you like living in rain. Because it rains ALL THE TIME. Short of monsoon seasons I can't think of any place on earth that rains  every single day. Thurnderstorms, mind you. Again it's another one of those ""it is on our list"" but I can't imagine it would be too difficult to dial down the chances of a storm. 

7.) The devs are active in the forums, which is nice, but I have begun to get the impression that they really don't care what any of us think. They seem to like their game the way it is so they just say ""it's high on our list"" then follow it up with ""whenever we get to it"" ... uhm ... no. It's either high on the list which means they would have addressed it after 8 months or it's not really on their list. 

8.) The vehicles you can get used to, the rain is another thing that you get used to. The issue becomes simply the ability to manage the animals -- other than just shooting them and making sausages -- combined with everything else just becomes too much at a point for me. 

9.) There is no auto save option. You have to remember to do it and since you will spend so much time trying to move a cow to a milking area, it is very easy to forget and have a couple of hours real time go by and no save so if it crashes .... 

All of this, for me, just becomes too much soI decided to move on.",1648955134,1648955402,False,3,0,0.550416052341461182,0,True,False,True

Pros: 
Concept is amazing, though with limited access to the game, there is still a decent amount of content.
Building is very basic and easy to get along with.
Raising chickens, pigs, cows, etc, is very satisfying, can be difficult at first but smooth once you have the rythm

Cons:
The money making system is a bit difficult and you may feel the need to be on a tight, consistent grind
Hunting/Combat is bland and boring. Stealth doesn't really exist especially when 80% of lined up shots miss. You go from stumbling upon an animal to chasing it through the woods like skyrim. (Add on) The new rifle is good but I have no idea where it is pointing while aiming

Overall opinion/review:
Very basic, fun game, but still needs polish. High hopes for this. I love this game so much for only being out for about a month of early access, I am excited for more and new content for this game and look forward to it's future.

This sim captures the atmosphere of the country and the never ending and ever-growing task list of country living perfectly. Those who think raising a bunch of animals is easy or peaceful likely haven't done it. And this game captures the stresses in a fantastic way.

From the tedious amounts of resources to build something most games treat as trivial to never having enough money and every animal's tendency to go where you least want them to go at the worst time. It is fantastic.

Then there is the addition of things like coolers for storing several meat products at once, it strikes a great balance between realism and simulation. 

Overall, fantastic game with a fantastic future, the feel of this sim is just so good.

If you like a pretty mellow game where you can simulate building a ranch from basically nothing, then you'll like this. It combines some realism that you'd find in games like farming simulator with some quality of life simplification (you don't have to do every single step every single time).",1648664238,1648664238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The issue at the moment is that it is very empty and bare bones, but that is to be expected this early on. After the tutorial there isn't much to do except breed animals, hunt, and sell, which again isn't bad but it gets boring after a while. I'm excited to see what this game has in store in future updates! :)
April Update: 
Since the April update there is much more to do, it is still quite a bit about hunting for money but the update has added lots of cool new features! :)
June Update:
I'm playing on the unstable build at the minute and the update add a lot it is super fun! The ability to build your own house is such a fun idea (I haven't done it yet but I plan to), being able to build your buildings anywhere on your ranch is also a really good update, it's much more fun to play when you can put buildings where you want. The updated graphics/ map is also very nice. :)
March 2022 Update:
The update so far is really fun, although the port to epic games has made it more difficult to play multiplayer, my partner left and then couldn't rejoin, we figured out that you have to be connected to epic games and be online on epic games for it to work, for us anyway. That's not so bad but in game it specifically says you don't have to connect to epic to play together but you do, my partner didn't have a session ID until he connected which is why he couldn't join me.",1619468372,1648567240,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,True

I believe one planned update is some farming too so that you can grow your own feed. That would be awesome as the drive to get feed is too expensive and takes too long. On ranch I always had a feed store nearby which was nice even if we grew our own feed because it had the hardware supplies etc.too. My last ranch I was on was actually about 10% ranch and 90% farm in terms of area as we had 10,000 acres of farmland on the ranch but also over 30,000 acres of leased farmland around the county we farmed. Even 30 years ago the farming part made over $1M profit after taxes and subtracting the feed for our own few thousand cattle. Plus we had free honey since allowed a beekeeper to use a little land in exchange for a few hundred pounds of honey per year. This is a fantastic deal from a small developer. For those making videos, it would be nice if someone made video guide showing solo play. All of the best videos seem to be cooperative play and don't help a lot for a solo player although they are mostly good videos.

I have had this on my wishlist since the day it was added to Steam I think. I grew up on ranches mostly. So far I love this.

The game has been constantly improved and has a new large update that came out several months ago. It expanded the ranch lands. Added a hardware store. Enabled building any building anywhere and more! Great small developers.

Give it a go for $25 full price or less when on sale. If you don't like it or want to wait longer before parting with the money then refund it and get it after more EA has passed or on full release. If you refund then keep it on your follow or wishlist so that you get updates.",1614904015,1648330943,True,23,3,0.72734302282333374,0,True,False,True

Had a bear inside the hardware store so i couldnt go shopping till i killed it or waited for it to move out. Had a medium sized chicken coop and put the food/water trays inside till i built a fence around it and most of my chickens would ""get stuck"" and die because they cant seem to figure out how to walk around the board to go up in it. once you get to having a few sets of pigs they just breed like crazy and it makes it like you have tons of stuff to do like cooking all the meat or hanging it to dry. I didnt realise that the Burger place in front of the place you can buy vehicles actually had a sell spot in the back and that it gives boosted prices on certain items each day. Would of loved to know that sooner. Once i restarted i was able to get the game going better and kept myself busy cannot wait on more things to be released for the game like quests to do.

this is a fun game, and am enjoying it.

Things that would improve it are
- The ability to get a loan so that you can get the animal need to earn a living
- getting resources when you demolish things.
- more information in the glossary about the way things are supposed to work
- ability to sell vehicles and equipment when you upgrade them. 
- vehicles easier to drive

Until they listen to the players and back off the storms, I can not recommend this game. I do enjoy the game during the 5 or so min of nice weather per hour of playing.  However having to run the game with no sound is not enjoyable. From the start players have complained about the amount of rain and now winter wind storms. Instead of making it better the devs appear to take great delight in making us deaf, the amount of storms increases each update. Yes you can turn off lighting but the rain/snow storms are still loud. The saw noise is understandable, IRL you must protect your ears so turning sound down then is no big deal. However until you can play this game more the 15 min without a headache I do not recommend it. If you check the discussions there are many comments about rain. This can be a great game everything is fun EXCEPT the pounding rain giving a headache every time you play.

Money is  slow coming, but given enough time I'm sure I'll have more than I can spend. My only real complaints are about the poor lighting design, lack of bank features, and a few glitches.. There's no indoor lighting in any of the buildings. The house you build has electricity to work the TV, but no indoor lights. It makes zero sense. Store buildings are pitch black when it gets dark. There's no ability to build outdoor light around your ranch so that you can see to get back to your house or even keep working. Being able to actually use the Bank for a loan wouldn't hurt either. Selling 6 eggs a day isn't paying the bills. The only glitchy thing I've come across so far is that logs randomly disappear right after chopping a tree down or meat disappearing after processing an animal. I look forward to the progress that can be made and features that they'll add.

I have discovered the lights within the home buildings, there are light switches. The store buildings still need lighting, but not a huge issue.

Repetitively chop and slice wood half with slow machines (the best one is still slow, and you have to do each and EVERY SINGLE LOG, time after time) or ""tend"" to chickens (press e every 2 or so in-game days). Train Horses, or feed and kill cows (you can milk them too) and pigs. 

A LOT of potential, but so goddamn boring as-is. It needs a lot of work, and I hope they can be honest to themselves with that fact, and keep this in development for a long while still. 18-24 months is not going to cut it at all the way things are going. Nearly a year in Early Access and... This? This is it? I don't even know how to get the damned rifle they tease, instead shooting the ""massive"" 3 types of game with a revolver. They don't tell you how to get better, of course. 

There is a short tutorial that count as 11 quests. Takes all-in-all maybe 15-20 minutes. Then boom. No more quests. At all. Just your flavor of tedium. I've had more fun shoveling IRL shit than playing this game. Most of my playtime by far is just waiting for some stupid fucking wooden planks to saw in half. Good God just work on the game. This is worth maybe $5, and it's $25 goddamn dollars?! Check out how many tested, true fantastic games you can get for $25 on here. What a rip-off. 

You can build in this game, requiring planks, metal and concrete. Metal is a fortune and can only be bought, concrete is cheaper, can only be bought. You can make planks but it is so tedious that it is hardly worth it. Some items require 100s of planks IIRC and you get 2 at a time sawing a log that you have to manually drag into the machine. Then you wait 10 excruciating seconds in the fastest machine to get them. The slower one is more like an honest-to-God real-life minute for 2 lousy planks. 

I'm keeping this in my library, because I do believe it will be good - one day - but with how it is currently, by the end of development, this better be Oblivion-tier gaming, or else it was a rip-off indeed.

Immediate Edit: Update for Rifle and some more quests coming on the 24th (of March?!) rifle is advertised, yet not in the damn game yet, taking a year for a rifle. Whoopee.",1645566057,1645566259,False,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

At the time of this review, there is no controller support. I play on a gaming laptop while laying on my livingroom couch and half watching old Markiplier videos (don't judge, it's how I unwind). Mouse and wasd is kinda awkward.
The dynamic weather is a little too dynamic. Maybe it's just a bug, but it always rains at night, and rains or snows at least once a day.

Pros: Very realistic, money is tight, keep at it - eggs and deer meat, slaughter the whole zone if you can!! Forces you to learn time management (day/night) like a real rancher would.

I like how the prices change for selling your stuff at the burger joint. You can make some good money, almost twice what the general store offers. Sooo much easier on you when you get the windmill (refills all water bins) and granary built btw (refills all food troughs).

I saw it had good reviews and wanted to give it a try. The tutorial was nice and simple, but problems become obvious very quickly. The controls are very clunky, the vehicles don't have any weight to them, the map is empty and feels like it was drawn on a top down display. You're suppose to be a resourceful ranch owner, but the only building resource you can get is wood, and demolishing things doesn't return any amount of resources. Since early game you're waiting on farms to become useful you're stuck with hunting to gain money and it's really repetitive with no challenge. Night time is utter darkness and will have to navigate by hovering over objects just to get in bed. Want to build a barn? Well you're limited by the terrain as there is no terrain manipulation. 

If you want a game for taking care of livestock and building a ranch around that just get Farming Simulator. I would wait a year and see if the devs are still working on this game.",1644771671,1644771671,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

There are criticisms (Feb., 12th, 2022 review date) though:  

The game has fair amount of 'asset flip' in it, many of which I recognize from other games I play!  Hopefully those will be replaced in the future w/o breaking the game.
The game play loop is fun, but you really can't fail as there are no costs beyond asset purchases to it just takes time to 'win' as it were.  The economy & risk is, essentially, non-existent. 
The vehicles really steer poorly.  

It's definitely not any where near the complexity of 'Farming Simulator.'

In short, it's lightweight fun.  If you're looking to run your complex, multi-million dollar farming complex...  This ain't it.  If you're looking to have some fun and play an enjoyable, albeit lightweight, ranching simulator at a fair price, you can't go wrong with this game.

I've given it a thumbs up, but not listing the pros for now, only areas which I believe should be prioritized imo:

#1 Low hanging fruit: The game desperately needs some ambience sound FX like birds, wind etc. It's not gonna be a simulation in the end so atmosphere will be paramount. Our group actually played bird songs with Alexa in order to have some amience. Check out Hunter Call of the Wild for inspiration.

Also:
- Vehicle handling is just awful..the Quad is next to unusable
- there is no walk function, just run and sprint. Kills atmosphere a bit.
- trees are one-hitted independent of size. Seems like a deliberately decision but a few more hits would help with the atmosphere and sense of satisfaction.
- footsteps are always the same sound, no matter the surface.
- It should be possible to sit on furniture.
- The rooster should go ""COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO"" :)

Big Pro: The character generation is great.",1644173715,1644173715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Watching my friends have a shoot-out
- Coming back from being AFK to see all three of my friends laying on the ground unconscious from shooting each other
- Watching my friend fly off to space in his car
- Getting jump scared by a bear
- That one friend that ran around chopping down ALL the trees (not tryna name anyone.. JAMES)

Don't get me wrong, I became addicted to building my ranch but I equally got frustrated quickly over the clunky controls and the emptiness of the world and the lack of info in the store in regards to using tools.
I spent 5 minutes trying to put deer meat through my meat grinder, but apparently you can't use it for wild game. No where anywhere does it say this.   Finding eggs is hard, they're so small and get lost in the grass. Having to pick up tiny chicken poops piece by piece? tedious, and when your character pivots their stance or a hen walks in your way you have to TRY AGAIN. HOLD E TO REMOVE. 
Demolishing things you've built should give you at least some materials back. Reloading your gun takes an eternity when it actually happens. If you have your gun in your hands you can't get in your vehicle until you unequip it, this killed me MULTIPLE times.  I'd love to see more customisation for the ranch itself. Decorations, paint for buildings, flower beds, maybe some birds in the sky? A large map, with a huge empty lake, insanely fast deer, bears and wolves that don't give you any sort of skin or pelt when you hunt them. I also made almost an hour or progress and the game crashed and I lost it, twice. yes, twice. save often. 
I'm aware it's a work in progress, I'm extremely excited to see where it goes. As it stands it doesn't really feel worth 30$, but as it improves or when it goes on sale I recommend it to people who love mindless, grindy games like farming sim.

However, it is a good alternative to FS19 you don't get quite the same ""build mode"", but who likes mundane, you do need to remember an access code in order to pick up where you left off, but this appears to be temporary as it is still an Early Acess Game. UPDATE( 1/19/22 ): So my biggest complaints are to do with how the game is advertised and the actual gameplay itself. We all know there are variations when it comes to marketing and actual programming, but there are a few things I would clarify to those considering this game as a viable future purchase. It is more of a homestead than a ""Ranch"" you aren't quite getting the ""in town"" gameplay. As mentioned before it has qualities similar to FS where a farm may actually be right in the middle of a suburb, this is a ranch and the whole purpose of the inherited home is to destroy it. Sucks, but an interesting way to give a tutorial all the same. My critique at this point for future updates would be; Better character customization, we all have a basic look, but it's hard to roleplay or simulate when your character is wearing a t-shirt and sneakers, second give us different options than a simple start to finish (yes I realize this is still pre-realease), Sandbox please I learn more from sandbox than a tutorial.",1642530891,1642633868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's super early access right now, you can tell within the first few days that there's a lot of work yet to be done. But despite that, it is REALLY fun. I got about 20 hours of gameplay with two friends, the other 13 hours were just me having fun and relaxing. It's a really great game to relax in, just go through the motions of caring for your animals, it's really nice.
I'd recommend playing with a group, as things are a lot more fun with friends, and it doesn't seem too balanced for singleplayer yet. It's difficult to manage everything with just one person.
I hope in the future there would be some more QoL features and maybe some upgrades to horses, specifically. Killing a meat producing animal and having to manually pick up each individual piece of meat is horrible, then having to process that piece by piece, it gets old. I found the cows to be the most fun to care for, milking is a lot more fun than picking up thirty pieces of meat.
Additionally, the horses were kind of disappointing. They're super expensive to work up towards, but hold no real practical value. And training them is just riding for hours and jumping over the same two jumps. They can't carry anything on their back, and you can't shoot off their back either. It'd be nice if they were practical to take hunting, or small errand trips, or something. Right now, they're just very time intensive things. They cost more than a car, and can do way less. I haven't managed to sell one yet because the time it takes to train them is really bothersome.

Despite all that, this game has super potential! Especially being a multiplayer ranch game. I'm really excited to see what the devs do in the future and what all is brought to the table, and I super look forward to an eventual horse overhaul!",1642550992,1642550992,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

NPC that you can hire to perform certain tasks and they get paid daily from your money.
Automatons so you can automate your production like automatic egg collection of course they will be much more expensive like 50k so there is a way to spent your money and evolve.

Pros:
* the tutorial is a fair introduction into the absolute basic things you can do, BUT you will have to figure out everything else out on your own
* starts you off with quests, so that you have direction
* some RL mechanics for the animals, but none for the rancher
* seem to be able to farm wood from anywhere on the map
* aside from some awkward moments where clicking did not pick up items, there are so far very few bugs
* buildings don't appear to take damage over time or from weather effects
* character is fairly customizable... though like, but why?
* game is in early access right now, so there may be more in the works.

Cons:
* the tutorial ends abruptly after it has you demolish a building, which for some people might be fine, but there are advanced mechanics I would have liked to have learned about through a quest line. I prefer a little guidance, which is why I don't play sim games often. 
* animals die seemingly without cause and not certain how to avoid that. only a couple of days in, despite having a coop and fence built, water and food in the trough.
* have no idea how to make chicks hatch, even though I bought a rooster. the hens don't seem particularly motherly, and there is no plan for nests or heat lamps.
* driving is controlled by both the mouse and the keyboard. at the same time.
* endless winter for me. would be nice to be able to choose climate maps at start.
* basic plans for barn require metal... and I have no idea where to get that because the tutorial doesn't cover it and I haven't seen a pickaxe for sale
* demo takes FOREVER because each little piece has to be broken down in a specific order. tedious.
* can't repair anything already on the ranch, and you don't recover any materials when you demo something.
* can't move your built items like fences and coops. only option is to demolish, which also doesn't recover any materials
* custom building pieces are limited and very few blueprints. not much styling options, either, just paint.
* no minimap for driving, nor overhead map for planning ranch out
* bird feed bag is wildly expensive and you will go through it faster than you can recover costs.
* too hard to get going. I wanted to build and sim and play with a ranch, not play a weird survival game where I often can't sell anything fast enough to replenish my stock or feed anything.

Overall, I'm sad to say this game wasn't for me. But again, I don't like open-ended simulator games. I need at least a small amount of direction (which the tutorial gave perfectly with a generic 'do this, repair that' quest line) throughout the game to keep myself busy. I already have to organize and prioritize my workload to an exhausting degree in my real life. No way I'm going to enjoy a game that makes me keep doing that when I'm supposed to be having fun and chilling out. And for a building game, I just expected a bit more ease to grow the ranch. That said, it is in early access, so perhaps people like me will find there is more to guide them at full release.",1641796432,1642352521,False,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,True

Obviously, with cons I must list pros. The quality is amazing and I'm sure for people who are inclines to farmer-styled games will adore it.

But for those similiar to me (who prefer games that are quicker to whizz through, don't take a while to build things, etc.) may not enjoy it as much>

I would still reccomend this game though as it is still great how you are able to build your very own ranch, raise your animals, tend to them and protect your farm, but for those plagued with impatience like me the building may be a bit tedious.",1642286786,1642286786,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,True

Played about 40 hours to have everything done, from having 100k$ to all cars, built every possible thing from my own house to a garage for all the cars, 4 barns for all the animals etc
Overall really relaxing game, can spend hours at a time playing it.
Love the building plank per plank mecanic, really satisfying
Driving is actually fun, sometimes buggy as when hitting a rock too hard (hate the rocks on the road to get to our farm) or when using the trailer
Discovered in my last 5 hours you can't swin but you can drive in the lake and when you get too far you get TP at the farm, that was hilarious

Some details for the devs : 
Sometimes reloading takes a long time to start
Placing fences can be frustrating, when trying to line it up or to connect two building with the wrong distance
Placing things in the trunk can be frustrting, as the rotation doesn,'t allow things to be precisely places and the axis can be different when the car moves.
Also, in multiplayer people don't always have the same placing / rotation axis
When building houses, if you place it not on the right angle you won't be able to place tables/stuff correctly, it won't ever line up (OCD is killing me)
There was only the 1600$ pickup truck that required to remove the brake before driving, dunno if it's normal
IT GETS LAGGY, i have a i5-10000k something and a 1070, the more you place down thing, and the more details, the laggier it gets. I don't regret making my own house last, it gets almost unplayable for the friend joining (I have an ok-ish fiber connecion)
Not being able to move things we place down, like the cheese and sausage stockage (when moving houses it gets expesive)
and / or not getting anything back while removing stuff, like a third / half the buildong cost of the said object 

Hopes for the next update : 
More car customisation, like wheels, bi-colours, and maybe add a level of dirtiness to the cars ? The more you drive the dirtiest it gets and we can have a power washer to clean it or go to the garage?
More seasons, only winter can be funkilling especially when during a storm and you can't see/hear a thing (and upping the gama makes the lights horrible)
A ""farming"" aspect, maybe ? It might be less ranch but growing some crops for the sausages or cheese, some herbs, and hence adding a lot more cooking
The ability to build anywhere, we wanted to zone out the road and we couldn't place fences so we kept going the wrong way
Oh and the built-in lights (i.e. houses) are horrendous, the one you can make are much better

unless the deers who ping pong your trucks over the map when they ran into them, i didnt had any bugs or so.

i ended up with 50+ chickens, 40ish pigs and some cows. loved to the diversity of not only selling meat but being able to make meatballs, sausages and even make your own cheese.

when i got 40+ pigs my fps dropped insane from 85+ to 25/30  when i looked at them it was also hard to manage them because the reproduce was insanly.

i would have loved to see some more animals like the goats and sheeps.
maybe in the future.

also i like to see being able to grow my own crops to sell or make feed for my animals.
and a total summary of all the animals i had in my farm would be nice.

if u like simulation games and about farming i can really recommend this game for you.

A realistic depiction of ranch life with immersive graphics and animations, as well as functions.

You are free to build all over a large ranch with the goals of the next projects completion driving you onwards. You start off real slow with some basic chickens but things start to escalate once you get your first few pigs, get into meat processing, then on to cows ect. 

Its worth mentioning that the multiplayer is perfectly implimented outside of some network glitches that can cause a dysynch after some time of playing on the same session.

The only issue with the game is its optimization when animals start to populate - which as you might of guessed - is sort of the point of having a ranch. I had 144 fps at the start but once we get several structures erected and around 30-40 chickens the game thinks 20-30 fps is fine on higher end machines with medium graphics on.

There are plenty of simulator games out there but this is the a better one. Now is this better than one of those farming/rpg games that have been popular in the last few years? In all honesty probably not, the animal interactions are essentially none other than move them for transport. Its strictly buisness, which some might like. Hopefully as the game develops we will see it evolve, god bless this ranch oh mighty.

A. I got this game about a week and a half ago and I don't even know what it looks like without the snow. Since weather doesn't really have an affect on anything, you should really let players decide what they feel like experiencing in every given moment. This was a nice idea but seriously you guys are getting so much negative feedback on it - Don't do that again :-)
B. I've fenced the entire farm like I imaging many others did - I'd like an electric automatic gate to be installed at the entrance or even a big wooden one. Right now If I want to build one I have to use the simple wooden one I use with the fences I build. I don't want to give up on the big arch.
C. There’s no such thing as a farm without a livestock guardian dog. Such dog could be released with the animals, guard them and make sure nothing comes near. If you want to go even further, have also shepherd dogs who lead the animals back to the barn when told to.
D. Horses should definitely have a breeding system. They are very cool. Also will be cool if we can take off their saddle. 
E. Seriously the whole empty town with no NPCs creeps anyone out at some point. Not to mention the Zombie lady sitting at the desk in the general store without moving. 
F. I’d push a little more recovery time for mothers in the farm before they get pregnant again. I’d even consider having some method for deciding a female will not get pregnant for now, like some kind of a birth control for when you don’t really want to separate males from females.  
G. Chickens who have fertile eggs should just sit on them. It’s tiring picking up eggs and checking them out not to mention how annoying it is when the mothers attack you and won’t let go. 
H. Is there a way for me to just allow other players to enter the farm? It’s getting lonely out there 😊

Thanks for a great game, can’t wait to see what you do next

It gets boring pretty fast at the stage it's at right now, which I get it's still early access and an early build which is why I'm not being hard on it and would sooner just sit on it for now and wait for more content. Some minor bugs here and there including getting flung the hell around if im standing in the wrong place while closing a coop door or flipping my car back over. But let me tell you that is prime entertainment for my friends to watch when I'm streaming it to them. Hopefully the chickens get a sleep animation soon because it's a little creepy looking in there and seeing that they've completely frozen in place during the night because apparently they're sleeping. The house really has no point to it yet. Do not build it. You really don't need it probably. It's just heavy on resources for no use aside from looks.

Implement a single player mode maybe. No matter if you're playing alone or with others, you can't pause the game. Now, if I'm playing alone, I would like the option to get up and go afk for a while without the risk of letting a day pass because my game doesn't pause since the esc menu behaves like I was in multiplayer with others. 

The only big thing I have a gripe with is that price tag. While it's still in early access and really not offering a lot, I don't think it should be regularly priced at 24.99. It has potential as a simulator-cost game eventually when it has more to offer, but right now it's not exactly the 25 USD type of fulfilling and mind-numbingly distracting gameplay I'm usually oddly willing to pay to have in simulator games.

Don't crash, and don't die unexpectedly because when you do, your progress will be gone.  You can save yourself a little bit of a head ache by purchasing an air mattress, which you can take anywhere and use anytime, but it goes in the back of your truck instead of just being a feature that allows you to press a simple button to save.  To me, it's clunky design.

When you purchase items at the store they show up on the ground outside and you have to put it all in the back of your truck, things like ammo, which are VERY small compared to anything else you buy can be hard to spot, and honestly should just end up on your character after buying.  Everything else I was happy to put into my truck myself, but the ammo is just silly.  

The game is pretty much a hunting simulator after you run out of quests to do in order to keep your chickens fed, and gas in your sawmill and car.  It feels hard to get ahead in single player, and there seems to be a lack of easy to find wildlife in order to keep yourself going.  The animals I found in most abundance were Deer but they are fast, so you end up chasing after them for awhile, and when they die you have to take the pieces of meat ONE BY ONE to your vehicles cooler, WHAT?!  Why not let us carry more back to our cooler, what would be the harm?

The gas and the chicken feed get depleted too fast IMO.  I'm constantly going back and forth to the store and to the gas station for the game to feel like fun and not a chore, at least in single player. 

Snapping building pieces in the game is obnoxious. Enough said here I think.

The store menu items should have info about them when you hover over it with your mouse.

What I'd like to see happen is the wildlife to be more plentiful, more quests to break up the monotony of doing the same tasks over and over again, Better balancing, auto save, better guns and ammo, props and decor items.

It is a simple yet entertaining game that effortlessly draws you in to spending hours upon hours tending to your ranch and slowly building up a nice little empire of wealth. 
 
Character customisation is not a main focus of this game, however there is an adequate range of customisations to select from with regards to the basic physical features. One criticism is that, if the player takes their time with customisation, they face an issue in which the game becomes night despite being in the character creation menu drastically impeding visibility which is not ideal when customising a character's visual appearance. 
 
Despite a good range of vehicles, sadly driveability is poor with regards to vehicle handling. Thankfully vehicles can be reset to their upright position and damage is not a factor within the game at this time. The vehicles, and game mechanics itself allow for a large number of items to be transported even with the smaller vehicles if the player is mindful of placement when stacking. It should be noted that the limit is maintained regardless with animals as these cannot be stacked on one another. 
 
The game offers an average building component to the game, in which there are a number of premade structures to select from as well as the option to create free form buildings. Presently these building are relatively basic, however serve the intended purpose. The premade home structures once completed come fully furnished with interactable items which are a nice addition. Although lighting within the homes could be improved, there is the option to add lights in through the building tool however these are unflattering. Some obstacles were faced when attempting to build, specifically the ability to align and snap fences. As such it is difficult to make these straight and to have these align well with premade structures. 
 
Whilst there are wild animals included within the terrain, these are mostly lacking in not only quantity but variety with long respawn times. From the initial game trailer, it could be presumed the game would include more hunting however this was not the case. It does appear as though this may be an avenue pursued by the game developers, with a building off in the mountains with an NPC surrounded by mounted animal heads and weapons. Currently these are not yet interactable in this building. Whilst players would benefit from more wild animals to hunt in early game play, this would also be an interesting and fun addition to late game play if wild animals occasionally ventured closer to the ranch requiring players to better protect their livestock. 
 
The game includes a range of animals that you can breed and farm for produce such as chickens, pigs, and most recently cows which are either targeted towards being farmed for meat or for the purpose of producing milk. When owning and tending to a variety of these animals, the player is kept busy with a variety of tasks to complete such as tending to the barns/stables, upkeep with food and water supplies, and of course collecting the produce specific to that animal type. A few issues were noted here, firstly it is highly important to keep the animal population (specifically the pigs) at a manageable level. Over population of animals dramatically impedes playability by causing severe frame rate drops and lag. Secondly, all animals within the game appear to be programmed to automatically beeline for the door/barn gate when opened, making it incredibly difficult and frustrating to move animals whilst keeping others in their current barn. Additionally, moving animals around is made further difficult due to collision with other items, specifically other animals. These issues with animal movement are mostly notable with pigs and cows, as chickens can be easily moved and relocated by picking the animal up. 
 
In addition to obtaining produce either through collecting eggs, milking cows or harvesting pigs/cows for meat, the player can further their profits and game play by crafting more advanced food types such as cheese, meatballs, or sausages that can either be sold raw, cooked or as dried salami. The cooking aspect is a nice addition that again allows another component of game play to alternate amongst the other tasks. However, there is no clear indication of recipes per se in regards to the kinds of food you can make. A recipe book would be a great addition to this game to provide clearer direction and options in the available food types that can be crafted. More food options to craft would also be a nice addition, with potential herbs and spices an option to be purchased from the general store. Further to this, it would be interesting to see the game developers include a cooking skill concept within the game, in which the more you craft food, the higher your skill level in this area resulting in a faster crafting time rewarding the progression in this area.
 
Whilst the game runs well a few errors were encountered during game play. There are a few notable movement glitches with the characters, specifically if two characters are getting up from the same bed/sleep location at the same time, causing one to be propelled into the air. Another issue identified with movement is noted within the house, specifically going up and down the stairs causing the character to become stuck in midair, although this is easily fixed or entirely avoided if the character stares directly at the floor when walking down the stairs. The final movement glitch worth mentioning appears to occur when exiting a vehicle prematurely prior to it coming to a complete stop, causing the character to glitch and be propelled into the air often landing one third of the map away from the original location. Now whilst not a glitch, another area for improvement with regards to character movement, is the characters constant desire to swivel when looking left or right. This movement is automated and can be rather frustrating, particularly when trying to be precise with tasks such as collecting eggs or utilising the ovoscope to check fertilisation of eggs. 
 
As a personal preference, whilst almost all of the key bindings were ideal and consistent across other games there were a few that could be improved upon, specifically when handling eggs. When collecting eggs, it is great that as the player you can hold the basket in one hand and hover over an egg on the floor/coup and select 'E' and this will automatically place the egg in the basket. However, it would be equally beneficial to have an option for taking an egg out of the basket. At present the player is required to again hover over an egg in the basket and LMB in order to pick up the highlighted egg. Whilst this is easy and quick with a full basket, this becomes more frustrating the less you have in the basket, often accidentally picking up the basket instead which is also LMB to pick up. As such, it is recommended that the action of picking up an egg from a basket is an entirely different command, and ideally could be key bound to 'Q' to remove from the basket, with 'E' remaining as the current command to place in the basket. 
 
Overall, it should be noted that the game currently remains in early access. The map is relatively bare, however there are a number of scattered buildings across the map that could serve a purpose and become interactable later down the track. As previously stated, there is a current lack in the quantity and variety of wild animals to hunt which could be a focus area to be improved upon. The addition of a recipe book and skill tree with progression benefits would be interesting to see, although more recipes and farm animals to be released should be the priority in order to maintain interest.",1640769293,1640769293,True,44,0,0.823406517505645752,0,True,False,True

Why you should not buy this game?

1. the tutorial is shit, I spend some times trying to figure out how to use water tank. apparently you are supposed to put it on the table..... 
2. Very grinding, it take a lot of times to start getting some money, you need to go hunt in the wild at the start of the game to even make some money. you can meet some deers if you are lucky but they run like being injected with drugs. bears is managable since they are quite big and not so fast, but it is hard to spot one.
3. the damn winter update is mess up, it is hard to find stuff since my ranch is covered in snow. I fenced my chickens and let them run around and when the lie their eggs outside it is hard to spot the eggs. (it is also hard to spot bullets when you bought it in general store.)
4. there is no quest here after you finished with tutorial. it will be nice to have some request from other people so you can make money filling up request.
5. add more npc and more dialogue in it, men these place is so glommy and desolate that it even beat funeral house. the npc just sit their arse down and let the machine do all it jobs for you to buy and sell.
6. you have burger joint but you can't buy a burger? the hell?
7. add newspaper or something so we can see what is the price of products (yes, I am asking for fluctuate market) is raising or fallen.

to conclude my review. you guys better bought other games than this one. at least until they have more updates in the futures.",1640504056,1640504056,False,3,1,0.523502349853515625,0,True,False,True

Tiny map, mostly empty. 
Hunting is .... well, 3 deers, 3wolfes, 3bears somewhere on the map, and when you shoot them it takes (inGame) days to respawn. 2-3 meat is dropping each that  you can sell for a just little money.
Building is very limited. And cost an arm and a leg. (much more then you can make with hunting)
Aminals are diying sometimes without any reason. Amout of food you need is insane. 5 Chicken eat a hole bag of food in 2 days? Selling eggs is not paying for this.
So you just do Tree cuttung and make planks. Over and over again. To make money to build, and buy food for your animals, and rounds for hunting. 
On top of this Lag, Bugs, Glitches. We had it a few times after relog, that our Ammo was gone and aminals where dead or not to found anymore.

The idea is nice, but it needs a LOT work before i would call it a fun game.
It is barly an Alpha with a high frustration level.
I have the feeling that this will be one of the nearly uncounted games here on Steam that never make it out of Early Access. But maybe the Devs will suprize me. 
Untill then: No! Don't buy it! Even on sale it is not worth.

I like the premise of the game and I know that it is still undergoing continuous developments, but there are few things I would like to happen in the game (Since last I played, I haven't played in a while)

1: That the sim you play as have a health bar, so there's some risk involved in actually being hit by animals. Or potential crashing the car. Just in general to create some challenge in hunting and angry hens lol.

2: a larger map with more animals to shoot.

3: the potential to gather other resources would be fun. not a must but would be fun.

There is no use for any other buildings really. The 3 main mats are wooden boards, concrete and metal. The other 2 you have to buy. No farming or mining or crafting. To get money you raise farm animals or hunt. By raise farm animals all you do is clean up their mess, feed and water them and thats after you buy them then sell their by products which is very limited to get money to buy more feed, metal or concrete. By hunting I mean you kill deer, bear or wolves. Thats all. All of which are few to be found and your only weapon is a 6 shooter pistol. The only thing you get from hunting is meat which you then sell for money. You will need it just to pay for the bullets.  Hunting is so limited that you can kill a deer with 2 shots from 1000 yards away (with a pistol)
 if he is standing still. My 10 hours play time could easily be done in 2 hours but I did a lot of exploring and upgrading and building large buildings just hoping to find more things to do or unlock. That never occurred.

You can upgrade saw table, water source, and vehicles but I found no reason to even need to because you can do everything required with the starting equipment.

My original thought before purchasing this game was; it's an open world / building game based on farming. However, going into the game, my assumptions were quickly realized to be false. ""Building"" is essentially, ""cutting"" down trees, which in my opinion is very lame animation, taking said wood to a wood cutting to get wood planks. Carrying those wood planks to said ""Pre-Built"" structure and inserting those pieces of planks into it. Once you had all wood and/or concert, the structure is built. 

The whole ""pre-built"" structure to me, is a big turn-off in games, because it takes away from building creativity. 

This game itself, in the limited amount of time I played, wasn't bad. The controls are extremely weird and janky, but if you're into simulation games, I would recommend this game to you. However, this game just isn't for me.",1637943934,1637943934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It started having a feel to it of 'empty', which is not a good sign for any game to have to it. You'd want to keep them so busy and happy they lose themselves in the game play so much not to have such feelings about it.  I started feeling that playing this was just a 'killing to sell' the meat game. I'd like to see more, as in things like farming, and the like as well and the homes you build being interactable way more then now. Which is mostly just a bed, drying rack and stove. All items are only for looks which is annoying and boring. You do not need to sleep even. The fireplace has no point to it (warming or buffing... so on. Nope, No point. . Just like the rest of the items in it.) chairs you can not use.. T.V. again the same. Art board in the kids room.. same. There needs to be more point to building a house. Also more ways to make the land and home 'yours' like in things to make to place out or on walls that have your personal touch and likes/feelings to express yourself. It would make the game way more fun if there was more to the game and house. There are no buffs or anything like it in the game. No need for eating, warmth, or clothing.. so on. ( I wish it had.) The weather has no effect on the animals or you. The falling dose no damage. Not being able to plant anything is a big let down. Also with all the 'meat' you don't even need to eat it?! This game for me just lacks what is needed to feel right when playing. I have seen many others saying similar thing to this point in their posts and reviews sadly. Please add what we want and need to enjoy this on a more long term bases. It being called a 'Ranch Sim' dose not mean you can't add what rl people world have on a big plot of land. ( a farm of food for exp. (even if it's on a small scale) to eat/possibly selling. Adding it as a food mat for foods to make new recipes or add to old ones to make them even  better. You could even add it to feeders for animals as a possible alternative food source .... you name it.) For me there needs to be more to it and to do for it to work and feel right.  Adding quests btw is still not enough for me. It is still just a killing = cash game if there is not more to it. Personally I am the type that feels the need to honor and thank a animal killed for food, so this bothers me. You know, like Native Americans do. ( I know not all feel the same regarding this point.) I would need more point to this game as a whole, not just watching a baby animal grow up, only to kill it for cash. =/  That is just saddening... not fun game-play.  That in fact is why I stopped playing... for now at least. In life, like in games, there is a need for a purpose to why we do something. A means to meeting a need. What needs do we have here? Why are we sent off to kill for cash ( wild or domesticated livestock ) if not for a purpose for the kill and cash? In rl you hunt to eat. You make money off animals at a ranch to pay bills/rent and pay for your livelihood. So on. There is none of that here. No rent. No upkeep. No need for things for the player. (items like... clothes,meds,food) No needs for the player. Making that cash from the kills of the livestock then have no meanings.. right? No point. You do not eat, or use money other then buying more animals, so then no need for the meat/cheese. The purpose is what drives the game. Where is it, the purpose? That's my question. It is the 'why' we keep playing a game. To move to the next step. I'd comes back to this game again if things change for the better over all. As a whole in things to do and over all fun with some realism.  Again, I did enjoy a lot of the game because I think it had some nice ideas and game mechanics. Just not enough to stay on long term. I am looking forward to it becoming what we have been asking for at some point. Here's to hoping it does.

It's also clearly designed for multiplayer, since playing it by myself often felt lonely and depressing. But still, it hooked me, and I kept coming back. 

Overall, the game mechanics are good. The goal was apparently to design a realistic farming sim, and that's what it is. You build buildings, you raise chickens, pigs, and cows, and if you make enough money at it, you can get a horse at auction. It's sad to see your animals die or decide you have to kill them to make sausage or meatballs and sell that for the money you need for feed (which the pigs, especially, go through very fast), but it feels more ""down to earth"" than most farm sims I've played.

That said, this is basically a Gamma release and 1) is not worth what they are charging in its current form, and 2) shouldnt be on early access in this stage.

Okay so theres bugs..... Its early access, I can deal with bugs, some of them are quite funny. 

However, this game would be better off named 'Stacking Simulator'. Go to forest, cut trees, grab logs one-at-a-time. place in truck bed using poor targeting system, rinse, lather, repeat. Drive home with logs, grab logs one-at-a-time, restack at barn to cut into planks. stack planks, grab stack of planks, .... you get the picture.

The ""free-build"" items are.... lacking .... at best. You can build buildings, but dont build more than 2x wide as the roofs dont stack. Theres walls with holes for windows but no windows. This is a ranch sim, but no barn doors (unless you build the prefab barn...). There are no paths, so I hope you enjoy tall grass.... everywhere. You 'can' buy a lawn mower. It costs as much as a pickup truck, moves slower than walking, removes the tall grass to expose a flat, under-textured ""green"" area, and will use about a 1/2 tank of gas to clear a patch the size of the pickup truck.

The pre-fab buildings are.... buggy. at best. lights stop working, or just have zero impact on being able to see. Rooms are so small you can get stuck in them by opening the door to get out. close the door, move, open it, door sweeps you back to stuck.... cant get up stairs without crouching as youll get stuck on a lamp...

Vehicles are bad at best. The physics are one thing. There is no such thing as straight. You will crash into everything, and everything is a fixed point, including the deer that roam around. The most expensive pickup truck has about as much usable bed space as the gator you get for free when you start the game (and you can haul unlimited weight so....). The only point to buying different vehicles is transporting animals. The SUV is the most useless vehicle in game. Theres literally no storage. You can put a few small items on the roof rack, but you have to jump up there to be able to target the racks, and good luck jumping successfully. Game in and of itself.

Animals have massive 'space cushions'. You have to keep them indoors or else they will wander / wolves will eat them, so you build a big barn, and before you know it, animals are being forced out every time you open the door to add more food. yet when you look around theres plenty of space in the barn still. Yet the animals are ""walking"" but being forced in opposite directions, or just stuck, as there is some invisible buffer for the animals that seems to be 3x larger than the animal itself.

The map is tiny. It seems to be about 1 sq km. Only a small portion of this is your ranch area. Theres only 1 ranch on the map, and they just opened up multi-player, so its either co-op with your friend(s) or play single player (other farming games allow area for multiple ""farms"".  I imagine with a few players, you would quickly run out of buildable area on a map this small.

There are so many, many things that seem so basic for any sim game that are just missing from this game.  The road map for this came has one to two minor changes being added every other month so I doubt this game will ever meet its capabilities. 

Still a fun game, I will still play, but its getting a 4/10 from me with hopes that the Devs will up their game (both literally and figuratively)

As far as the negatives for me personally, I find it frustrating that there is a character customization aspect (with ALL of the colors), but there aren't really any ethnic features or physical features to have people look like themselves. Considering you see your character especially, I think broadening that would be nice. I also had to pause my character customization since it followed the day/night cycle. I would also love to see more decor options-unless that's something unlocked later? I'm still just grinding for money at the moment.

Although, collecting meat, eggs, and milk, and processing all of that can get a little mundane at times, it truly is a game that is headed for stardom. The upgrades the Devs have made so far have been nothing short of spectacular. I would like to see a wheelbarrow for the barn, possibly a shute to put in the barn for putting meat into and shooting it straight out to a pick up point instead of putting the meat in a cooler and carrying it out. This can get cumbersome when you have lots of meat. Possibly upgrades for coolers so they carry more meat would be helpful also. Also, the fences can be a bit of a challenge at times due to the terrain so it would be awesome if there were some more allowances for that. 

Otherwise, this game is awesome and addicting to play. The piglets are super cute as well as the chicks. I can't wait for the cows to be able to have calves as well.

 - freedom to chop down any tree anywhere
 - there isn't any immediate threat of bears on the homestead
 - adding lights and obtaining illumination looks pretty good

Dislikes:
 - the fast consumption of food; i.e. chickens and egg collecting pretty much equals out, if not scrambling to obtain extra cash to obtain feed, between gas consumption costs and all
 - the selling prices. can I PLEASE have today's lumber prices??? One plank would be about 16, not the entire stack of 8 for $16. 8x16 please. Eggs should go for maybe 8-10 each, not the measly 6.
 - not enough 'inheritance' money at the start. A pathetic thousand'ish? At least double it. I had so many things go wrong in the beginning, still on the one game, working it all out...
 - CANNOT for the life of me figure out how to move an item after crafted... all I can do is destroy it and rebuild? Cmon, even the Amish can move a barn. I just want to move a table or something sensible.

Criticism/Things to ADD please:
 - More critters. It's a ranch, there's gotta be more than deer and bear. Squirrels (could run tree to tree, burying things in the ground, eating and possibly helping regrow trees!), rabbits, possums, raccoon, foxes, rats (pests).  ...and I know, it's not RDR2 or Farming Simulator, but some more wildlife would be appreciated.
 - few more guns... all I see is the revolver left in inheritance? Shotgun for bears, rifles for the deer and pests (if considered) and maybe another type of pistol or two.
 - PERKS: There is no leveling system at the moment, maybe there could be, with the selling and/or work done around the homestead? Perks like more wood planks acquired from saws, more meat upon skinning, or even upgrading the vehicles bought; handling, speed, gas consumption, etc.
 - maybe add a chainsaw? 'Insta-log' a tree with one click, chainsaw runs on gas. Why not? You have a lawn mower that is slower than anything and serves no purpose whatsoever, really.
 - AI Farmhand? We buy the feed at the store, set feed in appropriate place and farmhand can feed animals when troughs get empty. Single player or multi, that would be awesome if I didn't have to be SO attentive to the animal feed/water levels. ...maybe in future update, farmhand could be a long distant cousin (haha don't get any ideas ya hillbillies)

This game can be addicting. But for the income earned, it's almost like you even out. I started with a forest, and now have a GIGANTOR field among my homestead... lots of building space, I guess. Most of my wood was my income to get my errors corrected and keep cash flowing in. Pretty soon I'll be deforesting the town...
Not so much a chill game when time is of the essence, or chickens will starve to death.
Still recommend, want to see updates.",1633749269,1633749269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The multiplayer is alright with plenty of lagging, even with good internet speeds. There isn't much in the game in terms of progress. The animations are something you'd expect from an indie game 10 years ago. The driving physics aren't great. I'm not sure if the developers have never used most of the equipment in their life or just don't pay attention to detail. For example, the cheap table saw is gas powered, however it's clearly an electric motor that has a tube running down to a gas can. The saw blade also spins in the wrong direction and would simply kick back anything you're trying to cut. I'm sure they will improve the game throughout the next year but for now it's on par with a 2012 phone game.

* Good gameplay in terms of tasks, management, the actual storyline etc 
* Lots to do 

Cons:
* A LOT of bugs - driving mechanics are so messed up it’s near unplayable. Slightest tap to the left or right and you’re sent flying off the map. 
* The crosshair is so tiny it’s hard to interact with certain things - ie picking up the tiny eggs to put into the basket. 
* It takes so long to reload the revolver I’ve been mauled by bears several times. 
* Shooting mechanics don’t always work either, again thanks to the tiny crosshairs.

If you've ever played one of the ""Farming Simulator"" games, and hoped for a little more than driving tractors, this could possibly be the game you've been waiting for.

Starting out with character creation, you have quite a few options to adjust your looks to set you apart from others who you might play with.  You can adjust most facial features, and even have a few body adjustments.  Clothing options are somewhat lacking, but all the available clothing is stuff you'd expect to find on a ranch.

The introduction to the ranch is really nicely done.  You start with your typical ""grandfather left you a dilapidated farm"" letter, which I was somewhat disappointed with due to the lack of imagination.  Like, why not have the player maybe purchased the ranch at auction or something?  You're then taken around the ranch in a very effective tutorial which quickly teaches you the basics of the game without being monotonous.  From there you assemble a small ATV, which teaches you more basics (picking up, putting down, installing objects, etc) and then you're off to visit the local shops.  There's a gas station, equipment shop, vehicle shop, country store, and a few other shops to acquire your needed items.  You even get to load the purchases into the back of your ATV to drive them back to your ranch.

Upon returning to the ranch you go through some animal husbandry stuff with your new chickens (watch it, animals escape if you don't enclose them inside something) and then you get into demolition and construction.  While the tutorial was fairly through, it left out some very basic things.  For example, I had to figure out for myself how to cut down a tree.  That said, just walking up to the tree told me what I needed to do.

This game really doesn't have the amazing graphics of other titles and camera movement (specifically first person head bobbing) can be a bit annoying.  Third person view is excellent, and can even be shifted from left to right shoulder, but the character movement seems very mechanical.  It doesn't look good.

One of the things I really did like were the color-coded waypoints that coincide with your quest objectives.  It makes it really easy to determine what objectives are where.  Animals are also well done and seem to have personality.  The animals were the high-point of the game.

While I haven't played multiplayer yet, I can well imagine it'll be enjoyable.  It functions by the primary player loading their game, then going to the pause menu (esc) and selecting to invite your friends to your ranch.  This means each person can have their own ranch (game) and you can take turns inviting friends to your ranch to help out.  Either that, or if you want a full co-op ranch you just make sure the same person hosts each time and doesn't play without the others.  It's up to you.  I didn't see an option for a dedicated server, which would allow others to play when you aren't, but it's not really a big drawback since the point of multiplayer is to play with others.

So, right about now, you're probably asking yourself ""why aren't you recommending it?""  Well, even though this game is really early access and there seems to be a direction the developers are taking it, I question it's future.  There are some really important aspects of the game (like farming) which are currently missing.  Before I offer up my recommendation, I'd like to see;

- Some kind of crops, so you don't always have to buy your feed.
- A way to sell crops to the stores.
- A way to edit your world (flattening, tree planting, etc)
- More building & furniture options
- Adjustment for Time of Day (longer/shorter)

That said, I will be keeping an eye on this game to see if there are improvements in the areas I've mentioned.  The game has potential, and I really hope the developers make the best of it.",1630784536,1632435823,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1119730,99849334,76561198427323690,282,4,629,0,458,1643073438,"As someone who likes to take their time, enjoy the game without caring about the newest updates and features, and generally enjoy the atmosphere, this is one of my favorite games currently. I have spent 7 and a half hours:

-Building my house
-Watching my four Chickens
-selling eggs once every 2 or 3 in-game days
-Driving around
-Listening to the radio

And these are all more than enough to make me happy. Farming Simulator and other hardcore sims about rural life just cause me stress, mostly because it feels like you do more tedious work than actual progression/game enjoyment. In Ranch Sim, there's no ""do more work or lose"", or pressure to always have the most amount of money. Want to build your dream house? Just chop cut and place. When you get bored of that, check on your animals. After that, refill your fuel. Or do none of the above, and simply mess around with your friends with the bat-crazy physics. 

Speaking of building, if you ever played FO76 the building is extremely similar. It's simple, clear, and not confusing at all. It is honestly my favorite part of the game. If you haven't played FO76 (I don't blame you), imagine MineCraft but instead of placing a block, you place a blueprint that you fill in at your convenience. No pressure to get it done, and you can plan amazingly far ahead before placing your first plank. Don't want to use wood? Make some money and get metal/concrete! 

And lastly, when you get sick of all the above, the game's music and ambient sounds are beautiful. I have left it running in the background for an hour just to listen to the sounds of the game, it's honestly an experience to relax to.

All that said, yeah there are of course minor issues. 

-Deconstructing anything you build returns no materials
-The radio is minimal
-There aren't a lot of animals roaming (though there are some, just not as many as I'd imagine a scene like that in the game would be there) 
-The customization of items in game are very basic and there isn't a lot of customization depth
-There is a slight content deficit, it is noticeable, but with what's in it right now it does not bother me as there are updates, they just take a while it seems to come out

But I'd lie if I said these aren't nitpicks. I barely think of these things a majority of my game time, and while it would be nice to not have to restart my game after realizing I didn't pay attention to the way the floor I just made faced after already spending the large amount of wood since deconstructing it would simply delete the now spent wood, this is more user error than the game. Not to mention, there's consistent updates and the developers obviously have plans for content, even if it is a LITTLE slow to come out. Still nice to see they don't just leave this game to the dust. 

If you don't like atmospheric-central games that have minimal guidance and leave you to your own devices and to discover what those devices are on your own, this may not be for you. But as someone who wanted a game like farming simulator without feeling that classic ""Why am I spending my time doing it in a game when I could just... go do it?"" This is the answer. It's relaxing, inviting, stressless, and has amazingly funny and fun physics with a beautiful building system.

I don't have the heart to kill the livestock, yes .. even in a game. I'd rather fish and grow food and not have to look at this horrible device in the store. It's quite distressing and in my opinion, desensitizes players, in particular, younger players to these situations.
On the other hand, the wild animals that attack .. I have no problem ending them if my character is cornered.

I cant wait till it has a whole bunch of different kinds of animals and tons of cool building options. cant wait until there are more furniture and decor options for the build your own houses. I like the breeding process, but I wish when the animals health stats come up there was also a way to see their gender and maybe name them? This is silly but I wish I could pet my animals.

It could use some more stores and also like townsfolk. I think this game needs some npc cowboys. You could even consider having some employable npcs to help with the ranch when it starts to get big. I wish their was somewhere like the auction where I could sell me prized farm animals for more if they are like really old and great ones. I want to be able to buy more then just horses at the auction. it would be great to be able to build water features. I really want to be able to plant things both for crops and decoration. it'd be cool to not have to do the tutorial for every new game I start. overall I love this game already, I play it a lot, but I think it will be even better when the Devs are done with it.

As for the people complaining that they can't make money, the money is in the pigs, follow this guide below

Guide: 
1. Purchase a meat grinder and sausage maker
2. Build a couple of the meat drying wardrobes
3. Buy a male and female pig (more the better)
4. Let them keep breeding and growing old and fat (They multiply like crazy)

6. This will make pork sausages (Salami), visit the burger place every morning to check the multipliers, wait until you get x1.9 or x2 multipliers offered for them and then sell them.

With that said, I will also point out at the time of this review its still very early access. This is not a game to be ""won"" in a few hours, it is definitely a grind in the beginning. However, I find it really satisfying when I finally save enough money to buy the next animal I want or the materials I need for my next building. 

The developers are very active about adding more content and updating the game, I'm particularly looking forward to the hunter/farm quests that are planned. There are a few bugs and there's no consequences for collision damage or fall damage. The only thing so far that has really annoyed me, is how much it takes to feed chickens and how little you get in return from them.  I would like it implemented in the future that if you allow them out of their coop, they can satisfy their hunger a portion through that.

Shifting shop prices would be another fun element to eventually implement and the need to eat/drink for your main character. The graphics, in my opinion, are spot on. I can only run them at Medium on my laptop so I can only imagine how gorgeous this is with Epic settings. I haven't yet played this with any friends so the grind to build and make money is real as a single player.

I'll probably update this review when some more updates come out and I have quite a few more hours into it. But as of right now, I highly recommend the game.

I have a lot of things I think would be cool in the game, but I know there's only so much the devs can do at once right now, and am excited for the new roadmap that came out recently (October animal naming, and some stuff with the multiplayer mode, which I wanna play multiplayer but my friends don't have the game, December has a new cow coming with cow breeding for it and fattening of the cow and automilking machine, February has some stuff I can't remember right now). 

At first I struggled, and I wish I dicvoered the coolers sooner, but I didn't, as well as sausage production. But at first I had 2 hens and a rooster, which, died while I was focusing on my barn as I never realized they didn't have enough food. I was broke, but selling the raw chicken and their eggs I had collected I had enough for a single hen. I finished my barn and began selling wooden planks and eventually got my first pig. Then things changed a lot. That pig doubled how much I paid for it and I had enough for 2 pigs, which I've only seen upward progress since then. 

I'm working on building a massive barn, just need to do the stables in it and then light it and build a granary and I plan to use it for horses. I'll probably expand my current one for cows, as I finally got my second cow and had to move my horse to a small pen inside the barn I had made for my chicken originally.",1631366363,1631366363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My only complaints are that I wish there was the ability to breed our horses, a way to differentiate genders in horses, more manes/tail options, more coat colors, and maybe implement a bit more ranch riding in the game .  Although jumping and stuff is fun, I wish they would add different activities in regards to the horses.  Maybe add cow horses, cutting horses, some reining and maybe even some cattle sorting to really give it a more ranch feel.

  I also wish there were more animals to hunt-- maybe even add fishing?  
  The game feels somewhat barebones but it somehow manages to keep me entertained for hours and hours.

Making money seems near impossible. They give you about $1000 and 2 chickens to start out after the tutorial. Selling 6 eggs gets me $24 then food for the chickens cost 30...literally loosing money faster than i can make money. 
The hunting is supposed to be another way to make money however you have to be like 5 feet from the animal to actually get a hit on it. Any farther away and your character seems to just not know how to aim and bullets hit the ground around the animal even when your aiming directly at it and its not moving. After wasting several bullets trying to hunt one deer I had to buy more...I made $45 from the meat. and then had to spend $40 on bullets...only making $5 profit.
Pigs are apparently supposed to be the best way to make money however you have to build a barn and silo and metal for the doors and silo isnt cheap. after building the barn and still taking care of the chickens i have no money to buy metal to build the silo let alone $300 for each pig. the only way I've seen people actually making money in this game is by using a cheat engine.

I was excited for this game and was ready for it to be out of early access. I can say after 7 and a half hours of gameplay, it's still excites me to see the new updates planned. Do I think the game is worth $19.99? At this state, I'd say it's worth maybe $15.99 or $14.99. It's very fun so far but it does feel very empty as of right now. I'd rather wait until the April update of Daily quests and stuff to green light this. But I paid the $19 because I'm impatient and idc, I'm still just chilling with my chickens. This game is not perfect, and still has some bit a ways to go for it to reach its full potential. But the money-managing, farm-sim. Is still an okay game in my book.

Some Bugs I Noticed:
-Even in Drae's games on YT and some people here bring up that the autofeeders and grain silo do not work, and i can say that they do not work for me either and almost cost me an animal
-Deluxe coop does not have an autofeeder, which was disappointing
-Sometimes the deer will not drop after two shots.
-Cow and pigs will get their heads stuck on the side of the barn from the insides
-Sometimes eggs will not drop into the egg drawer in the coop. (I mean the unfertilized ones)
-Another bug as of 3/9/21 my eggs disappeared from my basket after loading the save.

What I Would Love to See in The Game Going Forward
-More cow colors/breeds like the Simmental, Belted Galloway, and the Holstein
-More chicken breeds like Silkie, Plymouth Rock Chicken
-We see more Sheep breeds
-More farm animal breeds in general even if they are just recolours.
- A vehicle marker would be VERY helpful on the map.
-Dogs and cats, cats could remove rodents that eat the grain, and dogs would chase off predators like foxes, bears, and coyotes that kill chickens or steal their eggs.
-We see more predator animals or wildlife like foxes tat sneak into hen houses, eagles that steal chicks, fish.
-We have fishing in a game, fishing is something that could be added to a way to earn money.
-Vehicle damage and better steering controls. With the amount of videos and times I ran into trees maybe some consequence would be you have to repair this vehicle, but the steering needs to be more manageable first.
-Breeding systems for sheep, cows, and horses
-Maybe some type of inventory menu showing the amount of grain you have, meat you found, etc.
-Highway lamps for night (even if they are scarce or spaced out)
-House decoration, remodels.
-Maybe a hen barn, some farms do not have small hutches or outside farms irl, instead they have huge chicken barns to house their animals, They have bedding, nest boxes, sandpits, I'd say check it out, it's pretty cool. Same thing with cows, not all cows live in big red barns, some are on feedlots and in other types of housing.
-Electronic milkers for the cows
-More townspeople, rival farms, more shopkeepers, days where the stores aren't open. People come to your farm to ask favors, buy products directly from you. Make the small area seem more alive.
-This can follow above, but have like a  delivery man to deliver animals you may buy online or deliver quest items to a town over (if you make it so you can't visit the town). 
-Maybe, future DLC maps or a secondary town, I noticed the bridge tunnel and maybe you can travel there to buy another ranch or different animals, or meet more rivals.
-Have deluxe coop (I think that's the one with drawers), be able to allow you to enter and clean the poop.
-Also for the health bar on animals? Get a town vet and have the animals be able to come down with sickness. Did you quarantine your animal in a stall or separate hutch? Well your whole flock/herd got sick. Make sure to buy some medicine

Again this game for me is pretty fun and something I can play to relax if need be. I don't expect everyone to like it, or my review on it and that's cool. I'll update my review as new additions are added and I will change around some things as it comes. Whether you think this price tag is good for early access, that's also up to you, I'd recommend looking at game play before purchasing and  make that decision for yourself. I also know my wants may never come to fruition and that's also fine, I just hope the gameplay becomes more immersive and still continues being fun.

7/10 Overall

Graphics- 8/10 Art Style is realistic and well done. Love was put into the models. That said, its a bit grainy and I cant seem to get above 44ish frames.
Sound- 9/10 Lots of really good music on the radio stations and clear crisp sounds. Would like varied animal noises.
Story- 3/10 Very good introduction. I can see there easily being more than the 10 or so quests that are currently in the game. A few more fetch quests to get money for early game would make early game a LOT more bearable.
Game-play- 8/10 Having both pre-made buildings and the ability to make your own from scratch allows for a lot of creativity without it being too daunting.
Customization- 9/10 Character customization is very in depths besides the small amount of hairstyles. 
Play Time- Solo you can probably do 20 hrs before boredom really sets in. With a group I'd say a lot more.

Ranch Simulator feels generally underpolished, buggy (one of the first bugs you will notice is how badly a car will react physics-wise when hitting a rock. I understand this is a game, but it certainly does not feel realistic.

There is no hunger, no pain, no real NPC dialogue that matters. No story, really. It's essentially just build a farm, bigger and bigger. It seems like this needs to be in alpha longer, even before it is released as early access. Currently the game is worth, to me (and this is honest in comparison to games like house flipper, thief simulator, etc.) around $5. It is certainly not an enjoyable experience personally, but I'll let it be up to you to decide whether or not to spend your money on this frankly underwhelming game (something I do not recommend).

Things I Like:
The Animal AI to return to the coop/barn at night
Checking if chicken eggs are fertilized with the Ovoscope(light)
Hens attacking sometimes when you pick up the eggs
Leading Cows home if you don't have a vehicle to transport them
Milking actually using A and D button presses to milk
The variety of chicken coops
The Character models and movements are great, even though they feel like a pre-made asset store system.

What I DON'T like:
The game looks kind of bad even with a great game engine like Unreal Engine.
No terrain painting, grass stays inside barn.
Map feels low effort, could use more attention instead of just tree and rock brushing.
The UI for the stores, particularly the lack of information on products. Why is there two kinds of metal bucket???
Cows don't Graze. I have a big open pasture for them to wander, so they should eat grass.
Lack of fence variety. I need different fences to use around the farm.
No Farming crops. We should be able to grow/cut our own animal feed.
Just one type of barn, with no alternate options for modular pieces. 
No predators as far as I've seen aside from Bears on the other side of the map. Ranch animals are too Safe.

It can be a great game and the graphics are very good. The realistic weather is cool and the scenery is great. However the balance is off. I understand it is meant to be a simulation but it takes WAY TOO LONG to get anything done, very grindy. To make any kind of money to start you either hunt (very little yield or profit compared to expense) sell eggs (chickens burn through feed like its free so really not worth it) cut trees and make into wood boards (cut a tree, carry 1 log, cut to 2 planks, rinse and repeat) that yields little cash. When you demolish something you do not gain even 1 resource to use towards a new build, that doesn't make sense. I tear things down all the time and reuse what I demo, not all of it but at least 30%. It's a good thing you don't have to eat or drink or you would die all the time because you spend so much time just trying to make $150 only to spend $90 doing it for a profit of $60 to go towards building your ranch up. I like a challenging game but I also do not have 60 hours a week to get a good start. I would wait until more updates come and the devs figure out more balance. Maybe allow some jobs with the abandon surrounding ranches like tearing stuff down or fixing stuff so you can make a bit more cash without expending more resources trying to do so (like people do, ya know). Want to sell sausage or cheese? First you need about $500 to even start that process. Horses are 2500 and a good vehicle is 1600 (realistic but it will take 30 hours of game play to get there).

Ranch Sim at the moment is all about killing every animal you see, then selling their meat. After 16 hours of play my main daily focus is all about the hunting/killing.

I have tried to raise and breed chickens (8) and pigs (2) with my hard earned hunting (blood Money). However, the cost of keeping them watered and fed seems to take all the money I have and I am constantly hunting just to keep the chickens and pigs alive.

As for wanting to building my own dream Ranch house from wood that I have painstakingly gathered from chopping down trees and making into planks. I did this only to find that I can't get any furniture for it! What is the point of an empty house, why did the developers give me the ability to build something I can't live in? Hence why I am still sleeping in the tent I got given at the start of the game.

I can though build/select a house from a build catalogue of template houses. Which do come completely furnished, the only down side is it costs lots of money to buy the resources needed to create them, money which I don't have because every animal I killed is helping me keep the 8 chickens and 2 pigs alive.

Good news though, I see the latest patch introduced Horses (woohoo). Just what I need when struggling to survive and living in a tent next to my 8 chickens and 2 pigs. It costs $50 just to go to Horse auction and then on arrival if you have a spare $5000 - $6000 you can bid for one.

Really, is it me, or did the developers completely miss the point?

This game should be called ""Hobo Hunter"" not ""Ranch Simulator"".

I do hope that when the cows are released that grass would regrow and livestock would eat the grass instead of always having to eat grain from the bag and i do hope that cows, sheep and goats will herd while the player is on horse back by whisling at them to move them to new grass. a couple things Id like to see are real pickups and livestock trailer, bulls when cows are released to add breeding for the cows. Maybe in the after cows are released you could add castration for the bigger livestock and a way to fatten the animals to produce more meat and the poorer the animal is the less. if by some hope the producers see this i really like this game and would love to give more ideas in the way of a ranch life.",1629953543,1629953543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So many aspects of the game are exceptional; the fact that I can simply build, cut logs to build, gather eggs, make sausages and preserve meat, then sell and repeat the process is relaxing. Caring for animals gives me a way to unwind from a busy day. The lack of pressure to complete missions or fend my ranch from predators or other ""dire"" consequences is very refreshing. No pressure to use your gun unless you choose to. The crafting is intelligently put together, the majority of what I've encountered about this game's design makes logical sense. 

The August update which includes horses feels like this game is becoming a dream come true. If the horses activities and care for them are as quality a process as for the other animals in this game, then this game will definitely be in my top list of quality adult horse games (which are VERY FEW in the gaming world at the moment).

Also, while the 3D models in this game (cows and deer specifically) could definitely use some work, as it is in Early Access I'm assuming these will be improving over time. Hoping the horses will look believable and realistic as well!

All you can do now is raise two types of animals and milk a third. even for that, you MUST do some hunting in the beginning, you cannot profitably start out with ranching alone.

Hopefully they add the new animals that are listed in the store, some more tools, and possibly some new buildings to work towards getting. I am going to give this game a 8/10 for gameplay and constantly keeping you busy while somehow still being fun instead of feeling like work like you'd expect of a Ranch Simulator.

For an early access game this is very good. cant wait for future updates.
I would though like to see some sort of crops like wheat farming and Orchard trees like apples, oranges, lemons and peaches, with new kinda recipies to cook on cooking equipment. like a kitchen to make it in.
Aswell as basic needs,like Hunger, sleep, hygiene and bladder...lol
if farm animals can die without food so should you be able to die from sleep deprivation and hunger, and working hard chopping trees and building, you should get dirty. Just my thoughts on that.
I would love to see more npc ranches in the world. with more quest to generate more money options.

Maybe future updates will include things like that.

We have made various ramps for the different vehicles in the game which has been pretty fun on top of the actual ranch style game. The car mechanics can be very glitchy especially with the small trailer while backing up. Honestly find it funny more then anything at times. At first making money feels tedious and you have to really start small and work your ranch up, which I didn't mind too much. The graphics are screenshot worthy and the game is just overall so entertaining to play. Hoping they add some more modifications to the vehicles and maybe some better building options.

-Some quests that you can make money (After prologue)

-Some npc interaction

And also after sometime you keep doing same things over and over again in order to earn money.

I have played about 20 hrs. and petty much bought and produced everything in the game at about 12hrs.  

Good: 

I like the concept of the game 

Items you can build are easy to place and remove 

Nice music 

Cutting and making planks are exactly right, tree cutting great, and the saw works fine 

Making cheese works fine, the racks for drying are fine. 

Bad: 

The graphics are generic “bought on an online store” 

Driving sucks, why does every game like to use WASD keys to drive, the mouse is the way to go. 

Removing items is fast and easy, sometimes too easy. Try to remove a bucket or anything while in a built house or barn because one miss and the whole house/barn is destroyed. No warning! 

Destroying buildings returns you nothing, not even 50% of cost of wood or metal. 

Ugly: 

To produce a sausage you must raise and pig/cow/chicken, kill it, pick every piece of meat (one to 15 pieces) place it in a cooler, move it to the grinder, pick up a piece, place it in the grinder, grind it into a pot, pick the pot, put it the sausage maker, take the sausage and hang it a room to dry, when dry, take the sausage place it in the cooler and then sell it. You can skip the drying process and sell it raw. If this was not ugly enough, they place the drying rack in such a way to make it hard to place the sausage. Also, in some houses a door might block your way which needs to be open and closed every time you hang and unhang sausage. You may bypass all this buy building in the cement garage, which is in on your farm, but it has draw backs too; you must cut and buy metal to produce the tables and drying racks. But you still need the farmhouse for the stove. 

When you first buy the grinder and sausage maker, it’s manual, you must turn a crank by moving your mouse in a circle (the well works the same way), WOW what Dev thought that was a great idea? Do that twice for every sausage made and it gets old fast! 

Let us not talk about the eggs 

I understand this game is in early access, that is ok, it also should be $10 too. Most of the stuff could be solved by giving more access to improve machines later in the game to cut out the many stepping points. I would recommend this to people who have money to spend and like the pain. But currently, I do not recommend this game to all the rest. I will come back in a few game updates and add to this review.

The circle selector wheel (press TAB) also needs some slight adjustments.

Replace it with number hot keys 1 thru 0 for what ever tools you have including the axe and crowbar.
Add a hammer, or spirit level or a book and use that for the construction mode.

With that said though I'm absolutely loving this game! I cant wait to see where it keeps going to and what all is implemented! The multiplayer aspect is very fun and my friends who own the game also seem to love it too.
If I could make any suggestions as of current, would be wonderful to add in a farming section. Some form of field management could be pretty cool! As well as adjusting spawn rates of the wild animals. I've seen very very few bears and for some of the days its like near impossible to find elk. Though I do end up finding atleast one.

However, I am very pleased to say that even as an EA title there is a LOT going on here that shows the AMAZING potential this game has. Overall, graphics are really good and it plays really smoothly. I know some of the people here are complaining about there not being a lot to do, but yoou have to remember this is an early access game and there is going to be more down the road.

I highly recommend this title if you are into games like Farming Simulator. Its mechanics are pretty straight forward and easy to learn, and the tutorial is pretty helpful and not super long (took me about 20 minutes or so to complete) and once its done it lets you do literally whatever you wish.

I am super happy i bought the early access before the real game due to the changes myself and the rest of the community can hopefully have effect on. This isn't a positive nor negative review, but a honest one. I paid for this game for both my wife and myself. We have played it through twice now, and the comments from others in the community about it being mostly a meat, cheese, and multiplier farming is the reality so far. There isn't much past that.

    There Is no real competitive adversity. Nothing to keep you on edge just the sleep and repeat. The biggest worries you have is animal fatality's and time management. Also once you finish acquiring the all the vehicles, houses, and animal facilities your left with the sudden fall off of entertainment. Its hard to maintain peak interest when you so easily have it all and have no further goals. the reality of this game is its not a ranch sim yet.

    Now after that potion of my review i want to reiterate this is not a negative nor positive review. This game is in early access and not yet finished in fact if the creators care for this game as much; if not more than the community whom gets to share what they've created. This game has much yet to come to light.

   Chickens, Pigs, Cows, and others not yet available. These are the bread and butter so to speak of this game and provide a need of constant attention, the animals all have there unique qualities. There are a few shops that have many items for sale. Gas is a constant need for your character and your pursuit through the game. It has well balanced mechanics. The building mechanics is in my opinion similar to ""The Forest"". The mechanics are very balanced between what you can obtain on your own vs what you need to acquire form the stores. all in all this game has a ability to be extremely advanced or under developed.

    To the developers i hope you have the opportunity to read this and make a quick response it would be appreciated to see you do follow what is being posted on your feed.  As a real life construction worker and rancher i believe you have something here to envy and nurture. Some suggestions to take or leave. A actual town setting. More Agriculture on the ranch. (Ranchers try to grow what there livestock eat, when they can.) Diversity in needs for animal food consumption. A real adversity for the player such as hunger, thirst, building deterioration (fencing), natural disasters, and even wild animal attacks on livestock. Missions and goals to achieve. (even the poorest farmer has a daily goal that gets him to tomorrow). Veterinarian visits and cost.

    Thank you all for the thoughts and time you've spent to read this. My wife and I have had a great time writing this and are continue to play.",1626491636,1626491636,True,24,0,0.732411623001098633,0,True,False,True

  I may change this review in the future, but this game might be TOO early access tbo.
      I am giving this game 7/10 in my eyes it has a lot of Cons atm.
           ""Very Small edits after July update""
   A few pros are that this game has multiplayer, It feels stable only had like one disconnect, Movement is good, The placement of houses etc is good we can build a few prefab buildings or in the style of ""ark or the forest"" you can build your own buildings not.. much to fill it with except the 3 animals.. and a table... but I have high hopes for this, and can not wait for this to be extended in the future. The animals are cute and when you get baby's they are adorable. When i look at the Discussion page they try to answer and help people with real problems i LOVE that...

That being said sadly here are some cons with the game ""still at this time"". There is some issues with the driving it can feel like you are needing to turn harder so you hold the button longer and then BAM it accelerates the turn so you almost do a 360. The carrying one log at a time and ONLY getting 2 planks makes building.. VERY grindy.. yes you can stack the logs on the vehicles ok but.. still with that being almost all the game offers atm it takes hours to build a non-prefab house alone... "" new July patch added being able to carry 8 planks "" It is also a shame that you can not seem to replace trees AND with that being said there is no way for us to grow our own wheat or something to feed our animals ..........
**with a game that has the word ranch and FARM in its description on the store page.... how about a small amount of farming or green house???**
  So every day ""at the beginning"" you are almost forced to kill some deer, wolves or bear ""bear and wolves are great because they run to you"" to get wild meat and sell it to a store just to be able to afford gas and feed and more bullets, A big con is animals can ""still"" stave to death when they plop to the ground at 2100 ""9PM"" so when i would like to use the night time to hunt or something i am forced to sleep because they are to stupid to wake up and eat or drink and the Status bars do not stop...  another BIG flaw is they can get stuck on the water troughs and feed troughs and then die that way do, you can not rely on the "" automation "" the game offers like the wind mill and silo "" silo may be broken at this time anyway""
And maybe the biggest one!!!
 THIS GAME NEEDS AUTO SAVES!!!! 
  THIS GAME NEEDS AUTO SAVES!!!
   THIS GAME NEEDS AUTO SAVES!!!
Graphics 
OK so the graphics are decent ""not like RTX ON lol"" but good enough for this game, I have seen a few floating plants in this new map they have in the beta, a lot of the map feels the same and the landscape does not offer much in respect to different tree types or rock types.

Sound
Thunderstorms are  too long and constantly happening. Animals make a little sound but not much hope to see this change in the future 

Overall
7/10  AT THIS TIME IN ""Early access"" !!!!

You start off getting a worn ranch and need to run around fining stuff and repairing your vehicle. Tedious. When you get into the vehicle you have to then start the vehicle and then drive. Do the users want this or do they just want to get in and drive. Yes, this is a simulation but how far do you want to go? Opening tins, cooking, eating and then washing and drying up afterwards?

You then need to drive your erratic vehicle to fill with petrol. You pull up, get your jerry-can and fill it before using it to fill your car. Any chance I could just fill the car directly from the pump? Nope. So I now have a half empty\empty jerry-can and probably a half empty car.

Next we go to buy a radio. Other than to show you the basics it's again a bit pointless. The best is yet to come. You drive to get some tools. You go to the computer and it starts a Monty Python sketch. ""Excuse me, I've just bought some tools and some chickens, Where are they?"" ""Yes Sir, we've thrown them into the car park."" ""What?"" ""Yes, we've scattered them all over he car park."" Perhaps it's a good job I didn't buy eggs. You go to look for them and some are difficult to highlight and grab. Annoying.

So 24 minutes in I got a refund. This should have been good but the ""ideas"" are so poorly thought out and ludicrous.

       The name ""Ranch Sim"" is indicating of it being a ranch simulator, where you can raise livestock and have actual choice in where you go as far as ranch content; Do you want to farm, raise livestock, cook? well you can't farm, and all you can do is make meat and cheese.  
       Driving around is cool, but that's all it is. Call it driving around the country simulation. Hunting was fun until it did nothing for you except waste gas; When you needed the money in the beginning, once you killed a few deer none would spawn, but there would be situations of 3 bears in the same area at any random time.
      I understand that this is early release; I wanted to love this game so much. I can't; For the fact they claim it to be what it falls so far from being; a ranch simulation.. Also, Having joined the discord and try to ask questions about the games direction, it seems to have little plans as far as furthering the simulation aspect. Though they're adding a new trailer and horses, but this will only inevitably help you make more meat and cheese products. This is a meat and cheese production simulation.
      While this game can be fun; I don't see it going anywhere currently with how the developers seem to be handling it. And disclaimer; it is not a Ranch simulation... it's grind incessantly until all you can think about is meat and cheese and multipliers, and lack of functionality of any store or immersive experience.
       This is a drive around and hunt for awhile until meat and cheese is your life sim. There is nothing else to the game. It seems as if they're going to further the meat and cheese production with free placement soon. The title is misleading.

EDIT: I feel honoured, thanks you guys. I was honestly a little angry with the game when I wrote this so I will say for the people who are looking to get this game:
This game is bottom line okay, for the price don't waste your money. 

They call it ""Ranch Sim,"" when they have no plan of furthering that aspect of the game in terms of living. It's more of a money making simulation, and you get a farm. 

 Having a slightly functional farm simulation, 

a realistic gas simulation, 

a beautiful scenery simulation,

a hunting simulation,

 a making cheese and meat and that's the only reason you farm simulation

 because there's not a lot of ways to make money and the game doesn't go much deeper than that simulation, 

or just take simulation out of the name and call it The Ranch.. 

Look; yes it's early released and there is work to be done, but the devs are misleading, and the game is way too overpriced for what they have Put into it, and the name. Please lord the name. I don't know if it's clear but it actually upsets me that they have not put any work into the actual playable simulation aspect; even the tutorial from the beginning misleading you into thinking there's more of a simulation aspect; when there isn't.

A sandbox where you can drive and shoot things, with gaming mechanics that are SO basic, no story / VERY LITTLE SATISFYING GAME PLAY. I had so much hope for a game of this genre, but this.. It couldn't even be a tycoon it has such a lack of immersion; but it doesn't fit the simulation genre in the way they try and place it.  When I said no plans of furthering the simulation aspect, that was no joke. They're adding everything else but anything you really want. THIS IS AN AWFUL STRATEGY/MONEY-MAKING GAME. Though they made it look very pretty.

 They are not going to further the simulation aspect in terms of living, though the game style is ""technically"" simulation, this game does not fit it. It doesn't match it's name.

Until things change. either the game or it's name, my review will stay negative; either way they are not going to change the game for one unhappy person when they're still profiting, poor execution. Hopefully things will get better.",1623993388,1626407465,False,300,67,0.884139001369476318,0,True,False,True

This game is fun to play its a demanding job game. You have to keep a eye on animals

Your always working harvesting meat from pigs and making sausages or salami pouches

and takes time especially the barns and depending on how much fences you place. The blueprints are just awesome 
to plan out how you want to build your farm. ""don't like it just remove blueprints without wasting resources and start over.

P.S     Now this review migh be about the experimental Beta but in all they have done a great job so far.

1.  Why give us an ovoscope?  You can't take the egg from the chicken to go check it without getting attacked. So you already know it's fertizlied and now have to find a place to put it back.  The ovoscope is a waste of money.  You also can't put the egg back in the drawer of the large chicken coop which makes NO sense.

2.  I paid the $300 to build the grain silo but it does NOT keep the feeders full in the barn or coop.  So I'm still schlepping bags of feed and several of my animals went without food for quite some time until I had enough money to buy more bags of feed when I found out the silo wasn't filling the feeders.  Dead chickens and one dead pig.  What a waste of money.

3.  Why does the vehicle you first get use so much gas?  I don't know if they are all like this, but that one sucks the gas down quicker than I can make money to fill it up.  NOT realistic AT ALL.  A vehicle like that actually gets very good gas mileage and would rarely need filling up.  

4.  The windmill which is supposed to keep the water troughs full does NOT.  I am still schlepping water from the poorly engineered well.  The spinning handle is a joke.  Why not a pump of some sort?

5.  I've had a few cows which I had to WALK home (really stupid because who can afford the huge truck) and have only been able to milk one of them. The rest won't attach to the bucket when you press E.

6.  There is no way to tell when the pigs are ready for slaughter.  I usually just slaughter them when they look really big, but I'd like to see a less ridiculous way to know for sure.

7.  The sausage making stuff is a waste of money.  It would not allow me to make sausage.  The only thing I could ever get to work was making ground chicken or pork which is worth less than whole chunks of meat so it's a waste of time. And it won't let you grind or make sausage with wild game, so what good is it?  Very annoying.

8.  Why are there no other people to interact with?  No cars.. No nothing.  The map is just a tiny, desolate joke.  I have been hunting the same two bears (sleep and they respawn) for the whole game.  

There are a lot more issues with the game but I'll stop now.  I hope the July update fixes some of these issues and more.  I see them advertisting that you'll be able to build anywhere but who cares when you can't even make money, or get ahead in the game.

The gun isn't a rifle as shown and isn't included at all yet, didn't find the rifle tease in the new patch and it feels like hunting isn't hunting as yet. It is kinda fun but they really need to switch it out asap to a rifle.

There are many issues with co-op, trailers and cars can tornado into a whirlwind and literally be unusable until the host jumps in, the headlights are also useless as they basically are only good for making it harder to see.

So why do i recommend this? because they are doing some major updates and it's still upgrading, they took a while but the changes have been major in good ways, they haven't removed anything good but also show upcoming items so you know what they'll likely work on next.

So in all this game is janky, a little bit of a mess with things but overall, it's nice to play with friends, it'll wipe your save if other major changes are made and they are really looking towards the future with more little features.

Being able to only carry one item at a time seems like an interesting mechanic until you realize that includes resources you have to grind out to sell to shops to be able to afford new tools and materials for your ranch.  Also, zero description or UI to let you know what any of that stuff is for.

Oh hey, the game gives you a cart so you can load it with items rather than carry them, well, some items, not all of them fit, and there's a very small limit to what can be laid down in the bed of the cart.  Also, your cart handles like a fat kid greased up and let loose inside a bouncy castle.  The vehicles control so badly, there's actually a command just to try and unstuck them.

It isn't added difficulty that you can't see your co-op partners, or vehicles, or friendly waypoints, on a minimap or the built in HUD-compass, it's just poor design.

Yes, the game - or better yet - the setting and the whole idea has a lot of potential. Potential that in it's current state is simply not met, which is actually fine. I fully understand that it's in Early Access and everyone seems to do it differently and everyone seems to understand the concept of Early Access differently, so I'm not gonna dwell on that. So this review will be about the game as it is at the time of writing, regardless of pricing or release model. 

The greatest negative aspect of this game that calls itself a simulator is the overall emptiness and lifelessness. It's not a small and not an ugly world. The map even looks a lot better now, after the June/July-Update. It's just plain empty. There's an occasional deer or wolf crossing your path, but that's about it. Shopkeepers are stiff and lifeless. There's an overall lack of sound and animations. Imagine the nicest weather being a thunder storm, which has a lot of atmosphere, nice lighting and sounds (although maybe a little on the loud side). A bright sunny day? Feels painfully dead, there's barely any sound. No breeze in the trees, no birds chirping or random critter noises, just awfully quiet. 

Also many interactions just happen without any sound or animations. You either click on things or press the interaction key and things appear or disappear. Though all this might likely be addressed later in some polishing passes. At least that's what I hope for. 

They did already improve the demolition part of the game by adding animations and physics to destructible parts. This was not the case in the previous time limited demo, which is a big plus for me, so at least you can see that things are being addressed. There is still a lot missing, in my opinion, but again, that might be added later as, understandably, this is not a priority.

The building mechanic has gotten a much needed update since June/July. Predefined plots are no more and it's a true blessing. You only ever start to value these things when they are actually missing. But the developers heard our crying and now there's quite a bit of stuff you can build just wherever you like. This already makes the game feel a whole lot better than before. 
Especially the beginning is a lot less tedious, as you can now place your table saw wherever you want, so you won't have to haul planks from one end of the ranch to the other just to build a chicken coop. 

With meat and deary processing there's also quite a bit more to do in the game. It just takes a little time to get there, as you don't have much money to begin with, so acquiring the necessary tools and livestock can take a while. At least now you're no longer forced to buy a house during the introductory quest, so you don't end up with most of your money already gone. Instead you can already start investing more in chicken and sleep on a mattress in the garage until you've got your business running.

What's already in place for how you do things is still promising. Like having to get gas for your vehicles, visit shops to buy and sell things, cutting trees and sawing logs to get building material, tending to your animals by providing food and water as well as cleaning after them. Also at least carrying items in your hands is animated. All these things that are actually 'simulating' life on a ranch. Again, it does have potential.

Seeing how the most critical things are being addressed in the latest updates, I think the game is on a good way, so I will recommend it from now on.",1615395799,1625235522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love that I can focus on animal husbandry and not have to plow giant fields.  The ability to make my own products like cheese and sausage is so cool.  There are tons of prebuilt templets you can use and thanks to the new build anywhere update you can custome build everything to your liking.  You can make your own lumber by chopping trees and running them through a table saw to make wood.  You can take concrete bags and pour foundations for your buildings.  This game is just an all around good game.  And they developers listen to the community and are making the game into a game that has eliments from everyone's wish list.  They could stop work on this game today and it would still be worth the price.  I can not wait to see where this game goes.  It has nowhere to go but up!!!  You do not wanna pass up this game!

You can build things and sell eggs and meat. But beyond that nothing to fill most of the time you're waiting for hens to lay eggs..
As of now, there isn't any farming mechanics unlike what is said in the trailer and description. Its just animals right now.
Only other thing of note is you can chop trees and turn them into planks, but you can't do anything with that apparently beyond the starter house? Also, you need money to make your starter house, so its a bit unclear why you need to add those planks to the construction site in the first place.

This game, is just...I have no words to really describe it simply. It's a Unity engine title, so the textures and models may be common with other titles that also use Unity, but it's done something very different with them. This is like if you took Stardew or Harvest Moon, removed the dating and crop mechanics, and focused on  the animals. They started with just three: Cows, Chickens and Pigs. The latest update (still only available in the unstable branch atm) added breeding for pigs as well as a full overhaul of the map and building mechanics. I'm glad I waited for this review, because if I made it day 1, I'd have been talking about a completely different game.

When it launched, Ranch Simulator had a very large map, with tons of empty space to chase down wildlife between caring for your animals. Now, however, the map is condensed and streamlined where there's an abundance of terrain changes, nothing is too far from another thing, and almost every square inch has something useful now that building actually requires wood for EVERYTHING (and it's actually a really good change).

The building mechanics have always been fun, before the latest update people got creative with boards and logs to make fences and other buildings, but now we can do that with something akin to many survival game base building kits, and I LOVE it. 

The radio in-game, though somewhat generic, is also copyright free, so don't worry too hard about copyright strikes or DMCA if you are using the in-game music for bgm. It is also set up to get louder/quieter based on the distance to the source of the sound, which is a plus.

The team, though small, has met and/or exceeded their goals for new content and quality-of-life upgrades based on suggestions. I say this, after the dev team pushed the much-awaited update to July 15th for full rollout (it's in the unstable branch atm). This is, of course, because of just how much new content and changes were made to the mechanics since the meat update in April. 

I can only wait with anticipation for the upcoming updates. as they've got a pretty stable roadmap ahead (and with them meeting it with few delays till now, you can definitely expect this team to crank out new content regularly for the next 6-12 months as they gear up for the final 1.0 release!). They have images for soon-to-come content like Horses, Goats, Sheep, other breeds of cattle, and the new pig breeding shows how these will all be great additions. The sausage/meat update also put so much more into the game for ways to make money from your ranch by making cheese and sausages.

The game can be a bit rough around the edges, as with the small team some bugs escape their testing before it goes onto the players, but everything spotted has been fixed quickly, if it was a major issue. The team is committed to a great experience for us, as players, and I really enjoy watching content from others in the discord and seeing just what kind of crazy stuff we can do!

If you like sim games like Farm Simulator and House Flipper, this is a game for you. If not, maybe you should look up a few Let's Play vids on Youtube before you make your decision. IMHO, though, if you think you'd enjoy it, I'd snatch it while it's hot. The multiplayer sounds like a blast, and the discord is always active and ready to roll whenever.

The character customization surprised me with how many more options were available than what I was expecting. The 'tutorial' actually felt fun to play through before the game set me off on my way to freely develop my ranch. I love how the game works: getting to do a lot of work by hand, being allowed to take part in constructing my buildings, having the vehicles (even the UTV you're given) be really useful, the function of actually stacking my items to load the cargo area of my vehicle by myself. The looks fantastic already, and feels great to play. I do hope that with the money I paid to try this game out, that more good things are yet to come as the game gets worked on.

I'm hoping that in the future, you have to do more to construct your buildings: tearing down the old stuff piece by piece was fun, but only putting up the frame of my house (for example) and then the house completes itself was a little disappointing. Redecoration would be a huge plus, unless I haven't unlocked that yet. I do love having a selection of different houses to choose from, for what I want to build for myself.

The map looks great, and has a great ambience. However, I'd love to see small birds and critters... it'd be nice to see a squirrel scampering by while I'm doing my stuff, or hear some birds chirping and see them flying tree to tree.

Vehicles feel pretty good so far, though I'd say some suspension retuning could help. Make the vehicle less rigid and absorb shocks better so the ride is smoother to a degree. How you load the vehicle doesn't seem to have a consequence from what I can tell, maybe a change could be made in the future to add more realism.

Is there any form of gardening / crop planting? I'm not looking to turn this into Farming Simulator, but I'd love to make a small patch / field that I can grow some veggies or other good stuff from. Or have these neat planter boxes set out, similar to Subsistence, for growing instead.

Maybe, as an option in the future, it could be set up so that you can design the house and other buildings yourself... have so that you can decide to use the blueprints like what's available now, or choose to freely put it together yourself within the building zone's limits. Then you could pick 'building blocks' from foundations, floors, wall, ceilings, and anything else needed to construct the building yourself, and have it look however you want!

This is nice game, and it feels pleasant to play! I'd recommend trying it out now and enjoy it yourself or with a couple friends. Again, I hope to see more good things come to this game as they continue to work on it.",1624209044,1624209044,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Go around and pick up stuff

A big part of the game is not where it should be at and it's not clear whether this will improve during early access. It could turn around and become amazing or it could release in a few months without much of a compelling gameplay loop. Remains to be seen.

Things I liked:
[list]
    [*]The realistic visuals of the storms
    [*]character look seemed realistic
    [*]the Placing feature, especially with the vehicles
    [*]the mixture between building, managing, hunting
    [*]well optimized ( had constantly over 120 frames)
[/list]

Things I didn't like:
[list]
    [*]way not enough hairstyles, beards, clothes
    [*]graphics are okay, but it suffers from typical things that some other UE4 games suffer from, too. Namely visible dithering,pixelated mush when not close by objects, some absolutely horrendous looking details/ objects as soon as you are not using TAA(characters hair i.e.)
    [*]for a simulator, there is not a lot of detail or simulating going on. I expected it to offer a deeper experience than usual fare, not less
    [*]there are not a lot of interesting or intricate mechanics. It's mostly just click and done. Building, Logging, Sawing, Destroying seem to all just involve braindead click and done. Not really any thought, choices, strategy or process involved.
    [*]whole gameplay loop seems to revolve around amount of dollars. Seems not very compelling. It lacks diversity in it's activites that games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, My Time at Portia, Wurm, Runescape, Valheim, Satisfactory etc. offer.
    [*]map is small and lacks details or any lived-in feel

Some minors improvements that I could suggest: 
-UTV engine sound in full speed sounds too rusty, needs some improvements
- Railway passings gets your cars flipped everytime you get some speed, so they need some adjustments.
- The mission with the water barrel and the bucket needs clearer understandings as there are a lot of people who doesnt know where to place the bucket
- A country road path leading to the ranch should be there, similar to the country road which leads to the General Store

I would also like to see fill gauges on the feed and water for animals to know how low they are getting.  I was also saddened by the lack of customizability in the buildings.
