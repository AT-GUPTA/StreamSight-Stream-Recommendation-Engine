Like a lot of clicker/idle games, the more active you are, the better the payout. I'd say it's about ten fold on what you get being active compared to being idle/closing the game. Makes sense to me since you can play when you can to update/upgrade your stuff and then log off for the night. You're still making progress - albeit rather slowly - while you sleep IRL. I think this game found the right balance between giving you too much of a reward for being active and not giving you enough for being idle/logged off.

I see people complaining that it takes too long to advance. Um... isn't that what clicker/idle games are about? I also see people talking about auto-clicker. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of an clicker/idle game?

Not when the developer adds a massive update that makes the game significantly slower to progress in with a bundle of new achievements. While more content is typically good, the way this has gone leaves a bad taste to anyone who spent the time to learn the game for things to be all but reworked. Microtransactions aren't as subtle, while not as egregious as others can be, they've definitely ramped up since.

It's a shame to see the developer take a stand against idling their IDLE game, it's become a clicker.

This is one of the few games I know that has such depth and so many things to explore. Multiple layers of prestige and different currencies add a lot to the depth of an idle game and this is done with perfection in this masterpiece.
When it comes to graphics there is nothing to complain... If you like pixel graphics just like me, you will love the style of this game! The whole game is very clearly structured and user friendly built.
The gameplay starts slowly at the beginning so you have enough time to find your way arround and won't get thrown in the cold water instantly with a thousend features at a time that want to be explored. After time all the other features join in and even if you think you are close to finishing the game more and more stuff comes to be found.
Overall an insanely good game when it comes to gameplay in idle games. It sets a very high bar for coming games that I play!

There's literally a 3-month gap in progression, meaning you're going to have to let the game idle for 3 months before you can progress (from the gloves to the cape).  In between, there's not much to do, either.  Just the same grind.  I mean, the game's only $5 at least, but I can see why it's free on phones.  Further, since the 2.6 update, now you have to be online to be able to play it, which is an annoyance and a deal-breaker to me.  Too bad Steam has the biggest ""Fuck you"" returns system.

Edit:  We're now at version 2.9.11 or so, and the dev has decided to double-down on his ""always online"" BS, and has further now changed the game to F2P with microtransactions.  Nowhere in the Steam store was this ""roadmap"" disclosed to the public, so those who bought a copy are feeling pretty betrayed.  Maybe in the future, this dev can learn to be honest, but for now, I still recommend avoiding this piece of crap ""idler-that-isn't-really-an-idler"" for the many others that are superior and free: Perfect Tower 2, Clicker Heroes, Melvor Idle, etc.

Bonus Update:  Dev has turned this game into a Pay-to-Play mobile game.  We're now at 4.4.0.  Pretty much every patch since my last update to this review has been either adding more grind or removing previous features that lessened the grind (nerfs).  This dev:

* Charges people to see the Update Notes through his Patreon while releasing ghost patches that nerf features.
* Capped the amount of item resources you can hold, while deleting any excess items you had, and then added a feature to sell resources to back to the players for real money.
* Removed features and then re-added them behind a new layer of grind. 
* Nerfed bonus SP and Gold you could earn from Eggs.
*Added ""Weekly"" Quests you can't finish within a week because their requirements are so draconian.
* Banned people permanently from the Steam Forums for criticizing the game's latest grindy changes.

FINAL EDIT:  I'm done keeping up with this ""game's"" crappy changes.  At 4.7.0, the dev added even more grind by decreasing gains from a number of progression features.  He's doubled down on permanently banning people who complain for their first offense, and even went as far as to wipe all their posts, even the ones that weren't hostile to the dev and his shitty ways.

At some point, you're gonna unlock ultra ascend, thinking you gonna get a massive boost, go back to where you were super fast and push even further. You know, the classic in an idle game. Well, you don't: even tho it took you MONTHS to reach that point, ultra ascending just brings you back to point zero with a measly bonus to coins and souls gathering and well... you're in for another several weeks or months of grinding depending on how active you play.
And that brings us to the second biggest flaw of that game: being idle is not really an option since it's significantly slower. If you want to make real progress, you'll have to spend a lot of time active. And I mean A LOT. 
Don't even put money into the microtransactions, they won't push you far at all. They are just a scam.

All in all, it's a really badly balanced game that only has its looks for him but under the hood, it's a slow, painfully boring idle game that I don't recommend.

Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt

It has Cloud saves for your Android/iOS as well, which is a nice touch. I do feel like this game may get old soon though, but for right now, I am still having fun and consistently coming back to it daily

Edit - May 14th. I have so many hours in now. And although it has been fun. The cloud save has ruined my experience. I play on the PC, iPhone and Ipad. But alot of the times, the Cloud Save does not work right. It is suppose to sync your progress across all platforms. But I have been playing on the iPad alot lately, and when I tried to play on the phone or PC, the progress was not synced. Costing me alot of playtime. If you play on just one platform, this game is amazing. But if you rely on multiple platforms to play this game, you may be sadly disappointed! :(

Edit - January 6th 2022
The dev has implemented a more stable Cloud Save experience and added the ability to manually quit (and save) on all platforms. The dev also is doing amazing with adding new features, content and fixes regularly. Back to 5 out of 5 stars for me!",1618089765,1641475612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, it can be a hands off or hands on idle game with portions of platforming in bonus stages, jumping for coins and souls in normal stages, and the typical curve when playing an idle game. Then it also has the typical ""CpS"" (clicks/coins/currency per second) that generates over time as you purchase upgrades and equipment. There is also a questing system for finding certain enemies to defeat as well as different dimensions to find them in. That basic gameplay is enjoyable for a bit, and is something that some people can appreciate. However, it's an idle game. There isn't much that is deep aside from trying to make the numbers go bigger and ""ascend"" (start again with a boosted speed rate) when the curve is getting too steep.

My biggest gripe is the fact that there is no bonus for those who purchased the game when it wasn't free to play. The devs could have easily made something reserved for those who spent the money to get this game up in popularity, OR even let them know that it was going to go free to play to prepare them for the fact. Regardless, they're a company who wanted money, and it felt scummy. It's an opinion that isn't going to dissuade me from still playing the game, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone. There should always be clarity on what's being received.

So, play it if you want, but it is what it is. I won't be sharing this to anyone any time soon.

EDIT:

And by ""no bonus"" or ""something reserved for those who spent the money"", I'm not talking about the additional gems or jewels which were available to everyone for purchase from in app purchases. There were some that some people had received, but some people did not receive them because they had started up the game too late. If a small boost is considered compensation, then I suppose that's considered. However, it isn't a ""hey thanks for purchasing this before it went free"" at all. Regardless, it is what it is. I'm not changing my thoughts. Not everyone was ""compensated"" and it isn't a compensation that stands to today. So, cheers.",1624307212,1624488006,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of the latest update I would however urge players to NEVER invest any amount of money into this developer again.
Because whatever time you invest into the game. As of today this game has become nothing but pay to win. And while I don't inherently have a problem with pay to win games. Keep in mind that people had over half a year to play this game, and sink their valuable time into this game. And as of the last update the developer has shown that, none of that matters to them by including a cash shop where for 24 euro you can have a 500 times multiplier compared to normal players for 15 minutes. 

To describe how big this bonus is i'll have to talk about some of the games features.

Nothing in this games matters other than your CPS (coins per second) there is no health to speak of, no damage, status effects or any strategy apart from increasing your soul gain and your CPS.

The biggest boost to your CPS when playing the game is when you run into power up boxes every 30-ish seconds and it'll contain a random boost. ranging from completely useless to at best a 9 times multiplier, There are about 8 different outcomes for these boxes and about 12% of the times it'll be a good one so every 5 minutes you'll come into a usefull one. This multiplier will last about 80 seconds giving you a chance to run into about 2-3 more boxes while this buff is running. and the best thing you can hope for is to run into ether the same boost, or a different once that increases this bonus exponentially (equipment bonus/ coin value).

The best thing you could possibly hope for is to run into a different box while you have the times 9 multiplier (you can double this buff by opening a silver box as opposed to a normal box, you get three of these every 30 minutes.) And then run into a bonus stage box... You should get by now that the chance of all this happening is extremely slim, and the majority of your time is completely wasted. when progressing one of the breakpoints (there are HUGE lulls of time between upgrades where you can increase your CPS). this is because the combination of boxes popping off is so small. 

What the cash shop does is effectively remove this entire random luck factor for the price of 23 euro per 15 minutes.
Everyone who spent hours just jumping for boxes wasted their time. as for 23 euro someone could do as much as you could have done in a few days. in a game you paid for. for less than the buff, and the game turns free to play.

At the same time the developer has indicated his intentions publicly to turn this game free to play and purely get profits from the cash shop. So to anyone that loves idle games, DO NOT INVEST your money nor your time into this game once it's free to play. The developer has shown to not care about any of it's players it only cares about how to make money. now that the cash shop has been introduced this is where you'll find newer upgrades and patches. spend more money to progress faster and encourage Pablo Leban to create more predatory games that even in the realm of idle games aren't all that good.

You might find you've been sitting auto clicking and making no progress on a bonus/chest stage.

Nicely interlinked idle / active gameplay improvements.
Strong incentive to switch between active gameplay (bonus and loot boxes, bonus stages etc) and idle (when all money/souls/upgrades placed and need to go stop playing).

Plenty of layered upgrade mechanics.

Love how over time you uncover new dimensions/maps and over time as you progress they fill with more enemies (and their types).
Could imagine even more enemies there later - but i still have big part of the game in front of me after few months already (just got to divinations, and ultra ascencion still ahead for me).

And THE BEST FEATURE I just found about - it's available for desktop too and WITH CLOUD SYNC across phone and desktop platforms! (Hence the login prompt some negative reviews mention, but yes it better not be required i guess?).
I was wishing game like this would exist for quite a while.

While also not being from too greedy company which often replace gameplay with buy buttons.
There are few options to spend real money, but seems to me they are ok, just minimal (unless you really want to extra rush the game for lot of bucks but why would you do that [too much]?). Could even imagine few more permanent paid upgrades too (maybe some extra perm benefit and some funny/joke-like reward too). Anyway they are so subtle, hidden away in menu, that You do not need to worry about it while enjoy the game fully.

Anyway for those who like (semi) idle games i can for sure recommend.

----
The game was a nice idle game with decent progression and fun/interactive minigames.  However, the most recent update added a forced/required login (apparently for crossplay).

This is entirely unnecessary for any ""PC Only"" players like me and really just opens up an extra avenue for my user data to be sold/mined/hacked/compromised.

The developer has nerfed the progression too much that it is no longer enjoyable to grind. I've only been logging in to collect a couple things, but I do not feel compelled to actively play because currency acquisition is so slow.

Even before the patch, idle progression in this [i]supposed[/i] idle game was awful. You could gain the equivalent currency playing the game for 10 minutes versus idling for an entire day. Now that the dev has slowed down active play even more, it all feels pretty meaningless.

Content updates for this game have been so-so. The last one introduced a new mini game which has potential. The reward for it is terrible though and it's purely RNG with how you'll progress in it. I unlocked the new character from it and got the achievements I needed, and now avoid them because they are a waste of time versus their reward.

Even compared to cookie clickers, the poor quality is noticeable. And that's free.
Existence of quest. It will trigger a new upgrade, but the quota is too huge.
I have to repeat ascension many times, but at that point I get bored.
The work of accumulating ascension points is very painful.
The progress of the game is very monotonous.
Warp stages not selectable (expensive upgrade required to select)
I don't feel the benefits of being idle.
Material system. Surplus. I want you to create a system that can be returned to the current CPS.
How long does it take to upgrade the cape?
I got 500k Ascension points, but I have no idea how to get them.
It was a waste of time anyway. For example, take time to drink Tasteless juice and Poor quality bread.

It may depend on future upgrades, but I don't expect much.

:::Impressions of playing for about 100 hours after:::
Ultra Ascension:
Ultra Ascension Point:
Point efficiency is too bad
Slight changes to the skill tree:
This is the only way to use Ultra Ascension Points
Quest initialization:
Do I have to hunt tens of thousands of monsters again?


Deterioration due to recent updates
Point efficiency is too bad:
I can't earn slayer points,It is 10% before the update
There is an upper limit on the number of materials:
Moreover, it requires an update to increase the maximum number.
Treasure chest system:
A system that only slows down the game

If you don't play active, you miss most of the items in the air that require jumping (coins, boxes, and flying enemies).  

Game is decently fun at first, but it turns into an extremely linear grind.  That is a bad quality for an idler to have.  I have a few big problems with this game:

1.  The bow sucks.  Sure, there are upgrades, but they are not impressive and it is still the most clunky aspect of the entire game.  It's connected to the jump button and there is a delay while the character draws the bowstring.  With the speed the game moves with the hyper boost, the bow is terribly implemented.  Layered upon this, the bow cannot be activated if your character is within melee distance.  This is problematic because in the later game, your hyper boost makes you move so fast that if you're trying to do something like ""kill flying enemies"" for a quest and you get a Horde result from a mystery box, it becomes very unlikely that you can get a bow shot off before you get swarmed.  If you haven't played this game, this may be hard to understand what I'm trying to convey here, but you will see.  The control mechanics are bad and it's just not enjoyable.   

2.  The mini game.  The mini game never changes.  It's cool about 3 times and then after that it's a hard skip for me because 1) it's inconsistent and 2) the rewards are terrible.  Inconsistency:  sometimes you can ""hop"" over a small gap and the timing works out for the next jump, but other times, your character doesn't hop over the game and you fall in the pit.  I have no idea what causes this to work sometimes and not work in others.  For the time duration, the rewards are minimal.  You get a few coins and about 100 enemy kills which nets a small amount of points (souls) for your next ascension.  The rewards should be 10x what they are now.  Needs incentive or you will be jumping over the mini game portal to avoid the whole mess.  

3.  Mystery boxes.  There are multiple bonuses such as ""extra coins"", ""increased coins per second"", ""increased souls"", ""horde"", and ""coin frenzy"".  90% of the time you're going to get ""extra coins"".  Kind of cool huh?  No, actually not.  Why?  Because the amount of coins you get is insubstantial in comparison to the amount of coins you likely already have.  For example, if you have 5.50e20 coins, the ""extra coin"" bonus will give you something like 3.50e19.  Who cares?  You could probably get more coins by avoiding the mystery box altogether.  Why not make it worth our time!??  Also, all of the other buffs have ways to increase their duration (compared to early game), but if the game pushes you towards actively playing, why are buffs only set to last 24 seconds?  Why not make it fun and give us a 5-10 minute buff so that we can enjoy reaping the rewards in active game play?  

4.  Why is the GUI so large?  Why does the upgrade and quest log box take up 1/3 of the screen (with not option to reduce its size) and then on top of its size, pop up (without the ability to move it) on the part of the screen your character is moving towards?  It's absurd.  There are no significant details included within it, yet the scaling is so large that it prevents you from even seeing the game play.  This could have easily been solved with a small set of buttons on the side to do quick upgrades or, at a minimum, let us scale the box down to 1/4 its current size.  After the 50th ascension, the pixel images for upgrades really cease mattering.  

The game just does not value the player's time or do anything to inspire the player to continue.  I'd never tell someone to get the game or not, but there are free idle games out there that show more appreciation in the player satisfaction arena.  Try it out for yourselves and you'll see what I mean.",1613237212,1613237471,False,22,0,0.590042948722839355,0,True,False,False

So far, the only downsides I can think of is that:
- I don't really like paying up-front for Idle/Clicker games, but that's just me.
- In the """"""earlygame"""""", the portal takes a while to charge back up. This is fixed later in the game, when you can spend slayer points to decrease the portal timer.
- Speaking of SP, it takes a long time to get enough SP to gain certain upgrades later in the game. Sure, it lets me stay on one ascension longer, but when I hit the wall, I hit it hard, and am forced to overstay my welcome.
As for the positives, this game is ABSOLUTELY addicting. Personally, numbers going up hooks me onto a game nice and good. Yes, this game has numbers that go up.

Although I am not necessarily proud of this, at least I feel it gives me grounds to review this game from an informed viewpoint. I've got hundreds of hours on other idle games here on steam, and what can I say, this game looked interesting to me, and it's cheap, so I picked it up. But i don't recommend it and here's why:

This game is good in a few ways. Sound design, effort, theme and graphics are all there and they make the game cool, also the fact that actual gameplay is weaved into the game in a pretty acceptable way too. 

[u] However, the game in and of itself as a clicker/idle game falls behind others in my opinion. [/u] In particular the ascension mechanic, ascension tree, portal mechanic, quests, and the fact that the game is very obviously made with the big idea in mind of having it be in mobile + PC at the same time, just kind of kill the game for me. The mechanics I just mentioned feel repetitive / uninteresting, and simply lack that dopamine rush we're used to getting in these types of games. 

The ascension mechanic I don't like because it doesn't feel strong enough most of the time. 

Upgrades in the tree seem to get super expensive while giving the same rewards as previous points, all the while being uninteresting in and of themselves. 

The portal mechanic is straight-up weird, it feels like a random idea that just didn't get developed through to the end, all it does from what I've seen is take you to another dimension, where you get the same amount of coins and enemies (actually, you get less enemies because you don't get the golem right away and frankly, I have no idea of how to get them to spawn in these worlds) but the enemies are different, so you can complete the quests that need them I guess. It's very strange, and doesn't make much sense to me. 

And finally, the game's core gameplay is obviously based around mobile. There's few buttons, they're really big, no keybinds (except for jumping) and there's also buttons that appear up at the top which are very obviously designed for mobile and make much more sense in the context of a mobile game. I ignored these buttons forever because they just seemed like random stuff to me. In mobile, these buttons prop up an ad, which they don't prop up here (hence the price of the actual game, I guess?). 

All in all these systems are very strange and honestly just disfunctional, and I feel like it's WAY more important for a clicker/idle game to have mechanics that make perfect sense than for them to have pretty graphics, sound design, gameplay, etc. These things don't really matter to me, and from what i've seen, they don't matter to most idle game players either. 

[b] If you want to try the game out for yourself, I'd recommend you play it on mobile first since it's free there, and then you can make up your mind on whether you want to have it on your pc as well. [/b] As for me, I do NOT recommend this game.",1610603163,1610603163,False,36,1,0.61154705286026001,1,True,False,False

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Good graphics, sound design and music.

I really enjoy the retro feel of the game and I believe that the animations and designs for the characters are smooth and nice to look at. As with some other idle games with music, having the same track looping over and over in an area where you're going to be spending a lot of time in does get grating after a while.

[*]Basically any semi-decent computer can run this game.

My potato laptop from 7 years ago with 2.16GhZ can run this game with lag spikes happening once in a blue moon, so I'm most certain anyone else's computer is going to be able to run it.

[*]Multi-platform and Cloud save support.

While I personally didn't use the multi-platform feature, it is certainly a plus for those that want to play on multiple devices.

[*]Hack and slash combat.

This idle game has mindless clicker combat that is somewhat satisfying, but I feel like it could be improved upon. I like the idea of having the Giants that have a healthbar that you must deplete in order to progress. Clicking to slash at them with your sword feels really satisfying, and you can feel the impact. However, having Giants only in the first area of the game, and having the rest of the enemies be simple one-shots really dissappointed me.
[/list]

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Generally, a flawed, gameplay loop.

Progression feels good for a while in the beginning, but it does not stay this way once you get into the mid and late game. As other reviewers have stated, once you unlock the last item (the Necklace), and get to the point of around Sx (Sextillion) gold, the game slows to an absolute crawl. Necklace upgrades feel so miniscule only a short period after unlock, and upgrading it doesn't seem worthwhile. Not only this, the souls you collect to earn Slayer Points (the ""Ascension"" or ""Prestige"" currency) don't seem to be balanced in your favor either. The very first area of the game has arguably the best enemy to collect souls on (the Giants, giving you upwards of 50x the amount of souls a regular enemy gives you). This makes going to another area feel almost punishing if you decide to use the portal early on. Even so, the extra gold you get from entering a further area (via the coin and enemy values increasing) doesn't come close to minimizing the slowness of the progression. Most of the time, I feel as though I have to luck out on getting a Random Box that gives me an extra coin per second bonus in order to make any decent progress. Certainly not a fun way of spending your active playtime.

[*] Slayer Points (cont.)

Slayer Points just simply come too slowly in order for them to be satisfying to collect. The amount you need for some of the upgrades is nigh on impossible to collect (some costing upwards of 1-2 million Slayer Points, while grinding for even 30-50 Slayer Points in a run is slow and will take you a decent amount of time). Even so, some of the upgrades you do recieve feel like filler and less worth it than other upgrades. For example, the Coins Per Second upgrades (that cost a lot of Slayer Points and only give a few extra percent bonus), and early item upgrades (like the Sword, being the first and weakest item in the game, giving next to no gold needed for later upgrades, and even upgrading it to higher tiers is still not worth the effort and amount of gold / Slayer Points you can put into it).

[*]The Portal.

The Portal is the system in which you can travel to different areas. It's an early Slayer Point upgrade that acts like a timed ability (much like the run speed Boost ability, that takes a few seconds to charge). The Portal is locked behind an 8 hour timewall every time that you use it. The problem with this is that it makes progression feel arbitrarily slowed down for the sake of padding out gameplay. Not only this, the areas that you are warped to are random until you get an upgrade for a couple million Slayer Points (well into the late game and almost impossible to get), so it's a gamble if your 8 hour time sink is going to be worth it. You can also upgrade to decrease the amount of time it takes for the portal to recharge (down to 2 hours minimum). But this still feels like padding, and still won't be worth it until you're able to select areas. I feel as though The Portal system should either be reworked, or scrapped entirely for a more linear progression system (where you traverse new areas after a certain number of enemies are defeated. You'd be able to get more gold from the coins and enemies there).

[*] Some nitpicks and bugs.

Hard resetting does not reset your gold count back to zero. Did some experimenting with late game mechanics and wanted to start fresh on a new file. Turns out the gold got carried over from the previous save.

Having enemies tied to certain areas makes getting materials for late-game augments and missions a nightmare. Having The Portal be under a 2 hour minimum, 8 hour maximum timewall doesn't help either.

Not much in the way of crafting materials (2 simplistic items to be crafted from what I experienced). As this is a late-game feature, I hope more content will get added to this portion of the game.

Minions and Augments are locked behind timewalls. Waiting many hours for a small Slayer Point chip doesn't seem too worth it, and the Augment upgrades you get for it are mediocre at best (with some simple boosts and upgrade tiers).
[/list]

Overall, this game is alright, but has some severe balancing flaws that hold it back from being worthwhile. This game has plenty of content, but having it locked behind arbitrary wait times and ultra-slow burning progression loops feels very cumbersome.

[h1]My ideas for making the game better:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Increase coin and Slayer Point gain.
[*]Rework or remove The Portal in favor of a new area progression system.
[*]Increase the effect of item upgrades, or add new item tiers beyond the Necklace.
[*]Make progress generally faster (more coins collected from pickups and enemies, faster base run speed, etc.).
[*]Decrease the cost of unattainable Slayer Point upgrades.
[*]Increase value of souls and make them easier to collect.

The basic loop of the game is to run in a straight line and click to jump. Jumping will let you collect coins and attack flying enemies. You earn money from those coins and enemies, as well as per second. Upgrade to get more coins for each. The outer loop is to gain souls for attacking enemies. When you ascend (reset the coins part of the game), you cash in your souls and use them to buy upgrades that carry across runs.

There are briefly interesting details, but if there are hidden depths, they are not hinted at. There are multiple tile sets and enemy types. There are a few ""kill 2000 bees"" style quests. There are upgrades to enemies. There are upgrades to unlock more upgrades. I see late game upgrades on the skill tree that should introduce something new-ish, but the existing mechanics give no reason to think those will add much to the existing ""click every few seconds while your character runs in a straight line"" game. Nothing looks like the interesting, synergistic, or choice-based upgrades one sees in better incremental games.

Active play is strongly rewarded, despite the ""idle"" name. You will gain far more coins and souls playing it as a clicker than an idler. There are still large walls in advancement that will take a lot of clicking or idling to get past. The walls loom large faster than your gains increase as the next unit of progress is continually further away.

As there is offline progress, I will keep checking in and will update this review if I find anything interesting enough to merit it. If you are reading this and I have not updated it lately, I have not yet found anything interesting to call it as dynamic and interesting as the typical idle game, which is a low bar to clear.",1596470593,1596470593,False,51,6,0.666502594947814941,0,True,False,True

I must say, I was surprised at how much I ended up liking this game. I bought it thinking this game would be one of the more inferior idle/clicker games due to the lack of reviews, price and seenshots but was super pleased & happy to find out after I spent some time with it it's actually a pretty good game. 

[h2]Already off to a GREAT start..[/h2]

Don't be turned off by the lack of reviews or it being in Early Access--it's pretty well polished out the gate. I honestly forgot it was even in Early Access until I went onto the discussions this morning to post a couple suggestions I had.. I mean--you'd never know honestly. It's very well put together all things considered and already has a LOT of content to keep you busy for a very long time along with a nice stack of achievements to work on while it's still being developed. 

[h2]Deceptively deep despite it's simple appearance and play[/h2]

The screenshots or even the opening stages of the game don't do it much justice in helping you gauge how much content their actually is. It wasn't until a good 10-12 or so hours (in-game + afk) that I was able to begin to see the depth it has, especially once I ascended. 

Ascending basically just resets the game, trading everything you've worked to unlock for some special tokens to use on the massive skill tree to buy new permanent abilities to apply to your future runs. 

It's a fairly common mechanic in these type of games and if you played these games before you know what am talking about.. and yeah, it's no different here or anything too fancy. With that said, I do feel like this game has a TON of skills to buy and unlock though which is definitely going to keep you busy and your runs unique for many hours and hours. 

[h2]It's not perfect and could use some more polish along with addition features as it progresses through Early Access..[/h2]

The game itself isn't without flaws. When I said it's ""Simply Good!"" I actually meant it both literally and figuratively. It's a simple game. In fact, its one of the most simple Idle game I've played to date. You have an avatar that stays on one side of the screen and you jump up and down to grab coins, smash boxes and kill enemies. It's like playing Mario Bro's on rails. In fact, a lot of the sound effects sound straight from the NES era Mario games! And that's basically it. You jump and after you get (x)amount of money, buy unlocks that give you more money that you can buy unlocks with so on and so forth. 

[h2]It's good and well worth the asking price.[/h2]

It's the simplicity that I admire about this game along with the sexy NES style pixel art. It's not trying to be anything more than a good Idle game, not going outside of the tested formula opting instead to what works best. 

[b]For an Early Access title, you can't go wrong buying this game if you are looking for an Idle game disguised as a platformer that looks, plays and sounds like 90's Mario Bro's but on rails.[/b] 

[h2]Here's what I like about this game[/h2]
[list]
[*]-Nice looking pixel art. 
[*]-Has a great soundtrack for the theme/menu (wish there were more like it!)
[*]-Easy to pick up & play Idle/Clicker game
[*]-Very simple but in a way that feels good
[*]-Masters the Idle/Clicker formula. It's a good looking game that is fun and has a ton of depth you discover as you play.
[*]-Feels complete for an Early Access game and is off to a fantastic start!
[/list]

[h2]Things that could be better..[/h2]
[list]
[*]-Needs more music! Love the 8bit tunes but I think there's like 2 songs or something.. MORE!!
[*]-The upgrade menu when open, covers your avatar blocking your view of them. Can't jump and upgrade at the same time.
[*]-Could use more general content though am sure it will come as the game progresses. Stuff like more music, features, items, monsters and that jazz would be welcomed.
[*]-Would like to see some Lore too. Bestiary maybe? Any lore would be welcomed really. :D
[*]-More customization options. Would like to be able to change my avatar up, maybe with different cosmetic items or have it so when we unlock items, those items get shown on our person. Stuff like that. 
[/list]

All in all. Very satisfied with my purchase and am optimistic for the future development of this game. I can't imagine this staying unpopular for too much longer. It has all the makings to be one of the best you can play in the genre and with it still being in Early Access, the skys the limit! If you need a game that you want to play when you can't and be fun to play when you can play, look no further. This game is actually pretty good like I said.
