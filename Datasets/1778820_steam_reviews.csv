-Nearly no graphics options (pretty much just motion blur is toggleable, no lens flare, bloom, etc.)
-Horrible defaults on upscaling, not properly setting to DLSS/FSR on Nvidia and AMD respectively sometimes
-No FSR 3 or even 2.2
-NO OPTION TO DISABLE UPSCALING
-Throw bugs
-Random added input delay bug
-Poor jukebox options
-Bad mixing/audio quality on a lot of older tracks
-Missing tracks, even ones from Tekken 8
-More minor things

More majorly, the addition of microtransactions post launch and plugging. Bamco and Harada have alleged that MTX is necessary as ""online video games cost more to make and keep up than they did on PS2"", yet if they truly felt it was a perfectly fine feature they should not have withheld its existence until a few months after launch. This was done to avoid negative reviews and bolster their initial sales (the most important period) and it was extremely scummy. Furthermore, the principle that MTX is necessary to keep video games online is ludicrous, and such costs should be factored in at launch. For $70 minimum with NO REGIONAL PRICING, and a guaranteed cash flow from all the future DLC, the idea that skins are necessary to keep the game up is incredulous on its own--but it gets worse. If you don't know how online works in games like these, you may be unaware that matchmaking in fighting games does NOT USE SERVERS. It directly connects you to your opponent through your ISPs and does not cost Bamco literally anything. The only thing that costs money to keep up... is the beloved 10fps tekken fight lounge. Allow me to word it like this:

Would you rather have all cosmetics and skins be completely free until the end of the game's life cycle BUT we have to bid farewell to tekken fight lounge, or have all skins and cosmetics cost money and keep tekken fight lounge? 

Would anyone pick the second option? Not to dunk on anyone who actually uses it, but does anyone actually go to the tekken fight lounge? It's so slow and feels completely vapid and pointless to me. Regardless, it's complete bull to believe that paid skins are necessary or should even be a thing at all in a paid video game, and the online matchmaking (99.99% of the game, especially now that most people are probably done the story) does not even cost anything to keep up. If they really wanted you to support the game by buying skins (you've already supported them with $70, remember!) then why can we not buy them directly? Why do they cost tekken coins, a made-up currency that will FORCE you to spend more? Individual skins will not be $4 if the coins only come in packs of 1000 (which they likely will), they will cost $10. Maybe $6 if they opt for packs of 600 (so you want to buy two) if we're lucky? It's shovelware mobile game crap in a triple A next gen full price video game. Justification for this in any way is completely asinine. 

And how the hell is there no penalty for ragequitting? It feels like crap when it happens, and only the dude who DOES NOT RAGEQUIT loses? Why do you lose your winstreak (which gives you more points when you have one) when someone plugs? How is this shit seriously still a thing in 2024?

Aside from that, the game is extremely good. There is a lackluster amount of stages and stage variety, and the base (we have to call it that now) customization is not anywhere close to as good as past tekken titles like tag 2, but that's pretty much where it ends. The story mode is great (shakespeare compared to Tekken 7), the music and music options is amazing, the visuals are very good, and the core tekken gameplay is fantastic from all the intricate movement to flashy moves to the new heat mechanics and more. The online actually mostly works too... we've finally almost caught up to online games from two decades ago!

It's great but held back by some miscellaneous issues and some really scummy bullshit. I'd recommend it from newcomers to fighting games and veterans alike even at full price, but damn please do not buy into this MTX garbage and just use the regular customization or mod something special in. If all the things holding this game back get cleaned up--which is 100% possible--I think it's a pretty safe 10/10. Right now, probably like an 8.5 though.",1706247421,1708862165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Incredibly solid rollback netcode, I only have issues maybe 1 out of 15 matches.

Always been a huge fan of this series, ever since T4, and this feels like the best new release in a long time. Super fun arcade and individual character story modes, great customization and color edits you can do with NO MICROTRANSACTIONS** (since writing this, they have indeed added microtransactions..pretty scummy, but the game is hard to deny still. they just need to work on punishing ragequitters/pluggers now..)

I can easily see myself putting several hundred hours in this one. Such a great game. Heres some rapid-fire reasons why Tekken 8 slaps:
-custom jukebox with legacy tracks from every game, set the music to whatever you want in every stage
-super solid online so far. (lots of rage-quitters, but this is funny to me. it will show on their profile so you can avoid)
-lots of flashy moves and every character has been fun to play so far.

Harada-san,

I am desperate.

I am asking you for one single thing.

I ask you, despite already knowing deep within my soul what you're going to say...

I ask you, as a 25-years-faithful Law main, who has spent many of those years of his life practicing backflips...

I ask you, in the memory of the child I once was, who one day stumbled into an arcade at the beaches of New Jersey and spent all the quarters he had, trying to run the gauntlet with backflips only...

I ask you, in the memory of the weekend warrior I once was, who always kept renting copies of Tekken 4 and 5 from Blockbuster, backflipping along to the music in the Tekken Force and Ghost Battle modes...

I ask you, in the memory of the diligent student I once was, who practiced with both PSP and PS3, brushing up on his skills by maintaining triple-digit winning streaks, with only backflips, in ghost battles in Dark Ressurection, Tekken 6, and Tag Tournament 2...

I ask you, as the stubborn old man I have become, attempting with every fiber of his being to once again brave the trials and tribulations of the art of backflipping...

Please, Harada-san...

Would you kindly add a 'random stage select' option to the quick menu after a ghost batte?

And to everyone else, I have a different question for you...

But before I get into all of those issues, let me preface by going on record and saying that I absolutely love the Tekken Franchise and as such have thousands of hours logged in Tekken 7 and a couple hundred at least in 8.
Day 1 launch fiasco (constant crashing) I could overlook as this release was big and the first time we got cross play in this franchise.
Day 2 was amazing. No more crashing and as perfect as you could get gameplay. 
Then came the first patch and that’s where everything went downhill.
I’m not sure what they did to “fix” the crashing but whatever they did makes this game lag like in online matches.
My system specs are as follows.
•	I9 9900k
•	RTX 4070 ti
•	32gb Corsair Dominator Platinum 
•	Samsung 990 Pro 2TB ssd
•	Gigabit Ethernet 
There is absolutely no way that this game should run as poorly as it does at 1440p.

From the atrocious online frame input delay, the rollback code that should be called fruit rollup code, and general overall poor optimization, I can’t in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game. Not in its current state. If you are like me, you are somewhat competitive, enjoy good clean fights, and can’t have a good time in a game where you need a lag input degree to compete.

The graphics are amazing, the characters are pretty good. It’s the gameplay at the end of the day that matters and as much as I want to thumbs up this potential masterpiece I cant. It’s terrible. Try again later. Go play something else for now.

You might as well recommend that your audience avoid nearly all modern fighting games. I care about microtransactions when they affect gameplay. I don't care if they sell costumes I can ignore. Costumes will not improve your terrible movement, or your non-existent defense, or your shoddy execution. Once the bikinis inevitably start rolling into the Tekken shop, they will only distract you from improving those things.

TEKKEN 8 has 32 characters, great mechanics, top tier graphics and visuals, arguably the best fighting game story mode, good rollback netcode, crossplay, fast loading screens, character customization, the best replay mode, good tools for learning the game, stellar sound effects, great soundtracks, awesome stages. I could go on. The base game feels like it already came with all DLC unlocked compared to the other full price fighting games. 

The new heat mechanic is awesome. You can basically use it whenever you want for whatever you want. Extend combos, force mixup situations, defensive panic button, you name it. Every character gets wild new options in heat, and they're just fun to use. Though this also ties into my main issue with the game because the most powerful heat moves have too much reward for how braindead they are. They deal cataclysmic levels of damage while being massive mids and giving the user a mixup even when I block them. I expect many of them will be toned down in future balance patches.

Overall Graphics: Improved than Tekken 7 but the graphics shown in very initial trailer of Tekken 8 at the event of TWT wherein the fight between Jin and Kazuya with high-end graphics were far better and realistic than the actual graphics of this game. If that trailer was developed using Real Engine 4, we need that engine, Bandai. Because this-Real Engine 5 game's graphics are far inferior than the initial trailer of Tekken 8.   

Game play: Innovative and Addictive.

Character Customization: Improved with variety of options.

Tekken Lounge: New and appreciable.

Ghost Mode: New but needs improvement.

Offline content is better then 7, better animation with obviously more budget.  32 character roster to start in any fighting game is a blessing, and DLC characters are already leaked.  

For some negatives, some of the Yoshi changes are bad.  The flip went from a easily steppable unblockable to a easily steppable non unblockable.  Its low damage with horrible tracking, 0 reason that property should of been removed.  Flash is also brain dead now, you don't have to be frame perfect anymore.  In 7 is was more satisfying to pull off because it was a lot harder and more rewarding.  Asides for that the other Yoshi changes are really good.  The character episodes are pretty low effort, they all start with a boring tournament fight but for the endings its worth.  Also the story plot was a bit underwhelming, very predictable story but still better then 7.

Steam Deck Settings:
Everything Low
Rendering Scale at 60
upscaling: Catmull-Rom Bicubic (idk what that does)
V-sync is on
Resolution is 800p or just default
Full Screen ofc 
This gives me 50 - 60ish fps

Mod's i'm using:
anything yakuza related (mainly music)
RWBY music (only one which is the This Will Be the Day song from Blazblue)

Edit as of (2/23/24) - I finished the story mode for Tekken 8 and its pretty good, i didn't play it in hard though because I'm not that good, It was still challenging for Medium difficulty though. Still worth buying at full price IMO, Might wait for a sale to buy Tekken 7 just to mod it because theres a Kiryu mod I wanna use for the funnis (funny's).

At higher level play there isn't much use for rage unless its for more combo damage, so you barely use it cause its highly punishable(considering if both players are waiting out for it)Characters need buffs and nerfs but that will come when more patches come out. Heat is too strong, considering heat smash does as much as a rage art. heat engagers and extended combos don't seem bad to me imo. Chip damage seems pointless, barely recovers much when fighting unless you are jun and you can recover just anything including regular health. if they are going to make heat powerful at least make it so you can get more health playing aggressive. This game is so mix up heavy you are never going to recover the health.

The single player is good for a tekken game. Not much outside of there. 

Once they take rage art out and create a few patches ill change my review. Always thought rage art was dumb. they don't realize most of the reason people weren't aggressive in Tekken 7 was cause of rage art, or at least it was 70% the reason.

That being said its a great game, mechanics feel nice and its a lot faster compared to Tekken 7. Ranked can be hairsplitting if you are trying to learn, unfortunately you really need to lab out a lot and figure out your character to do decent, and then later on learn a lot of enemies moves you need to punish as you progress. This game does have one of the best ways to practice and train compared to any other fighting game out there now. You can take control of replays and test out what you could have done better.

I played Tekken 7 for almost 200 hours combining the time I spent playing on Steam and Console and it felt great having everything upgraded in Tekken 8. They added crossplay so you can play against more people. The characters kept their identity with some adjustments to make up for the fast pace that the game now has. The rounds are shorter which causes more pressure each round to do something. 

I'm really impressed by the tutorials and learning resources they have. I recommend new players to go to the Arcade storyline because it explains most of the concepts to help you get better. There were a lot of hidden techs in Tekken 7 that took me too long to find and learn, but they explain so much in Tekken 8 that most of the gameplay makes sense (I haven't been through all the resources yet, so maybe they really do explain everything). There are easy to play characters that still have flashy moves so that it is friendly to new players to the series, and there are a lot of things to master for the loyal fanbase who played for years.

However, my excitement quickly turned into frustration as I delved into the game.

One of the most glaring issues that significantly detracted from my enjoyment was the abysmal server performance. The laggy servers plagued my gameplay experience, causing frequent disruptions and making it nearly impossible to execute precise moves and combos. Whether I was playing online matches or attempting to enjoy the single-player modes, the lag persisted, creating an infuriating gameplay environment.

The constant lag not only hindered my ability to fully immerse myself in the game but also made it challenging to compete against opponents effectively. It's disheartening to see such a fundamental aspect of the game, like server stability, fall short, ultimately detracting from the overall experience.

Despite Tekken 8 boasting impressive graphics, diverse character roster, and engaging gameplay mechanics, the persistent server issues overshadow these positive aspects, leaving me deeply disappointed. Until the server performance is improved and the lag is addressed, I cannot recommend Tekken 8 to fellow gamers who value a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

In conclusion, Tekken 8's potential is marred by its subpar server performance, resulting in a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying gaming experience.",1708624431,1708624431,False,3,0,0.489692479372024536,0,True,False,False

[h2]i'll elaborate.[/h2]

[b]The actual fighting[/b] : i think it's really good, the heatmode is fun, the passives it gives are fun and create risk/reward, ofcourse tekken just feels so good to play, and doing combo's is fun.
the only complaint i have is being unable to decide if a move activates heat or not, i would have liked maybe HOLD to activate heat on hit, it often removes those moves on the movelist when it comes approaching the enemy if you don't want to use heat yet.

[b]singleplayer content[/b] : the actual story mode is about 6-7 hours long and FAR better then tekken 7's story, arcade story mode can vary from 4-10 depending on if you beat every single guy at the arcades or if you just rail straight through to the end.

there is also Super ghost battles that uses the surprisingly good AI learning mode they have so you can fight your friends or random people from all across the world forever and increase your rank.

then there is also the character stories and i'm so happy to see a return to form with these slightly short but very entertaining and fun little snippets of what the characters are up to, we'll see if they can keep it up with the upcoming DLC characters too.

i sat at round 27 hours after beating all the singleplayer content.

[b]multiplayer[/b] : the meat of the game, this is what is gonna keep you playing for hundreds of hours.
the online is not as good as street fighter 6 but far better then tekken 7's netcode, i can play with my friend on the other side of the earth and i get 1 frame of rollback.
if you'e having a terrible connection it's not because the game's netcode is bad, but it's because your wifi is dropping more packets then Amazon does in a day

[b]practice mode[/b] : this is where i live, i often just get fighting games to figure out the characters and do cool combo's. this practice mode is extremely good, the features that have been added are monumental timesavers for setting up situations and, for instance saving your position and state and being able to reset to it in a flash.
Watching back replays lets the game analyze it and give you tips on how to punish moves and then lets you actually practice it instantly which is a HUGE feature for people wanting to get serious with the game.

[b]customization[/b] : another fun part of any 3D fighting game is character customization, it's an improvement, quality of over quantity this time around, fabric sticks closer to the skin in most regards, the fidelity is obviously higher,  and you can color basically everything, compared to previous entries there are few items to choose from (i don't consider a T-shirt with a different picture on it a unique item)
there are misc items that you can put all over your body and you can get creative, but you can't put any item anywhere you want which i guess it to prevent people from making characters with D*cks

[b]Negatives[/b] : there are some strange quality of life features that have still not been added.

you can't host a tekken ball game online in player match, you have to go to the arcade lobby and then to the beach area.

no tournament mode, my friends and i like to run a tournament now and then, the tournament mode in T7 was incredible for that, but now we just have to keep our own bracket.

this is definitely a very personal take but tekken ball is not very interesting, it does nothing particularly well compared to games with balls that are also fighting games like lethal league.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2] : 70 euros is pretty steep if you're not planning to play with friends or online but you must put value to your own time, it's quality over quantity and overtime i have no doubt they'll add a lot more content.

EDIT : IT'S F****** MICROTRANSACTIONS, F***

Legitimately the only thing I dislike about Tekken 8 is that it launched without Eddy Gordo or Christie Monteiro. That's it. Everywhere else, this game does what a good sequel should do. Tekken 8 adds some new bells and  whistles to the established formula, and with just a little figuring out, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them. Old characters feel just like they should, new characters add variety and flavor to keep Tekken from getting stale.

Tekken Ball is back in all its glory, and it's incredibly fun to play, with a few new tricks up its sleeve. Tekken Force doesn't seem to be its own gamemode, but without spoiling anything, I think you'll find something [i]kinda[/i] scratches that itch if you play the story ;)

Speaking of the story (and only the most mild of spoilers ahead) [spoiler]I had a hard time enjoying large swathes of it because it's pretty much the same as it's always been-- one contrived dust-up after another that ends with you taking on a ridiculously-overpowered boss with abilities that you'd never have to see anywhere outside of story mode. OR SO YOU WOULD THINK. No, actually the game ends with a pretty meaty challenge, but it's against a regular fighter the likes of which you might see anywhere else in the game! That was a breath of fresh air. I'm still docking points because there were like 7-8 fights against the big bad devil boss leading up to the final fight, but still. Holy cow is it nice to face a final boss that feels like it actually belongs in this series. And to top it all off, there are multiple endings![/spoiler]

For all my gripes about this game, there's a damn good reason if you go to Mortal Kombat 1's steam page right now, you will see a plethora of reviews telling you to get this game instead.

Before I dove into the Tekken series, I was playing other obvious picks like Smash Brothers, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, and in all of those games, I didn't know what spiking was until a couple of years ago, I could barely pull of a quarter circle or dragon punch move, I couldn't even hold a 10-Hit combo to save my life.

I've dabbled in Tekken since Tekken 4 and 5 on the PS2 whenever I visited one of my friends as a kid, and we'd play hours of those games. Then when the arcade cabinets for Tekken 6 rolled out in Australia, I only played those games at the arcade. But then Tekken 7 came out, and I wanted something different in a fighting game. So I bought myself a copy and went on the grind for hours on end, and a visit to Japan only reinforced my appreciation for the mastery that is the Tekken series that has become more than just a fighting game.

So of course, I had to pre-order Tekken 8, and Harada and the rest of the TEKKEN Project team has not disappointed. This game is easily the best fighting game of the year and I can't wait for the future post-launch support the game will receive. It retains everything that makes Tekken's combat iconic, memorable and fun while also adding in a few new features that set it apart from the other installations of the franchise. It's easy to learn but hard to master as always, but the Tekken scene is growing strong and finding new players.

[b]Announcing a Micro-transaction Shop 4 Weeks After Release[/b]
[list]
    [*]BAMCO knew they would get blow back if they had revealed this before or at release.
    [*]Cosmetics that used to be packaged into the base game are being released in exchange for Tekken Coins (more on that in a minute)
    [*]This is putting aside the fact that they are prioritizing the development of this shop instead of addressing major issues such as plugging (where players disconnect to avoid a loss)
[/list]

[b]Using Proprietary Currency is a Shitty Business Practice[/b]
[list]
    [*] The only way to buy anything is to exchange cash for ""Tekken Coins.""
    [*] These systems are varying degrees of predatory, since it's possible to setup the exchange rate and cost of goods such that there is always a certain amount of ""tekken coins"" left over, leaving you to either add more to purchase something or be comfortable with losing whatever change was leftover
    [*] Ideally, consumers should be able to buy goods with their credit cards for the specific amount listed for the item.
[/list]

[b]The Fighting Game Community is in Denial: Most Fighting Games Are Pay 2 Win[/b]
[list]
    [*] I can't believe this even needs to be said, but Pay 2 Win is literally anything that gives you an advantage over players that do not spend money.
    [*] In Tekken 7, BAMCO offered frame data - invaluable information for determining which moves are safe or unsafe on block - for money, which fits the definition of pay 2 win
    [*] Even more egregious is something folks in the community have just come to accept: in order to lab and practice against certain types of characters, you need to buy them. In other words, the only way to remain competitive is to pay money for characters even if you do not actually want to play as them.
[/list]

[b]There Should Be A Way to Earn Anything (characters/skins) By Playing The Game[/b]
[list]
    [*]Most folks would agree that a larger player base makes for a healthier game. The smaller the player base, the longer it takes to queue, and the more likely the game dies. 
    [*]Providing a way for players to earn items in game gives them something to grind for. All of the most successful micro-transaction based games (see league of legends and fortnite) give you a way of earning [b]anything[/b] in game with enough play time. 
    [*]This facilitates a healthy player base by keeping folks engaged and giving them something to work toward - and consequently increases the longevity of the game by giving people of varying skill levels someone to play against while also providing a larger base to monetize from. In other words, if the krill go extinct, there's nothing for the whales to eat.
[/list]

[H3]Now - for all the retorts I can see coming from a mile away.[/H3]

[b]UM WELL, GET USED TO IT BUDDY, IT'S JUST CAPITALISM[/b]
[list]
    [*] True, it is just capitalism and I'll be sure to wait before ever buying another BAMCO product
    [*] I'll also be sure to hand wave your salt when you complain about how much your landlord charges you rent, how little your employer pays you, all while slurping up BAMCO micro-transactions
[/list]

[b]IT'S JUST $3.99 FOR COSMETICS, WHAT ARE YOU, POOR?[/b]
[list]
    [*] A fool and his money are soon parted
    [*] I'm probably richer than 99% of you losers
    [*] But I also don't frivolously throw my money away
    [*] As mentioned - this argument misses the point - Micro-transactions in and of themselves are not bad. How they are done is what makes them bad. 
    [*] I love supporting developers that show a lot of love and care for their communities. Some of these monetization choices are at best incompetent, and at worst anti-consumer and hostile.
[/list]

[b]STOP BEING ENTITLED!!![/b]
[list]
    [*] Like I said - I don't have a problem with supporting developers and paying for additional content. Micro-Transactions in and of themselves are not the issue - HOW they implemented it is.
    [*] I'm willing to pay for additional content to support the continued development of games I love. Always have.
    [*] As a result, this argument is essentially attacking an argument and behavior I never made or exemplify.

It is remarkable that people cannot hold two ideas at once in their head: that this game is a lot of fun and adds a bunch of features that are really neat (like the replay feature and labbing) while simultaneously criticizing the less than stellar parts related to the Tekken Shop.

I feel like the fighting game community has been so used to tolerating and taking shit with respect to HOW fighting game companies monetize that they have resigned themselves to apathetically accept that [b]This Is Just How Things Are™[/b]. Most fighting games have been straight-up pay 2 win the second they started offering advantages to those that paid money and its a shitty business practice that could be ameliorated by giving everyone an even playing field in practice mode.

I don't think I have come across any single monetization system that has been perfect. I've seen worse than Tekken 8 (see mobile games) and I've seen better (league of legends / DOTA / fortnite). Those that are better in my mind still have flaws (I hate randomized loot boxes when you pay cash), but again, at least there is a way of usually earning most, if not everything, by just playing the game. 

Overall, the fighting game community and tekken fans will get what they deserve based on whatever they are willing to tolerate. Perhaps their tolerance for burning their hard earned money and time is higher than mine.",1708554658,1708556092,False,10,0,0.532962679862976074,0,True,False,False

Last thing i wanna mention is how many resources there are to help you. The in game move list is expansive and the icons aren't confusing in the slightest when it comes to combo's and such. also having the ability to fight ghosts of yourself and other players has been paramount to my growth as a tekken player.

The fighting is some of the best I've ever experienced, the characters are almost all interesting and usually have something going for them to make them enjoyable, the music is at its worst okay and at its best amazing, and visually it looks fantastic. There is a lot of newcomer accessibility as well, which I appreciate as this is my first time really playing a Tekken game. But there are some things to be wary of.

I've had some performance issues. Understandable ones, considering my PC is several years old now, but it should be noted that the game will run seemingly fine and then on occasion just crashes out of nowhere. 
The singleplayer/offline content, while done well, is relatively short if that's what you're picking this game up for. The only way you'd get more than around 30 hours of playtime is if you engage in online play, or spend a lot of time in the various training modes, like practice, CPU fights, Super Ghost Battle, or the replay mode.
As with most online games, the community can be kind of toxic at times. It hasn't seemed too crazy to me, but you'll find ""plugging"" on occasion in online matches where people will quit out of the game before they lose a match, which is very frustrating and doesn't count as your win and doesn't really penalize the other player (though you can report them and there's supposedly effort going into coming up with a ban process for people who do that).

The most glaring issue though is controversial. I, at least, expected an online store function to be in this game, and on launch there wasn't but now that DLC characters and costumes are coming out, an ingame store is being established. I'm not really surprised and frankly am confused at some of the outcry against it, but the main problem is with the approach. By implementing the store after the game's release, many people have bought the game potentially thinking there wouldn't really be microtransactions, but now there are some and the rating can get retroactively affected as well. It seems naive to think there wouldn't be a store, but I also understand that it wasn't conveyed before that there would be one, so I can kind of see both sides to it in that regard. 

At the end of the day though, I still heavily recommend getting this game. While some of the approach to microtransactions seems kinda shady, it ultimately doesn't affect much about the game, especially if you don't have issues with purchasing cosmetics in games, either because you have enough money to buy them all no problem or you have the control not to spend on them. It may even be a GOTY contender considering how good it is, though fighting games are still niche enough that I doubt it would actually be nominated for something like that even without the controversy.",1706246525,1708553402,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jin has returned to the forefront of a new struggle, as well as a battle that goes beyond just the legacy of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Forced to reconcile his past and also the devil gene power within him, he finds himself dissonantly in the protagonist role once again. How does one tell a story that redeems a man that once set the world on fire and against itself? Remarkably, Bandai Namco comes full force with their best Tekken campaign by a long shot.

Gone are the terrible sins of 7's horrific non-protagonist and beyond lame narrator, 8 delivers all the hype of 7's final arc from the very beginning and rarely loses momentum as it exceeds it proportionately with a solid pace. Ignoring the many microtransactions and hazardous DLC ploys for those who did not pre-order the deluxe edition, at the very least -- it can be said that BN learned from 7 in regards of its singleplayer content.

Not all of the content is rich, per say, the juvenile near drivel of the cutesy arcade quest is adorable however. It is a glorified tutorial, but one of the first of its sort in a Tekken game that actually gets you to learn the game but also celebrate its competitive culture in a silly, albeit fun way. 

The actual story mode is beyond rediculous and falls hard on the tropes that were there from the beginning of the series. To critique anything seriously in Tekken's story is a fallacy in itself. The presentation of 7's solid story was absolutely abysmal and made it one of the worst stories in any fighting game as a result, despite having some of the best characterization in Tekken's history (as well as a satisfying end to one of fighting games' longest running rivalry arcs). Tekken 8 and the Character Episodes are a grand treat, however.

Both modes utterly flex the mechanical prowess of the engine and while the story mode doesn't always deliver on some of the things it promises, it cohesively nearing the greatness of Mortal Kombat's overproduced campaigns and I mean that in a very good way. That being said, the cutscenes present in Tekken 8 are truly artful, stylized, spirit filled and will not age for the next decade most likely unless huge innovations occur in the industry.

The game performs a bit poorly in its current state, but even Tekken 7, after a near decade of patches, chugs on my rig that can effortlessly play 2077 on high settings. Optimizing this game is some sort of magic us mortals will never know, but Tekken 8 will be very playable in the coming months, I am sure.

The character episodes are soulful, often hilarious and are great introductions to the characters for those unfamiliar with them. Tekken 8, narratively and setting wise, offers a lot to long time fans and newcomers alike.

But let's be honest, Tekken is all about the gameplay. And at first, I hated it.

When I got Tekken 8, I was still visiting Spain on extended vacation at the time and had the opportunity to get the full 'family on the couch' experience that is mandatory for appreciating Tekken at its best. And I have to say, local multiplayer in Tekken is still among the most unbeaten experiences one can have in modern times. Something about Tekken brings the young and old together and Tekken is both utterly accessible to everyone while also having an extremely high skill ceiling.

The downside is that this game is crushingly difficult at times. Tekken has always been a 50/50 dance of defense and offense depending on character and I've always favoured very reactive defense as a Tekken player. As a result, online and even IRL, I was getting absolutely stomped. Which was confusing, because I was definitely a high tier Tekken 7 player and had fairly recently played at a semi-competitive level with some local talent at a convention last year. 

Tekken 8 favours aggression, even arcadequest says this, that aggression is the name of the game. I spent many hours, utterly frustrated, that I was being beaten by cheap tricks and cheap characters (admittingly, King and Victor and even Bryan Fury can absolutely murder unskilled or non-adaptive players with little effort). I thought, briefly, maybe - I was finally too old for competitive fighting games.

That opinion shifted immediately when I remembered, this game just released and mostly the Tekken veterans are online grinding the ranked mode levels at this moment. You aren't just fighting a dedicated fighting game player, but someone who has cultivated Tekken skill generationally.

Tekken has been present in people's childhoods to their adulthoods, entire households have been raised with this game and started their own in-between releases. No matter how much adult life has separated some from these games, you can see the nostalgia and fighting spirit light up in people as they pick a familiar character they know by name and heart. Its incredible that even older generations, who remember the originals, can pick up and play, understanding the mechanics that have been passed down title to title. 

As far as fighting games go, Tekken is an inheritance. Like a wushu master that cultivates generations of martial skill through their family, I, too, had to tap into youthful knowledge and recruit my inner child to assist me in persevering through learning the new edge to this game.

Once I unlearned aspects of 7 and ""got"" Tekken 8, boy did I get it. I started getting ridiculous win streaks, perfects and had crafted an entirely new proactive defense play style with aggressive punishment, contrary to my previous method. The euphoria I felt, climbing the ranks and actually fighting people numerous ones above me with some relaxed ease once I became comfortable with the new flow and the combos of my selected character - few games will ever make me feel this again.

Much like 7, I can tell I will be returning to 8 for the next 8 years on and off. Socially, competitively or just for the sake of it on my own.

8 is not immune to some of the pains of the ever growing, capitalism-driven corporate industry of video game development - but for the price I paid for it, I'm happy to say I've gotten years of continuous memories and a new generation of skill-building has begun.

That being said, I absolutely can't wait for more patches and months to pass, when it will then be my turn to do some rookie-crushing, specifically the new faces to the franchise. However, in victory or defeat, they will inherit apart of my fighting spirit and with great perseverance, they will enter the Tekken family for life. Just as it had happened to me, so many years ago.

There are two devil genes inside you. One is Devil Jin. One is Devil Kazuya. They're both going to finish their rivalry, finally.

But alas, there is a secret third thing, to be discovered in this story...

The win turned slightly with SF6 which was the first fighting game I played that seemed to actually care about the new player experience, and T8 now has enough stuff to get newcomers on board that I am somewhat comfortable recommending this to people who want to get into the genre, but could not before.

I will add one asterisk however, T8 is a very hard game to learn properly. Despite all the tools the game gives you, if you buy it with the intent on going PvP you WILL get absolutely bodied. A lot of your initial experience Online will be a 2 minute slideshow of somebody not letting you hit any buttons and punishing you if you do.

So now they've revealed their cash shop scheme. This game cost $10 more than full price $60, so $100 in Trudeau Pesos. On top of that they have character DLC locked behind a paywall, unlike how DOTA2 and other competitive games release their characters for free, but sell customisation. Now they show why character customisation in base Tekken 8 is so barren, they locked out most of it behind another paywall.

Amazing. As expected of bandai namco.
Don't buy, please. Stay away from this game unless you can get it massively discounted.

So the guys working on proton managed to fix it themselves. So far switching to prioritize response makes online feel a lot better, though the game seems to slow down instead of getting choppy so it's probably not the kind rollback netcode that makes sense, or the type people were asking for. It's still better than Tekken 7 at least since you don't have matches where you feel like you're underwater and your inputs feel like they're 200 ms behind.

I'll probably change this to recommend if they ever fix online with steam deck / linux. But I'm not that hopeful since apparently this has been an issue since the betas.

The good: Offline modes like super ghost battle is really awesome for picking up new characters faster. Fighting against a ghost that slowly gets better as you do is much more productive than fighting against random battles against someone with a full gameplan.

The bad: to be honest this would be a recommend if it wasn't for the terrible regional pricing, lack of customization options (it's the same shirts with different patterns again), and the broken online (for steam deck and linux, can't say for windows). Also no team battle, not to be confused with tag team.

However, what nobody has been asking for is their recent rugpull with adding capcom-esque microtransactions post-launch after reviews have come out and everyone has had their hands on the game. On top of the already full-price you pay to get the game, it's a shame that it seems like everything released post-launch will have to be paid for as well. It's no wonder that the customization items were so barebones at launch... And it sucks because what's present with the current customization is quite nice, but unfortunately that will be the extent of your fun with it unless you decide to pony up some more cash. What's even more unfortunate is that no matter how much the community despises this, there's no doubt that whales will fund this profit-model into perpetuity, making it seem like a success on their end.

Not even to mention that this will probably destroy the mod community for this game, as I expect bamco to crack down on those releasing free user-made customization content to the public if they think that it'll lose them a few dollars. But, time will tell.

Another reason for a negative review is adding an in-game shop with predatory tactics into the game 1 month after launch. 
The predatory tactics include
- in-game currency (most likely sold in packs that are either lower or higher than the price of items)
- selling nostalgia ($4 a pop)
- adding ""promotional stuff"" for in-game money (essentially, free advertisment for the people who they are collabing with, imagine wearing a white T-Shirt with ""Cup Noodle"" on it and then going online to play, bringing the eyes to the brand of anyone who matches up with you and then if you get to a streamer's match, all his viewers will get to see it, free advertisement driven by players)

The customization in the game is weak, even compared to Tekken 7. In T6 and T5 in was leaps and bound of what we have right now and it was done purposefully so that you would get to the cash shop.

Also, there have been talks online regarding Namcops going after modders and taking down any mods that would compete with their shop. 
Right now, after 70 hours of playing the game I'm sitting on 118, 000 000 coins of in-game currency and even if I buy all the in-game items, I would still be left with around 116-117 million units of it. It's worth less than dust and is pointless.

To add insult to injury, the game costs $70 on release and the Premium and Deluxe editions cost even higher. Essentially, they are quadrupple dipping (base cost + premium edtions/collector's editions, season pass for characters/separate characters, skins) and the fourth addition would be in-game advertisiment in the form of the dome inside Game Lobby with the arcades and avatars, where Michael Murray said it would cost up to $1 mil to advertise there.

The unimportant things first. The Game looks outstanding, both from a technical view as well as from its asthetics. Probably the best Stages we had since T5, only Rebel Hangar is a bit boring.

Gameplay wise its still using the way Tekken plays since T6, but to such a refined Level, where combo routes make sense, tornado is probably the best bound we had, being somewhat of a mix of the classic bound and the T7 screw. There were a few changes to the movement, they reduced the time needed to recover from a backdash, allowing even beginners who cannot kbd to get a certain degree of movement into their gameplan. Sidestepping is stronger than in Tekken 7, however backdashing is weaker, on some characters more than on others.

The music is finaly good again.

Now for the bad part. Customisation is lacking again, and this week we learned why. Selling old, badly upscaled outfits for 4 bucks in a title thats over full price with dlc characters is a sad joke.

But, keep in mind, this company sold the game and is choosing to add microtransactions AFTER the fact, which feels very scummy. I've been really enjoying my short time with the game so far, but it also rubs me the wrong way how they waited until after reviews to do something they knew would be controversial.

The only upside is the pricing isn't near MK1 levels, but it's still unreasonable to charge $70+, a character pass then hide an upcoming shop for later.

For the long version, I was going to give this game the benefit of the doubt and not tear into it like I did T7...but its absolutely unacceptable. I enjoy this game, and I want it to be good, but I will not encourage anyone buy it until Bandai gets their act together.

This game was made to coddle new players, every character has a safe (or even plus) on block panic button now, if not several, characters like Victor, Jun, and Jin are made to enable people with 0 actual game knowledge to beat players significantly better than them. A lot of the harder characters too, have been scrubbified. I'm not great at Tekken, but character cheese has let me pulled tons of undeserved wins, as well as pull wins against players with thousands of hours in other Tekken games. Pair this with the fact that Tekken is incredibly complicated and learning basic mechanics such as sidestepping  (because moves randomly have tracking, or some strings realign you with a person stepping you, and some moves just have broken hitboxes), and you'll never actually 'learn' this game...only have to beat scrubs, without having someone who already has thousands of hours in Tekken to help you personally. 

Also 'Special' controls gives people one button electrics, need I say more? Everything else about it isn't that bad but...really? 

This game is comically poorly balanced, Jun can turn her punishable moves into safe moves by taking chip damage (damage you can heal back) to herself, and can deal 110 damage with unblockable followups. Dragunov has boss character frame data, who enables a 50/50 on block, and even if you guess right and block he's winning because he's plus AGAIN, the only way out is to make a possible hard read but your punishment for guessing wrong is (you guessed it), your entire life bar in that case.

This game has no anti-cheat, or enforcement for cheating, this includes scripting, macroing for easy just frame inputs, boosting, and even ragequitting...ragequitting counts as a loss for the person who left AND the person who beat them to the point of leaving, whether or not you're allowed to get a 'win' is entirely up to someone deciding to DC or not when they're going to lose. You could argue getting a 'win' marked on a server somewhere doesnt matter, and I would generally agree, however this is still a game that costs 70$ and it should at least function as a game where counts cant be falsified. 

Thats just one issue, players playing their router instead of the game is a massive issue, every few matches you'll run into a player whose connection magically drops after taking two rounds off them, or even as blatant as WHEN ITS YOUR TURN and ONLY THEN. 

And the biggest elephant in the room, the thing that tipped me over the edge and made me salty enough to loudly complain about everything else...They pretended to have 0 micro-transactions on launch, but now a month later are adding a 'Store' to the game to avoid backlash from influencers and reviewers for having them in the game at launch. They're trying to have their cake and eat it too, and they think we're stupid enough to not realize. Its likely why the in game outfits at launch are lacking compared to every other title; they were taken out before launch to be sold back to us. Well, I'm only slightly mentally ill, so your whale baiting isn't going to catch me.",1706242933,1708491615,False,0,0,0.512200355529785156,0,True,False,False

On the one hand, I bought the game day one as I am a huge fan and love Tekken and the demo sold me on it. 

After playing it as well I was happy. Great story mode, great single player modes, graphics are amazing. The replay mode has lots of features. Really awesome game. Love it. 

But I felt the customisation was really lacking for variety. They were good customisation in the form that everything felt like something the characters would fit into. They didnt look plopped on. Some did, but most were fitted well and very nice.

But the options were really limited. Which was surprising for a $70 game.

And then they announce the Tekken shop after the reviews came out and the burst of positivity around the game. Honestly,  very disappointed and I will be very weary with games coming from this publisher in the future.

Which is why this is so tough. 

The game itself is an easy recommendation for any fighting game fan. Really solid and well deserved praise.

But on the other hand I dont want these anticonsumer practices to win.

No more paying extra for frame data since it's now included. SUPER robust training mode that includes punishment practice, jumping into match replays, etc. Game runs great, feels great. The newcomers are awesome (Reina gang here), there is a ton of content you can do singleplayer/offline before even needing to jump online. Lots to like,

Online seems... okay? I've had some pretty good feeling connections, and a couple REALLY laggy wifi games (which is par for the course with online games; please get an ethernet wire if you are able to guys, it is SO much better trust me). I haven't played enough online against far away opponents to give a full opinion about the netcode but one REALLY stutter-y input laggy mess of a match is already enough to tell me that there are certain connection conditions this game's netcode won't be able to handle, so bear that in mind when you're choosing your online opponents.

**EDIT: After spending some time in ranked mode with the online, I can confirm the game does have functional rollback! Long distance connections should feel good on standard. Wifi will be a 50/50 unless you priorities fluidity (but please please PLEASE, if you can play on ethernet you should)

Tekken 8 also has the most advanced practice mode ever created for a fighting game, including the ability to watch online matches for tips.  On the replay, you can even take control of your character and determine what you ""should"" have done.

They also introduce a arcade quest mode, which is very beginner friendly and fun at the same time.  They really nailed the ability for a complete newcomer to enjoy the game with some easy mode features.  With that said, this game has more depth than any fighter I've seen, and a person can really push the skill ceiling.

Once you get into your character, there's nothing like learning all the details of what moves to execute when, and man those online matches are competitive and fun.  The only downside is right now they haven't solved ""plugging"" where your opponent disconnects when they begin losing.  Luckily the devs just announced they are working to resolve that problem.

Ну начнем по порядку: 
1 - наконец-то нормальный визуал ,а то как-то теккен 7 посасывал с приличным заглотом у мк11 , но энивей мое знакомство с файтингами началось с мк1(12).
2 - обучение новых игроков . Хорошо сделано , думаешь что тебе все понятно и в принципе относительно легко , пока не зайдешь в онлайн))
3 - кастомизация. Сделать себе луфи и Сайтаму ну тут определенно лайк. 
С этим плюсы игры для меня закончились.
Началось самое интересное , я зашел в онлайн. 
Первые мои бои решил пойти в анранкед , думал поиграю посмотрю что вообще тут происходит и тут мне первым же боем кидает последний оранжевый ранг , он хуярит меня всем чем можно и я геймпадом в рука сижу и пытаюсь хоть что-то понять. Мои мучения закончились со счетом 3-0 и я подумал , ну бывает , и регнул еще одну и тут мне попадается гарью и хуярит меня абсолютно так же . По итогу регнув еще парочку ниже оранжевого ранга мне не попадались . Ладно, пошел рейтинг и наконец-то встретил таких же как я и начал совмещать теорию с практикой.

Отдельно хочется сказать про Лоу в этой игре , я не знаю каким нужно быть мангустом , что бы на них реагировать из просто надо угадывать) 
Персонажи с бесконечными миксапами (напоминаю что Лоу имба) , и если ты не знаешь эту серию , то тебя ей и заспамят и персонажи с бесконечными плюсами . 
Ебучие захваты наносят миллион дмг в игре где мид пробивает сидячий блок , это что шутка , так мало того не знаешь на что рвется определенный захват , готовься с постоянному его спаму. 
Бесконечные серии с лаунчерами и контрхитами , которые еще и выводят на нормальные комбо (у Клаудио единственный нормальный контр хит df2 имеет 13 кадров , но он одиночный))
Ну и хотелось бы еще отметить импут , да , возможно дело привычки , но вводить df db uf ud с это системой считывания кнопок превращается в меш по 100тыс. нажатий ради одного мува и про 1+2/3+4 тоже не забываем. 
Анимации ударов это тоже , что-то с чем-то, визуально отличить хай и мид возможно в 20% случаев , остальное ты должен выучить , молчим про паниши , которые должны вводиться моментально и ты еще должен знать какая из миллиона серий имеет подходящий для паниша фрейм , так и прием которым можно это сделать (с этим конечно же проще). 
Подытожим - если вы хотите потратить хренову тучу времени на изучение этой игры когда попутно вас будут чикрыжить мешеры и «старички» , можете брать. А если хотите переодически заходить ради удовольствия , то вам в покупке этой игры - отказано, потратьте их на более приятные вещи , от этой игры вы точно не кайфанете.",1708465158,1708465158,False,2,0,0.474315881729125977,0,True,False,False

This tradition was a hallmark of the Tekken experience, offering players the freedom to personalize their fighters in numerous ways without extra costs. Until Tekken 7, this approach was consistent and greatly appreciated.

However, with Tekken 8, there was a noticeable shift. The game launched with a surprisingly limited set of customization options, leaving many of us wondering about the change. The recent announcement from Bandai Namco about introducing microtransactions and an in-game currency for additional customization pieces has shed light on this issue. It seems the initial limitations were by design, aimed at moving towards a pay-to-customize model.

The essence of Tekken, for many of us, wasn't just in the combat but also in the creative freedom it offered. Moving to a model where players are expected to pay for that creativity marks a departure from what made the series so beloved. While the need for developers to explore new revenue streams is understood, the way it's been introduced in Tekken 8 could have been handled better to maintain the franchise's integrity and its relationship with the community. Tekken stood out in the gaming world for its commitment to value and player respect. Introducing these paid elements without clear communication beforehand feels misleading and undermines the trust and loyalty of the fanbase.

After careful consideration, I've decided to keep the game even though my first impulse was to request a refund. Despite feeling cheated, I still find enjoyment in it—but I believe it's important to inform others about these changes and let them decide for themselves.",1708461398,1708461925,False,146,9,0.635198652744293213,0,True,False,False

- Backdashing isn't as good, forcing you to stay closer to your opponent.
- Reversals lose to Hop Kicks, but Chickening is gone (more than a fair trade in my opinion).
- Counter Hit Throws (normal Tech Windows are i20-ish, depending on the Throw. Whilst Counter Hit Throws makes the Tech Window go down to i10-ish, also depending on the Throw).
- Chip Damage is a fantastic addition. Chip Damage cannot kill you. Instead, Chip Damage takes away Chipped Health, which you can gain back by hitting your opponent; Either on Hit or Block, you will gain that Health back. It really incentivizes you to get in there if you want to stay in the game. Rage Arts also take away ALL Chipped Health, giving Rage Arts some much needed utility. This can be huge for gaining an extreme amount of value for some huge comebacks.
- Heat is such a cool mechanic. For those who are familiar, Heat is very similar to Soul Charge from Soul Calibur. It allows you to play so much more aggressively. It even goes far enough to change the properties or Frame Data of certain moves whilst active. This allows you to go for new Frame Traps, or opens up the opportunities to set up Unbreakable Throws, depending on the character you're playing of course. 

I really feel as if the competitive scene for this game is going to be extremely exciting.

As for Single Player content, Tekken 8 has reshaped how you approach Arcade. Instead of you loading into matches immediately (although that is still an option), you're introduced to an Avatar Creator. These Avatars resemble XBOX 360 Avatars, which is very nostalgic for me. Although the customization is a little limited for them, it's extremely charming. You then follow a small story line, where you go to individual Hub Areas and play against the NPC Avatars in the area. It's really cute, and makes Arcade have an extreme sense of charm. The way that Treasure Battles work is when you load in, you just look for the NPCs who have a little Treasure Box next to their name. If you beat them, you get the Treasure. Pretty simple. When you beat the story line for this Arcade Mode, you're then introduced to one of the coolest things; Super Ghost Battle.

Super Ghost Battle is a mode that allows you to fight against... yourself. As you play the game, the game is compiling how you like to play; Your movement, Combos, etc. then gives all of that data to an AI. As you fight your Ghost, it will actively learn from you and pick up new habits as you go along; Your set-ups, how you play footsies, etc. It's really cool. It isn't perfect, it definitely needs a little work, but Ghosts are such a cool idea. As neat as this is, this alone wouldn't be so great though. What makes Ghosts so freaking cool, is that you can download other Player's Ghosts. If you're nervous about playing Online, either look up or approach a Player, download their Ghost and learn how to approach that person's character without the stress of just hopping straight in. This is an incredible tool for not only newcomers, but also for people who would like to learn at their own pace and take things one step at a time. If you're playing online and you just can't figure out that match-up, download that person's Ghost and really try to nail it down. 

Another way that the game helps you learn is the Replay System. Instead of just simply watching back your gameplay, there are mechanics built into the Replay System that directly help you learn! You blocked a move that you could've Punished? The game literally pauses and tells you what you could've Punished with! Got grabbed by a Throw and didn't know how to Tech out of it? Want to try it out yourself in real time to get a feel for it? You can take direct control of your character during the Replay and experiment to get the hang of those situations. This is so, so sick! What an amazing idea!

All in all, I feel as if Tekken 8 is an amazing game on it's own. If $70USD is a little steep for you, keep an eye on this game for when it goes on Sale. If you're a fan of learning Fighting Games, this is a definite must-play. The learning experience is beyond extreme-- Most would say it's too much. But Tekken 8 has truly made learning the game easier than ever with the tools that they provide you.

HOWEVER

The Bad:

I cannot endorse you buy this game at full price because once again sleazy anti consumer business tactics have reared it's ugly head once again and the publisher of Tekken 8 Bandai Namco Entertainment have chosen to prioritise DLC and in game market places over Game balance and making Tekken 8 the best possible game it could be. 

Not only have Bandai Namco Entertainment decided to add an in game shop, they did so sneakily by waiting a month after release to announce that it would be added, very much tricking a lot of the initial buyers who might've otherwise given Bandai much needed criticism and backlash for this decision. 

I could simply be screaming into the void; a lot of ""Gamers""(TM) simply do not care about big corporations doing these things to them so long as they perceive the game to be good. And to those people, fine, whatever, it's your money buy a Lili  costume if you want that's your prerogative.

However I would not recommend buying this game in the current state if you are interested in playing ranked online. The game does not punish ragequitters whatsoever, and the display of disconnection rate for the player is not incrementing even if you disconnect, it will always show 0%. Players who have blatantly cheated since Tekken 7, even on stream, have yet to be punished and are at the time of this writing topping the leaderboards. Bamco simply does not care about competitive integrity in the online mode, only offline. We only got empty threats from Murray and Harada that cheaters would be banned but nothing has actually happened.

Another worrying aspect is the predatory microtransactions that are being introduced into the game. Bamco removes customization options more and more from every game, and Tekken 8 is by far the most barebones so far. Not only is the player customization lackluster, they have the audacity to one month after release introduce the ""tekken shop"", where you can buy ""premium"" scam coins with real money to purchase legacy costumes for the equivalent of 4 euros which were always free before. In game currency is obviously predatory practice to make more money of the consumers who already paid 70 euros for the base game, and they also clearly did not include this on release to avoid bad reviews on launch. They are even going so far as to copyright strike videos of mods for legacy customes out of corporate greed.

I actually don't even dislike the game. I think the heat mechanic is fun and changes the game as they intended it to.

Let's start with pros. Jukebox for everyone. Somewhat improved tutorial in Arcade quest. I LOVE REINA. She is such an awesome new character and actually has lore and relevance to the story. Unlike poor Gigas, Josie, Katrina and Lucky Chloe whose only character development came in the form of episodes. I love how 3 is just basically movement and how she embodies a lot of Heihachi's style. Good design too. SKIP ABLE OUTROS. WHY FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY WAS THIS NOT AN UPDATE IN TEKKEN 7. 

EDIT: Story mode is actually very good and a huge improvement over 7 in every way. Character episodes are fine, but a lot of characters involvement with the story were superficial and not important. I was hyped to see Hwoarang, but disappointed when he didn't have any significant impact on the story. Still no brownie points for having a good story mode because one, it's not hard to improve over the trash that was Tekken 7's story and 2, any good game that costs 103 CAD$ has a good story mode by default.

I honestly cannot think of too many pros that aren't just expected of a video game at this point. Good balancing isn't a pro, a functional game isn't a pro and having online modes isn't a pro. HAVING FRAME DATA is bare minimum requirement. These among other factors constitute a bare minimum experience for people and do not deserve brownie points. 

There are a lot of cons and they outweigh the pros because of how prevalent/frustrating they are. 

Con 1: Input eating. This was really really bad in Tekken 7 and it's one of the main reasons I ended up not trying to get better at the game because once I hit Raijin, it became apparent just how awful the input eating was. I tried everything from different computers, controllers, keyboards, Bluetooth, cable and nothing worked. However, the input eating in Tekken 8 is not as bad and no where near as frequent. I could never pin down what caused it in T7, but I suspect it had something to do with the net code. How I mitigate/eliminate it entirely is beyond me and I pray to Harada it is fixed. 

Con 2: lack of offline modes. Story mode is a minimum requirement, vs is a minimum requirement, arcade mode is a minimum requirement for fighting games. None of these things constitute a positive. Tekken ball gets extra points for not being paid DLC. But seriously? The character episodes feel the same as Tekken 7. I'm not a fan of the new cinematic story mode and I enjoy Tekken 4-5 story telling much more, but that's a personal preference. Either way, a frequent complaint myself and many others had with Tekken 7 was the lack of offline content to wash the pissy taste of ranked out of your mouth. No team battle, no survival, no time attack, no goofy lore like Devil Within, nothing. Same goes for Tekken 8. Bare minimum requirement do not get any praise even if they are good. 

Con 3: DLC BEING ANNOUNCED EVEN BEFORE THE FUCKING GAME RELEASED R U KIDDING ME BAMCO. ""BUTTT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAAAAA HOW LONG IT TAKES TO DEVELOP CHARACCTERRRSS"" stfu. Then release the game later. We had already waited 10 years, I'm sure a few extra months to ensure characters that have been in the game since Tekken 3 wouldn't kill bamco. (I would much rather have an obscure character that has been forgotten like Bruce or a new character over Eddy as DLC.) There is no defending this, stop brown nosing.

Con 4: Lars and Alisa. No explanation needed.

Con 5: Azucena and French Noctis feel a bit like wasted opportunities. Azucena's gane plan seems somewhat unique, and her dodge mechanics are interesting. But a lot of her move set is recycled from Brunce, Josie and Fahkumram and I'd much rather have one of them over her. AND YES, that is because I mained all of them in previous games. Anyway, Azucena does have some unique moves, but they look hella dumb. I really, really, dislike dancing characters in fighting games. I hated Lucky Chloe, and I have Azucena's dancing. It looks dumb as hell. Personality is equally as annoying, vapid and void as Lucky Chloe too. The game refers to her style as ""MMA"" but it doesn't resemble MMA aside from the kick boxing/muay thai moves they took from Brunce, Josie and Fahkumram. Just looks like a hyper coffee girl who needs to chill out on the caffeine. Lackluster design too, could be the lack of personality/development though. 

My first experience French Noctis was really funny because I remember saying ""he wouldn't have the b and b 2 spam combo like Noctis, would he?"" Lo and behold I go to practice mode and DF2 and 2 spam Yeah, somewhat the same B n B combo. Not an issue though, most of his other combo inputs feel very unique and aren't copying from Noctis, I just thought this was funny. A professional Noctis player actually broke down the main differences between French Noctis and Nocits fairly well, but I still felt a lot of moves, animations, some combos, and game plan was recycled from Noctis. Which is fine,  I also mained Noctis and I'll miss him, so French Noctis is a nice addition, but feels very lackluster and not like a new character because of this. Not an extreme negative like with Azucena through. 

Con 6: Rage arts. I have hated rage arts since Tekken 6 and I still hate them. A big complaint a lot of people had and myself is that rage arts slow down the game. Having a one button combo that can kill if you're both low health sucks. Yeah, yeah, block and punish, duhhhh bait it out, duhhhh it's not used in high level plaaayyy, then why is it included? If it's such a bad awful, stinky, useless mechanic that only finds its use in low level play and high level play combos, why include it? Rage drives were the best thing to happen to rage arts, but of course those are gone. Rage arts are also antithetical to this games new aggressive game play. Uh oh, better stop being aggressive because they have a rage art that will kill you or do 55% unearned damage with one butttonnn. It's silly at this point especially when they claim and advertise Tekken 8 as aggressive. Rage arts are stinky.

Con 7: Crashes, save file corruption, random hitching when playing online. All of these issues will be eventually fixed, so not an extreme negative. But it adds to the shit pile. Edit. These issues have not been fixed ...

Con 8: Customisation is somehow worse with each game and now I can't mix and match different parts of their outfits with different pants, shoes or shirts? Come on, Bamco.

Con 9: Tekken Metaverse. The avatars are so low effort. Why no 3D models like SF6? God forbid a 3D game should have 3D avatars. Cheaper to make Tekken Metaverse I guess.

EDIT. Con 10: As I have been playing, I have been getting consistent crashes both online and offline. Luckily, I haven't got any during ranked matches, but I have during quick play.

Edit: Are you brown nosers satisfied yet? Added MTX store added after launch, I wonder why. Keep brown nosing though.

I have been playing Tekken since 4, I started playing seriously in Tekken 7 and made it to low blue ranks with all of my mains. I genuinely like this game, but my liking is hampered by the extreme negatives. We are allowed to complain about a 103 CAD$ (after taxes) game. This is a finalised and charged for product. This isn't the beta or network testing. THIS IS A FULLY RELEASED GAME THAT COSTS A DAY'S WORTH OF WORK. Customisation was an issue during beta that was ignored and now is part of the full game. Quit telling people they aren't allowed to complain and quit brown nosing. The only way this game will get better and get the fixes it needs is if people complain.",1706827140,1708451202,False,4,2,0.400428086519241333,0,True,True,False

As a long time Tekken fan (since Tekken 3), i am insanely dissapointed. 
Announcing microtransactions month after game release, just after getting good starter sales and PR is predatory. You see, enough time have passed and i cant even refund this after hearing the news. Well played bamco, you played me.

What they basically did was implementing the worst character customization since forever with the idea of selling classic costumes as a 4$ skins each later, which, guess what, they did not announce at the start, because why would you be transparent with your customers when u can act like they are idiots and milk them later? If u go to the internet u'll see a lot of useful idiots defending this, so strategy is clearly working.

Dont forget that its a 70$ game by itself, with announced dlc packs, that u need to buy if u want to play some of the Tekken's classis characters that were here forever, but again, why would you add them in basic version of the game, if you can sell it as a dlc later? Some of them, or the famous Tekken archetype in case of capoiera(Eddy/Christie) was here for 20+ years straight, and now are not in the basic game, but dont worry, they are your hype season 1 dlc(Eddy Gordo) so prepare to the next transaction!

Here's the list of awesome and important characters in the Tekken Universe that were cut just to be sold as a dlc later:
Eddy, Julia, Anna, Lei, Bob, Armor King. There are many others, its just the obvious ones. And all of them will sell like hot cakes as a dlc, because tekken fans love them.

Harada is famous for ""dont ask me for shit"" quote. I guess asking for not being insanely greedy is just too much, eh?

Do not ask anything.

Generally feature rich, replays are good, training mode is good, and story mode is pretty sick. There's Tekken Ball and the Customization options, and the Arcade quest seems like a decent onboarding tool for beginners. It feels complete.

As always, tekken is an amazingly sick fighting game experience when you are playing against your friend you play against all the time, or deathmatch against a total stranger for an hour learning the matchups together. When you aren't bogged down by trying to remember shit about each character every 10 minutes, tekken can really come together for anyone. Sidestepping and punishing feels incredible, ducking a high and blowing up your opponent makes you feel like a genius, and the combos feel really cool and good to pull off. The sound design is on point as always, and this time around the camera work (the slowdowns, zoom ins on big counterhits) are fucking rad, and the supers are actually awesome this time around as well. Not to go too in-depth in the actual gameplay, but heat seems to be a totally 'fine' addition to the game. I can't speak on character changes, but sidestepping has been buffed which encourages players to actually play tekken how it's meant to be played, and that's rad too.

Unfortunately, there's still a couple pretty major problems. The primary one is that tekken is very intentional about NOT reducing the friction in going from low/intermediate play to high level play. One could argue that adding red/yellow/blue hitsparks to each move would only serve to save players the time and effort of going into training mode to figure out what type of move it is. It's so silly that moves from previous games have been changed from mid to high or high to mid, without the animation changing effectively at all. There's no intuition about it, which is why the additional friction of choosing to NOT allow the players to have that information is so frustrating. I'm a grown ass man, and even though I love the complex interplay you develop between two characters with 100 moves, I HATE the fact that you can't learn a damn thing in the heat of battle, and you have to stop your ranked session to go into training mode to see what that move was or did.

Hell, there's even some pretty easy solutions to this that AREN'T adding colored hitsparks. You could have ""Go into training mode against this character"" after a match just like in Street figthter, and would be practically no effort at all. OR a ""watch replay"" button, which also is in its entirely own menu.

It's wild that when you go into training mode/replay mode and change a bunch of settings (show frame data, go backturn, etc) that shit won't persist for the next time you go into that mode. If I spent 4 minutes combing through Dragunov's movelist so I can practice defending against various things at once, I should not have to do that again the next time I want to try it. Same goes for spectator mode, you shouldn't have to open up that silly menu to turn on the opponents inputs and frame data and attack level even though that's CLEARLY the reason you're there. Like I said before, it's just that little additional friction between intermediate and high level play that really pisses me off, because they're so close to greatness. But it's 2024: Demanding that your game be the only game someone plays in order to even be good enough to ""play the whole game"" feels icky as hell. Respect people's time, Harada.

Overall, this is clearly a good game. Tekken 7 was a halfway-decent game, and this is an improvement on all fronts. If you have no intention of really getting into grinding it competitively, then you don't have to worry about any of that friction stuff, and there's totally enough here for you to enjoy, so I'm comfortable giving this game a light recommendation.

It's one of those tekken games that I will revisit just because of the ghost battles and smarter AI than 7. It is scummy that they release the tekken shop after release to avoid negative reviews for implementing microtransactions (remember when they talk crap on DOA for pointing out Namco selling frame data for 7? I still do, well look where we are.) but I can just ignore that, after all, it's just a company wanting to capitalize on the hype and popularity of their IP. We're familiar, every company has done it and tbh I'm not surprised at all. And, it's up to you if you're spending on that anyway. 

In the end, this is truly the tekken game for everyone. I praise them for including the helpful features to learn the game, they are appreciated. The use of AI for the ghost is impressive, not perfect but there's big potential there. The game is well optimized (find that guide to optimize the game further), runs 60 fps all the time for all stages. Just like everyone, the game crashes for me sometimes, been a problem since Tekken 7. Oh and they are not banning pluggers at all so don't bother using the report feature. They will ban you on the live stream chat if you keep requesting anything though which is arguably a more taxing process than programming something automated to ban pluggers temporarily.

TLDR;
Huge improvement from Tekken 7 with a multitude of features on release. Lots of offline content to enjoy, with tutorials/tools to help improve at the game. Online works really well on launch with a newly improved replay system. Customization is a bit lacking. Arguably the best Tekken release to date.

Wow, just wow. Where to start? This is one of the best launches for a modern video game I've seen in a long time, let alone a fighting game. Tekken 8 is incredibly feature rich upon release with more to come. There are so many tools that help improve your game-play as a beginner and veteran alike, from the in-depth practice mode, punishment training, combo challenges, to arcade quest.
As an offline component, arcade quest is a great way to drip feed information of how to play Tekken for beginners while also introducing the new heat system for veterans in a well contained story of fighting in arcades making your way up to the world stage.
By the end of that, the big offline feature is the super ghost battles, where the game learns how players play certain characters and simulate them as a ""ghost"", which you can train and upload/download them to fight against.

As for story mode, Tekken 8's story completely demolishes the story mode from its predecessor Tekken 7. It's actually refreshing to see the entire cast interact with each other that makes the Tekken world feel truly lived in (yes, all 32 characters in the base roster have time to shine in the story, and many of the Tekken 3 original cast are finally relevant to the main plot again). Bamco has embraced the absurdity of the mainline story and cranked it to 11, and honestly it benefits from it, making it such an enjoyable ride and wrapping it up in a satisfying conclusion.

I'm surprised that online works as well as it does while also being able to support cross-play ON DAY ONE. The fights online have very little lag if at all and you can adjust your matchmaking settings to search for the best connection possible. One of the HUGE improvements to online matches is the replay system. You can replay a fight and the game will automatically pause to give you feedback on how you can punish your opponent in certain situations, then you can try it out by taking control of the replay to see how you can execute that specific move.

As for the bonus stuff, Jukebox makes a return, allowing you to customize what songs you want to play in every stage of the game, including menus. The fact that all the music from EVERY Tekken game is in Jukebox was an unexpected boon too. Tekken ball also returns and is more fun than ever. I think the biggest criticism I have is that the character customization could be better. The most in-depth customization can alter appearances is colour differences, which is mildly disappointing, though I wasn't jumping into this with expectations of Tekken 6/Tag Tournament 2 levels of customization.

Another criticism would be the value proposition of the game editions. Ultimate edition only adds avatar skins and customization options which is a bit pricey compared to Deluxe and Base. Even then, the value of the Deluxe edition could be questionable since it includes a year pass for the first 4 DLC characters, which is still a mystery outside of Eddy Gordo being the first one. Most people would recommend the base game and MAYBE the Deluxe edition if you really want the next 4 playable characters.

All in all, one of, if not the best entry to the Tekken franchise and can't wait to see how this game expands with more to come as we wait for DLC characters and content.",1706597110,1708437378,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is feature rich, addicting, deep, has amazing training tools, excellent tools to bring in new comers, everything. 

And all of it is flushed immediately down the toilet because the developers refuse to address a nearly 10 year old problem: plugging. There is 0 penalty for rage quitting in ranked-- in fact, you can break your opponents win streak just by closing the game. The message from the developers is loud and clear: you should cheat. All you will lose is your dignity, and people who plug obviously don't have any to begin with. 

I just cannot recommend this game until this shit is addressed. Tekken 7 at least they told you how often your opponent disconnected (this could be reset, but it required some effort), but there was still no penalty, so people did it constantly. It is even more rampant in 8. It isn't just a few people doing this, I get plugged on every third match. When I watch streams, I always see a plug. Its pathetic. 

I am not a developer or programmer, but games with way WAY smaller budgets have implemented systems where DC = lose. If you don't have a stable internet connection, this game is not going to be enjoyable for you anyway. There is just no excuse for this bullshit after so long.

It will remain to be seen how heat played out but right now during the honey moon phase the game is really fun. The game continues to do what Tekken does best: offer a fighting game package in which there is enough depth that you can pour 1000's of hours into the game and still have things to explore, but is also accessible enough that new players can hop in, find a character that seems cool and mash away. Heat is definitely a powerful mechanic, but I was surprised to find that there is quite a bit of strategy and decision making surrounding how to use it effectively. The meta does fall into how well you can use heat so it is absolutely the defining factor in matches but how to use heat has some depth to it. I think that in subsequent patches, the strength of some heat moves will be tuned down, as T7 slowly lowered the power of certain characters over time. But I think we're in a period now where the game feels explosive and fun, which honestly is great for the first season of a game. Refinement can be the flavor of the game over a long lifespan, but the first few months-year I'm okay with being a slugfest personally.

To me the biggest drawbacks are QOL and optimization. Currently there is no benchmark to play online, so if another player's PC cannot properly run the game, the game will stutter. They really need to add a benchmark / recommended for online setting type of system to 1) reduce stuttering 2) not alienate the players on lower power PC's but instead guide them to the correct settings to reduce stuttering. There are many upscaling options but how they work are a blackbox. 

The other issue is the complete lack of infinite matches and poorly optimized user experience. FT2 in ranked is fine, but having player matches and lounge matches also be FT2 makes no sense. In a game as difficult as Tekken, it can be really difficult to learn match ups if new players are only encountering 1 character on a 32 roster every once in a while and then for only a 2, maybe 3 games at best. Also searching for lobbies needs to be implemented. I am part of a discord community and when we are trying to play with players in other platforms and are unable to invite via stream, it becomes a game of refreshing the available lobbies over and over until our lobby comes up. 

Overall, I love Tekken and I think this is a great game for newcomers and veterans a lot. If you go into this game with the right mindset, it's just the best.",1708275966,1708275966,True,7,0,0.566000163555145264,0,True,False,False

This might be a problem for you, or, if you have friends who play, it might not be a problem. Depends on how you enjoy TEKKEN.

Online stuff aside, I am very pleased with the game itself.

The game feels different enough from TEKKEN 7, while being still very similar. I play Bryan, and he feels really effective and fun, all his best moves are still in there and he got a couple 'new' ones, or they're easier to execute or something. I've had to play all of the characters at least a little bit thanks to the story but also just because there's something fun to get out of each one of 'em.

The big change I think is, what I would say are improvements to the formula by the inclusion of 'heat'? Heat mode? Heat meter? It feels versatile in that you can use it to keep up pressure and keep your momentum going and you can use it to try and get your turn back. That much is cool, I'm into that. It feels like a refined version of rage drives from T7, which, were okay but I found myself not using that often. Heat in T8 is like something you can do in addition to your rage and you can use it at any time, and I think that's just great.

It does mean literally everyone has a meter of some kind now, kind of, for example with Bryan it means he can use Snake Eyes moves for free in exchange for a bit of meter when in heat mode. So that's sort of weird for TEKKEN but I'm okay with it. It's not at all intrusive and once you've used it a couple times it really is intuitive, it fits your character's kit in a way that makes sense and it fits the game seamlessly. It's not 'gems' from SFxT or whatever, it's not some poorly thought out additional layer to the game that gets in the way or has a weird meta you have to learn or whatever. It's still TEKKEN. I had my doubts at first but was quickly won over.

The practice mode by the way will just tell you if moves are plus or minus on block or on hit and by how many frames too, so, that's pretty sweet. I haven't spent all that much time in training so far but the little I have spent I learned a ton just by throwing out random moves and seeing what was fast and what was slow and what was safe on block and for how much, and it's great. Really pleased with that addition.

The character selection is decent, I think many of the important bases were covered. I knew we weren't getting Eliza, Geese, Akuma back and I didn't play them that much anyway or well, only really for fun, but I'm still disappointed. At least having Eliza would have been nice... and thinking about it actually it seems kind of a surprise to me that we got several new characters for T7 that are just not even present in this one. I feel bad for Eddy players, people who liked Lucky Chloe, and I'm disappointed that Heihachi is completely gone - Reina has absorbed seemingly some of his moves, hardly all. But anyway, overall it's 'solid' and the inevitable DLC will probably round things out a bit. 

Given how much work has to go into all these crazy HD new models and textures and getting the voice actors back and all the rest, like wow, how many more can they even do, or will they even want to do? But I guess we'll see.

On the subject of DLC & pricing I really kind of can't believe how aggressively priced the game is. I'm glad that they haven't pimped it out with extra costumes and that kind of nickel & dime trash, but wow! $105 AUD for the standard edition? And we know there's season passes - plural, season passes - coming, since they only promise like the first one in the big package or whatever. Not too happy about that.

The whole development of this game feels simultaneously really expensive and sort of cheap at the same time, expensive in terms of they have clearly spent a bit of money on a lot of CG cutscenes, voice actor talent, making all the highest definition character models and all sorts of that stuff. And I can only assume everything had to be made fresh after T7 because all the new T8 character models don't... look like the T7 models. So they just had to redo everything I guess. Once upon a time that wouldn't surprise me, really, but nowadays... anyway I suspect we'll be seeing them for T9, I bet that was part of the plan, they're thinking long-term, and that's what feels cheap. We have Lee, but no Violet, who was probably cut for time/money reasons. So, again, feels cheap.

In addition, if you see T7 outfits in customization, those feel like the materials aren't quite up to spec or match the nicer brand new materials made for T8, not sure on that, just an observation. And so, I guess I can mention the customization. The T7 customization was a bit limited, but in this game it feels so limited that I really am at the point now where I ask - why even bother.

SOULCALIBUR VI has great customization, in fact it's really impressive, they have a great huge focus on that as a selling point to the game and they make it all about that, and it's great. It's incredibly robust. They invested in that and it really shows.

And this is harsh, but TEKKEN 8 has customization that just is not good enough. It feels obligatory. These two video games shouldn't necessarily be compared in this way, that's not what I'm saying either here, but my point is that if you aren't going to put the effort in, why spend the money and the dev time on making it and making it not all that well, when you could have just made like one or two more unique outfits for each character...? That's just my opinion anyway. The limited customization I've done on my characters is mostly just recolor the outfits I like, using the unique, per-character outfits that are noticeably significantly higher quality than many of the generic options.

So yeah that annoys me too.

Anyway, aside from that, singleplayer stuff. The story this time around was... good, it wasn't as great as T7, it wasn't quite as exciting, it felt like very little happened despite how long it was, they invented a Tekken Force-like mode which I don't think can even be played at all outside of the story so I'm not sure why they spent the time/money developing it? And, the story ends somewhat inconclusively in my opinion, and only raises more questions that I guess now we have to wait for TEKKEN 9 to get answers to, so that's a real 'see you guys in seven years' moment!

The weird arcade adventure 'mii' thing was alright though it wasn't all that engaging, it was just like tolerable to sit through mostly, it didn't really have strong characters or anything, I am not altogether sure again why they wasted time/money on it. I assume it may have had something to do with trying to help newer players get invested in TEKKEN, to help teach them things. The best it was for me was, it at least help teach me what the new mechanics are and how to utilize them, because I didn't really pay attention to pre-release video or anything, I just bought the game on release day.

I feel like many players curious about fighting games more just need to learn to face the game with the right attitude which is, losing is almost better than winning because it means you have a new avenue of improvement to take, and TEKKEN 8 can show you your replays and you can at least look at what you were doing when you lost and before you lost and see where you went wrong and what the other guy was doing. That's probably more valuable to know about than, doing a 70 damage combo or whatever.

Overall TEKKEN 8 is good. Some flaws, but it's good. I'm happy with it.",1708261526,1708261526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been a Marshal Law player since Tekken 4, I have felt that the moves for law have been neglected for quite some time, but everything is so refined in this game, it's smooth and the transitions for each character doesn't seem forced.

A small upgrade which has made a massive difference for me is the online matches, super fast match ups and rematches have no ridiculous waiting times which is a big win for the game.

Few new mechanics make the game more aggressive, but still more fun and not too overpowering for experienced players. I can't imagine how difficult this game might be like for people who have never played, but it still has a cool arcade mode to teach them how to play Tekken so this game does accomodate for everyone.

Besides that story mode is much better than what we had in T7, ability to use music from previous games are nice. So kudos there. Netcode is better than T7 but I think it could still use some improvements like having a benchmark filter in addition to bars. And maybe try making it closer to offline if possible, option to remove effects which causes lag completely.

BE ADVISED: Many prominent players have noticed a somewhat significant quality in online games when playing wired connections vs. WiFi connections, and I can say I've had similar experiences. If your wireless connection has/had occasional issues in other games like Street Fighter 6, it might be time to start running that Ethernet cable. Wired online feels noticeably better.

+ Looks good (unreal 5 goes hard)
+ Feels good (core game is fun asf, online works well enough to give serious time to)
+ Sounds good (this soundtrack goes nuts)
+ Strong launch roster (no 2D gimmicks this time around)
+ Heat system adds cool options that don't feel too overpowered
+ Plenty of modes and options to keep you entertained
+ Story mode has a surprising amount of variety
+ Character customization is awesome (fight anyone from Leon Kennedy to John Wick)
+ Jukebox mode is on all versions of the game this time
+ Ghost battles (an AI you train to fight like you) are a great new addition

- Story mode's plot is kind of nonsensical if you don't have old Tekken nostalgi
- Arcade quest isn't the best at teaching you much outside of beginner concepts
- Still no option to turn off some of the more annoying character customization in ranked
- Individual Character Story modes are a joke
- Not sure if there's something up with particular online matches, but when playing against console players specifically the built-in performance monitor starts to go red and the game can really start to stutter. The netplay is acceptable for the most part, but the code still needs some work.

If you're a fan, it's an easy 5 out of 5. I think the only caveat here is that if this is your first fighting game, it's kind of a doozy to get into compared to some other quality offerings for beginners out there right now. Still, if you think it looks sick and you understand there's some practice mode, YouTube tutorials, tournament footage (high-level Tekken is something else), and a LOT of online losses in your future, it's worth going in on.",1706905020,1708242116,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story was a lil silly, a bit epic, and surprising depth of theming by the end. I did not watch the prior story happenings but I did see a multihour video covering it before around when Tekken 7 came out. I did not play Tekken 7, but watched a bit of it.

I have played and seen played, most of the tekken games. Tekken Tag 1 I'm not sure, handheld games I don't think I have.

Something funny to notice tho. Kazuya and Yakuza are spelled with the same letters. And Kazuya runs around being an agent of chaos, and in the Yakuza games you can run around doing all kinds of shit, effectively being an agent of chaos as well.

How the ranked mode works is you should try multiple characters honestly, before you rank too far to enjoy the multiplayer.

+ Crossplay.
+ Rollback.
+ It's very well made.
+ Has a good amount of content
+ Someone finally implemented the Killer Instinct (2013) Shadow Labs mode again,
+ Character customization has a good amount of options.
+ The Replay system has a really cool ""tips"" feature that pauses the replay to give you tips on how you could have played better at certain points - like telling you how you could punish certain moves and etc.

Personal negatives:
- Character customization has a good amount of options - many of them way too silly or ridiculous for my taste. Your enjoyment of that may vary, of course.
- Despite crossplay and a healthy population, finding matches take a long time and it's almost never against a proper opponent. Very different from the matchmaking of, for example, Street Fighter 6.
- Well... it's Tekken. It's a rhythm game disguised as a fighting game. Not my personal favourite type of fighting game. Has about as much player interaction in a match as Solitarie.
- Optimization seems lacking.

Most of the negatives there are nitpicks or just my personal tastes, so it's likely an easy recommendation for most.

Though I do am disappointed with the matchmaking.",1707931020,1708217065,True,9,3,0.529598772525787354,0,True,False,False

[b]Character models:[/b] Some of the character anatomy is just.. Really bad. Law's face, Feng's back (???), and the cold lifeless eyes of particularly the women in the game (its forbidden for them to frown or something I guess, while the men are allowed to look like they're at the end stage of a particularly bad Taco Bell experience when they're particularly angry).

[b]Particle effects:[/b] Readability is important. Even though it has Electrics and laserbeams, characters haven't generally had massive screen-filling wooshlines and trails behind their moves. I find the massive particle effects pretty ugly, but more importantly they clutter the screen and make it difficult to see what's even going on. The whole screen flashing with sparkles whenever a heat thing happens gets pretty tiresome.

[b]Mindless offense:[/b] Aggression was core to the game's design and the devs have been open about it. Even characters that previously struggled to open up defensive opponents have now been given 50:50 tools that strongly favour the aggressor. Throws have been made harder to break, rage arts are MUCH safer, and for most characters Heat mode gives you access to even stronger pressure tools. At times it feels like everyone is Josie from Tekken 7. 

[b]""I am here to interrupt your flow"":[/b] Rage Arts were great fun when they were sharp and snappy, but anmations towards the end of T7 got longer - and they're now even longer than before in T8. Being in the middle of an intense match and then having to just go make a cup of tea because someone's doing their stupid super move is lame. 


While all this is true, I have still found myself enjoying Tekken 8. While the Heat system I believe is ill-conceived, it is preferable to 7's system where some characters had a meter system and others didn't. The game is still Tekken too, characters have the same complexity that you'd expect from the series, and the ability to self-express through combat remains superb. It's also where the bulk of the playerbase is now, so if you want the Tekken experience you've not got much other choice.

The stages are also worth a mention. Not only are they absolutely gorgeous, but this game finally introduces the Jukebox - a library with all the Tekken music ever made, which you can assign to each stage (and final round). This was only previously possible with mods (and hoping that someone had uploaded the music you wanted somewhere) so having it as an in-game tool is fantastic. It's a tremendous quality of life improvement, and has done more for my enjoyment of the game than any other feature.

Lastly, and least importantly, the story. Tekken 8's story mode is the worst story I have ever seen in any game - it was so juvenile that I went full circle from disgust to amazement. It is the filtered and concentrated essence of crap. I absolutely loathed it, and recommend it only to people who desperately want the 100% completion achievement, or people whose minds have succumbed to the anime rot. Buuuuuuuuuut it's a Tekken game - story was never going to be the reason I picked it up, and being upset about the story in a Tekken game is like being upset at the wine selection in a McDonalds.

At its core, Tekken 8 is a very competent and visually stunning 3D fighter with memorable characters and reasonably good character balance. I expect to be playing this for a long time.

Ghost battles are fun and actually provide a lot of training potential, may it be your own AI ghost or literally anyone's in the world. You can find some replays from different matches and the game lets you interrupt the replays to teach you potential counters to that situation???? As each character has like 100+ moves from different angles, stances etc, it really does help you to learn a handful of them and how they work in a real match. As much as I hate learning combos and grinding it out, this has been one of the best features in any fighting game that I know of.

Soundtrack is mint af, legit no issues with it.

Story, no issues, it's Tekken so what's to expect anymore.

Arenas are nicely designed, pretty to look at.

Character customisation is good, they may add stuff in the future but as of now, it's sufficient.

Minor downside - best of 3 is really nice but everyone leaves after the first round? Win or loss? And after the match ends, you cant jump back into the queue again, you either go to the Lounge or the Practice vs AI. Bit annoying with the load times.

The biggest downside, as of currently, is the unstable ranking. Due to the game being new, a lot of vets and og players will be at low ranks looking to climb up, so get ready to get bodied 80%ish of the time. Quick play, as with any fighting game, will be filled mostly with high ranks. So have a really strong mentality for getting bodied A LOT and learning.


EDIT: Changed to thumbs down because for a new player, anything during and after the Orange ranks is genuinely the most mind numbing experience known to man, almost borderline League of Legends mind numbing. You'll start getting matched with Spanish people who cant afford a decent connection so good luck with the constant frame delays. And the 3-4k hours of Tekken 7 and god knows what else.

If you're looking for something to play without knowing what touching another human feels like because you reek of BO due to the lack of showering and eating, this games for you.

Before anyone thinks ""oh he's just playing to win and not get better"" then you're right. There's only so much improvement you can do vs bots and sitting there for hours on end getting 30% of my HP chunked off with 2 hits or thrown into some combo grab loop and dying, isint how I want to spend my free time.",1706893317,1708125823,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have no problem with in game purchases on free games as part of their business model.

Tekken was just that; I would have gladly paid 70 for what I got even if it had a cash shop. Or even if they said it was coming later. But to drop it after reviews so they can manipulate the perception is a bridge too far for me. In this case I can’t vote with my wallet because I was tricked.

I hope others do the same and just stop playing. This is a new low and if we keep playing into it, it’ll just get worse. I was even planning on buying all the extra characters in whatever pass or bundle they came out in because I wanted to support what I thought was a well done game.

Renowned for its intense battles and diverse characters, Tekken has often served as a catalyst for exploring uncharted territories and confronting mythical adversaries. Imagining oneself in the shoes of Tekken's warriors, players embark on journeys through caves teeming with perilous creatures, from ferocious dragons to ancient dinosaurs, engaging in epic battles that test their skills, courage, and determination.

The allure of exploring caves lies in the mystery they shroud and the treasures they conceal. However, in the world of Tekken, caves are not merely repositories of riches but also battlegrounds where the brave clash with formidable foes. Venturing into these dimly lit passages, players encounter a myriad of mythical creatures lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. Each step forward is fraught with danger, as the echoes of distant roars and the rustling of wings signal the presence of adversaries waiting to be vanquished.

Among the most iconic adversaries encountered in these caves are dragons, majestic beings revered for their strength and feared for their fiery breath. Inspired by the formidable dragons of Tekken lore, these creatures pose a formidable challenge to players, their scales impervious to conventional weaponry and their roar shaking the very foundations of the caverns. Engaging in combat against these mythical beasts requires more than mere brawn; it demands strategy, agility, and quick reflexes as players dodge searing flames and strike with precision to exploit their weaknesses.

But dragons are not the only denizens of these subterranean realms. Ancient dinosaurs, remnants of a bygone era, also roam the caves, their colossal forms casting imposing shadows on the walls. Inspired by the prehistoric creatures featured in Tekken's imaginative universe, these dinosaurs are not mere relics of the past but formidable adversaries capable of unleashing devastating attacks with their razor-sharp claws and thunderous stomps. Battling against these behemoths requires players to adapt to their relentless onslaught, finding openings amidst the chaos to deliver decisive blows and emerge victorious against overwhelming odds.

Yet, amidst the chaos and peril of cave exploration, there is also a sense of exhilaration and triumph that accompanies each hard-fought victory. With each defeated foe, players forge their legend, their exploits whispered in awe by fellow adventurers and chronicled in the annals of gaming history. The caves become a testament to their resilience and tenacity, a proving ground where they hone their skills and emerge as champions, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

In conclusion, the hard battles in caves against mythical creatures inspired by Tekken encapsulate the essence of adventure and heroism. Through these virtual encounters, players embark on epic quests, confronting fearsome dragons, ancient dinosaurs, and otherworldly beings with courage and determination. As they navigate the treacherous depths of the caverns, they prove their mettle, forging their legacy as fearless warriors and masters of their destiny. And though the challenges may be great and the dangers ever-present, the thrill of triumphing over adversity and emerging victorious resonates long after the echoes of battle have faded away.

surely im over reacting, right? surely publishers wouldnt abuse your ""support"" to weasel their way into *more* money per 'customer' right? lmfao.

games fun, im going to get many hours out of this game like i did 7. its what brings me back to fighting games. however i greatly dislike this trend of releasing content, or even the entire game, as 'early access' for the more expensive versions. or in tekkens case, every DLC character will be accessible 3 days early for season pass owners. i thought the penalty for buying every character individually was that it totaled over the cost of the pass, not ""eat this characters shit because you cant lab his tricky moveset"". considering eddy gordo, a classic tricky character, is the first DLC character. this is a bad thing.

love the game, but i sincerely hope this business model dies before it does any more damage. we dont need more games being predatory and shitty.

Tekken 8 is visually gorgeous with a large roster of varied characters to thoroughly enjoy in both the most casual through pro level fighting. The storymode and other offline play is mashable for the newest of rookies while the skill ceiling is exceedingly high online for those looking for a challenge. 

Quite accessible for newbies too, for a fighting game. The very basics are taught well enough by the Arcade Quest, and the training mode is quite comprehensive. The movelists are as usual in Tekken very intimidating and long, but helped by the combo challenges and probably the best replay functionality I have ever seen this game provides every tool needed to get to grips with characters and mechanics. For everything else, there's always youtube guides. 

I can't say how it fares at high level, as I've barely gotten a bit over 17 hours in so far and maybe five or six of those went to Arcade Quest and the storymode, but I absolutely think it's worth the cost of entry. The matchmaking is generous and provides quite a lot of opponents with quite excellent connection quality, which has personally been a bit of a problem for me in SF6 due to living rurally and Capcom being far less generous with the matchmaking. 

If you're just after a singleplayer experience though... I don't know. The storymode has no challenge to it and while the production value is ridiculously high, the writing is hilariously bad. This story feels like a tween just tried to condense every Shonen anime arc into five-six hours of play, which I suspect is the intent. It's downright funny in its cheesiness. 

Highly recommended if you're looking for either a pro-level fighting game or just a casual masher. It's fun for everyone.",1708057982,1708057982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I come from games like MVC, MK & SF, I only played Tekken in the arcade as a kid, never really got into it. When Tekken7 came out it was crazy how much everyone talked about that game, however, at that moment I didn't care to jump in it. Fast forward to the end of T7's lifespan I started becoming very excited to hop in Tekken for the 1st time with T8...

I did not realize what I was stepping into....

This is so much fun it's crazy! It's been since the MVC2 that I've been this excited about a fighting game. The access to a massive move set is so nice. It gives you the ability to approach characters how YOU want to play them. This game gives you the freedom of expression with your character.

Graphics, amazing, don't even have to talk about them.

Stages, man are they awesome! Having ""the ground of the stage crumble while you and your opponent fall through the sky slamming down into a hidden treasure room... all because it's the ""final round!"""" is so sick!

Lastly and surprisingly, I don't really care too much about the UI in video games. When people are crying it's amazing I'm thinking, ""yea, it's cool."" When people are crying it's terrible, I'm thinking... ""yea, It's cool."" The Ui in this game is great strictly for the color scheme, the customization of characters, and the customization of THE MUSIC!

Yep, you can allow the music of the game to shuffle through the playlist of every Tekken ever made... sounds kinda cool but not really a big deal right? yea right, it's a huge deal! I never hear the same song twice, I keep hearing so much cool stuff, this game rules.

By no means am I Tekken master nor am I a fighting game maniac. But as a gamer who is familiar with almost every genre, I try to play every fighting game I can get my hands on. It's safe to say that I at least know the basics of fighting game mechanics and what it takes to ""get better."" In the recent years, with the help of my best friend from high school, I've had a chance to learn the ins and outs of games like SF6, Dragon Ball Fighterz, MK, and even some anime fighting games. As a result, the more I invested, the more I learned. The more I learned, the more I enjoyed the games. I grew up with the OG Playstation and Tekken 3. Now, 20+ years later, what a great time it is to be alive: to witness the eighth installment of the Tekken series.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
In the fighting game genre, I think we can all agree that if the game is fun, the game is already great to a certain extent. Back in the day, that's all that mattered. Now, we've got other categories to consider like amount of content, cosmetics, replayability, updates, etc. But let's face it: when it comes to Tekken, no one can deny that it's the legend among legends when it comes to the bare bones. They solidified the game and introduced the new heat drive(?) system. They went the same route as Street Fighter 6 in that they brought the ""special style"" for newcomers - akin to Modern controls in SF6 - to just press buttons and enjoy the game for what it is. Of course, we all know that this will only get you so far; and to really delve deep into Tekken, one needs to get the kids' gloves off and play like the Tekken legends of old (lol) to learn combos w/ manual inputs and understand what you're actually doing. Regardless, there are many ways to enjoy the game by whatever means necessary. The game perfected the Tekken recipe and it is indeed the best Tekken to play in 2024.

[b]Content[/b]
Two things that were noticeable: companies know that a lot of players are not as hardcore and excited to play online/ranked so it feels like they implemented a strong Ghost system for players to enjoy in the long-term, especially those who deem themselves ""less competitive"" like myself. When it comes to replayability, I think this is a good way to enjoy the game further past the story/arcade modes without stressing out about playing online. Second, the special style allows players to ""see"" what certain characters can do without lifting a finger, really. Well, maybe using your thumb to chain simple combos but it definitely makes the character bust out the flashy stuff on the fly.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[b]Story[/b]
Tekken's story is beyond disappointing, and this has been the case since T4. It's your average hero beats villain, angel vs demon routine that every Tekken has brought so far. No real character development, no real stakes. Just a Jin/Kazuya fest as usual. I have this lowkey feeling that the writers have this hard-on for making the Japanese characters look cool and have the characters that represent the rest of the world be their side pieces, but this might be just minor politics at play and wouldn't really bother me.... IF THE WRITING WASN'T SO SUBPAR. $20 says AI technology can do better for Tekken 9. Then again, every anime series post-2010 has had similar subpar storylines all over the place so.. I guess they just lack creativity and prefer to take the ""safe"" way when it comes to stories (just like Ubisoft).

[b]Customization[/b]

[UPDATE] Feb 15, 2024
Upon further analysis, the customization in Tekken 8 is the best in the FGC. Beats the likes of MK1 and SF6 out of the water. Still would like to see more accessories, as we had in the T6 days, but from what we've seen people around the world come up with these past few weeks since launch, the potential of creating various characters from different franchises is astounding.

[strike]This one's a bit disappointing.[/strike] Do they plan to release more accessories and outfits in the future? If so, are they gonna be paid DLC...? Case in point, the customization options that are available at launch are underwhelming to say the least. I don't know why I was expecting to feel more excited to see the likes of T6 and TTT revived. But I might have gotten my hopes up a bit too high. At least we can make LEON from RE4? Cyberpunk for Jin? A bootleg Kenshi from MK for Victor? GOKU FOR LARS?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Final Verdict: S[/b]
Arguably the best Tekken game of all time, for veterans and newcomers alike. The biggest compliment I would like to throw is that in a game industry where we're used to companies releasing unfinished games to rake in the $$$, Harada and his team really took their time and sweat blood and tears to bring Tekken 8 to a near-perfect state before unleashing it upon the world. Also really looking forward to how Knee dominates the tournament scene once again.

Yeah, I think I'll be sticking with this one for a while.",1706393960,1708028454,True,67,0,0.759133577346801758,4,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of lore and story so its definitely refreshing to see a gallery short movie that sums up the lore series to catch you up to Tekken 8's story campaign. The cinematic are gorgeous. 

Finding a character you enjoy playing as and just learning how to kick ass with them is really fun. The game is definitely challenging with a constantly evolving AI ghost that learns your habits and becomes your in-game mirror to help you grow as a fighter. 
Little steps of progression and frequent breaks in between ensure that I wont get burnt out on the game. 

You can even customize your own character outfits and cosplays.

With the replay feature, learning is much more fun than it's ever been, and if you have a coach they can easily show you what you could have done in your matches.

Is it fun? yeah.
Is it spammy and overwhelming at times? yeah...
Are some characters cheap? yup 
Does it reward constant aggression? For sure.
Should the heat system maybe undergo some changes? Yes. 
[spoiler]Rage and Heat are more or less ""comeback"" systems, and although Heat can be a helpful for an inexperienced player, in the hands of a veteran, they're tools which easily lead to extremely one-sided battles, if you don't perfectly keep your guard up, which can lead to battles of attrition about who makes the first mistake, which then can turn out to be mostly fatal or allow patient gameplay with a player that can just outspace and spam the super moves that come out really fast and deal around 40-50% of life as damage, as a punish. [b]More times than not, you just have staring competitions until the heat bar runs out, so it kind of works against the pace of the game and what it the Heat system intended to originally do.[/b]
In contrast, Rage arts, despite their damage output, are only available when you are at 30% life. The only problem they have is that they not high-risk, can armor through attacks and can also be used as a punish against a player that throws out any attack.
Personally, even in Tekken 7, i never held rage arts in high regard, since most of the time, it's a get-out-of-jail-free card and the damage increase of rage, really should have been enough.
It doesn't help that the standard input of rage arts in 8 can be easily misinput'ed.[/spoiler]

Are you going to sweat in every online match? Definitely.

Offline modes for single players and customization are still lacking and i do not know if Bandai Namco are going to add more stuff down the line.
The story mode, arcade quest and character episodes are basic but alright.

Should you get this game as a newcomer to fighting games? Sure. Tekken isn't hard to learn, it's casual friendly but it's just incredibly difficult to master until it becomes second nature, then you stop thinking alltogether. 
But maybe get with some friends, throw a party and play this game just casually. Maybe just play the game for the sake of playing a fighting game or playing a character you like.
Don't get sucked into the competitive rabbit hole or the mindset; it will only make you miserable; This counts for many games out there.

[b]Honestly, just have fun playing the game and never forget to Ki charge. I do appreciate if you do that.[/b]

Other than being the best fighting game to date IMO, T8 is near perfect but it has one frustrating con for me. Too many launchers!!! There are characters in game who can launch you on anything which encourages button smashing. Maybe the developers intended this to help get newer people on the game. I’ll eventually get better defensive and launcher familiarity but dang, they didn’t make it easy coming from T7. T8 is a completely different game that encourages offensive pressure especially with the heat system but overall; I'm thankful for a great product. This is the Tekken the FGC needed.

Basically what you are buying here is like a ticket for an event. The event is called ""those first n months during which Tekken is in fashion"".

The game, by its own, though, has enough features for everyone, and all features go from great to 'at least decent'.

- Online play is very good, with good lobbies and matchmaking and cross-play and anything you may want.
- Input lag is the lowest of all Tekken games, as measured by Nigel Woodall. In a game in which input lag actually matters.
- Customization is very good.
- Character variety is very good.
- Story mode is decent and well produced, especially for a Tekken game. It's cheesy, and funny, and childish, and extremely over the top from the beginning to the end.
- Graphics are... Unreal Engine 5, with its goods and its bads. It runs really smooth, otherwise it implements TSR brilliantly, and all the bells and whistles that you want with modern GPUs. It looks really good for a fighting game. However, does it look 70$ good? There's a demo, up to you.
- Ghost AI opponent remains to be seen, so far not very challenging, maybe needs more usage.
- Arcade quest mode... is decent.

In general, the new player onboarding has not worked very well. Very low % of players doing the arcade, tutorial, individual character story or whatever. Needs maybe more coverage of movesets, maybe more locations... more avatar customization?... don't really know the cause, but I'll just leave that there too.

7 years after the disaster that was Tekken 7 I expected NAMCO to get their shits together & this is what we got!
I have to admit, Tekken 8 graphic is a big step forward compared to Tekken 7 but still there was so much room for improvements, take a look at how MK11 & Injustice 2 evolved, characters are so lifelike in those games but in Tekken 8 they look like dolls, graphic looks good & bad at the same time
I'm not even playing other fighting games but just look at the difference between Injustice 1 & Injustice 2, or MKX & MK11, SFV & SFVI, you can notice the differences just by looking at them from miles, & It feels like they just remade their game from the bottom

Voice acting: Finally for the first time Namco hired all voice actors to redo all the voice-lines, this is not something that I should praise because it's their job, SF & MK doing this for every entry but when it comes to NAMCO before T8, they were recycling all the dialogues from older Tekken games since Tekken 4, in T7 they reached the next level & picked some random dialogues from T6 campaign to act like they brought new intros & win poses but they didn't, that made Tekken 7 characters extremely soulless & dead

Customization keeps getting worse & worse since Tekken tag 2, As a Lili main I wanted to get her Tekken 5 DR outfit but it was fucking gone, so many classic outfits are gone, how could you be worse than T7 when it comes to customization?

Models: although It's their job to make new models or improve the old models without reusing same models but I appreciate that they tried but somehow they managed to mess it up! looks like male characters are all so jacked, what's up with Marshal Law, Steve & Hwoarang? they all look like body builders, why are they younger than they were in Tekken 4 & why they look like dolls/plastics while were living in 2024 where in most AAA games you can't tell the difference between a game & movie

Animations: Yeah, they're still recycling animations since Tekken 1, Kazuya still has the same electronic uppercut since Tekken 1 from 1994


Graphic: Okay for 2024 game

Gameplay: 10/10

Stages: 7/10

Music: Tekken 8 musics are a bit weaker than T7 but you can still use older Tekken musics so 10/10

Netcode: Better than older Tekken games

a victory.
but i felt no emotion. when you play against King, things like winning and losing become meaningless.

i only booted up online for a few fun and fair matches, eager to see how far my leroy training had gotten me.
but there is no fun against King. yet there is no annoyance, nor is there a sense of weariness upon seeing King's character art appear on the loading screen.
i take a few deep breaths before the match starts.
but no amount of deep focus or relaxation can hold against the wave of instinctual fear that overcomes my very soul once the announcer ends the countdown with that word.
the exact same word i'd heard in so many matches that i'd come to not even pay attention to it anymore.
but it's different when that barbaric mass of mexican muscle makes his presence known.
i couldn't possibly hear the announcer more clearly, it's like it was the first time i ever even heard the word, but i still knew exactly what it meant.
as if i was a meek peasant forced by an emperor to fight in a gladiator arena as punishment for stealing bread to feed my starving son.

and what is a peasant to a King?

what happens during the match cannot be explained in words, it's something that can only ever be felt.
it's beyond fear, the closest thing in our mortal realm that can be considered lovecraftian.

as the match ends, and i see my well earned victory boost me up by a rank, i feel as if i had aged an entire year in one battle.
was this how the samurai felt charging into a battle and witnessing a hwacha launch too many arrows to count, barely surviving the metal rain, and coming out on top regardless?
victory hardly matters when you've witnessed such horrors of war in the heat of battle.
a human made that, and it will only get worse.
humans evolve, war evolves faster.

 Other than that this might just be the best Tekken game of all time. With 700 hours in T7 im not a beginner but neither am i really good at it (played a lot without learning, just goofing around).

 I was very very sceptical of the game the Heat system, chip damage and emphasis on agression, which felt like the opposite of what Tekken usually stands for. I can say that i actually enjoy all of it. The emphasis on aggression does make defense more difficult but its still rewarding. I dont feel the need to play rushdown, u can still poke and step to create whiffs and punish etc. The heat gives u more to think about, it makes me always keep an eye for my and the enemies heat-meter. UE5 looks splendid, and i havent finished all the ""single-Player"" content yet. There is actually some of it and with those ghost battles even people who hate online play might find some fun stuff to mess araound.

The variable characters, the 3d animations, the flashy hits, and the cool older kids doing weird stunts with a sword wielding ninja entranced me at first, but it was many years before I could actually identify the arcade game I had seen as tekken, when I discovered a copy of Tekken 4 at a friends house and played it while hungover.

Years later, I played Tekken 7 and was impressed but found it a little sparse. The gameplay was deep but understanding it required a dedicated pursuit and the tools that were provided were not really up to the task. You had to do research and keep notes and build actual in-game experience against others - but the netcode wasn't that good, so online matches lagged and irl play, well, it wasn't long before all my friends refused to play me because the basic mechanics of this game (lows, armor moves, backdashing, throws, etc.) feel like unfair cheating to someone with little to no mechanical knowledge.

Starved of good matches, I dropped Tekken 7, Now, Tekken 8 is here and it has arrived at a time when my schedule is open to it. Everything I could want is in the game - the core cast is essentially intact (though some will surely contest who is in the ""canon"") and the roster is an expansive 32 fighters with the promise of more to come (how many were in Tekken 4? 18-20? And I thought that was a lot to learn...). Animations and graphics generally have received a nice bump from 7 and the stages are beautiful, with multiple tiers to throw your opponents through (and now there are stage hazards as well). These stages are the best in Tekken history, visually fascinating and detailed enough that I have stopped in practice mode to admire the small details like the ongoing gunfight on the warzone level. The songs are all hypnotic bangers, and there is an option to use the soundtrack from any previous game.

There are a lot of reviews out there that talk about how this is the Tekken to be initated with, with all the improved practice tools and tutorials and that is all true. The game does what it can to put you on a conveyor belt to competence which is great, since it has produced a bumper crop of new players for a franchise that richly deserves them. 

This however should not overshadow the fact that this is a great Tekken. I really enjoy the new heat system, it has added a new element of intensity to matches and meshes decently well with the older rage system. The special moves that each character has with heat really add speed and style to fights. I am not wild about the continued inclusion of rage arts but this could be personal bias - they are a cheap equalizer for less experienced players when a veteran forgets about them. I still think this game represents a further refinement of everything the devs learned from 7 and matches feel great to play, even after several hundred in a row.

Also helping this tekken is the introduction of cross platform play and better netcode. Matches will still lag from time to time but it's almost always a more reliable experience than 7.

This is the one to get if you are new and the one if you are old. Just pick it up, so we can all plaay together.",1707869361,1707869361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In Bandai Namco's quest to increase aggression, they've completely neutered the systems and neutral that define TEKKEN.

Out with poking, timing mix-ups, and footsies. In with forced unearned mix-ups on block, and non-stop immediate timing responses.

With no adequate defensive systems to balance out the offensive ones, the game has devolved into a chaotic mess of who can oppress the other player with their buttons more. And it's lead to this game having a clear top 8 characters at launch, that are almost untouchable.

It's a gorgeous game, has a fantastic story mode, and is loaded with features. But the game-play that underpins it is a bastardised version of the series.

As a long time loyal TEKKEN player, I can honestly say, this goes right alongside TEKKEN Tag 2 as the most volatile, stressful, un-fun TEKKEN game ever made.

In addition to the game-play being volatile, it's still full of bugs that can crash the game outright, and it also has a lobby system that is so bad in makes Arc System Works blush.

I feel that there is fundamentally something wrong with the core of Tekken 8, which I don’t feel can be fixed without a significant overhaul.

I can't lie one of the main reasons I got this is because if Tekken does well enough it might mean we see Soul Calibur 7 some day, but considering this is the first Tekken I've ever played I gotta say I love this game, it's so full of charm, there are TWO literal bears on the roster, everyone is fluent in every language including animal and New York is prophetically referred to as a 'Wasteland'.

In some ways the customization in this game is less interesting than soul calibur but in many other ways this game is far superior.

Tekken 8 has a lot of strong points, such as the graphics and new balancing, that so far seem to be much better in comparison to Tekken 7. I am personally not a fan of the music in the game and think its perhaps one of the absolute weakest points of the game, but the addition of the jukebox that allows you to turn on music from the previous games is an awesome feature. 

Whether or not you are new to Tekken, a casual player of the previous games, or someone who has grinded the game a lot in the past, i would like to strongly caution you against picking up this game if you might feel as i do. While the balancing seems overall better than prior games, in what feels like an attempt to endear itself to a more casual audience, the game has been made ridiculously spammy. It seems like every single match online is just strings upon strings upon strings of combos that chain into each other, where you just have to patiently wait for the spamming to end before its your turn. 

This is particularly noticeable with some of the new characters, that seem to be especially safe and easy to use, that you have to pay extra in order to get access to. I imagine this is exactly the same as they attempted to do with Tekken 7, where dlc characters were introduced with very clear examples of power-creep, likely as a tactic to give incentive to purchase the dlc characters. Much of this was patched and balanced later on of course, and i imagine they are going to do the exact same thing here. 

Most of this strings that people constantly spam online have ways around them, like sidestepping, crouching and punishing, etc. But often these windows of opportunity are incredibly small for online play where latency shortens your window of opportunity. Which translates to a very poor online experience, although the game DEFINITIVELY performs better as an experience for offline play. So i am eager to see how it performs in tournaments as a spectator. But so far over the 14 hours of online play that i have had, every match goes the same, all the way up to purple ranks. Every match is just strings upon strings getting spammed constantly, while you patiently wait for your turn to begin, as your opponent continues to spam while pushing you towards the other end of the planet. 

Certain characters, like Jun, also has incredibly colorful moves that just paints your entire screen with distracting colors and ""Christmas lights"", making it hard to see what is even going on. And she is not the only character with this feature either.

TLDR; Tekken has become incredibly spammy in pursuit of accessibility, music is subpar, visuals are cluttering and distracting mid-fight, but the game is overall far, far better for offline play than it is online. 

Also, you do not play because of the story. It is nonsensical and incoherent, but honestly unimportant for your enjoyment of the game.",1707764442,1707764442,False,1,0,0.436485707759857178,0,True,False,False

The characters are even cooler than I remember them from Tekken 5, they have so much identity, and look stunning in Unreal Engine 5. Compared to Street Fighter 6, it feels like combos are a lot easier to string together, and the combo system provides a great degree of creativity/versatility. That said, it also feels like Tekken 8 is a whole lot more complicated than Street Fighter 6, given the fact that its 3D, which is a blessing and a curse. It can be very daunting getting to learn what moves to duck, which to sidestep and how to punish each of the 32 characters, when everyone has at least 100 moves in the movelist. But on the other hand this provides nearly infinite gameplay value, because there's always more to learn.
On the topic of learning, Tekken 8 provides more tools for practicing than I've seen in both Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. The highlight here is the ability to go and watch replays of your own matches, where the game gives you tips and feedback on which basic combos to use or which moves can punish the opponents offence. This combined with the ability to download ""ghosts"" of your opponents, which mimic their playstyle, create the best basis for leaning in any fighting game, in my opinion.
Oh yeah and the game is really content complete too, moreso than its competitors. You have story mode, arcade quest (cutesy storymode/tutorial), tekken ball, character stories, jukebox with all the previous tekken music, and an online lounge mode.

There's a fun and silly story that I was able to get through in a day thanks to the good 'ol simple combo option available. It was much more engaging than what was in Tekken 7. It's a little short, and I'd love DLC, because the set dressing and production value is incredible.

And, hot dang, there is two especially important additions that I feel would've been super welcome in Tekken 7. First, the adventure mode that acts like a story, but is filled with tutorials. It got me learning about the new Heat system early on. And second, I dig the updated replay system - pretty goated. It's helped me learn about some enemy strings that I would've otherwise kept challenging and getting launched for, and let's me play right away to learn counters while it's fresh in memory. In the olden days, it would've been Uncle YouTube with my ass just to learn what a power crush was. Now, I feel like a complete beginner has some good resources to learn and get some wins. And the pool of characters is also much smaller than Tekken 7, so I feel like the rate at which I'm learning matchups is way faster.

The online play feels awesome on ethernet. I feel addicted to quickplay, man. This game for me is the epitome of ""one more game"" mentality. Sure, getting wooped by someone with a way higher skill level is rough - especially if I feel like I'm not learning anything. But, a good chunk of the games, regardless of rank, are exciting. I love the new default best-of-3 rematch system. Because those 3rd games that get to the Final Round, and the last 10% health on both sides; nothing beats that rush. I'm slowly but surely climbing the ladder in ranked. My one  It's pretty cheap that someone can unplug on ranked when they lose. I eat the L's lol, but I feel the game should be able to calculate who was going to win, especially during a rage art cutscene.

I don't play a ton of games, or for that long, but I've logged around 120 hours in the last year of Tekken 7, and got hooked. Jumping into Tekken 8, it's honestly everything I could've wanted in a sequel. The new gameplay elements, the story, the graphics and music; it's all top-notch, and I can feel the urge to play again well up inside me when I'm at work.

good aspects:
Brilliant visuals.
Brilliant effects.
Stunning scenery/stages.
Decent arcade feel hub in game to find many players with a interesting arcade cabinet style set up for matchmaking.
Great sound design.

negative aspects:
Terrible movement.
Over focus on flashy cutscene invoking moves mid game via use of ""Heat"" removes the immersion from the fight.
Terrible balancing.
Nerfed backdash for several characters which ties into balancing problems.
over bloated 50 50 options for many characters which makes the game more guess work heavy. 
bloated damage for certain launchers with not enough punish potential trade off if blocked. 
movement feels slow and clunky like walking through mud/wet sand.

In Tekken 7 I reached Tekken King rank online towards the later stages of T7 life cycle and I loved near enough every aspect of it. The movement felt balanced across all characters and rewarded you for putting time into learning the movement system and how best to utilise it in your game play to improve yourself. In Tekken 8 movement or more accurately stated as spacing is completely thrown out of the window with plenty of moves from near enough the entire cast can hit you at very questionable ranges and hit boxes seem to be bigger on many moves which effects how well you can utilise movement overall. Back dashing feels terrible for certain characters in this iteration of the series which is a odd take to go for with a game like tekken where it felt like movement was a core fundamental yet despite this in tekken 8 this is not the case.

Several characters in the cast that are string focused which for new comers reading this review means characters that use multiple button inputs to complete a 3,4 or more string of consecutive hits for whichever reason in this game now has built in tracking in some cases which realigns the character model with their opponent which also effects the movement system meaning that players mash happy more in this game with less regard to movement being a possibility to stop their advance unlike in previous instalments of the series. There are many recorded cases online where moves from certain characters have hit their opponent despite the opponent being completely in their back or completely off axis to the characters weak side.

The Heat mechanic in game is an awful addition to the tekken series as a whole. In game we now have the introduction of Heat engagers, smashes and burst. Heat is essentially a meter system. This is the first time in tekkens history I have seen where the risk reward ratio for a particular move is completely skewed in the players favor with absolutely no repercussion for blocking it. you could be pressuring your opponent and have landed a move on them granting yourself an advantage with for example a +5 on block advantage for the opponent to then use a heat smash to reset the situation and grant themselves a plus frame advantage essentially stealing their turn. Even if you block this despite it being your turn frame wise the opponent that used this heat smash is completely safe and now has a on average across the cast +2 frames to then turn the pressure back to you. These moves are armoured, have excellent range and deal chip damage which is also an unwelcome addition to the series. 

This game has now become a 50 50 guessing simulator where after using heat smash or a heat engager it then follows into a 50 50 situation meaning the player or opponent can now use a guaranteed mix up option and depending on the character you're facing this can be easier to accommodate to or much much harder all because of a character choice. this is directly linked to a balancing issue as certain characters can absolutely abuse this much more than others.

there are also guard breaks in this game with some characters example I will use being Jack 8 where he can charge up a move for a guard break which for some reason allows a guaranteed heat burst move which if at wall can lead to a guaranteed 80 or 90 damage combo in a game where it usually only takes two combos to kill. 

In this game there are currently 5 or 6 characters used more than the rest of the cast for very obvious reasons if you decide to play this for yourself and they outshine the rest of the cast by a astonishing degree at this stage. This game has been made by the developers to be deliberately more offence focused with the introduction of chip damage and recoverable health to incentivise players to attack more which makes for very mash heavy fights where certain characters outperform in this aspect also. all of this whilst making 50 50 mix ups much stronger options and adding heat smashes in game which have a built in mini cutscene which ruins the immersion of a fight and prioritising armour moves to steal turns back makes this iteration of the tekken franchise the most mash heavy and outright exhausting fighting game I have ever played and it's not even remotely entertaining to witness with most of the offence being thrown at you feeling like completely cheap thrown shots with no general aim but just used to see if it works because that's what the devs intended for.

Rage arts are still in the game along with the entire heat system as a separate resource and are all currently -15 on block meaning not all of the cast can launch punish these moves anymore which again ties into move risk reward ratio being completely unbalanced again. 

Grabs in this game are strange now where a lot of them seem to have built in tracking and then others don't all with varying degrees of frame break windows with some characters having generic grabs with not accurate frame break windows despite the rest of the cast sharing the same which again is a balancing issue or a bug and with many varying states that guarantee full grab chains for insane damage in some specific circumstances. 

movement is absolutely butchered in this game by comparison to its predecessors with back dashing being nerfed into oblivion for several characters and this makes the movement system feel terrible to utilise which makes it feel like moving through mud or sand. Sidestepping has been buffed slightly in this game, however so many moves now have weird tracking properties despite not expressly stating they are tracking moves and these can come from moves that are part of strings or outright singular hit moves. in this game tracking moves can be visually seen by use of blue lines stemming from the characters limb yet despite many moves not having this property you can still be hit in very odd and outright incorrect positions all because the devs have made offence a priority so locking you down with these big hit box moves seems to of been a intentional move. 

Good aspects of the game so far seem to be the netcode. I play on a high end PC with top upload and download speeds and I have absolutely no trouble playing with players from Pakistan, Japan and America despite being in the EU with very minimal lag noticed at all during sessions.
Sound design is impeccable.
Character model visuals are great.
Stages are stunning and interactive with many different situations and mechanics in built.
Overall graphics are incredibly nice and smooth.

Unfortunately the bad sides outweigh any semblance of good this game has in its current state as Tekken 8 is nothing like the core of what Tekken is and has been for years and years prior. What made online matches interesting to both watch and experience was the mind games and the footsies players would have vs one another to force a mistake wether through movement or punishment yet all of those core fundamentals of what makes tekken an amazing game that stands out from the crowd of other fighters has been completely stripped away in this iteration. Devs please go back to your roots.

The game is complex and the LAB(practice) required hours could cause you to worry :). I'm writing this review from the point of view of a casual gamer that has Tekken 8 as their first Tekken game and finished almost everything in it after 70-80 hours in offline/online(rank 10)

[b]Positives:[/b]
- Great graphics, combat looks cool, feels cool and brutal. Tekken 8 is the best version of Tekken
- Winning online makes your laugh out loud, very satisfying
- Good music options with Jukebox, can change to any Tekken music
- Good Campaign that lasts for 3-4 hours and has incredible cut scenes that are gorgeous especially in the last hour of the game
- Surprisingly funny 32 Story Episodes. Can try out moves for each of the 32 chars in these. Can take up to 5-6 hours
- Good Arcade Quest that invites you to learn the basics of Tekken 8 while advancing a campaign through some social arcade places/stores/bars. Can take up to 5-6 hours
- Strong Roster of 32 characters with around 10 characters that are really bad ass like: Jin, Kazuya, Devil Jin, Jun, Reina, Zafina, Paul Phoenix, Law(Bruce Lee), Raven(Blade), Hworang, Bryan, Victor and Lee
- Minimum of 30-40 hours of gameplay to a casual player and easily 100+ hours if you would like to explore more than 1-2 characters and push the online ranks
- Combat looks very cool, feels very brutal with the more heavy hitting characters like Jin and its satisfying to pull out a win in a stressful situation especially online
- Unique combat mechanics and combat style, no fireball wars but you get grab wars and juggle wars
- Unique mechanics like attacking your enemy on the ground a lot, side stepping attacks, auto blocking and blocking on Standing posture as the standard opposed to 2D fighting games where you block low as the standard
- Easy mode exists that will allow you to juggle/air combo enemies with ease and perform other more complicated attacks
- NetCode for Online pvp is great most of the times, no issues seen
- Multiple Online pvp modes like Quick Play, Ranked, PvP arcades which are all very populated
- Combat seems fair and responsive both for single player and especially where it matters more -> for online pvp
- Great practice mode where you can see the moves executed and then you get to practice them
- Great combo challenges
- Great replay system for your online matches, you can save your favourite matches, get improvment tips when you watch them and can actually execute the received tip on the spot -> totally new system which will help people improve a lot
- A lot of customisation options for people that are into that stuff
- Steam achievements are easy to get to 100% in around 25-30 hours as all of them are just integrated into the first hours of the single player and online journeys you go into.


[b]Negatives:[/b] I don't view the negatives of this game as something very heavy, some people could also consider then negatives positives. Like a hard learning curve could be a positive or negative, a lot of mechanics same story etc
- The story of the game is a bit generic, the graphics and the fights/explosions are amazing and save the campaign but the story itself is 'Power of Love and Friendship wins'. Maybe drop all the serious and granny like advice this story has and just make it funny like the Story Episodes are.
- The music is a bit uninspired like techno music that is not very hard or doesn't drop some sick beat or anything but you can actually load your own playlist into the game or just any other Tekken sound track from the Jukebox so this point is saved but its worth mentioning
- Even tho the game was simplified, i feel it could be simplified even more to attract the casual gamers. There are over 100+ moves(+1 stance and its moves) for each character(can be overwhelming) which denotes depth and variation but the execution skill needed to perform some of the moves i feel is still too much for a casual gamer
- Execution skill needed for combos is too high -> especially online when you are getting hammered. There is a case that a player should struggle a bit a progress but when the struggle is too great(the execution skill for moves/combos is too high) people will just quit the online play because you would need to stay so many hours in the lab/practice mode and its not fun anymore at that point.
- High end ranked games require a lot of lab hours(practice hours) which kills the fun of the game. If the moves could be easier, the lab hours would be lower. The lab hours need to be reduced for high end ranked play to include more people.
- Please make this version of Tekken or the next Tekken more keyboard friendly. Most keyboards cant take 3 inputs at once and some moves are just not possible where 3 inputs are needed


[b]Conclusion:[/b]

 I wanted to point out that the negatives are small in this game and you will be able to play your character without issues(60-70% of the moves are accessible), there is an easy mode available for the more complicated stuff but it will feel like cheating and you wont feel so cool using it/winning with it.
 In conclusion i can say i had a blast with this game, its a great game, especially online when you fight some close games and you win. This will give you a minimum of 30 hours(25 hours to fully clear the single player + 5 hours for the casual online pvp push) and 100+ hours over a few years or if you want to try out new characters, its worth the money.

If you want a work around you'll have to either find a better ISP or use a VPN which is pretty terrible practice coming from a newer fighting game.

Watch the replay, and the game will point it out all while giving you a demo of the set up and letting you practice it after being shown that moment in the match.

The initial barrier for entry to play the game is lowered thanks to a decent tutorial through Arcade Quest, and backdashing no longer being as gated. Furthermore, the game is no longer as convoluted due to actually having access to accurate frame data in the training mode. 

Thanks to the new universal Heat mechanic, characters that were/are missing tools for pressure benefit greatly, granting them more options (namely, a one-time guaranteed plus frame move at the expense of their meter). On the other hand, the tools of those who already have strong pressure gets upgraded with chip damage. However, Heat was designed such that it must be used wisely (extending combos for your entire Heat is a risky trade). Overall, this mechanic reduces potential power gaps between characters by giving whoever knows how to use it well an advantage. 

One iffy thing is that the devs put EWGF into the assist button (like for Kazuya and Reina), but at least they made it slower than regular EWGF. Also, still a crap ton of knowledge checks, but at least they changed a lot of animations to make it much more obvious where the moves hit.",1706912502,1707602616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the surface, this game is beautiful. The character models, their animations, the arenas - everything is top-notch. Optimization is great, as well - when I can't reach my PC, I use my Steam Deck (old model), 45 stable FPS (I set this to prolong battery life), and with decent graphics.

The fighters have great identities - both, in visuals and in fighting styles.

Under-the-hood, it has FANTASTIC depth. I watched some guides, and you can *literally* dedicate yourself to learning one character for *years*. Executing flashy combos and special moves is super rewarding, both visually and damage-wise.

Tekken 8 does seem quite intimidating, at first (and, frankly, it is for newbies like me), but it also has a ""beginner-friendly"" mode (""Special"" style, which greatly simplifies controls).

Some characters have more moves that reach much further than the character animation/model than others, and I havent seen it be this severe. Tekken 8 is the most longest reaching limb tekken game I have played and I am not sure I like the inconcistency. [b]For example:[/b] There are so many more moves which you cannot strafe/sidestep. Getting hit by seemingly airboxing.

There are a lot more characters who have too much of a fast paced linear flow. As in, characters with forward momentum moves that puts them in advantage of some kind. Resulting in a fast paced Tekken game, sure. But its forcing the mechanics a bit too boldly to fit the mold they have planned, and it is visible. [b]To the point of[/b] characters almost playing by themselves.

I dont feel like that I (me) am playing the game in the way I want because the game conditions me to play by its rules set within the character I chose to in such a way that I have to follow the characters flow-chart.

[b]As another example[/b], what if I DONT want to heat dash after a heat activatable move? You ALWAYS heat dash after a heat activated move. Because of that, those moves that heat activate are balanced in such a way that they kinda leave you wanting the heat dash, resulting in those moves feeling like a resource you loose when heat is activated and done. Creating a soft decrease of every characters move-list (not that decreasing the move-list is bad, just pointing out how the mechanics influence to this conclusion).

Victor embodies so many of the ""agent character"" tropes I love, and basically cheats (in a good way) with his blade and gun based moveset. Azucena outright sucks though. She feels like if Lucky Chloe and Christie were fused into one character, but had their personalities extracted and replaced with nothing but a love of coffee. I really hate one-note comedic relief characters, and she feels like a waste of space on the roster. Azucena reaches El Fuerte levels of cringe, but her presence is this game's only major flaw.",1707504237,1707504272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, another small gripe I have is the fact that the game has upscaling and while the options are a lot and some are quite decent (TSR, DLSS Quality being the best), many are unfortunately mediocre and make the game either perform poorly or perform great but look like a blurry mess.

Nevertheless, It is not perfect.  The customization options are severely limited. I got all the unlockable stuff in one day!  Also, Arcade mode is no longer necessary since we have character episodes and arcade quest. Just put devil Kazuya and Azazel in the latter parts of arcade quest, and if the player wins, they get a lot of points  and 3 treasure boxes(Like in Tekken 7) because right now at the  higher levels Arcade quest is too much of a grind as you run out of high level characters to fight. Finally, in the next DLC i suggest they add team battle, with the option to play Tag team or not, offline or not. Beyond that everything here is great! just please fix Law's 3+4-4 combo ender.

It's a fighting game so there's a lot of replayability, not to mention that it's newly released so if they took it in the same direction with dlcs that its predecessor did, it's going to be a banger.

Graphics are amazing, but is optimized well enough that with enough processing power you should be able to smoothly sail in terms of frames. It looks daunting at first when you watch trailers of the game and such but I assure you it's very well optimized.

Netcode is a HUGE improvement, I'm able to play on 220ish ping against someone across the world with barely noticeable input lag (this is subjective, some combos that have strict timing can and will be dropped). Comparing this to Tekken 7, it's so much more smoother. 

Overall, the game may seem scary for new players cause you need to learn a decent amount of moves for over 30+ characters (how many ever characters are in the game), and not only that, you also have to learn matchups but hey, that's just how fighting games are.

To begin, this absolutely is a continuation of quite possibly the best polygon fighting game ever made since others simply don't carry the reputation of Tekken on numerous levels going back to the 1990's.  Over the many iterations, the number of features has expanded and there are lots of variations within the game itself from the avatar you can build and test against other computer opponents to the customization of the characters, avatar and screen elements during play, just like Tekken 7 but expanded.  As has been stated too many times already, the heavy use of the Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) adds a level of detail that pushes the entire game visually beyond MK1 and SF6, although from what I read, some of the UE5 elements are not used for whatever the reason but the game visually is cutting edge.  It is nice that there are direct references to prior Tekken releases, I like having the ""jukebox"" feature so you can have prior Tekken music playing during your Tekken 8 experience.  The game play is of course tight, the heat system is a welcome new element that can change a match and the sound and various lighting effects are also excellent.  My 12 year old daughter who is taking actual Taekwondo found a realistic association with Hwoarang and set the game to medium difficulty and is enjoying the experience as someone who never played a Tekken game before and made the jump from Nintendo Switch games with their much lower graphic capability and simpler game library.  

As for negatives, well there are a couple, nitpicky honestly though.  The graphics are stunning for the most part, but when there are levels where the floor collapses, you can see this incredibly primitive polygons at times if you look carefully which is just kind of...out of place.  It isn't very noticeable but if you look for it, you'll see it.  Secondly, the stories for the characters are random in quality, but to each their own.  My 12 year old was noticing on one movie end sequence how Jin and Hwoarang were racing on motorcycles a high speed without motorcycle helmets and I told her to just roll with the fantasy elements because the character models are top notch, but this is a video game, goofy, unrealistic fantasy elements right along with mind-blowing visuals and slammin' sound.

So in summary, if you came looking for a superb Tekken update from Tekken 7, Tekken 8 is a worthwhile upgrade and maintains the high quality that comes with your standard Namco video game.

My machine: Windows 11 Pro, AMD Ryzen 7, nVidia RTX 30 8 GB of VRAM, 32 GB of system RAM and a 1 TB SSD, mostly ASUS hardware and the game runs perfectly on my ancient Sony 40 inch XBR6 HDTV at 1080p.

-Multiplayer hub
-Various offline modes like Arcade Battle, an improved Story Mode from 7 and Tekken Ball
-Large private lobby system that can host multiple battles at once
-Rollback netcode
-No paid skins
-Largest release roster of any modern fighter out right now
-Gameplay is fluid with a large skill ceiling like previous Tekken releases

Cons:
-Netcode can go from silky smooth to unplayable.  Seriously, I get that rollback has to predict inputs but this iteration feels like it guesses wrong far too often.  Inputs get eaten on the regular.  I've watched punishes get 'erased' right before my eyes.
-Game still needs some TLC.  I've had to reinstall my drivers twice already since release to fix frame jitters.  For context, my setup is an i7 13k with a RTX 4060.  This shouldn't be happening.

Overall: 9/10

[h1]Story Mode & Character Cinematics[/h1]

The story mode is a complete Jin fanservice, but you don't have to be a Jin fan to like it. They especially tried hard to excite the fans whose childhood coincided with Tekken 3, and I think they were successful in this regard. The cinematics, the music as always, and also the many surprises specific to the story mode were enough to fascinate me. Had many deep moments as well.

There is also a mini arcade mode where we can watch the individual endings of each character, I was very happy that the character cinematics returned, and the game has a true arcade mode now.

[h1]Music[/h1]

I can separately praise the music played in the story mode and the stage music we listened to in the game. The music is just... Tekken.

It was a great surprise for me to have the jukebox on the PC. We can access and listen to the albums of all games in the series and replace the stage music with the music we want.

[h1]Convenience and Learning[/h1]

As always, we can look at the movements and combos of all characters in the classic practice mode. We can learn how to do the movements and practice them.

There is also a mini game mode called Arcade Quest. In fact, this mode aims to teach new players Tekken and test their skills against artificial intelligence opponents that are similar to the player. Doesn't matter if you're just starting out or an og fan like me, the game holds your hand in some way.

[h1]Online[/h1]

Cross-platform works fine and matchmaking works better compared to Tekken 7. This makes me want to play online even more.

Using the avatar we created for Arcade Quest, we can wander around the online lobby and meet people if we want. The lobby functions as both a menu and a chat, it is well thought out.

By the way, fighting with ghosts that copy each player's performance almost exactly is as fun as fighting with the players. You can also train your own ghost.

Even though I'm not a good Tekken player, I enjoyed all the modes and I especially love playing online. Winning gives a strong pleasure, you can feel every hit you throw, and losing teaches you a lot about the character your opponent plays as you continue to play the game. If you like Tekken, do not hesitate, if you are entering the series for the first time, do not worry, the game prepares you for everything.

You can try the demo before buying.

Thank you Namco and Harada.",1707434592,1707434592,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The game provides a substantial amount of gameplay for those who dislike online play. So much so that I would say 36 of the 36 hours spent playing this game have been CPU battles. 

Additionally, the super ghost mechanic provides a challenge that will help almost anyone improve.

The practice mode, along with the replay review system, provides ways for anyone to improve while removing some of the tediousness often found in the practice modes of other games.

When it comes to online gameplay, stemming from the minimal amount I've played, is quite smooth and has minimal latency. Occasional lag spikes have occurred but quickly subsided and did not drastically affect the gameplay.

Special Style is an easy controls option available for new players as well, but the mechanics are not nearly as polished when compared to the Modern Controls seen in Street Fighter 6.

Hosting and creating sessions could improve with more quality of life features, it is difficult to search for a specific lobby and requires constant refreshes to eventually find the lobby you're looking for, and it would also be great to still be able to customize a session while hosting.  The option to fight a dummy while waiting for a match would also be great if a player would prefer to stay warmed up as opposed to spectating, a feature already in Ranked and Quick Match online.

I mainly play Mortal Kombat games, all the Street Fighters, and some of the Guilty Gear / KOF / and games featued in the EVO tournament (including Tekken). What this needs is multiplayer, as not having it on the Steam Deck (without errors) almost makes me want to refund it. It's a fun Tekken, I recommend it, but PLEASE FIX STEAM DECk MULTIPLAYER!!! And include all WiFi bands and connections, better rollback!

Since discovering Ethernet + 2.4 ghz connection on docked mode, I've changed the review back to positive. I STILL think Tekken 8 should improve its multiplayer for WiFi & Steam Deck players, it works in docked mode but only occasionally. Fortunately, I take it to any coffee shop and I get the nice graphics, fun matches, & 2.5d game with its similarities to SF6 with a stream of exciting matches.

My thoughts for T8 by far
1. Beautiful character model - So glad the character models improved so much compared to T7
2. Great fighting experience - New Heat system is pretty good, helps pacing up the matches, in a good way. More health, and combo feels so good as always
3. Satisfied story mode - Feels like watching a decent movie with lots of game matches to play, by playing this mode, I can tell they work so hard to put bunch of details thru out the whole story line
4. Music slaps

I really don't want to give this neither a good review or a bad review. Look I love Tekken 8 as much as the next guy and I think its heading in a great direction. Tekken 8 is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played. & Just like majority of people. I paid retail price for this game. And like other I used to play Tekken 7 for a decent chunk of time. So let's set that as the ground-work. 

Tekken 8's multiplayer experience is what you expect from a Tekken multiplayer experience. Tekken players..... You know exactly what that means. For those not aware. Tekken has a history of having not the most stable / ideal online environment. Now, obviously this can come with the territory of playing fighting games online. Or any online match for that matter. Every game suffers from this. But, Tekken. Playing Tekken online for me feels just as bad as Tekken 7's multiplayer if not, a little worse. Tekken Players know what I am talking about but, examples are below. 

 [b] Crashing > Frame Drops > Lag > Massive Input Lag at times > Fake 3-4 Bars > Inconsistent Punishes Online > Disconnects > ( And So on )
 [/b] 

And in some ways. I almost feel ostracized / selfish calling Tekken 8's multiplayer a let down because so many people are calling it good.  I'm sure ton's of other people might not have the same experience & could disagree with my point by pointing out some technical leap they did to address theses issues from their titles. But, I for the last 30 hours have been trying really really really hard to like Tekken 8. But right now, in the state it's in. I can't seem to find that enjoyment. The feeling I get from the state of this game is the same feeling counter strike players got when counter strike 2 came out. 


Once the honey-moon phase of a new release is done. You start actually experiencing the game for what it is & Tekken 8 is not all glitter and gold lol. But, I digress. I'm sure like i mentioned earlier plenty of people are not having the issues I am having. Do I think this should stop you from buying Tekken 8? No, definitely not. The game is beautiful, fun & has tons of great content & heck. When the online works as intended and the stars align. You might even get to experience an amazing online match as-well. This game deserves all the praise it gets. But, nothings perfect. And I want you to know that going into it. It's a great game. But, be warned that the multiplayer is really not a good resemblance / example of that.  

But this has just been my experience with it. An average consumer like you, spending full retail price on a game ",1707368742,1707369070,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

The only flaw with this game comes in on the story mode. Don't get me wrong, it's great up until the 50% mark.

But what I did NOT expect was a HUGE improvement to the intermediate player experience. You can watch your own replays and the game will pause when you get hit by something that the game thinks you don't know how to answer (""you could have ducked that"", ""here's how you can duck this move you just got hit by""). AND, at the touch of a button, you can launch a minigame in the replay where you practice dealing with that move you just got hit by in the replay.

The online is ok. I've heard some people have issues with the rollback implementation, but I'm not having any problems.

Its very entertaining and I enjoyed my time playing ranked even though I'm a washed up Tekken 5 gamer. There's probably unbalanced cheesy stuff but as an inexperienced player it literally doesn't matter. There is a decent amount of singleplayer as well to ease in newer players which is great.

HOWEVER, this game has a huge flaw, and its the low level fatal error bug that causes a crash that has been extensively documented on the steam forums. For whatever reason, the game will experience a driver-related crash if you use certain GPUs for no real rhyme or reason at any given moment. Some maps appear to crash more than others, and this can happen during inopportune moments that can cause your save data to become corrupted or cause you to disconnect from a ranked match. This crash happens every time I play, I have not once closed the game from the options menu, relying instead on the inevitable crash to end my session with.

Like I said this happens to a wide variety of systems using various GPUs, AMD and nvidia. My system which has a 1080ti and is well above the recommended specs for the game can run the game on ultra with a constant 60 fps, but will crash within 5 minutes on one specific stage, and 30 minutes to 2 hours otherwise. People with 4090s have also experienced this same crash, so people saying its a hardware issue are downplaying the problem for some reason as it can happen on brand new top of the line hardware. For comparison my friend has a 2060 which can hardly play the game at a constant 60 fps on low, and he has never crashed. Meanwhile for me the game is actually unplayable.

Bandai has not even acknowledged that this error exists beyond a useless help article on their website that doesn't fix the issue. They've even replied to support tickets saying that you should ""hire a technician"" if you're affected by this problem. What a joke. This leads me to believe this error may never get fixed since its a relatively small number of players affected.

IF YOU HAVE A 1000 SERIES NVIDIA CARD DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I'm basically out 70 dollars so that I can have the word ""TEKKEN 8"" in my steam library.",1707338310,1707339370,False,86,5,0.640765726566314697,13,True,False,False

It can be a little overwhelming, but it is still a great time if you have a basic understanding of how these types of games work. I feel like that sums up this game pretty well. The first character I picked up to play has over 130 moves, however despite that, it still manages to be a good time even if I don't know many combos or anything like that. I think the key to enjoying a game like this is to not expect to be the best right off the bat, you will get destroyed in every match (probably), however this game provides you so many tools to where there really is no excuse one could have to not improve at the game. 

You can fight AI recreations of another players play style and play against it, which actually helped me understand their play style, to the point where I could actually beat them after adapting to it. You can also fight your own AI Ghost (as the game calls it) to weed out weak points in your play style. 

I think this game is definitely worth the time IF you like fighting games, and if you have the patience for that kind of thing. If you don't, but you still are intrigued by this game, I still think it's worth trying out the Arcade Quest at least, as it gives you the base tool kit you would need to learn how to play the game, albeit it is VERY basic things.",1707327260,1707327260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The developer put much love and effort to this game and they gave us tons of content. They made the characters more expressive and have personality, the stages looks amazing, story are great, Customization are much better and also they bring back Tekken ball!! 
if you new to this game do not be afraid, they made an arcade mode where new player can learn combos, punishment and movement while enjoying the arcade content.
Online match are much better than Tekken 7, especially the load time are the biggest improvement so far, not to mention we now have replay system which players can re-enact the previous match they play, if you got demolished in ranks you can watch and play (Yes you can freely play the replay match) and the game will tell you which move should have been the best option. This feature are so cool and i never seen it before in other fighting game.
There is a lot more content and feature that you can try in this game, I highly recommend this game.

I was not a Tekken player before this, but it has me hooked. Gameplay is amazing, and the netcode is great (I have only had one or two opponents with bad connection so far out of many games). The story, although generic, has astounding production value and phenomenal soundtrack to go with it.
Also, probably the most important thing in making a fighting game feel good to play, the animations, are insane. Tekken 8 easily has the most satisfying buttons to press of any fighter.

After the first update, I can change my review to positive. 

In my opinion this is the best Tekken game since Tekken 3: 

  - Stunning visual
  - An amazing Tekken battle system with new features and improvements. 
  - A lot of content from the start.
  - Tekken provides a big roster of fighters and a lot of character optimization. 
  - Each arena has highly detailed textures and area-layers. 
  - Good online, but need improvements.

Game feels complete and friendly to players, without a greedy free-to-play approach. Yeah, I’m talking about you Capcom.

I’m very satisfied with Tekken 8 and can recommend this game to everyone. 

P.S. Story mode is the weakest part of this game. Perfectly visually, but stupid and empty inside.

Giving plenty of offline modes to hone your skills. Giving everyone two moves list, one that only has the moves you should concentrate on and the other is the full moves set. If your new, concentrate on learning your key moves so it doesnt feel so daunting. Something for everyone, and plenty to keep you coming back for more!

I like how they also brought back Tekken Ball and a few hidden serious and ridiculous content as well.

I am going to go into detail about this:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive Environments:[/b]
[i]Tekken 8 screams breathtaking graphics and brilliantly designed environments that put players in dynamic and vibrant battle arenas.
From bustling city streets to serene natural landscapes and from there to Nightmare realities, each stage is a visual spectacle, enhancing the overall gaming experience.[/i]

[*][b]Refined Gameplay Mechanics:[/b]
[i]Building upon its previous installments, Tekken 8 introduces refined gameplay mechanics that offer a perfect balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for Tekken Pros.
The controls are responsive and creative, allowing players to execute complex combos and special moves with precision. I can also add executing combos that are just frames, are much more easily executable now.[/i]

[*][b]Diverse Roster of Characters:[/b]
[i]With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and backstory, Tekken 8 offers something for every player.
From classic favorites like Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama to newcomers with innovative fighting techniques like Azucena and Victor, the character selection is vast and varied, and rumored to be becoming bigger and bigger in the coming years.[/i]

[*][b]Engaging Story Mode:[/b]
[i]Tekken 8 features an engaging story mode that delves deeper into the rich lore of the Tekken universe.
Players embark on a thrilling journey filled with intrigue, betrayal, and epic showdowns, unraveling the mysteries behind each character's motives, with the main story just based on the Mishima Bloodline.[/i]

[*][b]Robust Online Multiplayer:[/b]
[i]The online multiplayer feature of Tekken 8 delivers an exhilarating experience, allowing players to test their skills against opponents from around the world.
With robust matchmaking features and various online modes, including ranked matches and tournaments, the competitive scene is vibrant and engaging, the net-code is not perfect but its way better than the Tekken 7 when it came out back in the days. [/i]


[*][b]Customization Options:[/b]
[i]Tekken 8 offers extensive customization options, allowing players to personalize their favorite characters with unique costumes, accessories, and cosmetic items. Also paying homage to other characters from the games like Resident Evil with adding their customized costumes in the game.
From traditional martial arts attire to outlandish outfits, the customization options are virtually limitless, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, so that my character may look cool while Kicking A$$.[/i]
[/list]

[b][i]In the end I would like to add that Tekken 8 surpasses expectations as a fighting game masterpiece, combining stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, with new Game Modes and a diverse cast of characters to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, Tekken 8 offers something for everyone and cements its place as one of the finest fighting games of all time. I would recommend highly to anyone and to anybody who is into fighting games or not, as this will hook them up.[/i][/b]",1707280124,1707280220,True,54,2,0.743877112865447998,0,True,False,False

1. I don't really play fighting games very often. so I'm probably not the target audience for this game
2. I haven't played Tekken since like a hand full of times back in Tekken 2.

I just beat the whole game and i cant say that I actually learned how to play. In an attempt to make this entry more appealing to new comer to this franchise it seems that they have added in a soft ""Auto combo"" system the called ""Special style"". I took the time to read as carefully as i could when the prompts came up explaining how this system works and thought at the time that it was a simple base that would grow on me. but as the game progressed it was clear that this system and overall combat was far more complex than I had thought. I would either find myself stuck repeating the same attack over and over making me feel like I had little to no control over my character or completely wipe the enemy with an near endless combo string, leaving little time for the CPU to react. Through out the whole game there was the heavy feeling of ""I have no idea what I am doing"". I feel like the Special Style system was either not explained very well or that there needed to be a dedicated tutorial section in the game somewhere.

Story: it was serviceable

Performance: The game would sometimes stutter during cut-scene. even getting bad enough to skip whole sections of them.",1707276454,1707276454,False,0,0,0.449826985597610474,0,True,False,False

With heightened anticipation, I embarked on this latest adventure in the King of Iron Fist Tournament, eager to experience the evolution of a franchise that has captivated players for decades.

Gameplay (5/5):
Tekken 8 boasts exceptionally smooth gameplay, a hallmark feature that has remained consistent throughout the series. From executing intricate combos to delivering devastating blows, every movement feels fluid and responsive, staying true to the essence of what makes Tekken such a beloved fighting game. Whether engaging in intense one-on-one battles or participating in frenetic multiplayer showdowns, the gameplay mechanics of Tekken 8 never fail to deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience.

Customization (3/5):
While the core gameplay mechanics excel, Tekken 8 falls short in terms of customization options. Compared to its predecessors, the level of customization feels lacking, leaving much to be desired in terms of personalizing characters to match individual preferences. Despite this drawback, the intuitive nature of the game compensates for the limited customization, ensuring that players can still immerse themselves fully in the combat experience.

Storyline (3.5/5):
Admittedly, the storyline of Tekken 8 may not be its strongest aspect. While it exudes a sense of nostalgia, particularly for long-time fans familiar with the lore of the series, some elements may come across as cringe-worthy or predictable. However, it's worth noting that the storyline serves as a conduit for invoking fond memories of past tournaments and iconic characters, tapping into the nostalgia factor that has been a driving force behind the enduring appeal of the Tekken franchise.

Overall Impression (4/5):
In conclusion, Tekken 8 stands as a testament to the franchise's enduring legacy, offering a compelling blend of nostalgia and innovation. Despite its shortcomings in terms of customization and storytelling, the game excels where it truly matters – delivering a seamlessly engaging gameplay experience that is sure to captivate both long-time fans and newcomers alike. For anyone with a passion for fighting games or those seeking an entry point into the genre, Tekken 8 undoubtedly earns its place as a must-play title.

I wholeheartedly recommend Tekken 8 to anyone who appreciates the thrill of competitive combat and the rich history of the Tekken universe. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer eager to experience the adrenaline-pumping action of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, Tekken 8 promises hours of exhilarating gameplay that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",1707276321,1707276321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Apparently since then the game has really come into its own, and instead of being an infinitely deep knowledge check gated by finger breaking mechanical execution, it's also still that but in addition it has a beautifully simple and low-mechanical-requirement skill floor for new folks. You can learn to play this game in a few hours and have tons of fun with your friends and other folks online (now that they have more modern netcode).

Forget the dumb full-dpad triple 360 with a dragon punch inputs of some other fighters. Forget the single frame execution requirement in your 40 move bread-n-butter string of some other games. You can learn these combos! They are fun to do! You can react to these grabs (unless it's Victor)! It's got easy, big one-button moves, but they aren't overtuned. It's got ridiculously over-the-top supers, but they aren't too long and you can't do them multiple times in a round.

As well, the game has amazing graphics all the way down to low-end machines like a steamdeck where it maintains 60fps in matches. The animations are beautiful. There are 32 EXTREMELY distinct characters on launch. It has the incredible soundtracks from every single Tekken game. The stages put the other modern fighting game stages to shame.

While the single player isn't quite as amazing as SF6, it's got two separate modes that are both really excellent. It has a great single player and offline experience generally, and top-notch practice and training modes.

If you have been thinking about getting (back?) into fighting games, I think you'd be happy choosing this one. It has that same ""easy to learn, hard to master"" quality that made Soul Calibur such a big social event back in the day. Just remember to wait your turn ...",1707274048,1707274048,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And after only over 60 hours, I can safely say that this is the best Tekken game to have existed thus far.

Tekken had always been a feature-rich game ever since Tekken 3, having different game modes on top of the usual 1 on 1 fighting game. From Tekken Ball back at Tekken 3, to the beat 'em up style of Scenario Campaign in Tekken 6, the series has everything from a solid fighting game for competitive players, and fun game modes for casuals. Although, Tekken 7 did take a huge hit on the amount of single-player/local multiplayer content being close to non-existent mainly due to it's budget, but it was it's best selling game on it's franchise's history which haven't topped off of since 1997 due to how the game was well balanced (for the most part), how accessible it is (being available for PC was huge since it was the first of it's franchise), and how well the game is as a spectator sport.

So how does Tekken 8 fair against Tekken 7? It pales in comparison. Gameplay wise, Tekken 8 decided to try something different by adding the new heat mechanic, which feels like an immensely drastic change from the usual Tekken feel. The game was always known with spacing and playing footsies on a 3D environment on an extremely high level, but now they really hammered down on making the game more offensive driven with the addition of every mechanic with the heat system, but the defensive tools got a slight increase with sidesteps covering more distance, and also power crushes getting buffed by it being safer on block once the player was hit during the startup frames. Graphically, the game is impressive. It shows how much budget the game actually has in comparison to its predecessor. It could be the best looking fighting game to date.

The story of the game is an absolute love letter to classic Tekken fans. Without getting into much detail, it is the most cliche thing that you could ever think of in any anime, but the final fight makes it all worth it. The final fight made me have that feeling that I can only wish I can relive that moment for the first time all over again. The character endings are back with the classic CGI animations and they do feel like the classic Tekken endings, some being absolutely funny, some weird, and some that is tied to their lore.

The practice tool is very in depth and improved from Tekken 7, giving you tips on how to punish certain moves against all characters and even through your replays. The replay tool also lets you continue from a certain point to help you play against a flowchart that a different person used against you in a match. So now there are added tools for you to learn the game even better.

Super Ghost Battle is an interesting game mode, and I have a little under 50 hours on the demo just playing around the Super Ghost Battle. What it does is it lets you create an AI that follows your every move, habits, combo routes even when you drop your combos. It reminds me of the amiibos in Super Smash Bros Ultimate.
And honestly, I have a lot of fun even just fighting against my own ghost, I see my own patterns and habits going against it and it does makes up for the default AI that Tekken 8 has when playing other modes.

Now here's the big kicker for me, character interaction, how the character feels like an actual character instead of them being random guy # 4 with a moveset. They nailed it here, each character does feel more alive, especially with some intro sequences. It's these levels of detail that made me love Tekken Tag 2. There are definitely some set of characters that needs special intros, but I still love that they exist.

Overall Tekken 8 is a 9/10. The game is damn near a perfect fighting game in my opinion, with the added single player content with Tekken Ball being a nice relaxing game to play with the homies, how well the netcode is to play with people around the world online, how each character and stage looks with very realistic graphics, and the infinite replayability of the Super Ghost Battle. It has the potential to be the best fighting game out there in the market and for sure it rivals Street Fighter 6, which I think is the baseline to what a modern fighting game should be.",1707255404,1707255404,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The launch roster also boasts an impressive 32 characters! Street Fighter 6 launched with 18 for some context.

Most characters have been given a few new moves which adds a veneer of freshness Along with an entire system wide mechanic called ""Heat"".

The Heat system brings new moves along with the possibility to regenerate some health which really encourages a very aggressive style of play. While very flashy, the cinematic moves from heat gets tiresome very fast. With a first to 3 format these flashy scenes will play a whopping 10 times PER match.

god I'm so fucking gay for King . every second of my life doesn't go well unless i think of him, my beautiful eccentric man. i will get down on both knees, beg and bow down
just for a glimpse of him. it doesn't matter of what part, it can be a knee. his fingernail, or even a strand of
hair. I don't care, as long as its him. King , my beloved, where are you in this world. wonder when you will incarnate a worthless being and come to me in the river stream. or will you have me on the brink of death in wait, on my death bed lying and pondering the thought of you. staring, sick and ghastly, hand out and reaching for you like my last wish. the shooting star in my sky, so far and out of my mortal reach. King , oh sweet King , please come to me. lure me in like an angels song. have me petrified and amazed by your glory like the god you were. have me make shrines of you with these bare weak hands, unmarked of calluses and full of so much energy. King , where are you? can you hear my cries? how loud they are in the faint moonlight, out the window they sound like a mockingbird. to find you, explore every part of the ocean, have no care in my stamina, will. i Know ill find you, ill be pulled into you by force. like you're a covalent bond, my heart will flow of pure love. just for you, my heart skips a beat. for you, i breathe the oxygen around me. only for you, ill give my heart. all my necessities vanish just for one glance of you. King , your words mean galaxies. the one I'm in means nothing unless you're init. id do so much, yet so little will happen from my mortality. praise you like a superhero, want you like a child's favorite blanket, love you like a dog

For its price I cannot recommend it.
It has way too many effects on screen during the fights, and the game somehow drags in my machine.
I have a RTX 3070 my computer is not that bad
Character customization is not a big deal.
Feels like some game modes were done in the laziest way possible recycling stuff.
At start of game we had some cut scenes with reaction time, and they gave a dynamic to the fights... I was fooled cause I never saw those again
I know this is not Mortal Kombat but at least there should be some battle damage since it's a fighting game the fact that some action scenes characters are thrown arround buildings breaking everything and come out with 0 visible damage breaks the immersion for me

Sorry but I didn't enjoy the game, and unfortunately couldn't get a refund due to a few minutes over the 2 hours limitation which is really annoying. Comparing to MK1, I would say I enjoyed more fighting in MK1 even though MK1 is for me one of the worst fighting games released nowadays

Tekken 8 is my first Tekken game ever. I'm not huge into fighting games, however I probably have about 125-150 hours across the Mortal Kombat and Soul Calibur  franchises.

Getting right into it, I am in love with Tekken 8. Clocking about 30 hours so far, the game has a way of teaching you the mechanics like non other through the various modes then game provides, right down to specific character mechanics. 

The practice tool is extremely versatile and helps you practice specific moves as much as you wish, where as the Arcade Quest Mode teaches you the generic mechanics of the game while facing seemingly more and more difficult challengers as you progress and learn to use the taught mechanics. Definitely recommend Arcade Quest to be your first stop as a new Tekken player.

The AI Ghost Battles are a fantastic addition to fighting games in general and I hope to see it in more games going forward as it is another great tool for practice.

Online play has been challenging as veteran players make there way up the ranks from the bottom.I can see and feel myself improving at a steady pace with lots of practice, which keeps me coming back for more. 

Those wanting a more social aspect to their fighting games will love the Tekken Fight Lounge, a virtual space in which your player avatar from the Arcade Quest Mode can walk around and interact with other players.

Customization of characters is very good in Tekken 8 and allows players to feel as though there characters are truly their own. It can leave me wanting more in some areas when it come to customizing, but I don't think that what makes a fighting game great, so I can't let that hold it back.

Tekken 8 is a 9/10 fighting game that is worth every penny to those willing to put in the time to learn the game at a controlled pace. I truly do not have many if any, negative things to say about the game.",1707157688,1707157688,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to fight online be sure to check first character tier because they are made uneven,so that some are slower or lack some useful attacks. Single play bots are dumb as wall. And I even try to teach my ghost fighter,still it is dumb as brick. Dumb noobish super sayan powers at low hp is SUPER anoying breaking fights rhythm and making both players stop and defend like 2 morons afraid of each other. What worse these moves have cut scenes and they are of course unskipable and soon they become tedious,repetitive and boring to level of annoying.

as for the online there is alot of things i didnt like like heats and stuff they really have to do something about it, like, if the opponent used heat you are done, all the pressure is on you, some characters are broken and deals tons of damage like lee chaolan. it really needs to be patched as soon as possible

All of them having releases within half a year of each other.  This gives us very easy compares with those so fresh in our mind.  And there are a lot of arguments for Tekken 8 being possibly the best.  I say this because while I talk what I think the game does well and not well I will be making comparisons to it's contemporaries.  I assume that is why most people are reading a review is where should they put their money.

Graphics are gorgeous.  As of writing this the best looking fighter on the market imo and best of the big 3.  The story mode features movie like cut scenes which transition to game play.  If you blink you may not even notice you are about to enter game play.  SF6 does a better job with consistency.  For example there is less clipping of outfits and hair physics are better.  But this game is just downright pretty from the characters to the stages.

Sound is top notch.  Landing blows is satisfying.  Nothing sounds flat.  Blocking has the classic Tekken sound.  Nearly all the voice acting sounds really good.  Only a couple don't quite do it for me.  Music in Tekken is always hit or miss for me.  It's kind of the same here.  It will either be a banger or something having you say wtf.  One super nice feature is ""Jukebox"".  It allows you to play music from any previous Tekken game or all of them mixed in.  Even create your own play list.  At no extra charge - imagine that.

Story mode took me a little over 4 hours to complete on medium difficulty.  Each character has a ""mini"" story mode which consist of 5 encounters with beginning and ending cut scenes.  There is also a mode called ""Arcade Quest"" that is a story mode for the player but also functions as a great tutorial.

A single in game currency is used to unlock addition pieces to customize the players avatar for Arcade Quest and all kinds of bits a bobs for the main roster of characters.  You can kind of build your own skin.  Of course your limited to what is there.  But I have seen some crazy outfits and references I easily understand for online play.  You can make your character nearly unrecognizable.  For no extra charge.  Everything earned by playing the game.

Speaking of which, lets go ahead and clear out some elephants.  There is no battle pass.  No real money is asked for player avatar cosmetics or main roster cosmetics.  Sure, some things may come later as DLC.  But there is not an in game store button anywhere to be found.  While Capcom and NRS has put a disgusting amount of micro transactions into SF6 and MK1 respectively it's so nice to have a major fighting game release not try to milk their players for all they are worth.  In an era or 12$ fatalities and 15$ turtle avatar costumes Tekken earns a lot of respect from me personally.

Similar to Modern controls from SF6 Tekken has a control style called ""Special Style"".  Featuring auto combo's that can be varied depending on buttons pressed, access to easy throws and lows and some general special moves to throw out.  Overall it's neat to be able to do some crazy looking combo's while having no knowledge of how the game works especially since Tekken is an intimidating game to get into.  Without getting too deep in the weeds Special Style has a ceiling.  It will only carry you so far.  With Modern in SF6, while Classic is still dominant at high level play, I believe Modern can be competitive.  And can reach some pretty high levels.  You won't reach high levels with Special Style.  It's not really an alternate way to play the game.  It is true training wheels you will have to remove at some point.  Sooner the better.

Online is great.  Best Tekken has ever felt.  Some wireless opponents may be sketchy.  Accept those at your own risk.  But nowadays it more of a low risk.

The practice mode and tutorials are superb.  For being such an intimidating game to get into with every character having a couple hundred moves - they seem to being doing almost everything possible to teach basics, bread and butters and get players acclimated to the game.  When watching replays it will give suggestions like in T7.  But now you can take the replay over and actually practice the suggestions given.  Everything the game teaches may not be the most optimal stuff or things you will see at evo.  But it's effective.  You can apply everything to actual matches and see results.  Again, just superb practice mode and tutorials.

For me, it's a toss up between SF6 and Tekken 8.  Both titles bury MK1 in the dirt face down.  SF6 is probably a better choice for most people.  My 11 year old daughter and I have a much better time playing locally with Modern controls.  She even plays some ranked online here and there.  I am personally better at Tekken as I been playing off and on since Tekken 3 and it is a series that rewards skill earned in previous entries.  So I may be a bit biased also.  The training mode and tutorials are best in show.  I don't feel taken advantage off with silly micro transactions and battle passes.  Both SF6 and Tekken 8 are great games for different reasons.

Tekken has always been an extremely difficult fighting game to learn for new comers and it still is difficult but Tekken 8 is the most accessible Tekken in the series for new players. The game has amazing tutorials, practice features and really goes in depth to teach you the ropes on how to play the game proper. They also have a 'special style' feature that resembles SF6 modern controls and makes for a fun experience even for those who are completely new to fighting games. 

Every character in the game is juiced up with new moves and crazy buffs that make every character a serious threat especially with the new 'Heat' mechanic which I think makes this game incredibly fun and stands out from other fighting games. 

Harada, Murray and the Tekken team at Bandai Namco really focused not only on amazing gameplay but they put a heavy focus on single player features and content that I personally think blows SF6, MK1 and honestly any other fighting game out of the arena. Amazing story mode, possibly the greatest fighting game story mode of all time. The music, the atmosphere, the stages all make for an amazing experience. New Jukebox feature allows you to pick and choose which songs, from the entire godlike Tekken music catalog, you want playing during fights, main menu and other menu locations like customization screen. 

If you're not a super competitive person or are nervous to play ranked/players matches online with other people, you can literally try out Tekken ball mode, hang out with friends in Arcade area with you custom avatar and they have a ton of hilarious and really cool side story campaigns for each character that shows a video of what they are up to outside of the main story. Also, my personal favorite when I'm not playing ranked and that is Ghost Mode. You can literally play against some of the best player's in the world's Ghost AI that plays just like them or you can play against your own Ghost, who will resemble your play style. This is truly one of the greatest features of all time and it shows off how far video games have come and will continue to go in the future. 

If you are a competitive player and want to get good at Tekken or learn matchups, they track and keep record of all of your fights so if you're getting destroyed by annoying characters like Panda or Asuka, you can go to your replay of that match and the game will not only show you what is punishable and how to tech throws you were getting hit by but they also allow you to literally jump in to the replay and take control of your character to see what you could have done to counter what the opponent was doing. Truly next level stuff here.

Online netcode is very good, rematches are instant, no load screens like old Tekkens. Character customization is hilarious and very cool, they allow you to make some amazing custom skins with their customization features.

Tekken 8 has something for everyone and I can honestly say that Tekken 8 might just be the greatest fighting game of all time.

I really enjoy that every round you have your heat and ultimate so there is no cross round resource management and every round you can feel free to use everything at your disposal.

Also the customisation is great, Avatar customisation is ok. Character customisation is amazing and the Jukebox is a very welcome touch.

32 Characters on launch is amazing and not enough can be said about it. Feels like an endgame roster yet there is so much more to come.

Practice has some amazing tools as well which helps you improve yourself against anything you want. The AI Ghosts are also very cool and you can practice against anyone you want and it doesn't feel like a robot playing.

Online feels super smooth when its running well but sometimes there are more matches with small hitches than I would like. However overall it runs really well more often than not. Just be sure to use an ethernet cable.

At the end of the day its a fighting game, if you are willing to grind and enjoy the actual game play along with all the extra content you are in for a great time.",1707107990,1707107990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe due to the fact that I'm a street fighter fan and in general, I only really played fighting games during my childhood/arcade era. 

Now fast forward to 2024 after for dunno what felt like a millennia, Tekken wasn't even in my radar of games but for some reason just to get out of my monotony, I decided to just f**k it I'll buy whatever is on release that's out of my usual genre of games. And dang, it's whole a different experience! I felt the nostalgia of my childhood going to the arcades after school (I'm not a delinquent) I never felt like this for so long. I'm enjoying this game so much, like very very much! 

So anyways, Tekken 8 was really good. It has all the tools you need to keep your interest and be a better player especially for beginners such as me who never played fighting games for so long. One thing I would also like to emphasize is on how responsive the controls of this game. Not only it's visually impressive but it's    so responsive to play. That's why it feels good to play. 

Performance - Absolutely amazing. It's rare for a day one release to run almost without problems.

Still have much things to discover from this game and I'm excited to continue my journey with Tekken 8.

Only complaints are the fact Tekken 8 has less customization then Tekken 7 which didn't have much for a Tekken game, and the fact the devs heard some people don't like rage arts so they added heat smashs which are just unarmored rage arts that do little less damage but are super positive on block.

The story in 8 was probably the first Tekken game in a long time that I wanted to finish, even though it's very corny/cringey. I love it's being called anime fast and furious because it's pretty spot on, last couple Tekken stories had pretty bad pacing but this one is just non-stop action and every time you think it can't get anymore insane it proves you wrong.

I loved all the character story endings but I feel like KIngs and Pauls were missing just a little more at the ends.

Can't complain about the online, yea I have it set to only 4+ bars but I've had very little issue even wifi matchs.

I know the 180+ move list can be intimidating, but like I told people in Tekken 7 your only going to be using around 20-30 of the moves so don't worry about trying to remember all 180+ moves. And in Tekken 8 it seems like most characters need to use even less. On top of that it's not uncommon for different characters to have similar moves with similar inputs and if they are good on one character they're normal good on others.

Biggest complaint is the lack of character customization, I thought Tekken 7 was bare bone but 8 is a whole new level. I like how you can recolor nearly ever little detail on character default skin and alts but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the character customization.

I get that rage arts are like by people who don't play fighting games often, and honestly I personally don't have a issue with rage arts seeing how if their blocked they are easy to punish. I do have issue with heat smashs though, because with out smashs the heat system would be a ok new edition to the game.  Heat bust is a good ""get off me"" or combo extender, I really like that while in heat mode different moves get empowered, and heat dash is useful on some character. But heat smash is such a weird design because why use the empowered moves? Why use heat dash to make moves that normally can't combo work in a combo? Why do either of them when you can just heat burst and then immediately heat smash if it's blocked why would you care the person pushed so far away they can't do anything about it and if it hits then you do a big chunk of damage for just pressing a single button. I've played Tekken for a long time but I am not even close to a ""pro"" at all. So when I do real good in a round and I get the opponents hp down to right at the point they enter rage with only being jabbed a few times myself, and then they heat burst and keep backing up until they see me do anything, including dashing, and they burst doing big chunk of damage and then they wait for me to push anything again and then they rage art and because Yoshi doesn't have anythings to do they remaining hp in one hit they get the rage art. So by hitting just 3 buttons to burst, smash, and rage art they do as much damage as I did by ""playing properly"" or sometimes it's just enough to kill me even though I've only been hit by a few jabs vs the opponent who I've side stepped counter hit into full Yoshi combo two or three times, it feel really bad when it happens 3 or more times in a single hour. Smashs should not be even remotely positive on block and if they just throw it out and just completely miss, their character should be left reeling for a good long while.",1707098019,1707098019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For reference, I wasn't a Tekken fan before this entry. I disliked Tekken 7 and how difficult it was to learn. However, I haven't had nearly the same experience with this game. Inputs feel better, the characters are all extremely cool, and I feel like the training the game gives me is so much better. I love the character variety and some of the universal mechanics making it easier to play the game and enjoy it. I think it is a great competitive game that you can jump into, find a character you like and play. Character customization is okay, but apparently it is worse than other Tekken games but I can't give much input. The music is fire, and includes earlier games so if you don't like this one, you can do some of the newer ones. I think the story is absolute hot garbage of bullshit that makes absolutely no sense. It feels extremely rushed and everything moves so quickly. It is better than Guilty Gear Strive but looked at Street Fighter 6's in comparison, this one is awful.

Coincidentally, I upgraded to a completely new system (new mainboard, CPU, GPU, RAM), and now the game crashes are completely gone. What was causing the problem before is still a mystery. 
For the time being, I am leaving my review as negative, because the apparent number of customers who have to deal with an unplayable game is just too high. If this issue should finally be acknowledged and fixed, I will change this to a positive review, because the gameplay is excellent. 

(Even though, as a 3D fighter novice, I just suffered a 15 loss streak and will continue to be losing all of my matches for a very long time ;_;  )

For the moment, the singleplayer features might be a bit lacking and the navigation of the online matchmaking systems could be (a lot) more intuitive.

If you enjoy your 1 v 1 fighting games and an incredible deep and satisfying combat system with a ton of fighters with even more moves, option and individual styles, get this game.

The game sucks like almost in all criteria:
1. Graphics. I relay don't understand why people hyped around new graphics, it looks the same as T6 (maybe added few effects)
2. Characters design. Maybe I'm just not enough weaboo, because some characters looks like the are guest characters straight from FF or KH.
3. Customisation. The lobby is fucking Kunstkamera. I would better pay $100 for few skins rather playing with thous clowns. (and you even cant disable it)
4. Game play.  basically the game about joggling, 2-3 command grab or joggle combo = you dead. Neutral is exceptional phenomenon on a high rank. And at the same time you don't have no combo brackers 
5. Solo. Stupid story mod, that you have to finish to open other mods. Easy and short ""arcade"" and tekken ball....

First off they mad the combat more aggressive while still keeping the core Tekeken combat, the new heat system isn't as broken as I thought it would be and can consumed very quickly with the chip damage not being too bad when blocked.
The story mode is a big difference compared to Tekken 7's with having a lot more bombastic action and more higher stakes while still paying respects to the older story beats helping newer players understand Tekken 8's story.

Awful internet infrastructure. 5/10 of my online matches have had latency issues, complete lag spikes that ruin any plans i had of playing a fun game. This is on top of the noticeable frames of input lag on my side of things. It feels like playing underwater. The devs refusal to implement state of the art netcode out of PRIDE is awful. While this game was in development, fans urged Harada and the dev team to implement a netcode similar to Street Fighter 6's, which is amazing to play on. Didn't happen. 

This is being sold on Steam, a platform where 95 percent of players use online multiplayer when playing with others. I find the lack of great netcode (Like street fighter's) to be a glaring problem with Tekken 8. After story mode and single player, you will want to turn to online matches for fun, the poor netcode and online experience persists from Tekken 7, which really sucks after waiting so long.

Edit: So I learned something cool, If you go into game settings you can change the netcode system to ""prioritize fluidity."" You can also restrict matchmaking to 5 bars (near perfect) connection only. ALSO you can choose to not match against any Wi-Fi players and prioritize ethernet. So now, after you have removed 98.5 percent of the matchmaking playerbase, only 3/10 of your games will be laggy and feel awful. Try it out :)

TLDR: It is clear the Tekken team put a lot of time making this game look and sound beautiful, but the choice to ignore easily available netcode that would perfect this game, out of pride, is a horrible mistake that prevents this game from being the amazing next-gen fighter it could have been.",1706908563,1706987211,False,4,2,0.478762447834014893,0,True,False,False

TEKKEN 8 is the culmination of decades of experience by the Bandai Namco team mixed with love and trust in their own franchise. Every aspect of the game, from graphics to gameplay, has been polished to its ultimate form in a show of dedication and passion. This series is, and always will be, the most hype and engaging of any fighting game series in my opinion. No other fighting game gets the same emotional response out of me such as this one. The overarching story for TEKKEN may be convoluted and nonsensical at times but The Dark Awakens is honestly one of the best stories in a fighting game to date. 

[h2] The Dark Awakens [/h2]

This has got to be one the hypest, most balls to the wall, action-packed single player modes in a Fighting Game to date. Its a short story, yes, but from beginning to end, the action never stops. Initially I thought it wouldn't be anything special but I'm glad to say I was completely wrong. Not only is it an entertaining story, it also manages to give far more character to some of the TEKKEN 7 cast that were left than TEKKEN 7 ever did. On top of that, fans of the series will absolutely love all the little details and references to past games and media. Great choreography and a blood-pumping soundtrack come together to raise the experience far above the rest. I've played my fair share of single player story modes but [h3] NONE [/h3] ever managed to be this exhilarating. I was screaming like a little girl as my skin crawled from PURE, UNFILTERED HYPE. God, I can't even begin to describe the final battle. I began tearing up a little bit as the jaw-dropping action took place and Jin faced his fears and limitations. This single story mode ALONE cemented TEKKEN as my favorite fighting game franchise. Previously I would go back and forth between SF and TEKKEN but not anymore. 

[h2] Gameplay [/h2] 

TEKKEN is all about personal fights. Very rarely will a character have a projectile. Most fights are face-to-face and close quarters. Your opponent will almost always be within striking distance at any given moment. TEKKEN has changed very little since TEKKEN 4/5, only deciding to improve on what's already there and adding to what's already shown to work. If it's not broken, don't fix it, right? TEKKEN allows for people of all skill levels to have fun with the game, but once you decide to look deeper, you'll discover just how complex it all can be. TEKKEN rewards your time studying and learning with full, uninterrupted control of your character.  The sheer amount of moves characters have may be daunting or even overwhelming for newcomers but, in time, you'll learn to trim the fat and focus on 15-30 key moves for your own character and your opponent's. I will admit I was a bit concerned regarding the new direction TEKKEN was heading with this entry. 
This game's theme is certainly [h3] AGRESSION [/h3]. I'm glad and relieved to say I'm enjoying this new entry very much. Defense will always be a huge part of TEKKEN and you can be as defensive as you like, and once you finally decide to make your move, you'll have the opponent guessing for their life... provided you don't take too much chip damage of course. 

[h2] Online [/h2] 

I'm delighted to say the online play is simply the best the series has ever had. I could go on and on and praise it for days on end but you'll just have to believe me. Those disgusting Wi-fi users are still a toss up between a good enough match or an awful, stuttering experience. Just deny the match and move on. Buy a freaking 5 dollar ethernet cable, damn it! 

[h2] Extras [/h2] 

Customization is not as good as it was in previous entries but its serviceable enough. You'll easily be able to make something you like, though I'll never be able to shake the feeling of what could have been. Regardless, if I love the way my character looks, that's a surefire way to get me to come back. 
Jukebox is finally here for every platform and I love how every single OST from the TEKKEN series is here. 

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

TEKKEN 8 is simply the best parts of the franchise put together into one. TEKKEN is the best (and only) 3D fighting game franchise and for good reason. It was all worth the wait.  ",1706232478,1706986318,True,2,1,0.538106262683868408,0,True,False,False

Excellent graphics, story is classic Tekken but with top tier cutscenes and very enjoyable although short story mode. 
Arcade Quest is a prolly my favorite sp content mode as it's basically a big tutorial for new players where it teaches u new mechanics as u advance through the mode as well Ghost Battle mode where u fight AI versions of online fighters.
Roster is very good with 32 fighters although there is no classics like Eddy but he is coming in dlc 1.
Gameplay is super fluid and always constant 60 fps and new mechanics really do make game difficulty floor lower while raising the skill ceiling at same time.
I would recommend this game to every fighting fan even if you play only 2D fighters you can atleast test demo which is available for free to see if u like it.

Super Ghost Battle - A Juiced version of treasure battle able to download ghosts of other players both pros as well as friends, You are even able to battle your own ghost.

Tekken Ball - It's back and better then it was in Tekken 3 or other Tekkens.

Has ranked and casual online modes.

Has cross-play.

Has Rollback.

Has a large launch roster of various fighters that are actually different from one another.

Has customization options you unlock by playing the game versus charging your card.

Has a theater mode to get a since of what happened in previous titles.

Has a Jukebox mode to customize Tekken 8's banger of a sound track as well as import tracks from previous games and assemble your own custom lists.

The multi-tiered stages with breaks on walls and floors are amazing! They were good in previous ones, but now they blow out ""Level-oution"" from games like Battlefield and that's a whole other genre.

It's like they took all the best things from Tekken 3, Tekken 5 and Tekken 7 and added new tools, Systems and modes on top of what made those games good as well as smoothing out the gameplay experience to where all movement feels very fluid and their is minimal input delay regardless of platform.

It bridges the gap between ""believable"" and over the top ""anime"" and ""wire"" action sequences much like great Kung-Fu cinema movies of the 60's - 80's, As well as more modern titles.

> Has some single player content
> Improved SS opens up mindgames
> Improved Throw system makes them more viable
> Can view other players' replays 
> Can take over replay and lab situation without manually going into practice mode and finding the move in the move list
> Instant rematch 

Bad:
> Rank system has no placement matches and good players goes through lower ranks winning 20+ games in a row.
>> Fix: placement matches and make Tekken ladder ELO based.

> In replays it is hard to lab near end of the round as it automatically skips to the next round.
>> Fix: at the end of the round ask player for confirmation if he want to jump to next round.

> After the match if opponent declines , but you accept rematch you still have to wait for timeout to be able to go back to standby.
>> Fix: Allow going to standby

> You cannot exit game in the shortcuts alt+f4 is faster.
>> Fix: make exit game button default in the shortcut menu.

> You cannot tell if move is + on block visually for all such moves, not good for game with 100 moves per character
>> Fix: Adjust animation

Ugly:
> No punishment for pluggers.
>> Fix: make them lose rank. Time out them from ranked.

> Leaderboard show only top 10`000 people, I cannot see all my friends there and where they are.
>> Fix: Allow me to see all my friends on leaderboard - even if they are below 10k place

Best Tekken ever in my opinion.
Way better than Tekken 7.

But GFX is too good, so i set everything to Low

I started with my favorite Character Law in Multiplayer.
So previous information is based on some first attempts in multiplayer.

3- February- 2024  -- My score story mode 9.5/10 ( I dont give a 10, nothing is perfect)
and here's why...
Today i played the story mode. (A tip play story mode: do it in one row for example in a afternoon)
I can safely say this is best fighting story mode ever to date, from all fighting games.
It's not just my opinion, but its a Fact!

This afternoon i played in 3 a 4 hours the whole story mode in One row.
Really, really too insane story.. 100% story mode immersion.
You completely are sucked into the story.
Cinematics TOP-notch!, STORY: very very very great!
I laughed, was multiple times really impressed, very great story did i already say it? HAHA
I will never forget this story it's just too good. 
- I have essential tremor disease and after the game my hands were shaking of intensity xD
and i was very exhausted (in arms) and i felt great after the story.
Beautiful story it could be anime or a movie, but gaming is always more fun.... YES HAPPY!
.. Hands-down the best fighting game story and Best Tekken from all Tekkens.

Are you a fighting gamer or new to fighting games.. THIS is IT! Buy or Buy
, but there is so much more to do in this game. This review will be updated without spoiling.

Even if it's a 4 or 5 bar match if its WiFi it's basically unplayable. I can't get matches unless I'm in a battle lounge and even then it takes ages to find one. If I want a good connection I have to play without cross-play and if I'm not playing cross play it seems to takes forever to get a match. I also get disconnected from the battle lobbies quite often. I'm playing wired on PC so I really don't think this should be happening. Customisation is a big step down IMO. But the single player content is really good and the game is a ton of fun, loving all the characters so far. If you like Tekken you're probably already playing it. If you're new to Tekken and are looking to jump in then this is a great starting point, especially if you live in a region like Europe or America. If you have a friend who's around the same skill level I think this would be the best possible fighting game to play together. Between the customisation and the cool factor, you're in for a treat. If you have no friends who play fighting games and aren't good at Tekken at all (like me) it might be a bit tough to get into.

My friend, who's a new FG player, started the game and the offline mode was able to teach him how to progress, with relevant tutorials to use in an actual ONLINE match. I, for one, appreciate how it was able to teach me the new mechanics. Air combos are easier to do with the ""Tornado"", making air combos easier to learn and do.

Another interesting take is that you could download someone's AI Ghost and fight it. An AI learned Ghost that actually takes in how the player exactly plays. You could even battle and teach your own AI Ghost.

Definitely hard to get into, but once you ""get"" Tekken, it's easily, and very oddly the most chill fighting game I know of.
Something about how flow is achieved? I don't quite have good words for it at all. It's super chill once you kinda get whats going on and you ""figure out how to figure stuff out"", if that makes sense. 

For those who've never played a fighting game before, this is both the easiest and hardest one to get into imo. For the easy stuff, it's fairly intuitive? Traditional 2D games are VERY archaic, they're intuitive once you get them but... Tekken kinda just makes sense. The high mid low game is both super easy to get and also very difficult to master. Yeah, you can ""get"" ducking highs or whatever, but I can only IMAGINE my self fuzzy blocking lows DURING neutral movement right now. Let alone reading wave dash mix, or whatever else is going on.

Execution is ALSO very easy... and some of the hardest in the genre. The button buffer is SUPER generous, movement buffer doesn't exist afaik. You can get good damage off a combo with 10 minutes of practice. You can get great situational damage off a combo after 600 hours of practice... it's crazy.

If you value movement in games? Specifically movement being a skill and something you can express yourself with, I HIGHLY recommend Tekken. 

Oddly, it reminds me of Melee? In a way? Specifically just that movement is hard, your character can be in a lot of states that cause specific attacks to happen. Neutral in Melee is obv VERY different but the core idea of turns being a little more loosely defined is VERY apparent in Tekken. If you're minus 1 to idk 3 or 4 in Tekken, it's fairly reasonable to just... move out of the way of someone taking their turn back with a jab, so you can steal their turn. They can respond by delaying their jab and catching your movement. Very cool stuff!

I super cannot wait to get good at this game, it's gonna be so much fun :D",1706953411,1706953411,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately I've run into performances issues, including Several ""Initialize error"" messages and long load times. That could be my fault however as my CPU processor is old. Other than that this game has so much to over. The amazing fighting mechanics that Tekken has always been known for are present and over thirty characters in the base roster. This game has something to offer for every fighting game player. The Cinematic story mode titled The Dark Awakens is quite possibly the most ambitious, epic, and memorable fighting game story mode every produced. Its shorter than what you may be used to if you play MK and Injustice but it packs quite a punch. Jin Kazama goes through a tremendous character arc, one that brought genuine goosebumps and heartfelt moments. The final fight is beautifully choreographed and concludes the story with a bang. The ending leaves you wants more as expect and there are still loose ends to be tied up and explained but its good that we have a solid story arc to prop us into the next generation of Tekken after the somewhat lackluster Tekken 7 story mode. 
      Besides that there is a lot to do. The Arcade Quest is a fun little mini game reminiscent of old school Arcade play as well as a clever nod to Tekken world Tour competitive gaming. The new Replay and Tips feature adds so many tools to help player improve their skills and the New Super Ghost Battle ensures that you can play against anyone you want even when they are not available Online. You can even fight yourself. Its a brilliant feature and one I hope they will continue to build on in the future. The Presentation of this game is sublime. Namco really stepped it up with the visuals and this is apparent in the epic redesigns many of the characters have. I look forward to playing this for many years to come and to see the Tekken fandom and community grow after this new release. This is phenomenal and the best game to come out of this three decade old franchise since Tekken 5. What a time to be alive!",1706944283,1706944283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Day 2: This iteration of Tekken is easily my favorite of all time. It has an extra emphasis on being aggressive with the new Heat Dash system and the stages look absolutely amazing.

Easily something here for everyone and a great story to boot ( I haven't actually played said story, just heard it was good. Spent hours online battling)

And If you just want to have some beating people up kind of fun I can really recommend it. Im just way too scared hopping in on the online mode so I cant say anything about that. But in singleplayer it should be fun for almost everyone who played any tekken before and liked these aswell.. ALSO the story mode is just crazy fun and you also be able to understand whats going on even without having played any other Tekken game before, since you could also get a recap for the story anyway. The movelist is extensively long as you would reccon from a Tekken game since every face button corresponds with a limp of the character and you can get some wilde combos with that (Even tho if I do a crazy combo its mostly on accident but also that is just simple fun anyway.. maybe one day I'll learn how to actually do cool shit but until then I just train my Reina and try some other characters) I also really hope for DLC for characters of the previous games that aren't here like Eddie or any other capoera character since they were fun also.

Personally, I prefer the graphics and art direction of Tekken 8 over the other recent fighting games. Tekken 8 doesn't take itself too seriously and is intentionally ridiculous and over the top with characters like giant panda bears.

Tekken 8 is a 3D fighting game; your character can juke to their left & right and thus are not locked to a 2D plane. There are a lot of 2D fighting games on the market, but not a lot of quality 3D fighting games. So, I think it is likely Tekken 8 will maintain a healthy player population for a long time.

Tekken 8 has been my first Tekken game. Tekken is a bit notorious for being hard to get into, and I can definitely see why. It is complicated and will take a long time to master. However, there are a lot of game modes to help beginners, so despite the complexity Tekken 8 is proving to be a good entry point to the franchise.",1706833082,1706928860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- I've always struggled, when it comes to fighting games.
- My brain being the worst with 2D fighters, but i do enjoy some of them only casually tho.
- But something with Tekken grabs me. It might be cause of I played a lot of it with my friends, when I was a kid.

- Tekken 8 making character moves easier but also much more, gives me much easier time learning characters I like.
- Like I've learner 2 more characters already, when I only somewhat managed to play Paul in 7 and 8.

- Story was a banger. Just plain enjoyed it. 
- Online feels much much better from 7, even had no issues when playing with my american buddy. 
- Tho Wi-Fi is a different story, its pretty much 50/50 if you're gonna have issues or not.
- Jukebox, just makes the game even more enjoyable.
- And no mirco-transaction bullcrap, that seems to slither into all games these days.

- If i would give the game a rating it would be a solid 9/10
- I'm gonna enjoy this game for many years forward.

I haven't had any games to look forward to in a while besides CS2, which is really undewhelming, and MGS3 remake, which will allow me to replay another favorite from my childhood.

Anyways, onto the Tekken review. 

GAMEPLAY

If you've played Tekken before... it's Tekken alright. If you haven't, then you're in for a treat to one of if not the best fighting game of the past 10 years. New mechanics have been introduced that close the skill gap, which is good for newer players, yet will still reward veterans. I'd be saying nothing important to actually explain what Tekken is, but Tekken 8 is a damn good representation of how a Tekken game [i] should [/i] play.

CHARACTERS

I'll try not to stir the pot of who I think should be in the game or not, but I think I can say something all Tekken fans can agree on when I say the base roster is great. Whether or not it has some of my favorites is irrelevant, for new players specifically, this roster gives a huge variety! For veterans, I'm sure most of us can agree that there are characters here that we all know how to play already, despite some of us missing characters who were in 7. For instance, in 7 I was a big Kuni, Lili, and Julia player; despite Kuni and Julia not being here, at least we have Lili still, and I've taken a liking in Reina!

STORY

Usually in Tekken, the story is serviceable enough and is usually nothing to write home about. In 8, I enjoyed the story and like before, it wasn't anything to write home about. SPOILER IN HIDDEN TEXT, CLICK FOR SPOILER ! ! ! [spoiler] The ending where Jin slowly goes back to Kazama style was awesome, especially paired with his T3 theme! I do think the whole Angel Jin character design was a little goofy but I'm all for it building up to the ending fight. [/spoiler]

MULTIPLAYER

This is the core of all fighting games... and the ranked system is great! There's very little lag in my experience, and I've played with friends who live across the world from me, as I am in NA East, I've played with friends in Japan and eastern Europe with no lag to speak of. 

PRACTICE TOOLS

This is [b] HUGE [/b] for all you newcomers considering picking this up. Unlike the previous game, frame data is included with the base game. If you've played fighting games before this feature seems like a given, but since it was DLC in 7, it's great to see it here as part of the practice mode. Speaking of the practice mode, it's the best I've seen in a fighting game yet. You can change so many settings that it's hard to keep track of. You can even compete against a ghost of yourself to find gaps in your playstyle. Besides that, you can watch replays and take control of both characters (as long as the other player is not a CPU), which lets you see how you could have tackled a situation differently. For new players and people like me who go into this game labbing off day one, this is amazing to have available.

CONCLUSION

If you've never played Tekken before, this game will welcome you with open arms. If you've played in the past, it's all the same. The hype is justified for Tekken 8, pick it up and try something new. Good luck out there! 

P.S. if I PEWGF you in online don't take it personally.

Customization is about on-par but also leagues better than TEKKEN 7, hair and hats can be worn together now (mostly), there is a genuine color picker, a wider variety of clothing pieces, and Soulcalibur VI's ""accessory axis decider"" is there too. However we still haven't been able to manually select gloves since TEKKEN 6 (2009...)

The Story mode is awesome for what I've see so far, but the gameplay doesn't let you play it the way you want sometimes, it's like an interactive movie. And every single gamemode, I had to disable Special Style. In Arcade Quest, I'm still disabling it almost every battle.

This was my first Tekken game - I'd mostly come from a background of SF and more anime 2D fighters.

Candidly, I wish I hadn't bought Tekken 8.  I don't think it's a bad game - by all accounts if you liked the previous Tekken this one is absolutely supurb.  I just know it isn't a game I have any interest in getting to learn or getting good at.  I feel like it plays so differently from any other fighter I've played that I have to just learn so much nuance specifically for a single franchise that I also just... don't care about.  None of the characters clicked with me - visually or gameplay wise.

But what it does? It does fine.  Netcode is good.  Graphics are good. Controls are responsive.  Has a really good tutorial and solid training mode.  I just have massive buyer's remorse as I know this is now a $70 digital paperweight on my steam account.  That's on me - the Demo didn't win me over either but it also only had 4 characters and I thought for sure at least one character would speak to me.  But, they didn't.

Anyway, that's why I'm saying I don't recommend it - for players like me, I don't.  For fans of 3D fighters or previous Tekken games you'll probably have a blast.  I doubt I'll be touching it again - I should have gone with my gut.  A life lesson learned, I suppose.",1706919758,1706919758,False,3,1,0.415884345769882202,0,True,False,False

[u]STORY[/u]

Out of the current Fighting Game titles, Tekken went and did and make an epic story possible. It was well written leaving you wanting for more. To add, it respected the legacy of the game since Tekken 1 by doing callbacks through music, in-game sequences, and gameplay changes as you play through the story.

Story is a 11/10 for me. 

[u]Gameplay, Online, and Monetization[/u]

1. Gameplay - HEAT is the new system added. A new system to promote more aggressive play. It added things like chip damage and heat specific moves. It's sort of an install/power-up for all your characters when you enter this state. its quite fun imo. The game also has been simplified for beginners and a well implemented tutorial system.

2. Online/Netcode - Its a huge step up from Tekken 7. Very responsive and overall a great experience so far for me. However there's still some hiccups. If people do not have their PC optimized or running the game where their pc barely handles the game it could cause problems on your end as well. Overall though, if everything is running smoothly be it on the internet or hardware side, it's a smooth experience.

3. Monetization - There's no monetization practice except the seasonal characters, that's it. Everything can be obtained in game.

Overall, it's my favorite fighting game. If you're looking to get into Tekken, now would be the perfect time.",1706919395,1706919395,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The overall presentation is excellent- the visuals and music are a step up from the last game. The mechanics are largely unchanged from the prior game, except with the awkwardly named Heat system which (name aside) is a nice addition that rewards aggressive game play. Online functionality is pretty solid as is the starting roster of mostly returning fighters. There are a few that I wish would return (Lidia, Katarina, Bob) along with a few surprising omissions (Anna, Armor King, Marduk) but I suppose Bamco has DLC to sell. Even Eddy was not safe. 

The single player modes are a blast, the stand out being ""Arcade Quest"" which is a ""power of friendship"" type story that helps introduces players to the mechanics of Tekken. This reminds me of a pared down version of Street Fighter 6's World Tour mode, but that is not a bad thing. ""The Dark Awakens"" is the other single player story mode and a cinematic narrative that goes into the next chapter of the Mishima melodrama. While I am not overly attached to the soap opera-esque narrative, I can say this is a definitive step up from the story mode in Tekken 7 narrated by the world's most boring journalist. While the visuals are stunning, I did find myself getting bored with the match ups towards the end as several of the fights even in the same chapter are between the same two characters who spout off a few lines of dialogue and repeat the same match up. I do hope you also like playing as Jin Kazama (thankfully, I do) since he will be your only choice for the majority of the campaign mode with a few chances to play as Lars and other randos. There is a tournament midway through the campaign that gives you the choice of who you wish to play as and I wish that was explored more. Regardless, the campaign spotlight is on Jin who does get some satisfying character growth especially towards the end of the fifteen chapter story. No one gets dropped into a volcano here. So far. 

I have enjoyed my time so far with Tekken 8 and anticipate it will fully replace Tekken 7 among my friend group. If you are new to the series, this is a fine place to jump in and get ready for the next battle.",1706913171,1706913171,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I`ve been a Tekken fan since 1995 and the game has had it`s ups and downs along the way, but Tekken 8 is nothing short of a masterpiece. 

For those struggling to start:
- Choose a character to your liking.
- Remember your character's fastest strikes - to intercept enemies' attacks and to start your own.
- Remember attacks and combos, that hit low (legs) - for the same reason as above.
- Remember attacks with hyper armor - they are super useful to break an aggressive pressing.

Every instrument in the list is useful. You just need to find its use.

That said the single player for this game being only story and arcade quest feels short in comparison leaving with nothing to do pretty fast so if you really wanted to feel like there is a lot of things to do to unlock stuff, this game might feel too short.  Beat all the possible ghost npcs even the ones in the final fight/ super ghost battle computer search.  

Online is great, crashes were really bad at launch but seems fine now.  

Still wish it could do something to make fights happen faster.  It's annoying waiting for other players watching their own cutscenes before readying up or being stuck for the whole timer duration just because we ready up before the other player cancels and leaves.  

for some reason game struggles to find steam friends ingame.  need to invite using steam overlay tho do not put the game in borderless because it softlocks the steam overlay in my experience which was a frustrating time


the tekken fight lounge felt like a rushed attempt to copy sf6's fight hub but I wish there could of been more done to encourage player interaction in the hub as there seems to not be a way to challenge players you see at the moment.  You would have to see them sitting on one of the specific booths (for some reason place is made mostly with single player booths) that have a booth on the other side of it but even that because we have to sit in a single player character selection menu we can't tell if the player is even still there while we have to wait on a bunch of loading screens for what feels like an eternity before the game decides to search for the player on the other booth.


still think sf6 did alot more things right making the player experience feel smooth and quick to the point.  Fight more, stare at loading screens/menus/cutscenes less. i'm not sold on the ghost battle thing as it feels the npcs can just get cheesed out with plus frames.  The replay showing tips is cool tho.  even tho this review seems like i'm complaining alot, still fun game as the battles feel good being the most important part.",1706234607,1706898811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only one major issue so far. They need a good system against cheaters and ping droppers. Seven fights online. Four started with a good connection which dropped to one bar and went to well over 2000 ping. which signifies a lag switch. Who does that anymore?.. Two of them used a rage art twice at the start and kept a permanent metre going without it vanishing and one I smashed and he was like thirty levels higher than me. which only means they used underhanded macros to win a lot and this time he messed up.

The game’s story concluded the Mishima Family saga very well and very well thought-out as well, and honestly, my only problem with the story is that it’s severely too fast-paced for my liking. I get it, a story mode isn’t really the focus of a fighting game, but hey, this game is concluding a 30-year story. Though, at the very least, TEKKEN 8’s story mode is better than most fighting games’ story, story delivery, and execution, and was a huge improvement to TEKKEN 7’s story mode… one with a very boring 3rd-person journalist who isn’t even relevant to the story.

I’d also like to say that the developers and the TEKKEN TEAM did an awesome job is hiding intricate details, along with musical callbacks throughout the franchise, which will cause surprises when you’ve actually played the story. Even I was not prepared when I saw the changes from the trailer to the final game and it gave off a totally different vibe. It was a beautiful experience. Directors of modern media should follow this, and not show almost everything in a trailer that you don’t even have to watch a film to know what happens.

The Heat System changes a lot of animation and frames of a lot of useful moves and tools of characters which allows them to just trap opponents in the block string—a condition where you are forced to just block your opponent’s attacks, consecutively. There’s also the Special Style which allows newer, or non-fighting game, players to enjoy the game with button mashing to assist the players in doing combos. 

In addition to this, I also like the fact that this is the most beginner-friendly game in the franchise, aside from having the Special Style. See, TEKKEN, in any of its iterations, heavily favors those who played the previous games since your fundamentals are: (1) relies on legacy experience, (2) highly different from any other games. I say this because they included another single-player mode in the game; Arcade Quest.

This mode has a story of its own, but is YOUR story. Throughout the story, you are taught the basics of the game up to the more advanced techniques and mechanics available in TEKKEN 8. It definitely is a welcomed addition to the game. Although, I’d say ArcSystemWorks does a better job at this, making it brief and concise, in comparison to the Arcade Quest which may take up a few hours which may lead to a newer player bored… but it really does its job in holding your hand and making sure you learn properly before you can proceed.. so, pros and cons, I guess.

There is also the return of TEKKEN BALL which is a fan favorite from TEKKEN 3 and the game’s character customization. I have to say, TEKKEN 8 character customization leaves me a bit dissatisfied as the available wardrobe and options are quite limited in comparison to previous games. Despite that, though, people took the saying “limitation only breeds creativity” to heart as people were still able to make stunning customizations but really it wouldn't hurt to have more options. Furthermore, there are also the character episodes where we’re presented with different what-if scenarios, though some are canon.

For a modern game to include multiple modes that you may enjoy offline or solo, it is quite a surprise, considering most modern fighting games only include 2 offline modes, story and versus, and online versus for the most part. I mean, we’ve received more in the earlier days of video gaming but hey, I’ll take what I can and it’s already more than most nowadays. I can’t say it’s cheap though since it’s quite expensive. 


TEKKEN 8 launched with $69.99, $99.99, and $109.99 price tags for Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate editions and for a general consumer, that’s a little bit too much—but if you’re a fan, like I am, does the price really matter that much? It’s worth it, just for the story’s conclusion alone. On the flip side, like Capcom, Bandai Namco are very generous with sales and I’m sure we’ll be able to see the game on sale in a few months.

Overall, as a fan, the game is definitely a must-get. For those wanting to get into TEKKEN, this is the game to start with. There’s also the History section in the gallery if you want to be caught up to speed with the story before you start TEKKEN 8’s. There’s so much to unload with this game, from the story to its gameplay, and I’m enjoying and savoring every moment. 

	If I have any problems with the game, it’s that it could be optimized better for PC.

Anyway, not sure if anyone would agree, the graphics are really good for this and not sure if implementing this would be harder but would really like to have them add the following on Future patches: 

-Customization on hairs like in Tekken 6. 
- More Costumes ( probably given )

Possible Guest Characters:

- Tifa / FF characters ( Please Harada san lol } 
- 2B ( probably 1% possiblity but hey! )
- Kiryu ( We'll he kinda fits right? )
- Baki ( Since Feng pretty much look like Retsu )
- Bayonetta ( Well, customization on Zafina is good enough I guess )

Story: The story is incredible with pre-rendered cutscenes in a cinematic format with an interesting twist on the gameplay; i.e, you don't play as one character for 5 rounds of combat and then switch to the next. The story follows a protagonist for the most part and fights are broken up by quick time events and other interesting breaks mid game that make it feel fresh for most of its run time. The final chapter of the story is one of the best finale fights/boss fights ever, it is as close to perfect as I could have asked for as a tekken fan.  If you're new to tekken, there are story-line recaps available before you start the main story, it will ask you before you start if you want to watch them if you're unfamiliar with the series and its lore.

Second story-mode/Tutorial mode: The Arcade Quest serves as a tutorial, disguised as a mini story adventure where you create your own tekken avatar, (that will be used for online play in the fight lounge/ battle hub) and venture through arcade to arcade on a personal quest to improve at the game, meet new people, compete in local tournaments, and face off against your rival. It's a tutorial with phenomenal pacing, (it doesn't front-load its information, more so drip feeds you) disguised as a cute little adventure mode, that honestly, all fighting games should seek to emulate in the future.

Online play: The online play is the best it has ever been in the Tekken franchise. Ranked mode, Player matches, hosted lobbies, the fight lounge, group battles, etc. Its netcode has a blend of rollback and delaybased netcode with rollback doing almost all of the heavy lifting. There is no wifi filter, so spotty connections are bound to be spotty if you accept every match you're queued into. For a 3D fighting game, this is the premiere online experience and almost all of the time, feels like you are playing an offline match.

Arcade Mode: The classic arcade mode is present and is exactly what you would expect. There are some niche interactions with specific characters from what I've played, but if you've ever played an arcade mode in a fighting game, you know exactly what to expect from this. 

Character Episodes: Character epiosdes are back, this time feature 4-5 fights before achieving your character ending, all pre-rendered cg cutscenes with heartfelt and goofy moments alike. Yoshimitsu and Kazuya character endings stand out to me, alas I have not completed them all yet. You're pitted against lore relevant friends and rivals before fighting your biggest rival in the final fight. It's back and it's great.

Tekken Ball: Tekken ball returns in its best rendition in Tekken 8. This mode is incredibly fun, more fun than it has any right being, with wacky interactions and customizable balls i.e, beach ball, iron ball, globe projection ball, and more. Can be played online via the beach area of the fight lounge.

Graphics: This is the best Tekken has ever looked and is arguable one of the best looking games on the market at the moment and is visually stunning from the fore to backgrounds. some stages are interact-able in more ways than expected, like being able to kick llamas off of a cliff, mid combo, on Ortiz Farm stage for example. The pre-rendered cutscenes are fantastic and the gameplay is remarkably comparable. 

Customization: Avatar, Character, and player customization are possibly at its peak for this franchise. Tekken fans can rejoice in knowing that their playercards, player profiles, etc are fully customizable, just as they were in Tekken 7. Character customization rivals that of Tekken 7 and may even be greater, being able to customize each characters Hair/hair-color, eyes, makeup, glasses, skin color, clothes, tops, pants, shoes, hats, accessories, etc. I've spent several hours creating famous anime characters in game, like Old man Joseph Joestar, David Martinez, Jotaro Kujo, Terry Bogard, Wolverine, Walter White, Lara Croft, etc. You'll see plenty of goofy stuff online as well.

Sound Design/Soundtrack: Tekken 8 sound design makes you feel how hard hitting devastating combos are and really pack a punch. The counter hit sound effect is clear and recognizable and follows suite with the incredible production this game has. The soundtrack is as great as any other modern tekken game and features the Jukebox customizable mode where not only are you given access to every song from every tekken game, ever, you are able to customize your own playlist and mix and match songs to fit with any menu screen or stage in the game. Truly amazing.

Practice Mode/Replay System: Tekken 8's practice mode is top notch and chalk-full of features rivaling any other current fighting game, allowing you to do combo challenges for all characters, run drills with specific setups by having your opponent training dummy shuffle a large mixture of moves you can choose for them to cycle through, and is a contender for premiere training mode amongst all competitive fighters.
        The Replay System is an improvement from Tekken 7's replay system, where when watching you can choose to have tips on every replay for either side(P1/P2) and receive paused notifications mid replay on moves you can duck, punishment options for blocked moves, sample combos on whiffed combos i.e, you launch your opponent but drop the combo/don't know a combo from said launcher, etc. AS WELL AS, it allows you to jump back midmatch(replay) and PLAY as either sides character at any point and can practice specific situations that are difficult to emulate in training mode. You can drill punishment options for an obscure character or a tricky frametrap an opponent put you in etc. Revolutionary stuff.

Super Ghost Battle: This mode uses A.I. to mimic your playstyle and learns from you alone. It is a computer opponent created whenever you play arcade quest with a specific character, and you can train your Ghost to become better and better as it learns movement, punishment, combos, and neutral from the player. It can be reflective of a players skill and will in long term overwrite what it first learned from you as you first learned the game and emulate your playstyle over time. Players can create a ghost for each character in the game and can battle other peoples ghosts, whether its off of a profile from a ranked match you played with a random, off of your friends list, from high ranked players off of the leaderboards, and even the Tekken 8 developers themselves. That's right, you can fight Harada himself.

Conclusion: Tekken 8 is THE Premiere fighting game and is possibly the greatest entry in its long running franchise. Long live the Zaibatsu and play some good-ass tekken!

Too bad Street Fighter 6 could have said the same thing if it wasn't for that disaster of a launch for SFV which led me to check out Tekken and at this point, I think there's no looking back as I am now a Tekken guy after being a SF guy since the SNES days.

Street Fighter 6 had a solid launch and comeback at the $60 price tag instead of the $70 price tag.  I was wondering if Namco was up to the task to at least be on par with SF6 when it came to the single player modes and T8 has more of that than I expected.  You have the Metro City setting in SF6 and then T8 has the main story, individual stories (like in T7), Arcade Quest, and Tekken Ball.  Tekken Ball is an okay inclusion and it could be argued that bringing back Tekken Bowl would have been a better choice but you can always go back to T7 for that.

There were issues with online play on launch day so I simply played the single player modes until before this review.  I loved the fact that you could fight someone up to a best of three sessions and while I was matched up against someone making their first online appearance, it was just fun and competitive to the very end which is what you want unless you are that Orochi in the Arcade Quest

I really enjoyed T7 and I can say that T8 is an improvement over T7 so I can recommend this game without an ounce of hesitation.",1706840667,1706840667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I looked up previous games stories and this game is a massive love letter to previous games and the fans very much like the stories of Devil May Cry 5, FF7 remake, Re 4 remake etc. 
There is much to do in this game, you can review matches and the game will tell you what you did wrong and where you could have punished and how, you can download not only your own ghost but even opponent's ghosts as AI and fight against them continuously as a way to learn. This might be hands down the best training mode i've ever seen of any fighting game.
I find that the visuals in this game are stunning. backgrounds/stages, the customization aspect is fun, I don't care much for it but it's a nice touch to let everyone have their own ""unique"" version of a character, albeit it's used a lot to meme which in itself as also fun lmao. 
The arcade quest thingy is also a nice addition for new players such as myself to learn. 
While Tekken feels a bit overwhelming to learn how to play given how different it is from other fighting games I have played (MK games, SF, DBFZ) and the extensive move lists, im having a blast learning and I can't wait to play more ranked.

Customization is great, the grind directly to which item you want for which characters simplify it compared to RNG in TK7

The ghost A.I + online is perfect combination of fighting against your self + your friends ghosts
as for the online man finally i can play with my friends through cross-play, really love the fact they added practice mode + rank match-up to lab without being limited to labbing only, great feature

The story has some flaws but overall it's a good cinematic experience
Customization is a little bit lacking but I'm sure they will add more costume pieces in upcoming updates.
The flashbacks and usage of prior games music made my grown ass cry like a baby .. it was a love letter to TEKKEN fans.
Gameplay and Combos feel very smooth, Graphics are decent but they downgraded it since the reveal trailer (I can see why they did it)

I can say confidently that it covers all of the bases that someone would want in a next gen fighter (minus 120fps). Incredible graphics, exciting competitive game play and a fairly decent campaign. 

With that being said - if you are planning to pick up Tekken for the first time and enjoy matchmaking/online play, you are sadly mistaken... This game is riddled with sweaty neck-beards that have thousands of hours sunk into the franchise. You will spend more time watching your fighter bounce off the ground combo-locked than actually playing.

Purchase this game knowing that you will have to practice and memorize move sets/combos, watch youtube videos and study the living sh*t out of other characters tendencies. Most people will ultimately quit over sheer frustration. Others will enjoy the challenge and practice to get better.

Here is my actual review: 

I've been a long-time Tekken fan since my dad introduced the game to me on PS1 when I was 3. Since then I've never missed a single game in the series, and enjoyed every one (yes even 4) even though they may have their faults. 

I can honestly say that Tekken 8 might be the most fun game in the entire franchise. The character's move-sets seem more simple at first, but the game has completely expanded due to the heat system. The game is much more offensive focused, flashy, and faster paced than previous installments. There is much to learn about the game, and I continue to be excited to progress.

There is so much single player content to keep you engaged without even stepping foot in an online lobby, an extensive practice mode with combo trials and frame data (that you don't have to pay for), a jukebox to allow for soundtrack customization which every fighting game should contain moving forward, a replay system that actually helps you learn from mistakes during a match, and new fighters to the series that are so damn fun that I can't stop playing them (Victor supremacy btw).

It seemed like Tekken might have taken a page out of MK's and SF6's books and added a genuinely fun way to pass time when you don't really feel like playing other players.

Arcade Quest is a glorified 4ish hour tutorial.

I _expected_ a few extra tournaments after the tutorial part was over. And sure, I could just play arcade mode - but then I could also just play Tekken 7. I want to take my character from Arcade Quest into post-game tournaments that actually challenge me. There was talk about building up a following of fans and then going into tournaments with people cheering you on - and I don't see _any_ of that. Just scripted interactions with people who've been following you.

The rest of the game is what you'd expect from a Tekken game. It's solid. It's _fine_. But it's also a $70 price tag on something that really isn't much different from Tekken 7.",1706812734,1706812734,False,1,2,0.391199111938476563,0,True,False,False

Heads or tails for who gets a launcher first, because when you get launched, most characters have a very close to 100 to 0 combo with the new heat system. If you're lucky enough not to die from the first combo, then congrats! you get to meet the wall, with wall combos even stronger in this game, you're certain to die, and that's only with a regular wall, where we've got plenty of other flavours of wall to kill you even quicker. With improved mobility in all characters, any wall or barrier break now rewards you with a full combo, often over to the next wall. And now we move on to bomb walls, which explode on wall smash dealing lots of damage, and rewarding you with another free full combo to the other wall. 
Other fun new inclusions are a million particles all over the screen which cloud your view, removing any hope of sight reading your opponent, and a fucked input system because the only thing better than being stuck blocking for 5 minutes while the enemy deals chip damage to you through an un-punishable combo, is the game randomly dropping you back input, along with most other inputs because why tf not.

Game design is over, enjoy 0 skill floor, and 0.1 skill ceiling via slamming your forehead into your controller to for a 200 damage combo

Positive :
- They took time to fix issues that ruined the previous franchise and fixed a lot of them (like not being able to go back to the main menu once u go in ranked match mode) etc..
- The new ”My Replays” system is bomb. Long story short u can ”go back in time” and take control over ur character in a replay to learn how to punish the enemy. A good way to learn and adapt.
- Game has really beautiful maps and soundtracks overall. some better than others.
- Air combos seem easier than T7 cause u got more time to react (at least in my opinion).
- Jukebox mode is finally a thing.
- Shoutout to all 3D/ VFX artists, animators, graphic designers (etc.) that worked on the game. it came out flawless.



Negative : 
- No Tekken Tournament mode. I find it funny that they included a fake Tournament Mode Offline in Arcade Mode but not an actual real Tournament Mode like in Tekken 7. Very dissapointed with that...
- No direct ”Tekken Ball” mode Online, only if u go into the Lounge, then go into the Beach Area. 
- Very Unbalanced (King, Dragunov, Jack-8, Reina, Paul & Victor (to name a few) deal too much damage for no reason. Like more than half ur hp is gone and they are full hp themselves type of damage.)
- Hitbox sucks.
- Need more outfit variety in both character and player costumization. they reused the same stuff from tekken 7 too much...so much so that they didnt include actual legacy outfits, like tekken 5/6 outfits. buwomp.
- Game is a bit pricey for what u actually get.",1706492671,1706798913,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

New Heat system can take some getting used to, but provides a new dynamic to the game that makes it more explosive than previous Tekken games and increases the skill ceiling for those looking to get sweaty. 

Story mode is also great. Very corny at times, but a love letter to long time fans and with enough intense cinematics to keep you engaged for its 2.5 hour duration (may be longer if you die a lot lol). Those who have played older Tekken games will be happy to see that Character Episodes have the same wild endings that you would expect from the franchise. Arcade Quest mode is a fun way to learn mechanics of the game systematically as you progress through offline ranks.

The customisation - while a wee bit limited - allows for creative outfits and cosplays to let your personality shine through your character. The updated graphics really make the characters and environments look stunning - truly a next-gen fighting game. The return of Tekken Ball is also very welcome. Overall, the offline content will keep you entertained for hours, 9/10 from a long-time fan (would be 10/10 if we had old school team battle).

The new online Fight Lounge seemed a bit weird at first (cartoony avatars in a Tekken game?), but having that experience of seeing other players in an arcade setting is lovely. Tired of ranked matches? Go hang out by the group match arcades and practice some combos - anyone can join at any time to have a few matches. Maybe you're tired after some hectic games, so you can wind down with some Tekken Ball at the Beach Area.

However, the netcode seems to be a bit weird currently. I've had 5 bar matches with certain friends in Tekken 7, but in Tekken 8 we're lucky to match in the first place, and it's usually 1 bar and basically unplayable. This may be fixed in the future but should be kept in mind. Overall, my personal experience with matching is great, especially with the addition of Cross-Play. 90% of my games have been smooth, while the other 10% were still playable, but very janky (for reference I have a wired fibre connection). Another issue, albeit rare, is that I would match with someone, the first game is fine, and then upon a rematch, we would disconnect after the first round.

Online experience - 8.5/10 - would be higher if the netcode is optimised a bit more.

As someone who's played Tekken since Tag 1, I would say this is a worthwhile purchase.

P.S. PC players, PLEASE lower your graphics settings if your system can't maintain 60 fps in actual matches. An online connection can be smooth, but will lag horrendously if one person's PC is struggling to run the game, and I know it's not my 6600 XT.",1706784648,1706784648,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tekken 8: Power Isn't Everything

Overall, this game feels a fresh breath of fighting games. The mechanics, gameplay, graphics, character customization, etc all seems to be balanced. Although few characters are OP but with each season I'm expecting Namco balancing the stuff. 

Story mode: The story mode gives the sense of Tekken 3 era. Well structured and the story was progressed in exciting manner. All the characters were wisely used in it as compare to previous Tekken titles where some characters were left alone.

Online Experience: Now comes the most important perspective of this game, the ONLINE EXPERIENCE. So far its good. I easily find players online. The rollback features seems to make gameplay smooth but the net code can be further improved. Its not bad neither perfect. I hardly faced DC issue till now but it can't be predicted for near future experience.

Since I've been playing Tekken since 1995 on the PS1.  Still, if you look at the amount of content, the 32 character roster, number of game modes with one of the best tutorials ""Arcade Quest"" that teaches you all of the mechanics of the game.  What more is there to love about this game.  

This version of the game has the lowest barrier of entry for newcomers and still maintains the technical side for us hardcore players who want to go in-depth with our favorite characters.  For $70 you truly get a complete game and then some. From character customization, amazing soundtrack and previous Tekken soundtracks, multiple game modes and a main campaign that could be it's own full feature movie, with additional character story campaign for all 32 characters with their own endings that really ties the knot.  Not many developers create games with this much content on day 1.  Typically, developers want to milk you $$$ with each iteration and update where you'll have to pay 100s of dollars to get the full game experience. 

I highly recommend you purchase Tekken 8.  Even if you get the standard version, you will truly enjoy it!  It is a gem.  This game is going to make a huge impression on a lot of kids childhoods.  It did in mines waaaay back in 95.  I've met some of my best friends playing Tekken.   It's really going to be hard for Bandai Namco to top this one.

I'm really diggin it. kudos for creating a grounded game that feels more in depth then the crazy movements and effects happening in anime/tag fighters. 
  Such a complete package, the customization options inst DLC. Imagine having this much free cosmetics on release(cough cough* Mk1!) lots of single player content. The ghost battles are pretty fun. They aren't as hard as fighting the actual players but they do the same attack patterns and attack strings that you can download them. Really good replay system. Story was a nice treat, very cinematic. Prolly the best fighting game story in the genre. They also have music from every tekken game. Tekkens soundtrack is fire  
    People collectively agree tekken is one of the hardest fighting games to learn. I agree, but its mostly due to there being SO MANY moves that learning every single match up is gonna feel impossible. But you can learn a certain strat and go on a rampage online that most players wont have an answer. You can play a ignoramus play style and have success online unless you fight Pros/veteran players. So you are gonna feel discouraged learning the game the proper way. but just enjoy the process, the process is very engaging.

Has a large list of characters, feels really smooth, new systems that help players comeback / do cool combos, has options to make the game easier for people, practice modes, and lots of other things. The story is pretty meh overall and very ""anime""-like, which took me out of it a bit. Plus, in the story you're playing as Jin like 90% of the time instead of jumping around and learning about other characters and what they are doing. I think MK9 did it much better in terms of a playable fighting game story. Should have really focused on multiple characters and had more things than just the same few fights over and over (and the wonky fighting masses of 3D enemies).

Either way, this is a great continuation of the Tekken franchise. Just wish it had more practice tools, macro setup, a few more characters (saving them for DLC, I guess), and more game modes (Tekken Ball is fun but give us more). Still think Tekken Tag Tournament is better because of the 2v2 dynamic, but this is very solid. Oh, and I wish they brought back Paul Phoenix's ""Rapid Fire to Stone Breaker"" move... I miss it so much!

Tekken has always been a fun fighting game that anyone can jump into. I am TERRIBLE at fighting games, but the level select on here and the button menu you can pull up during the fights to remind you of what button does what, helps tremendously. The way Tekken handles it's story line is awesome as well. You don't need one character to fight the entire gambit of people in order to flesh out their story. Each one has their own unique story line that you can complete fairly quickly to understand what all is going on. Within an hour I had 3 characters done. 

Again though, the combat is more fluid than other fighting games I've played this year. I haven't played the Tekken Ball yet so I don't know anything about that, but fighting wise it's very fluid.

The story mode is fantastic. It's impressive how smoothly the game transitions from cutscenes to gameplay.

The Character Episodes are great. They remind me of the classic Tekken style where you play through arcade mode to unlock a character's ending. Now, it only takes four stages. Each character's story is unique and worth exploring. Kazuya and Steve are must-plays.

Arcade Quest is enjoyable, offering a mix of story and arcade culture. It’s particularly good for beginners because it includes helpful tutorials.

The character customization isn't as good as in Tekken 7, but it's still pretty cool. You can do a lot with it. I hope they allow more mixing of different costume types soon.

I've had no problems with the online play. They've changed it to best-of-three matches, which is different from the endless matches in Tekken 7. This makes sense for ranked play and the matches load quickly.

The player ghost feature and the Replay and Tips option are great for learning and improving. If you lose to someone online, you can download their 'ghost' to practice against. The ghost system isn't perfect yet, but it's helpful. The Replay and Tips tool is essential for getting better. It analyzes your replays, shows you where you can improve, and lets you practice specific situations. It's already helped me counter certain moves better.

In summary, Tekken 8 is nearly perfect. Any small flaws are minor compared to its overall quality. The graphics are stunning, and the game runs smoothly. I love how the characters interact, and every new character is fun to play.

If you're a Tekken fan or enjoy beat 'em up games, this is a must-have. For newcomers, it's a great introduction to the genre or the Tekken series.

And although more accessible and appealing to newcomers than ever, it's not any less complex and sophisticated than previous titles. It's a wonderful game for series veterans and complete beginners alike.  

[b]What I love the most:[/b]

- The increased viability of sidestepping
- The improved practice mode. Getting better at Tekken (i.e. 'labbing') has never been more fun.  
- Crossplay
- The arcade lounge  
- T8's newcomers are much more interesting than the ones we got in T7. 

[b]What I think Tekken 8 could improve upon/is currently still missing:[/b] 

- Modes like team battle and survival battle

- Customisation (although I'm fairly certain it's been confirmed that they will add way more options as DLC). On a loosely related note: the men are too muscular, too similarly built, and their asses are way too flat. It just doesn't look right, bc they're all freakishly muscular above the waist. King and Feng are the only two male characters in the game who look like they know what a squat is. The rest has 0 cake and just looks awkward as hell. As for the women: none of them are built like fighters. Where are their muscles? You can't have the physique of a Victoria's Secret model AND throw grown men around. Give the ladies some muscle definition. 

- Less serious stages, like the ones in Tag Tournament. The stages we currently have are a little too serious for my taste. Give me the airport, mall and beach from Tekken 4, or a library, an aqaurium, a casino and Mt Fuji, to name a few examples. 

- Most of the music is just awful. I don't know what happened to Tekken 5's composers, but after Tekken 6, the quality of Tekken's music dramatically dropped (Tag Tournament 2's soundtrack is downright offensive, while 7's is just OK. Of course the Jukebox fixes this problem, but it's still unfortunate that those of us who actually know and care about music, are essentially forced to change the tracks specifically made for this installment, to ones from past games. 

- No Miguel (yet) 

- Ghosts are just really bad. Perhaps not surprising to most other people, but I was really convinced this new AI technology was going to change Tekken forever. Ghosts seem to be quite good at replicating a player's offense, but none of the ghosts I've fought (including those of pro players), had any defensive capability to speak of. The AI clearly isn't advanced enough to actually take into account things like timing, spacing and the opponent's tendencies, so ultimately, playing against a ghost just feels like playing against a much weaker normal CPU. 

[i]For now, I give the game a solid 7,5/10. It has the potential to become a masterpiece, but it'll have to be improved upon in several ways first. Still, there isn't a better fighting game on the market right now, so if you're even a little interested in the genre and somehow don't own T8 yet, you really should go ahead and buy the game imo.[/i]",1706735594,1706735594,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend this game to arguably anyone. I think you'll enjoy it regardless of who you are because it's just fun as hell, I don't know how to word it, but it's like fun factor was put first and they somehow were able to give us one of the best fighting games we've had in a while.

The bad- When playing with friends you cant train or do anything besides spectate the match, when you are in a full lobby with friends and you have to sit and watch all the matches to fineally get up to it being your turn to get bodied and then back to sitting, it would be great if you could just practice until your turn or something inbetween.

The Good- I have been able to pick this game up and understand it faster than any other fighter, the combos are simple enough i can atleast do some of them, beautiful graphics literally stunning, runs great, lots of fun charcters to play, being able to customize your own charcter is amazing! the story modes are both really enjoyable.

- Easy access to 50/50 mixups across the board, thanks to the new heat system.
- Massive chip damage on + moves.
- Increased range, clean hit range, and tracking on unseeable low sweeps.
- Throws are unbreakable under certain conditions, on some characters, and counter hit throws are a thing now, They have significantly reduced throw tech windows. If you run into situations where you could've sworn you'd teched the throw, this is why.

All in all, I don't like the gameplay direction Tekken is going. The new mechanics still feel overtuned, even though they were massively nerfed since the beta, and should be addressed in upcoming balance patches.

I have played street fighter and mortal kombat but I believe that Tekken is victorious over both of them. You have so much freedom with character customization and a bunch of characters to play on launch. And there will be more with dlc's coming out every few months. 

A concern that you may have is that you'll suck at this game. I think that I suck at this game but I suck a lot less than I did before I started. Since each button is binded to a limb you can think of combos that make sense without having to necessarily study all the 100 combos each character has. Also the the 3D arenas with interactive elements gives the game so much more life compared to MK and SF. 
The game has quite a few modes. It has a story mode where you play through the Tekken 8 storyline, a mini story mode for each character to go more in depth with their storyline/backstory, A career-type mode where you play as yourself playing through the competitive tekken world. Online battles, offline battles, and tekken ball. It's pretty rad.

Ultimately if any of this sounds interesting, I would suggest either playing the demo or buying the game and seeing if you like it for 2 hours then refunding it if you decide against it.

Even at a low rank, you constantly come across some geniuses and nerds who simply do not let you out of combo attacks and win without even allowing you to gain control of the character. The game simply lacks balance. If you just want to try out each character and learn how to play them, I'm afraid I'll disappoint you, it's impossible. Most of the games you will be up against an imbalance character whose movements are simply faster and stronger than yours and you will not have a single chance of winning.
In addition, the game looks too chaotic and aggressive, where your block or battle strategy does not matter when everything around you glows and sparkles, causing headaches. 
- Character customization is terrible. Almost all of them have the same items. There is no variety or specific things that can make each of the characters unique. The worst thing about this is that they are mediocre. The person who made the customization simply has no taste or aesthetics. 
- I don’t understand why critics compared it to Tekken 3. From this masterpiece from childhood, there are only a few characters and a game mode on the beach with a ball. it's just a poor imitation of Tekken 3. 

In this condition I wouldn't recommend the game at full price. Buy it with 50% discount and you will love it. May be.

Anyways, this game is pretty much like Tekken 7, but with a new system thrown in to make fights a lot more aggressive. I want to point out that everything looks amazing - from the fighters themselves, to the actual stages. I know it's supposed to be a fighting game, but some of the details are almost stealing the show. Also the soundtracks from some of the stages are INSANELY good!

I heard (and saw) people getting crashes and having issues connecting to online matches, but I haven't encountered either of those so far. Might have been just during launch, considering I got the game a few days after.

All in all, I'd say it's worth buying if you like fighting games, and especially if you're coming from Tekken 7. Even if you are new to the genre, they added a neat little mode that simplifies your inputs a lot, which I think will be a lot of fun for people who are still learning.

Pros
* Arcade quest is the best fighting game tutorial I've seen.
* Online works great. No weird lobby system or other annoying stuff. Just queue up and play.
* The moves list highlights main moves for the characters making it much easier to learn a new character without having to look up guides.
* Heat mechanic is great
* Simplified some things without ""dumbing it down"" too much

Cons
* What the fuck did they do to Pauls hair?
* Pretty expensive
* Poorly optimized, requires a pretty beefy PC to run on higher settings",1706684569,1706684569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Customization is awful. It's just lacking. Barely any effort was put into this and for 70$ this is just flat worse than Tekken 7 and definitely worse than Tekken 6 was.(10+ years ago!).

- Technical problems. This game has issues reading controller inputs, the screen flips on customization, the audio lags.... it's a mess.

-Story: It's lame, what happened? Tekken 7 had some hype moments, this one has...sorta hype, mostly bland moments.

Check your reaction speed as well. The game only tests fluid intelligence, no other factors. Someone with an intellectual quotient of 110 could even be a Physics PHD and solve high level math equations, but they will never be good at Tekken, as Tekken tests Fluid Intelligence. That is not to say Tekken is a very intellectual or intelligent game; the complete opposite: it's too fast paced to develop strategies. Any strategies you employ will purely be done by your subconscious mental processes in the same way a Boxer does not think about what he's doing in the ring. The irony is that Tekken is simultaneously a brain-dead game, yet one that only checks for fluid intelligence. Maybe because it is only an IQ test it makes sense that no kind of knowledge or experience in the game can help you improve. I wish this post was ironic or coming from a point of view of ignorance, but I have thought about this a lot and I find this conclusion hard to refute. If you test low on the IQ test, save your money, or you will waste your time and nothing but frustration from your lack of progress will await you.

Jukebox got changed a bit to allow more freedom. Customization is still neat, and tekken ball is very fun. Arcade quest is okay -- it kind of feels like a rushed singleplayer mode in response to sf6's world tour. The lobby is neat. The netcode is sub par, but I've had plenty of perfect connections between ethernet pc to pc matches. Crossplay has a weird unique jitter to it in my experience. The game overall isn't very optimized it seems despite a lot of options to tweak -- I've experienced strange slowdowns in specific matches and it may be because of opponent PCs lagging. Netcode setting should also be on prioritize response by default. I also have issues with my controller when tabbing out and tabbing back in.

The best stages I've seen in a FG, pretty graphics and vfx, a 32 char launch, and different customization/expression options make this a great pick for me. Tough to get into, but it's pretty great.

The graphics are insane, the fighters have so much more expression and personality. The sound design is even better then Tekken 7. And in my opinion, that's saying something! Netcode has drastically been improved. Combine this with crossplay, and you'll have a match in a second. Even WiFi is decent (most of the time). Tekken 8 introduces some new mechanics, which I think is a good thing. I'm kinda sad about the rage drives being gone, but the new Heat system gives alot of flexibility every single round. 

Single player is sorta meh. They added a whole ""tutorial"" campaign in Arcade Quest, which I didn't much care for, but is great for new Tekken players. The story is not my cup of tea, but not bad. I love the characters, but the storyline feels like a bad fanfiction. The cutscenes are straight up banging tho. Oh, and the customization of the characters feels a bit lackluster. But to be fair, that is comparing Tekken 8 at launch with Tekken 7 after 5 seasons of content.

So yeah, I know I'm biased. I fell in love with Tekken with Tekken 7 (1000+ hours) and this just feels like the successor I wanted for that game. Easily the best FG of 2024 and with a bit of luck, the best Tekken in the series so far.

The King Of Iron Fist Tournament 8 has arrived and it truly is a fight against the tides of evil. A much needed step in the right direction, Tekken 8 gives you the best bang for your buck next gen Tekken experience. Leading up to the game's release I had genuinely set my standards pretty low with the amount of characters from the previous game I liked being cut out (and likely later slated for DLC) and all the talk about this 'arcade quest' mode (which upon playing I still didn't care for) but once I actually got the game and played it upon its launch day I can safely say it definitely blew my expectations out of the water. The fighting is much more improved over the previous game, whereas the rage art almost feels more like a crutch they seem to make the blocking much more effective than the previous title; whilst adding a sort of mini rage art called a heat burst in which you can use to chip off a sizable amount of damage. But that's not even talking about the amazing range of detail and snappy and genuinely realistic movement in the animation department. This game is absolutely stunning and boasts that every character ending has a fully animated, somewhat beautiful cutscene and it sure does. This genuinely looks like a huge step up compared to the previous installment, I can see Jin's pores now! This is a game I feel I can surely come back to in a few years and see that the cgi hasn't aged one bit. It genuinely flows really well in and out of gameplay that at moments I almost forget that I'm in a cutscene and get really amped up and start pressing buttons in anticipation for the next battle. I also think they've massively improved the story mode by making each chapter feel genuinely meaningful and have it flow well as a story. In the last game I kinda felt the game had this problem with overexplaining what was happening and also giving us these story mode battles that felt kinda unfocused to the main plot at hand and it was honestly kind of a hassle to get through at times while this one keeps you on the edge of your seat focused on this whole Devil Kazuya world domination plot. My only genuine gripe with the story mode is chapter 10 almost being similar to that of the Tekken Force mode from previous installments in which they try to make the characters have a wider range of movement fighting an onslaught of enemies, but still kinda falling in this idea that they want to keep your character on an axis, I don't know about you, but I think that controls really weird and disorienting, but I really liked in-story that while this is happening, all these small battles are also happening that you get to take control of which offers more traditional Tekken gameplay. And while I may not like the gameplay of chapter 10 nearly as much as the rest of the game, I can say those moments at least feel more meaningful than yet another onslaught of JACK-6s that just so happen to drop in. The story flows genuinely super well and keeps you hooked with all its fun character interactions and somewhat twists it throws your way. I also want to mention the lack of Heihachi. I think if he were in this story it simply wouldn't nearly be as effective as I was more excited for the feud between Kazuya & Jin, that being the main focus of the game. These characters finally get to duel at like full power and it's a much wanted to see fight as a Tekken fan. It really has the intensity and satisfaction you're looking for in a story like this one. Very much recommended for people trying to get into the series, Tekken fans, and fighting game enthusiasts in general. It has about everything you'd want in a Tekken game and comparatively to the other Tekkens on the market currently, I'd honestly say just get this one. It even seems from the first day's online issues they kind of patched it up because since then I've had no problem playing online with my friends, even if it means having to find them through the dreaded arcade quest mode for simplicity's sake. It also plays more fun than the past 3 installments and satisfies any and all story itches you'd be looking for in a new Tekken game (minus Mokujin) and I'm seriously looking forward to all the new things they have in store updates & DLC-wise.",1706334961,1706627001,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Story mode is fun but has a lot of growing pains that slapping special style on everything doesn't really fix.

Buying the game super early alongside Tekken diehards means Ranked is still getting figured out so you're going to be pit against people -way- out of your skill level. The AI you fight to get your power level gives nothing, I've had multiple friends tell me they got put in beginner and they are in Maurauder and higher in T7.

Once you finish the offline content, there's really not much to do as a new player for a while because online is just going to be out of skill range.

Edit -
After playing the game for almost 40 hours, as well as finishing the story mode.
I can't express how emotional this game made me. I can't put it in words besides expressing it with, it's damn perfect. It's some REAL good ass Tekken.

Story:
The Tekken story was never really known for the stories besides the occasional fathers throwing their sons out of cliffs or into volcanos, and even with quite a few plotholes to the lore, it depicts the story in an epic way with some good naration and BADASS cinematics and fights!
Made me feel like when watching Dragon Ball Z or Naruto as a kid and had me hyped through the whole thing.

Gameplay: 
I've tried a few fighters besides Tekken, like MK11, Street Fighter 5 & 6, KOF14 and some of the older KOF games, but man... No fighting game feels as good and epic as Tekken, this is my humble biased opinion, but DAMN! Only Tekken can scratch this itch, and with the implementation of the heat system, that kinda forces you to play much more aggresive than the predecessor games, it's gotten so much more fun! They also made quite a few moves easier for certain characters, which imo is welcome.

Gamemodes:
I've only done first chapter of the Arcade story to unlock super ghost battle, and I havent tried other gamemodes besides online rank matches or online sessions with several of my friends, so I can't speak for them all. However, it sure is fun to play vs your own ghost or other players ghost.

Online:
In Day 1, expectedly servers wasn't too stable cause of the inflation of players on the servers, however, now that there's less people on, it's really damn good! Connection is super solid for me when I play ranked matches, even vs console players or wifi players. Big step up from T7.

Final Score:
MAAN I'm a unapologetic biased Tekken fan, so easy 10/10, where as T7 was more like a 8/10. This game has everything I wanted. More juicier combos, smoother combat/gameplay, and juicy graphics. No need to wait for sale. (Actually if you don't make a lot of money, you might wanna wait a bit, I had the luxury to afford it this time around)",1706236072,1706595731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played Tekken 7 before and it was ok, not gripping at me wanting more but this one is so far the best in the series IMHO. Have been watching the reviews and videos beforehand and was already gripped in the fighting mechanics of this game with a fast paced rushed down fighting style. I have just played through Story Mode and could feel the potential in the creativity that is lacking in other Fighting Games. Also story mode is actually fun and the story was quite enjoyable. The fact that there are so many different ways in playing your character adds more fun in this fighter. 

Having played the Demo I nearly gave this game a skip. Was definately missing the full experience.

I was able to matchmake online, so look forward in more competitive matches at some stage
It actually benefits to be on the attack rather than on the Defensive.  With 32 playable fighters, will sure have plenty hours to Lab new fun characters.

Pros:

- The Story. It's leagues better than T7's trainwreck of a clickbait news article.
- Gameplay. 
- Character Episodes are WAY better than T7's by far.
- Tekken Ball makes a grand return
- Newcomers are fantastic (Victor's my personal favorite)
- The Roster is good as well for the most part
- I hate to admit it, but they slightly improved upon Shaheen. (Key word: Slightly. He still sucks personality-wise.)
- The visuals are outstanding as all hell.
- Avatar customization is something I never thought I would like in Tekken.
- Incredible OST (Rising Storm/Pave Your Way is my personal favorite)
- Jukebox being included on all platforms

Cons:

- The customization is still limited compared to T7's. But hey, we can take solace in the fact that there are new features in customization.

You are missing out on AAA GOTY T8 

Ya you can play T7 and have 50 some characters, or play some jank low budget theatrics; a divided developer's dream-dry divided & salty..

But You, are missing out on AAA GOTY! 

Here where it's a veritable blood sweat and tears, a umami of flavor, character, and design.. 
Beyond Tekken 5 and 7.. for some jank feels

Stay in the past.. 

If you cant build past your missing main..? 
Stay behind weakling...

and Tag 3

while you reminisce
about the good old days 


Get wet n00b 
Get Good Pro

And get out of your damn momma's womb the both of you.

Get hard~core 
Get Tekken 8

Buy and give these dev's a well earned hand of applause for this AAA insanity

Sure you can wait: 

Mortal Kombat 1 might get better? 
They might even give Tanya and Megan Fox their actual Model's faces back; instead of peeling on a sick [i]Politically forced mask slippery with the oil of money and greed[/i].. 

*In defense The MK1 devs are trying to fix things and apologize with free DLC in MK1, but the lack of finding 2 characters in MK1 is really a large problem for a tag game.. Like Tekken Tag 2, there needs to be something for everyone. Warnerborthers butchering faces and covering chests was a dumb way to cause a diverse roster. 
The moves of a roster should feel good to everyone in a fighting game, that's why Tekken 8 feels so damn good, and Streetfighter 6 feels so samey, and Strive feels so restricted.  


But you know deeply Mortal Kombat 1 is not Boons vision, its being outsourced to War-nerBrothers and pandering to the capitalist market. 

Look at the souls stripped away for a pretty backdrop, and clearly early buggy day one 2 player OOPS Health bar broken F- IT! LETS RELEASE! WHO CARES WHAT THE DEVS SAID. 

The same Early release that screams Jank far more Cringe than the ""Hilariously cringe Arcade mode"" in Tekken 8! 

The arcade mode Cringe crash course? 
It was so bad! 
it was like a spoiled dad joke sitting in the swamps being ignited by a desert sun billowing sawdust sweat and methane.. 

Just a constant crass ass joke that was so aware of how cringe it was.. 

It went from OK.. that is cringe
 to completely wow that's poetic-self aware cringe.. 
And yes even more to OMG thats 90's commercial Cringe.. 
It was wonderful the so cringe it was goosebumps and laughter bad.  

I had a blast and casuals will hate-love it, and I hope they do it again as a staple for the series, cause ya it was VERY Saturday Afternoon School special.. 

Now 
The story is where all the AAA sits 
It rolls balancing on a dash of Force Mode 
And the Jukebox hits hard and the rest bounces away with ONLINE Tekken Ball goosebumps 


As I said If you cant find the cash, then save up. 
You will want this Deluxe .. 

Don't go for the ultimate unless you lack creativity, or gotta Pal World them all..

You can always Donate with Season pass 2-4

It's clear so far the Tekken 'formula' is still there and going strong with the latest. And while this new heat system is a little different and will take some getting used-to, it seems to fit in nicely with everything so far, and I can tell I will be regularly revisiting this game over its lifetime.

The graphics look great, but are making my card's age (radeon vega64) a factor.  I can maintain a steady 60FPS @ 1440p with reduced rendering scale and all other settings on max, so I'd still say it looks beautiful and runs well on this card.  It may still drive an upgrade for me, though.

I played Tekken 2, 3, tag and 4, back in the late PS1, early PS2 days, when it was a great party/roommate game for me and my friends at that stage in our lives.  Then, after shifting to PC, and getting away from fighting games altogether, I was pleasantly surprised when trying 7 on a whim late in its life and finding out the fundamentals are still there and solid as ever, and the online matchmaking, despite its flaws, was good enough to feel like dabbling in.  This has carried over into T8 from what I can see already, and am already as hooked to the online/ranked system there as I had gotten with the previous.

As an adult with a life and a job, who will not be pursuing any fame or prize money from video games, this particular style of online competitive play still feels good to me.  The matchmaking is fast and has gotten even faster in 8, and the matches themselves are also fast - you're playing many matches in a sitting, and the inevitable reality of the 50-50 win-loss rate (that every online player in every competitive game must learn to cope with) doesn't feel so bad with the quick turnaround.  This is more of a general fighting game vs other competitive game style point, but it feels like Tekken's devs understand this and have designed with it in mind, which I appreciate.

There is single player content in this game, too.  There is a lore behind the characters in the game, but it's ridiculous.  I think it's ridiculous for the sake of being ridiculous, but it's hard to say.  Either way, it looks beautiful, and it's fun, and the arcade quest and ghost battles are a good way to get into the casual beginnings of online ladder play, which is where the real fun with these games is to be found.

Tekken is my favorite fighting game, and if they stick with the formula they've got nailed down, it will stay that way for years to come.

It feels like Tekken, having a great time.  Getting my ass beat, but it's great.  

I would definitely recommend this game to any other older folks like me.  The tutorials in this game are very good and so is the training hall.  

The characters all still have their own styles and personalities, and the game leans hard into this.  The appearance customization is also pretty damn good.  

If you have an itch to pick a game and build some skill, I recommend this 100%.  I'm more of a survival RPG / isometric cRPG person, but even I'm having a blast here.  

Oh the Arcade Lobby is pretty cool.  Reminds me of walking around arcades when I was a stupid 90s teen.

Tekken 8 is held firmly by more of the deep, technical, and ultimately satisfying gameplay the series is known for, made even more exciting to both play and spectate with the new Heat System. All three newcomers are well designed and evoke nostalgia whilst bringing something to Tekken never seen before. The training and replay systems are extremely robust, promoting intuitive learning without tedium. The graphics are stunning, boasting high quality character models with a noticeable improvement in the stages themselves.

However, the game is marred by its mediocre single player. The story mode is a fun 4 hour romp, and leans heavily into shonen anime tropes, which can make it polarizing for players not already invested in the story. The character episodes are simply 5 AI fights to watch a 45 second ending, and can be tedious just to find out your favorite character gets a silly cutaway gag as an ending. Arcade Quest is a short tutorial mode that does its job decently, but fails to deliver how exciting high level gameplay can be or give a player a better reason to sit down and learn the fundamentals rather than to just go online and mash buttons. I will say that something is better than nothing over Tekken 7's absolute lack of a tutorial mode.

The online netcode is markedly better than Tekken 7, but the netcode still isn't up to snuff with near perfect implementations of its competitors, namely Guilty Gear Strive and Street Fighter 6. An unfortunate side effect of the high fidelity graphics is that if your opponent's PC struggles with performance, you also feel it as well to keep the game in sync. Many players online do not optimize their graphics settings leading to unplayable matches, exacerbated by poor wifi connections. The online play experience is passable, but I will applaud the vast improvement over Tekken 7. It's fine and playable but not perfect.

Despite this, Tekken 8 still has some of the most exciting gameplay in the gaming market today. It hits all the important points of a fighting game as hard as it can, while making decent attempts at welcoming and retaining new players with more single player options and improved netcode. All of this adds up to be a outstanding game I will be playing for many years to come.",1706561729,1706561729,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really awesome. I also like how different every player in online plays, just have to manage to find a way to beat them... spammy or whatever who cares, that's their playstyle, to me the game is well balanced. Now don't like much the story mode & customization (only because I believe they could be better, not that they suck) but everything else is absolutely great and an improvement. Oh yeah and the stages and soundtrack, those all are great, love playing in every stage. Though some stages music is a bit too calm for a fighting game, at least in my opinion but overall it's really good.

Also.. where is the photo mode for such a game? We have to wait for Nvidia Ansel support..?

Story feels too generic, even worse than some random anime ones, but then again as a fighting game and the entire story itself isn't that good, at least the visuals/character designs and all that is the best for me. Yes I expect good story telling, they should work on that. Fine if characters talk other languages but for a proper story they can have them speak English too as a different option (if hasn't already), although them all being together coincidentally makes absolutely no sense, same as riding bikes for whatever reason lol. Story mode should've been longer but there might be story expansions..whatever.

New players should just play offline or quick match until they learn the game, ranked is too difficult when first starting out. This arcade mode they added/ghost players is really good to learn the game, also new practice features/combo challenges, better controls overall. Gameplay-wise, from playing Tekken 7 this feels a lot better and smoother, so good job there.

Customization, similar to Tekken 7 with more options but not too much. Again I don't expect them to add more? I mean.. it's fine, but I believe it needs more hairstyle options/accessories/clothes.

9.5/10

Great graphics, awesome music/sound design, engaging gameplay with good tutorials in practice mode and arcade quest, diverse launch roster with 32 character and good variety in both offline and online contents. This game almost does everything great.

Really enjoying this game a lot more than I thought. I've been cracking out on it the last few days learning Jin and Drag and it's been super enjoyable. Story mode sucks, but you'll like it if you are 15 and/or still like anime for some reason. I'd like to see some tweaks to netcode. As of now, wired connections are mostly fine and crossplay seems pretty solid. I'd say 7/10 of my matches are good connections. Which, for an online 3D fighter, is really good. I'm sure they'll improve it over the game's lifespan and they have a good start this time around. Definitely worth the price IMO

Every aspect of this game was designed by people who love the franchise, and it absolutely shows. 

Fighting games can certainly feel like ""more of the same"" when the next iteration drops, but every part of T8 has changed (at least slightly) and after some time with the beta and now full game, I can confidently say it has changed for the better.

The loading is insanely fast, the graphics and flare are top quality, even the story this time around was a blast. However, the one defining set of features that make Tekken 8 the BEST fighting game out there are its practice tools. 

My god, to say they went above and beyond is [i]not[/i] doing it justice. The practice mode bot is super customizable, there's wiff punishing training, followup training, combo trainings for each character, ghost fighting, and oh my god it just keeps going! These features are doing massive work, helping newer (or even older and just not as good players like myself) learn how to play Tekken to its fullest potential.

The one specific training tool that needs a callout is Replays. You can watch your recent matches sure, but you can also PAUSE AND HAVE IT TELL YOU WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. And as if that wasn't the coolest thing yet, you can then TAKE CONTROL of EITHER CHARACTER and play out the next 10 seconds! I cannot stress enough just how cool and USEFUL this is when learning. 

So yes, absolutely recommend, even if you're not a Tekken fan. Even if you hate online there's a full campaign, full arcade campaign, 32 character battles, arcade mode, ghost fight mode, etc etc. I don't know what the future holds for Tekken 8, but I am excited and confident that it will be bright.

I felt like with Tekken 7 a lot of the aesthetic and identity was lost. 
Tekken 4, 5, 6 and TT2 had amazing identity, graphics and style that made Tekken what it was.
8 brings back its style, identity and flow that we've all been missing in T7.

The roster consists of 32 characters, each with their own unique fighting style, moves, and combos. It holds a rich story mode, a variety of online and offline modes, and stunning graphics and sound.

Story mode picks up where Tekken 7 left off, with the final showdown between Kazuya Mishima and his father Heihachi Mishima. We explore the origins of the Mishima family feud, the secrets of the Devil Gene and its orgins as well as the fate of Jin Kazama, who is missing after the events of Tekken 7. The story is presented in a cinematic style, with fully voiced cutscenes and dynamic battles. 

Gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and responsive, with a balance of offense and defense. There are new mechanics, such as the Heat mechanic, which allows the player to unleash powerful attacks as well as recovering health, chip damage and Power Crush, which allows the player to absorb some damage and continue their attack. The game also has a variety of stages, each with their own environmental hazards and transitions.

Online mode is robust and smooth, with a ranking system, a replay, and a spectator mode. We also have cross-play between different platforms, allowing players to challenge each other regardless of their device. Sounds are impressive and immersive, with realistic character models, detailed animations, and expressive facial expressions. There are diverse and dynamic soundtrack, featuring rock, techno, and orchestral music.  The voice cast is of talented actors, who deliver their lines with emotion and personality.


To sum this overall great package:
Positives:
+ Amazing gameplay
+ Phenomenal Design and graphics
+ Stages, characters and moves are perfect
+ Tekken Ball
+ Online Lounge and online modes in general are smooth except Day 1 Release
+ We can use all Tekken soundtracks in the game from T1 all the way to T7 and 8
+ The Story is awesome. Really well done.
+ Easy to get into. Arcade Quest and the tutorial really help out bringing the best in you. It's easy to practice, easy to learn and very hard to master.
+ The Ghosts AI is actually capable and useful. What a great design choice and implementation.

On the negative side:
- Not enough customisation options. T6 is still the GOAT in that regard
- No Tekken Force
- The sound of punches isn't as satisfying as T7 but it's good enough still

Tekken 8 is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, as it offers a satisfying and thrilling fighting game experience. The game has a lot of content and replay value, as well as a deep and engaging story. The game is a masterpiece of the genre, and a fitting conclusion to the saga of the Mishima family.",1706445436,1706541937,True,119,2,0.808512032032012939,0,True,False,False

You can train by watching replays, but not only that, you can actually take control of the character and practice a move, a punishment, or a combo to learn.
The arcade Quest, as simple as it seems, is actually really nice! It teaches the basics, and honestly, it is kinda chill to play through.

This game as most gaming channels call it is a game changer for the next generation of fighting games and for me...this game is the next generation of making people rage quit in a different way, call me cocky but this game is fun, it features:

- father and son beef
- character story what ifs (some are canon than the other)
- Limited costumes than previous games (maybe in future updates they'll add more)
- Plot twists
- ships
- crying after losing a ranked match with broken fingers after combo-ing so much for nothing
- Combo-ing to the point people report you that you're cheating and never utilize that you're just THAT GOOD
- restless hours of playing
- And for some reason this game is really satisfying to play at night no matter the country you're living on, it just feels so satisfying

The story mode is okay, but has so many tweaks to health values and lets you spam supers 3 times back to back, sometimes more. It's one of THOSE where the story mode itself plays nothing like the actual game.

The customization is....alright. You can recolor most costumes, but it has less customization than even Tekken 7, which was less than half than that of Tekken 6 already. It feels like customization is becoming less and less of a feature and more of a ""well people expect it so we HAVE to have it."" but there's little other than colors and a handful of really poorly modeled accessories.

The Alternate modes are...sparse. The ghost battles are very limited and the Ai is too easy. I was able to consistently beat the highest ranked ghost in the game easily, even with characters I've barely used in the past, and I'm not a great player by any means. The character stories are literally 5 matches fought in the same arena with an ending cutscene with no real story relevance.

So...why am I reccomending the game? Because the core gameplay is some GOOD ASS TEKKEN.

It's the legacy-skill-heavy, Beat-faces-in, get-mixed-for-days, turn-that-jin-into-a-win, Lili-more-like-shutup-frenchwoman-you-smelly-baguette Tekken you've known and loved, but more refined, and more aggressive.",1706528336,1706528336,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Main story shows love to fun side characters.[/b]  Story itself isn't really that interesting, but there's a lot of effort put in it to make it a fun display.

[b] There's another game mode called Character Episodes. Short CGI endings are back and they look great, however it still feels like a ""fun little side thing"".[/b]  It could have used more matches than five, could get a little harder at the end as it doesn't feel like a real game mode but something to do for casuals. I don't like that idea, I think even casuals would like to overcome some challenge, which would make them more likely to play online. Nevermind that, they could actually advance characters' storylines instead of repeating the same old feuds. So there's not much really new, would absolutely be more fun if you had no idea what Tekken is, I guess. But it's way better than Tekken 7 at the very least. 

[b] Arcade mode is a tiny bit better in the matter of gameplay[/b], eight battles that are a lot more challenging, but I don't really see why you would play it again after you've seen it once, especially when there's Super Ghost Battle.

[b] Super Ghost Battle is truly fun, you can download someone elses ghost you face online, you can basically download a bunch of good players and make an Endless Mode of your own.[/b] Of course they are still not the carbon copy of the player and act slower, but they use similar tactics and make similar mistakes, so it is a very useful tool to break down the opponent's patterns.

[b] I think the biggest achievement of Tekken 8 is that they've done everything they could to teach the game.[/b]  Streamlined a lot of characters' game plan, added Heat as a last resort for choking newcomers and turned it into an actual fun mechanic so it isn't a burden on experienced players, the practice mode is great, being able to watch replays is great, you can even take control during a replay to try a different approach, it's really amazing how much thought they put into it. [b]Arcade Quest, while it condescendingly babies the player with Mii characters, sets up well thought tutorial matches to show you the ropes.[/b] It still doesn't break down everything, but at least it is character specific and gives you a good idea of what to expect. It's nice if you're someone who never played a fighting game and want to avoid studying a video game. It gives you the basics however it still won't teach you everything about your character, or about actual bastard plays people make in Ranked.


[b]I'm very positive about the gameplay itself[/b], while I think the visuals are cluttered and Rage Art cutscenes are annoying because it forces you to watch a customized anime character do a bunch of generic bullshit whose shameful creator is surely jerking off during that whole minute, [b]I think this game allows a larger variety of gamestyles than Tekken 7.[/b] Turtling is not unbeatable anymore. You can sidestep, power crush, throw, and most importantly use explosive moves like King's or Paul's punches to stagger the enemy and put pressure on a blocking player or fish for openings. There's still a lot of times when it feels unfair, like when a character pulls up with something in a confusing mix-up, a trap for you to lower your guard to punish you for a simple jab, and spams that because it's the easy thing to do, but I do not think a fighting game can ever be truly balanced without being boring.

[b]Network connection is fine in general, but it doesn't deal with high ping extremely well. I wouldn't try to play this with a friend in a far country.[/b]",1706483758,1706525537,True,3,0,0.550898194313049316,0,True,False,False

He jugado varios mas no dedicarles tiempo para mejorar, en este parece ser mi prrimer tekken donde si le metere bastantes horas, mas que en el Tag Tournament 2. Si tienes dudas de si es buen juego o no te guias mucho de lo que dice la gente, debes probarlo, es una experiencia maravillosa, Soundtracks, Audio Increible en los Combates, Graficos espectaculares y mas con ese Unreal Engine 5.
Super bien Optimizado, muchas formas de remontar una partida, Rollback, bastante contenido con el juego base y sobre todo. Todo el Sountrack de los Tekken hasta la fecha que han salido. Literal puedes hacer que este juego se vea casi como tu quieras. Aun no me juego la Historia y demas modos como Tekken Ball pero ya con esto que tengo puedo decir que:

Overall Tekken 8 is amazing - the visuals are great,stages are great,combat is juicy,the story is decent,the new characters (Reina and Victor) are superb.
But there is 1 feature that left me in awe.The new ghost feature is the one thing i literally wanted from this game.I ve spent like 6 hours already fighting against ""myself"" and its probably the best time i ve had with figthing games.And not only its fun - i also feel like its very helpful if you want to improve because your ghost is getting better alongside you so you need to come up with new stuff to be able to beat it consistently.

Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series. 

Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.

I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes.

Introduces many systems designed to level-up player skills in an incredibly deep and complex game. If there ever is a perfect time to get into Tekken, this is it.

Personnaly, I played T2, T3, TTT1. Was pretty good at it... then T4 came out and it literally sucked out my passion for Tekken. Went back at T7 and almost immediately dropped the game due to its frustrating online + I never got used to the walls introduced in T4.

T8 is a whole different beast! I've clocked in pretty much 20 hours in two days and have barely scratched its surface. I rarely clock this amount of time, now that I'm older. Despite the game still having walls/floors and being crappy (<10% win rate online), I just keep going and going. I can feel that energy of wanting to be better. I've selected a couple of characters, but focusing on one to really get good at. With the tools/modes they provide, I'm sure I'll get there.",1706493979,1706493979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played Tekken 4 at friends'  house and always enjoyed the game but my child brain couldn't get the combos and tactics. Fast-forward some years and Tekken 7 was one of my most played games of all time. I love the competitiveness of the community, the effort it takes to truly master a character, and the bizarre storyline. Tekken 8 didn't knock it out of the park but I definitely am satisfied with my purchase. 

Pros:
Beautiful game with a hype ass soundtrack
Combat is intuitive and rewarding 
Each fighter is beaming with personality especially the new characters 
The practice system is great and it's nice not having to pay for frame data lol
Cons:
New heat system allows for people to steal turns with the press of a button. 
The Visual effects are OD sometimes. 
The combat is good but the fighters don't feel like they have weight to them. 

All in all it's a great game. If you want to get into fighting games, this is a great start.

Crashes on startup and attempting to load into a fight due to shader errors on graphics cards with high video memory.


Fixes online with compatibility patches and running as administrator have not worked for myself but may work for others.

Let me start by saying that I am a long-time, non-competitive SoulCalibur player.
I decided to give TEKKEN 8 a change after trying the demo. I'll tell you, on paper I appreciated the changes introduced compared to the predecessors and the excellent entry level in the single player mode, the Ghosts with AI...
For Singleplayer or to play with friends, nothing to say.

However...

For me it's a huge NO, to version 1.1.2, at least as regards multiplayer and character balance; which should then be the pinnacle of experience in games of this type nowadays.

On the one hand there is a Netcode that is too unstable and ruins the gaming experience, so the results of a match can be overturned too easily.

On the other hand there is a fairly obvious problem with the fighters.
I realize that, as in all fighting games, there are characters that are more optimal than others for one reason or another, and that many times developers can make mistakes in their creation (the times of Leroy Smith in TEKKEN 7 at the first release speak for themselves, or when they introduced Akuma without any rework)...BUT THIS TIME, it seems clear to me that the DEVs haven't really reasoned or, if they have, they have reasoned very badly because many of the characters in the rouster are :

-extremely simplified in the execution of their combos (Law is embarrassing for how quick and simple he is, to name one out of many);
- advantaged over others in their game mechanics (King and Azucena can make too much use of air combos, in a game where they should have been reduced to the bare bones and which promised to change the approach to gameplay);
- made unstoppable due to the animation frames which do not physically allow you to build an adequate defense or punishment, creating too many differences in the final game experience between one character and another.

Even putting effort into learning a character's kit well (without using assisted mode) is pointless, since you can play the most advantaged characters in that mode and make them even more awkward than they already are.
It doesn't matter if they do little damage, they enter an eternal loop of animations in which you can't find any opening and are unable to deliver a punishment.

I wonder what was the point of revolutionizing the game by removing pokes, air combos, giving such a substantial rooster and revolutionizing everything, if we then end up with this imbalance.

Truly a disappointment.
I'll only play it for Singleplayer, I'll be honest.

Premetto che sono un giocatore di vecchia data di SoulCalibur, non competitivo.
Ho deciso di dare una change a TEKKEN 8 dopo aver provato la demo. Vi dirò, sulla carta ho apprezzato i cambiamenti introdotti rispetto ai predecessori e l'ottimo entry level nella modalità Singleplayer; per giocarci con gli amici o da solo, nulla da dire insomma.

PERO'...no.

Per me è un gigantesco NO, alla versione 1.1.2, almeno per quanto concerne il Multiplayer e il bilanciamento dei personaggi; che poi dovrebbe essere il culmine dell'esperienza in giochi di questo tipo.

Da una parte c'è un Netcode troppo ballerino e che rovina l'esperienza, quindi i risultati di un match possono essere ribaltati troppo facilmente.

Dall'altra c'è un problema abbastanza palese con i combattenti.
Mi rendo conto che, come in tutti i picchiaduro, ci sono personaggi che sono più ottimali di altri per un motivo o per un'altro, e che tante volte gli sviluppatori possono compiere degli errori nella loro creazione (i tempi di Leroy Smith in TEKKEN 7 al primo rilascio parlano da soli, o quando introdussero Akuma senza alcun rework)...MA QUESTA VOLTA, mi sembra palese che i DEVs non hanno proprio ragionato o, se lo hanno fatto, hanno ragionato malissimo perché molti dei personaggi nel rouster sono:

- estremamente semplificati nell'esecuzione delle loro combo (Law è imbarazzante per quanto è rapido e semplice, per citarne uno su tanti);
- avvantaggiati rispetto ad altri nelle loro meccaniche di gioco (King e Azucena possono fare troppo uso delle air combo, in un gioco dove dovrebbero essere state ridotte all'osso e che si riprometteva di cambiare approccio al gameplay);
- resi inarrestabili per via dei frame delle animazioni che non consentono fisicamente di costruire una difesa o trovare aperture per un punishment adeguato, creando troppe differenze nell'esperienza di gioco finale tra un personaggio e l'altro.

Anche impegnarsi ad imparare bene il kit di un personaggio (senza usare la modalità assistita) è inutile, dato che i personaggi più avvantaggiati puoi giocarli con quella modalità e renderli ancora più imbarazzanti di quanto non siano già. 
Non importa se fanno poco danno, tanto entrano in un loop eterno di animazioni in cui non riesci a trovare alcuna apertura e sei impossibilitato da assestare un punishment.

Io mi chiedo a che cosa sia servito rivoluzionare il gioco rimuovendo i poke, le air combo, dare un rooster così sostanzioso e rivoluzionare tutto, se poi ci si ritrova con questo squilibrio.

After the announcement of the Tekken 8 launch date I decided to uninstall Tekken 7 to relax a bit and avoiding most videos on T8.

When the time came and I bought T8 and started the game, I was really amazed at the presentation and the wealth of options and game modes. (Tekken Ball! Juke Box!!!)

The icing on the cake though?

I dreamt for years of playing a good fighting game with my buddy who's living on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. And now the dream became reality!!!! The netcode is almost perfect!!! Only three stutters in over a dozen matches!!!

The graphics are amazing (everything is nice to look at from main menu to character select screen and the in game graphics of course). the gameplay is smooth, addicting, super fun and an upgrade in every single way compared to tekken 7. the OST's are amazing as usual. an actual complete game with no micro-transaction always a plus. in addition, I wish the roster is bigger even though its fine at its current state. lastly, what i like the most about the game is that each character feels strong and unique.

However, the only con i see here is the customization which is not unique to each character, having universal customization shared by all characters seems lazy. but its still good, there's lot to choose from, also free (unlocked by in game currency) and better than any fighting game in the market in my opinion.

Ghost AI of other players. That's the best feature of the game. Even if you are shy and intimidated by the game's hardcore reputation, you can play alone in Acrade Quest and button mash in offline for hours of fun before the difficulty goes up and you start thinking about looking up and practicing normal combos. Then you notice walls are a problem so you look up wall combos. Then counter-hit combos etc. I am no serious fighting game player, but the gradual transition towards higher-level play, all while offline, was so smooth. Winning against ghosts gave me confidence as well, and by the time I joined ranked online play, apart from connection spikes, I was already winning. I recommend the youtube video called ""Learning Any Character ~ Tekken 7"" from Zug to understand the fundamentals of the series. 10 frames for a jab, ~15 frames for a launch, that kind of thing always seemed too intimidating to learn, but they come naturally with a well-featured Practice mode that lets you try punishing enemy moves, and a helpful Replay mode where you can review your mistakes and retry mid-replay.

In Tekken 7 I played only Negan who was the only interesting character with personality.

Tekken 8 is a step up.
Now all characters have personalities.
They comment during fight and have interesting interactions.
Character models look impressive (finally they look like humans).
Now I am considering trying to play different characters.

New stages are fantastic with great music.
New slick look in menu and lounge.

New combat mechanic which is interesting (heat mode as I understood).

People say it has great solo content if you are not interested in multiplayer. (can't rate because I only play multiplayer).

The transition between cinematics and gameplay were incredible, and the game has some of the best graphics I've ever seen with amazing sound design. The music got me really worked up during key moments.

The story was epic from start to finish, with effective tropes from anime and comic-book movies that keep us coming back. It was a truly international ensemble, with every character speaking in their own language - and about everyone had their turn in the spotlight, while managing to not stray far from the father and son driving it all. 

Even as a relative newcomer, I found the story very accessible thanks to a recap cinematic mode and some lines from characters that summarized their past. But I was familiar enough with the series to appreciate some callbacks. Gameplay wise, I kept the newbie-friendly ""Special Style"" mode on most of the time which let me pull off flashy combos with ease.

The staff behind this game did an amazing job. I am so glad I made the decision to buy the ultimate edition because I see myself investing as many hours (if not more) into this as I did with Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
Worth the wait. Best Tekken game I have played in years.
