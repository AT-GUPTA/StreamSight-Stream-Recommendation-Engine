The weapons, gunfights, and special abilities are all unique to make Rogue Company a decent experience. After a while, however, things get repetitive all across the board since matchmaking is all over the place.

You’ll get either two different kinds of matches while playing Rogue Company. Either you’ll be playing against professional players or teamed up with brand new gamers that aren’t all that familiar with how to play the game at all. It’s fine to a degree since we all start somewhere, but I can’t tell you how many times I had terrible matchmaking to the point where it got frustrating where it was me with a few new players against maxed-out players that instantly kill you on sight.

Then within just a few minutes, many of my teammates leave, even when I’m doing pretty well. Combine that with AFKs, quitters, disconnects, and it’s just not fun being by yourself going up against full squads, likely a group of friends plowing through win after win. I chalk it up to being a free-to-play cross-play/cross-platform video game and even though the graphics look nice and the gameplay isn’t all that bad, it gets boring after a few hours in. There is no depth or substance after the first few hours where everything is new and exciting which then turns into a boring grind fest just to level up various things.

When I also played this at the time, the game glitched out and gave me all sorts of Steam Achievements without actually earning them. I was shocked when stuff like Play 25 hours in a party, Win 100 matches, and many others just instantly unlocked and I was nowhere near those stats. Maybe it was when it finally came onto Steam something was broken but yeah, I just wouldn’t invest any more time into this game. Especially since it now looks like not many people are even playing Rogue Company at all these days.

Overall, I give Rogue Company a 1/5 and would not recommend this to anyone. I also wouldn’t recommend putting any money or time into this since it feels like a dead game. Nobody really plays it, streams it, or even talks about it. Stay away!",1672258597,1672258597,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
Awesome skins and emotes
Excellent gameplay
Skills & Perks 
Bunch of different game modes

Cons
Rank is best in flex party. (friends or teammates in same party)
Unable to disable cross-play (Only consoles are entitled to crossplay option)
Console players never shut up (play permanent with open mic)
Leavers/afkers (two types of each. Leavers: Leavers or dc'ing Afkers: afk then get booted for inactivity or emote afkers. Those that afk in a corner spamming emotes to not get kicked for inactivity)
Some dc or weapon firing bugs. 
Typical Cheaters and aimbotters (which is rarely)

Overall: 7.5/10 is my rating for the game 
(1/10 for leavers/afkers other 1/10 crossplay and the other 0.5/10 for the rest of the cons)
Will still recommend the game to anyone even with the cons. Main issue with the game is you need friends to party up with for rank as you get more leavers/afkers in rank than casual and then finally no option to disable crossplay on pc.",1649804949,1649804949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
