PS2 release day with GT3: A Spec and Forza 4 later on. I love the way the car, any car in this game, feels going through corners after spending time getting the right setup. Never had to before and it's been a learning curve, but it is SO rewarding to finally get that proper contact around corners. Racing feels genuine. Want to get into LFM (LowFuelMotorsports) lobbies, but still working on my safety rating in both public lobbies and single player races.

Have not tried iRacing. Have tried and disliked the feelings of RF2. Word of note, RF2 had issues for connecting to populated stateside servers which didn't help my decision for them.

Knowing that AC2 is supposed to release around Summer of '24, I'd like to see some changes though. I would like to be able to select the computer screen the game is displayed on in game rather than having to put the game in Big Picture mode. I would also like to see vehicle customization that allows for less having to go through other websites and PhotoShop. I would also, more importantly, like to use my joystick on my Fanatec wheel rather than just be limited to the ""joytog"" due to specific key inputs for looking around.

TL;DR
Worth the purchase! You'll get a lot from the base game before you feel you want to purchase the DLC's. Word of note, I bought the DLC's no more than an hour after starting to play because of how happy I was and wanted to venture more into this game.",1708842863,1708842863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm pretty capable of running clean races but found myself constantly being penalized after being struck by others.  After browsing the iRacing forums, I found most people who publish similar frustrations are usually attacked for being ""bad"" drivers and causing their own accidents.  I'm well capable of taking P1 and have done so on numerous occasions during my iRacing ""career.""  I became tired of the hostile environment surrounding discussion of the SR system and even more tired of having my license penalized for actions beyond my control.  I think iRacing's strength lies in that it does an outstanding stand up job of organizing race events.  The cellphone app is handy for someone like me who has limited time to burn my life away in front of a computer screen and would like to be able to plan to start a race at a specific time.  I'm aware of Low Fuel Motorsports for ACC, but I haven't yet acquired the necessary SA to get my LFM license here.  Also, as far as I'm aware, LFM doesn't have an app for me to browse my dorky virtual racing career on my phone.

For a while I'd already known I liked ACC but felt it didn't have the same depth as iRacing (in terms of physics and handling).  After I cancelled my iRacing subscription I spent more time with ACC.  Well it turns out I just knew nothing of real world GT3 cars or the assist systems they use.  After learning how to adjust brake bias, traction control, abs, engine mapping, setup, and how to approach driving these cars which designed with the assists in mind, I gotta say there's a hell of a lot of depth here in ACC that wasn't immediately apparent to me.  I'd always known I liked the FFB and graphics better than iRacing, but now I'm starting to think I may like the physics better here in ACC as well.  I think iRacing still has a massive leg up in multiplayer, but I now think ACC is a ""better"" overall game.  (better is subjective, find what you like best)

Something else worth mentioning is I bought several tracks and a handful of vehicles to race on iRacing.  I've probably spent close to $400-500 on iRacing in the brief period I spent with it.  This does not include the $800 wheel I purchased.  I went and purchased all of ACC's DLC after realizing I could get multiple cars and multiple tracks for roughly the cost of one ""rented"" track on iRacing.

I didn't intend for this to end up as a sim vs sim posting but it's hard for me to not compare the two.  I spent a good deal of money many hours on one sim that left me more frustrated than entertained.  Now that I'm focusing more on ACC I find I've spent far less money and have been much more entertained.  Your mileage may vary.

I'd be very excited to see more touring cars and overall slower racing classes introduced to this platform.  At the moment there's only one touring car in the game.  I'm eager to see a front-wheel-drive race car introduced to the ACC physics system and FFB environment.

If you were to introduce a spec Miata series to ACC may never leave my computer desk again.",1704423647,1708146520,True,10,1,0.594082891941070557,0,True,False,False

I played this for 70 minutes, and I'm still not convinced this is my cup of tea, ACC is way better. Controls for Logitech wheel+pedals set up in 5 minutes, physics make sense (although a bit to slippery imo), multiplayer works, I was in a race in no time.

As a noob I caused 2 accidents, one of them was probably entirely my fault, rear-ending a car. The other one was when I was recovering from an oversteer, and I let one car pass, then tried defending the position I had and the guy just crashed into me. I can imagine how infuriating these could feel (to the other driver) when they are actually good and such.

By default I got the Lambo Huracan. It feels good to drive, and after a few laps, I feel how the car behaves. Original AC wasn't able to accomplish this.

~5hr edit:
There are definitely people who actively and intentionally mess up others' games, but I confirm that this game can be fun. And despite some mistakes and accidents, I was able to raise my safety rating (and have the best lap time of the lobby), which is nice. There was one weird server with 10 hours of qualifications, which at first is odd, but actually useful to learn a track with other cars around, and grind that SA :) For personal lap records though, unfortunately yellow and blue flags delay the attempts for a few minutes.

~14hr edit:
matchmaking (talking about quick join, and public servers) as beginner is unfun, as I get put into lobbies with experienced drivers. Racing almost doesn't exist there, as I lag behind, nobody to overtake or draft behind. Another painpoint is car setups, where many things can be adjusted to shave off seconds, and there are websites selling configs for a price of a DLC, which is ridiculous. I will probably check out some communities with dedicated private servers that host more opportunities for beginners.
Since my initial review I revisited AC1, and after having played ACC, AC1 makes more sense and the lines between the two are a bit blurred. AC1 is not as bad as I initially thought, and ACC is not as good.
Given its popularity in AC1, I don't get why the full Nordschliefe wasn't included in ACC, and same goes for some other tracks, probably.
Regarding bumps and crashes, it's sad that starting from last position is advised to avoid corner1 crashes. I started from the middle, avoided one crash, and I got crashed into, ruining my race and SA rating. Both cars receiving penalty when someone divebombs is just plain stupid or lazy. There could be smarter ways to determine the penalties, for example if someone comes from behind with X km/h speed diff, they should be the one to blame.

23hr edit:
I just finished my first race I actually enjoyed, because there was a guy we could fight with. We both sent ""gg""/""good race"" after finishing, so it highlights how rarely this happens with beginners, which is sad in terms of matchmaking.
23 hours... I also improved my lap time by seconds (for reference: Monza lambo evo, 1:54) during this race by braking late AF and not being so careful with avoiding a little tire squeal (the sound cue and actually slipping does not happen at the same time... bit of wheel-induced oversteer entering the turn can help avoid understeer it seems)",1706371481,1708030699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You mastered arcade racers like Forza Horizon and Dirt.
- You mastered simcades like F1 and Forza Motorsport.
- You saw some streamers playing ACC, and it looked pretty cool.

How it's going:
- You try playing ACC with a controller, only to spin at every turn on your first lap.
- You get good enough with a controller to know that you need a wheel to do a proper lap.
- You get good enough with an entry level wheel to know that you need a sim rig, load cell pedals, a direct drive wheelbase, an authentic formula wheel, butt kickers, and a VR headset to truly feel immersed and squeeze every tenth out of each lap.
- You spend all of your free time and most of your time in the office on sim racing forums and browsing gear sites.

every other aspect of the game? horrendous. the UI must have been designed to be as useless and annoying as possible, it can not possibly have been by accident. 

there's a VR mode in the launch options of this game, which until you're driving a car shows you a 2d panel of the main menu, you CANT use VR controllers at all, which means when you launch the game and it FORCES you to create a driver name, you have to peek out of your VR headset and use a physical keyboard to enter the text, so hopefully you had one nearby, and hopefully you can see out of your headset easily, otherwise good luck. 

now after you've done that you get into the actual menu for the game, at first it looks decent, modern panels with most of the modes you'd want to drive. lets say you want to set up a fun race session with friends. great! go over to the multiplayer tab and.... no way to host a session at all? interesting, the game is on steam, and steam has multiplayer server and session abilities on it, so why not press a button to setup a lobby and just invite people through steam? why make people run the dedicated server software. (which by the way you need a 3rd party tool to be able to use) well anyway now that you've exited the game (for probably the 3rd time) now you have the dedicated server running on your computer, and you can go back into the game and join your session right? well probably not. you need to enable NAT loopback so that you can connect TO YOUR OWN SERVER. an option which many people using ISP provided modem/routers wont have access to easily. 

its interesting that a racing game can be so well made for the actual racing part, but be so bad in every other aspect. do the devs live under a rock and think their UI and everything is totally fine? it was very clear with the original Asseto Corsa that the UI was actually unusable. there's a 3rd party app with as many downloads as the game that controls the UI and everything itself. at least this time they actually have a menu system in the game so you can theoretically use it by itself, but only if you're happy playing on other peoples servers or singleplayer. 

for gods sake devs, just use steam multiplayer integration and let people setup their own session IN GAME. i gave up trying to setup a session and bought someone else an iracing subscription just to play with them. is that really the experience you want for this amazing racing game?",1706839230,1706839230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The smoothness of traction loss means about a month or so ago I booted the game up after half a decade of playing different titles and never really feeling like I understood cornering, and suddenly it clicked for me and I understood how to trail-brake and slip angle drive through corners. FFB feels extremely good right out of the box as they say. 
It's not Assetto Corsa 2. To be clear. It's like a spin-off movie focused on a smaller group of characters - GT cars. Which are sports cars converted into race-cars. I think. I don't really care. It doesn't matter that much. They all look and sound pretty similar once you're in them. Sweaty V8s/V6s usually, gear whine and the echo of the metal cockpit. And any elegance to their silhouette is bludgeoned out of them by the aero and the bloody horrible liveries(BTW, why do racecars always have such horrible liveries? Can't they at least try and make them the same general colour and tone, so it's not like someone puked up a DIY catalogue on the car's chassis?). But they behave differently. Probably. Maybe. Honestly I got prompted by Steam to review this game, and it really is good, but I play Assetto Corsa much more, and I mostly drift in that rather than race. So I haven't played enough to even notice if the Mclaren 720s behaves differently to the Ferrari 296. They're all much of a muchness to me if I'm honest, but I'm not the one to ask. D'you know what? Just go away. I've changed my mind, I'm not even telling you if it's good or not. Now you'll never know.",1706823161,1706823161,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This sim is a prime example that a racing sim doesn't have to be hard as hell to be accurate. The DLC (while I usually can't stand these little DLC packs) used to be worth every dollar until they started making you buy an entire car pack to get 1 freakin' track. Despite this negativity, it's still a buy, but now it's only a buy during a steep Steam Sale.

EDIT: I think I've spoke too soon.. Kunos has been mostly quite nice about the pricing of their DLC, but now greed seems to have won them over. The British GT pack (3 tracks) is $13. Now with the release of the 3 American tracks that price has skyrocketed to $18. This is not what I expected from this group of developers! 

EDIT: When Kunos released the GT4 pack, it was cars only. I was happy to purchase a car pack full of different cars to drive. But now!! Now with the GT2 pack, they've decided to slyly toss in a track to just to piss me off. If this would have been GT2 cars only, it would have again been great, but no, they suddenly feel they have to slip a damn track in on an already good DLC just so people who have no interest in GT2s will have to buy the whole freakin pack.. I'm becoming very disappointed at Kunos and their obvious greed!!!!",1595047590,1706754952,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a racing title where precision and immersion should reign supreme, the unnervingly light and numb sensation transmitted through the steering wheel plunges players into a bewildering state of disconnection from the virtual track.

Attempting to wrangle a high-performance race car with the responsiveness of a deflated balloon, I found myself grappling with an infuriating lack of tactile feedback. Every turn, every maneuver felt as though I was guiding a ghostly apparition rather than a finely-tuned machine hurtling through legendary circuits.

Desperate to salvage any semblance of enjoyment from this ordeal, I delved into the settings menu, spending countless hours tinkering with sliders and toggles in a futile attempt to coax some semblance of realism from the game, even using LUTS. Yet, no matter how meticulously I adjusted the parameters or experimented with different configurations, the elusive sensation of tire grip, road texture, and vehicle weight remained stubbornly absent.

Assetto Corsa Competizione's failure to deliver a satisfying FFB experience not only detracts from the immersion but actively sabotages the gameplay itself. Racing enthusiasts seeking the adrenaline-fueled thrills of high-speed competition will find themselves stranded in a virtual purgatory, condemned to navigate tracks devoid of the visceral feedback essential for mastering hairpin turns, controlling slides, and pushing the limits of their driving prowess.

While the game boasts stunning visuals and an impressive roster of meticulously detailed cars and tracks, the fundamental flaw in its FFB implementation casts a shadow over its otherwise commendable features. Until addressed, this deficiency transforms Assetto Corsa Competizione from a potential masterpiece into a frustrating exercise in futility, leaving players adrift in a sea of disappointment.

Just make sure you enable 'Gamepad' in your settings and assign your pit limiter to a button like 'A' or 'X'

The GT class comes with a lot more feel for the track and achievement in learning each layout compared to the games for open wheeled race cars and the tire physics make track evolution feel super satisfying each lap as you learn both car and track.

The single player options are also amazing with pretty good AI compared to other titles that make mistakes and try different lines along with a fully customisable season calendars with the tracks not missing a single bump or texture, race category participants, and format to give lots of variable and new experiences and that's less than ten hours in!

countless laps, countless kerb kisses, and enough Aston V8 roars to wake the dead. Assetto Corsa Competizione isn't just a game, it's a digital addiction fueled by laser-focused racing and tire-shredding satisfaction. The physics? Razor-sharp, demanding respect for every turn and apex. The cars? Each a precision instrument, begging to be pushed to the limit. The sound? A symphony of screaming engines and gravel crunching symphonies.

But ACC isn't all sunshine and checkered flags. Multiplayer is a chaotic ballet of divebombs and last-lap heroics (or villainies, depending on your perspective). Kyalami sausage kerbs are more like medieval torture devices, and mastering Spa's Eau Rouge is a rite of passage for any virtual racer.

Yet, through the sweat and tears, a grin emerges. Every nail-biting overtake, every perfectly timed corner exit, every inch clawed back from a fellow speed freak feels like a personal victory. And then there's Nordschleife, the mythical Green Hell, looming on the horizon like a siren's call to every masochistic sim racer. Kunos, we're begging you, unleash the beast!

So, is ACC worth the investment? If you crave the thrill of the perfect line, the adrenaline rush of a close battle, and the satisfaction of mastering a machine, then buckle up. Just don't blame me when you emerge from your rig, blinking at the real world like a confused tourist on Bangla Road Thailand.",1706528787,1706528787,True,1,0,0.500866591930389404,0,True,False,False

Jestem raczej kimś kto woli simcady bądź zręcznościówki więc przejście w rejon bardziej realistyczny wymagało czasu i cierpliwości, a gra na to pozwala. przez większość czasu śledzi nasze postępy od poprawnej linii po kontakty na trasie, utraty przyczepności bądź walki o miejsca z innymi graczami a tym czasie od czasu do czasu modyfikuje profil, by wskazać mniej więcej którym stopniu zaawansowania jesteśmy.
Szkoda tylko że to co system pokazuje nie zawsze odpowiada prawdzie. W wyścigach mp tak jak w każdej innej grze wyścigowej znajdą się i ci którzy mają wysoką rangę bezpieczeństwa a mimo to nie zawahają się was wypchnąć.

SI jest tu dostępne, lecz jej rola jest drugoplanowa. Wyścigi z KI są traktowane raczej jako tutorial, to tu będziesz testował auta w otoczeniu wyścigowym zanim wyruszysz do trybów wieloosobowych, jednakże nie powinno się tego punktu pomijać iż KI jest dobrze zaimplementowane. Auta sterowane przez komputer mogą wylecieć z trasy tak samo łatwo jak gracz, nie spychają, zostawiaja wystarczająca miejsca itd....innymi słowy da się jeżdzić.

Co do aut i tras....cóż. No jest ich mało. Jakość co prawda jest wyśmienita ale brakuje mi no paru tras bądź aut. Gra bazowa ma tylko parę audi, 2 astony, 2 Ferrari, 3 Lambo, 2 bentleye, lexus, Jaguar, 2 mclareny, 2 hondy i 2 BMW. Trochę mało. Zwłaszcza że było w przeszłości wiele naprawdę pięknych aut Gt3 które mogłyby zostać dodane ( Viper GT-3R, Corvette Zo6 GT3, Ford GT GT3 czy nawet Cadillac ATS V-R Gt3 ) ale niestety licencji od Blancpain sie chyba przeskoczyć nie da.

Jako że nie mam dużo realistycznych symulacji to o fizyce w grze się nie wypowiem bo się na tyle nie znam. Jedyne co mogę powiedzieć to że jazda jest przyjemna.

Gra posiada edytor malowań dla wozów, jest on aczkolwiek zrobiony na odwal się byle by był, więc jeżeli chcecie kiedyś pobawić się w tworzenie zaawansowanych malowań do wozów do musicie znać się na Photoshopie, GIMP-ie, Adobe bądź innym programem do edycji.

Gra wieloosobowa jest też stabilna, co jakiś czas master serwer robi restarty i wtedy nie można dostać się do gry z innymi graczami ale tak to nie ma większych problemów. Jako że serwery są dedykowane to jest ten standard zachowany.

no cóż nie wiem jak się wypisać więc kto wie...widzimy się na drodze

Amazing physics, lots of top tracks and a selection of excellent cars. You can customize everything, and there are very detailed options to adapt the difficulty, assists, and rules. I have the full set of DLCs, and the tracks are absolutely stunning and worth it, every single one. It looks great and it even comes with a great default configuration for the Xbox controller, even though you should of course play this with a wheel -- but before I decided to buy one, I had to evaluate the game without one. I now played this with a Thrustmaster T300 wheel and pedals as well, and it feels even better of course. UPDATE: I got Fanatec gear and it's amazing to drive with a GT3 wheel.

The only very minor negatives I can come up with it that it's only GT3 (a minor issue for me, as GT is my favorite series), and that Nordschleife is missing. Most likely it's missing because this is the official GT game, and the track was not part of the covered racing seasons. I hope it gets added to a future season and then comes to ACC, that would be amazing. If you really need Nordschleife, try Automobilista 2. It's a very different game with a much broader focus and tons of cars that I also like, but for GT3, nothing beats ACC: it just looks, sounds and feels better.

This was a very early review, and after the 19 hours I played, I have only gotten used to one car and driven it in time trial mode on all tracks in dry conditions, and a few in rain. I have not messed with the car's setup, I have barely started the career. But I believe I can already tell you that this game is truly a great experience! Now let me drive just [i]one more lap[/i]! 9.5/10

Update: I have played a lot more (on a friend's account, because he has a wheel), we are now driving in different conditions and without the assist line and watching videos to get better. It's still a blast. I absolutely recommend this to everyone looking for a serious racing game. Like Dirt Rally, it's rather exhausting to play though, and requires lots of concentration. If I talk to others while playing, I find that I make mistakes and mess up. If you are willing to put in some effort, it'S perfect though.

ACC has redefined what it means to experience high-level racing simulation, offering a level of realism and attention to detail that is unmatched in the genre.

At the heart of ACC's success is its meticulous replication of GT3 cars and their behavior. Each car feels distinct, with the developers having gone to great lengths to accurately model the nuanced differences in performance, handling, and aerodynamics. This level of detail extends to the tracks as well, which are laser-scanned replicas of real-world circuits, providing an immersive and authentic racing experience.

The game's physics engine deserves special mention. The way it simulates tire grip, aerodynamics, and car dynamics is second to none, creating a realistic and responsive driving experience. This is complemented by the game's weather system, which not only impacts visibility but also track conditions, forcing drivers to adapt their strategy and driving style.

ACC also excels in its sound design. The roar of the engines, the screech of tires, and the ambient track sounds create an incredibly immersive atmosphere. Whether you're playing with headphones or a full speaker setup, the sound design enhances the overall realism of the simulation.

The game's multiplayer component is robust, offering a competitive environment for racers of all skill levels. The ranking system ensures fair matchmaking, and the penalty system encourages clean and respectful racing. The single-player career mode, while not as fleshed out as some might hope, still offers a satisfying progression system and a chance to improve skills against AI competitors.

Graphically, ACC is stunning. The attention to detail in the car models and tracks, combined with advanced lighting and weather effects, makes for a visually spectacular experience. However, this does mean that the game can be demanding on hardware, requiring a relatively powerful system to enjoy it at its best.

In terms of accessibility, ACC might be intimidating for newcomers to the genre. Its focus on realism means there's a steep learning curve, and the game doesn't hold your hand through it. However, for those willing to invest the time, the reward is the most authentic GT3 racing experience available.

In conclusion, Assetto Corsa Competizione continues to set the standard for GT3 simulation games. Its unparalleled attention to detail, advanced physics engine, and immersive sound and graphics create an experience that is as close as most will get to driving a real GT3 car. While it may be demanding in terms of both hardware requirements and player skill level, those who rise to the challenge will find a deeply rewarding racing simulation.",1706118778,1706118778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

its affordable, accurate, active, runs well on mid spec machines, and has a super engaged leauge community. it may not be the most diverse racer out there, with limited selection in both track and car types, however it makes up for it in quality and race quality. 
this alongside a slow and steady rating system to get you up to speed makes it a killer game, and the DLC is so worth it.

for me ACC has gotten much worse with version 1.9 your basically stuck using the most recent cars if you want to be competitive

 the built in BOP is absolutely crap and you pretty much HAVE to join lowfuel motorsport or simgrid if you want a populated race 

lowfuelmotorsport has been making a much better custom BOP and pretty much is saving ACC without these guys i think 50% of people would still be playing so hats off to them. 
 
its really hard to recommend this game anymore as its in a much worse state then when i enjoyed it the most and if it was not for 3rd party hosting sites it would not even be on the radar.

but i do feel like its still a good experience compared to whats available just expect to be let down often and everytime something changes its probably going to take months to be working well.

if you read below these are updates that happened over the years when i was having problems with something in the game believe me whats written down below is a small portion of the issues ive had haha

ACC is still good and with 1800 hours+ in game its not like i can say i didnt enjoy a lot of it but idk i do feel like I was buying into the sales pitch for the first few years and now i can kind of see all the cracks and flaws and they just seem to be getting worse with every update many things that were problems 3 years ago are still problems and possibly even worse now than ever   

1.8Well after so many hours on ACC I have to say I am just so ready to be done with this game, ACC was really amazing for about a year mid 2021-mid2022 or so was really great for me the update in Aug 2022 seemed to really ruin every car i was driving making the game unenjoyable for me and over 1.5-2 seconds a lap slower even after hundreds of hours on this patch I just dont seem to be able to drive any car on it very well. 
There has been many updates and honestly I am just sick of spending hours and hours on setups and learning to drive a car for it to all just be erased and changed by an update then being 2 seconds a lap slower till you finally figure out w/e random setup stuff/meta you have to do this update to make the car drive ok after playing for 1500 hours there just should not be some changes you make that make people 1-2 seconds off pace and have to relearn to play the same game over again its just ridiculous at this point. 

(old thoughts)
This is my favorite sim racing title but still has bugs sometimes mostly a good experience 

again the US CP server is not working for 5 days now ridiculous this happens way to often and it takes way to long for them to fix the same issue over and over pretty sad when a company just lets things goto crap and abandons there work >>>>>Constant problems with multiplayer access and cp server access for the past week pretty annoying why is this stuff such a regular issue tried to get help from kunos they dont even acknowledge or reply yet they say to go through the effort of ziping up your logs file to send them its a waste of time it seems  ----

---sorry for caps >PLEASE FIX CP SERVERS FOR ALL COUNTRIES PEOPLE ARE GETING NO SERVER IN REGION IN USA AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES SO THERE IS NO PLAYERS HARDLY ON THE SERVERS PLEASE START SUPPORTING ALL COUNTRIES AND PLEASE HAVE A INTERNATIONAL CP SERVER AT LEAST A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK AND ALSO PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY DRIVE GT4 IF THEY HAD A SERVER AND TIME OF THERE OWN I AM FURIOUS WITH THIS STUFF ACC DEVS ONLY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT EURO SERVERS IF THATS THE CASE THEN LET EVERYONE RACE ON EURO SERVERS YOU ARE LETTING THIS GAME DIE BY WEARING BLINDERS ITS RIDICULOUS >sorry for caps in hopes it would be noticed<

 1.7.9 now 300 hours later and still seems like alot of the same issues with one fix comes another problem i guess thats just the way this game is going to go i used to think this game really sumulated what real racing would be like but idk i dont think real racing is this sensitive or everyone would be dead lol if the weather changes 1c your tires can change to the point of losing seconds of time or crashing i dont beleve .2 psi 1 way or the other is going to make a car drive like its a 1970s stationwagon i just dont get it i think in trying to be a simulation they have pushed some things way to far for any non pro racer and the fact that all the information you need to do well is not included with the game and you have to spend just as much time searching for stuff on forums
 -some just to get the game to work properly half the time 400 hours of game time and probably 200-300 hours of research and 1 patch update changes all the bops and everything you knew and all your setups are now garbage time to relearn how to be a race engineer or go pay for a bunch of new setups or search forums/youtube for hours upon hours to learn the fixes as fun as it is 1 time around every 2-3 weeks it seems like theres some bop change were the car you were driving gets ruined then you figure it out and 2-3 weeks later it happens again 

<old>>1.7.5 now im having tons of server issues and double the ping or even triple the ping as i normally have doing ping test its the same as ever this is really starting to get old to be honest my connection isnt fantastic about 90-110 ping average witch is acceptable but 250-400 is no at all this is 100% a acc problem as other games and test are way less ping the servers wont even load 75% of the time or connect i really dont understand how every update brings some kind of new problem that ruins the gameplay why update when your making the game not work anymore?

>>1.7.4 hotfix the game works now but is still doing odd things like my CC went to 100 randomly yesterday it was 75 before this randomly happend the game has been turing on player id tags when i have turned them off 10x i feel like the game just doesnt work as well like lower fps i was pretty steady 80-90 fps now im 60-70 and it just seems noticably worse and i have lowered settings as well im not sure what to think about that>>>2 days prior >>>>the game does not start after 1.7.3 hotfix update the acc logo screen apears then a windows box pops up saying its not working anymore and needs to be closed kind of ridiculous litterely doesnt even get to the main menu anymore . <<<new

 old>>So it seems there working on things but it is very frustrating to be honest when you play for hours and hours to learn something then its changed i feel like the AMG has been almost ruined 2020 version worse than 2015 has especially been bad since the 1.7 update and i dont understand how it can be so bad now to be honest it seems some cars are alot better than others now and setups that were amazing b4 are undrivable almost for me also i the comp server races see to have more regular weather so far 3 day 1 day rain and 2 night races 1 with rain this seems more normal as i had 10 night and night rain comp races in a row b4>>old post>>   EVERY CP SERVER RACE IS NIGHT OR RAIN so the servers are still on and off if it actually loads or not my biggest gripe now is the cars just seem completely different to drive now and in a bad way tire temps seem all over in the same lap my tires will fluctuate 8 clicks while one side is 28 then go down to 27.2(27.2 is now undrivable understeer or traction loss ) and brake ducts dont seem to help to get consistant preasure.......

 original >no competition servers in my region after update british gt update even know im in the region the race is in and meet all req. the game is great but really annoyed after just getting the imola update on xbox and it not working right and now i cant even get into a server after this update somehow i got into a eu server and im in us but theres no server in my region when us race comes up it makes no sence worked fine yesterday i think ive spent 200$ just on the game and dlc between xbox and pc so yea...not sure what else to say the racing is great but dont expect it to work all the time",1613001018,1705947869,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, I don't share the same joy when it comes to the multiplayer game mode. The lobbies with higher safety rating are fine, with only a few racing incidents and maybe 1 immature driver or so. It's in the lower leagues where you have to deal with the type of scum who have never completed a safe overtake in their life. They can and will punt you off the road. What makes it worse is that there is no in-built reporting system AND both players safety ratings are lowered. That means even if you are innocent , you still get punished. Aside from the multiplayer experience, the game is pretty good. The only things that are needed are an improved multiplayer experience and an in-built reporting/ban system.

ACC is not a game as such, its much more of a sim than a game, the career mode is just racing against bots, no story, animations or cut scenes etc.
If you want an idea of how hard this game is go to any driving game you own and turn off all assists (although there is traction control and ABS in ACC its still not easy) and turn up the difficulty to max, you need to practice and practice and practice and probably need learn some advanced driving techniques just to get up to race speed.


ACC is the official GT3 game and as such it is restricted to just the cars and tracks from the GT3 series, there are also GT4's (Essentially slower GT3's) available as an add on but no one really races them.
Some may see this as a bad thing, but this does mean that they only have to concentrate on 1 style of physics and they have done the GT3 cars justice.

Then there's the setup of the cars, you have a choice you can buy them from a 3rd party or learn the art yourself, i warn you its not that easy.
The tyres are the easiest part of the setup and the one part you will have to use all of the time.

The tyres are everything in this game, get the pressures/temps wrong and you will not be able to drive fast and will probably spend all your time sliding and spinning out, you need the correct temps to have decent grip.
You will need to drive multiple laps, return to the garage, adjust your tyre setup then go back and drive a few more laps and rinse and repeat until you have the desired temps/psi, this may need 6=8 laps to achieve the desired temps...And that is just for the track temperature that you happen to be on at the time, change lobby or track temp and you will have to do all  this over again, it does get easier to do over time as you get the hang of it.

I wouldn't really recommend you play on a joypad, it is doable but not ideal, i'd think you would struggle to be competitive, but if you must i'd suggest to find a good guide on how to adjust your pad (there is a great one on here).

For those that do like the format and physics of this game it can get expensive and i am not talking add ons etc, i am £800 in so far on a wheelbase, load cell pedals, stand for the wheel and pedals and a gt style wheel just because...And this is the cheap gear (Thrustmaster)...You can easily spend £3000 to £5000 on a nice setup.

I just realised i haven't even mentioned the rating system within ACC, some think its really bad and others think its ok.
I wont go into details on it but i will say if you want to race online then you must pay attention to it...And you can only have one user within the game and there is no resetting your user to reset your stats.

ACC is not am arcade type of game, sliding and drifting is bad, crazy fast changes of direction are bad and crashing into other cars is a big no no, it will lose both yourself and the car you hit some of your safety ratings which is the most important stat in the game, so don't expect the person you crash into to be happy with you.

So if all the above sounds good to you, go for it you will love it

If you do buy ACC then please do everyone a favour and don't just jump into an online race straight away, it will end badly for all...PLEASE go and practice, practice and practice before joining any public lobbies.",1664806102,1704373950,True,40,1,0.812006115913391113,0,True,False,False

Online racing is awesome and this is where I spend all of my time; 30 cars on track brings a lot of action, lots of overtakes and a lot of collisions to avoid. Major fun when getting consistent enough to close the gap to the car ahead over several laps, and it's nerve wrecking if you're the one that's being hunted.

I don't think I will ever play another FM Microsoft game again after finding this simulator. If you want a nice authentic racing experience with a very flexible difficulty and control setup. This is for you. Great visuals as well especially for a 3 to 4 year old game. It has a nice learning curve though, and cars feel a bit floaty at first. However if you get it down and learn your corners it is EXTREMELY satisfying! The customization is not as quite in depth as Forza's, but it does let you create your own team, car livery, and has many colors to pick from. Between this and F1 2023 I think my sim racing thirst is quenched after the let down of FM8 and Microsoft / Turn10.  I am playing on a Razer V2 Wolverine xbox controller and after a couple tweaks in the input sensitivity it felt great. I will be creating a sim chair setup w/ my ol' reliable Logitech G27 for this though.

DEV forces player to use only 1 analog and 2 trigger so....you will forces to have an empty right analog with unnecessary keybinds and this how to fix it.

-Throttle and brake will bind to left and right trigger by default so you can't change it let it be
-clean all right analog default keybinds
-bind shift up and down to shoulder buttons L1/R1
-use steam input and change right analog stick unit to dpad
-assign dpad up to right trigger /throttle
-assign dpad down to left trigger /brake

by this you will had 2 throttle and brake set keys on your hands and when you want to use throttle and brake at the same times like trim your position in apex. use right analog up to throttle and brake with left trigger.

controller had more potential than DEV thinks It's need just a right setup with an analog stick height extension. even a clutch it's can assign on a controller and i never seen a simrace game thats not allow player setting up to comfort their play before. this fix can work on steam only. but how about a console player who don't had a wheel and steam input.

IE: GT4/GT3/GT2 (although GT2 isn't really a thing anymore). But if you are looking for an authentic feel in GT series racing, this is the sim for you. I play a wide arrangement of 'racing sim' style games. From Forza Motorsport, to the original Assetto Corsa, to ACC, to iRacing. I even do rally with games such as Dirt Rally 2.0 and Rally Sim Fan's Richard Burns' Rally. For GT3 racing, ACC is king. Even compared to iRacing. The brakes are realistic, the tire model is realistic, and the cars handling is realistic. This feels like driving an actual car, as it should.

The only drawback I can find to this game over something like iRacing is the damage model in ACC is a lot more forgiving. Tapping the wall in ACC won't force you to limp the car around the track to the pits, or have to tow in, whereas in iRacing, it's a bit more realistic in that aspect. Hitting the wall would do detrimental damage to your vehicle, and in iRacing, it does. So this game does have a little bit more forgiveness when it comes to incidents on the track. The audio is also much more immersive in ACC than other sims, even getting to the point that driving through closed in sections of the track will cause the audio of the car to echo back onto you. It's nice. And the game is beautiful. 

So, would I recommend this game? Yes, for GT3 racing, this is the top dog. For everything else, I would say get iRacing (especially if you are into dirt oval racing... iRacing does that SOOO WELL!).

Setups do play a big role in lap time and therefore people try monetize this aspect of ACC which means you will have to spend more money on top of the $40 price tag + DLC to have a competitive setup to properly race. This leads to another side which is that ACC uses info from the GT championships so if 1 car becomes bad and you have just spent $40 for the base price and say 1 DLC for the car so like $15 and then a $20 setup you are now down $35 for the car and the setup for an noncompetitive car. You can find free setups or make your own but they are rarely better than pro setups and way more time consuming. A negative is also that you do need to own all DLC to participate in ranked races, but just sign up for LFM which is way better or do casual races. Despite listing some negatives this game is incredibly fun, Weather and graphics are amazing, the cars feel very responsive and drive differently based on TC and ABS settings. Better multiplayer than Assetto Corsa as in AC the server list is clunky and often empty, in ACC you can get your favorite car and join multiplayer races. Braking system is also significantly more accurate for GT3's than IRacing or Assetto Corsa. Cars are also incredibly detailed with many nooks and crannies as well as accurate weight distribution for stuff like engine placement and fuel. Car collisions are significantly better(detection wise) than say iRacing. On the other hand the mechanical damage is not as detailed as iRacing and can sometimes feel negligible in an aerodynamic sense. Cars can be very hard to drive but incredibly rewarding once mastered, I drive the Mclaren 720s GT3 Evo and it is very hard to sustain grip through lower speed corners and sometimes even the off tic can make the car loose grip or lock the steering, but once you have mastered all the brake markers and the intricacies it is incredibly rewarding. Take for example, I was learning the Mclaren on Monza and when I finally got a 1:54:072 I was extremely happy, but I have been driving now on Spa and feel like on eau rouge my car looses grip and the steering locks which is very frustrating. Either way if you are a pleb or a professional racer sliding into a GTR user get ready to be called a slur. PS.

The first game didn't even work and required you to spend hundreds to a thousand dollars to get a proper wheel and pedals. It didn't work with standard logitech wheels and pedals.

I have a fanatec system with both a normal steering wheel and a F1 steering wheel and can tell you this game only works with the F1 steering wheel. This game suffers the same issues the F1 23 game had where you can't make turns without going the full 900 degrees to either side as the game just doesn't recognize going 90 degrees when turning the wheel. You have to play on manual mode in order to get some better control, but it's obvious they don't drive a manual in real life.

The menus and GUI could use a little re-organizing and the server list could have a more refined search based off region or such so that you can find more populated servers but generally i have found online racing and the systems in the game to be awesome. I love getting online and hitting even 10 minute sprint races to ones lasting much longer. I also think it would be neat to feature in a more expansive livery editor. 

Im only at 77 hours so far but i think ill easily have hundreds more. Maybe you'll race me :)

*asterisk below ( I have had the privilege of driving real race cars and building some over the last 20 years, it is my profession  ) 
------1920 hours of playtime later from the text above-------
I forgot that I wrote this, and now.... i am approaching 2000 hours. I have ran in LFM and other grassroots style leagues that have pushed my driving technique and competitiveness to levels I have never knew I could achieve through a sim. The people ive met, and became friends with will likely stick with me for my entire life through the comradery ive experienced racing some of the best drivers on the internet.  I have become involved with this sim/game more than any other game ive ever played and i did several years of competitive level esports with Counter strike.   There is no other game on this planet outside maybe the cumulative hours ive spent playing games online since the late 90's with first person shooters and rts combined than ACC. Which to think about is insanity because I enjoy games. I think what has separated this from the others is that it is a real world tangible experience ( *see above)  that benefits you in many ways as not only a driver but human being. It forces you to challenge yourself constantly so you are not left behind. I always have been able to find small steps forward in bettering myself in this and in real life at the same time!   

TDLR : make a ton of friends, teach them how to get fast, get into a league ( apex online, Low fuel motorsport , simracing.gp, ) it breeds excellence and better racing. This games updates and further progress even in this late of the game is still keeping coming back for league after league, its just that good. I will break 2000 hours very soon and will not likely stop until even after 3000 as long as the player base and development of the game doesnt cause it to die.

Okay it is a simulator so it does have quite steep learning curve but it is so rewarding when you get the corners right and get to the pole in the qualifiers. Would I recommend it? Hell yeah!

Is it worth the price? For sure but also keep look on discounts for better price if you are not willing to pay the full price.

5/5 or 10/10 for a racing game!

With the latest updates the tire model has gone much much more better!

The categories avaliable are improving slowly but surely (GT4 and GT3 so far).

Smaller load times, better grafics, lower input lag and a great online multiplayer competition. 

You can participate in private leagues or just join in one of many open servers with races online any time you want. Also now there are many official championships with real prizes on the line that you can take part of for free.

Even the smallest of setup change can modify the behaviour of the car so be prepared to have a hard time discovering the secrets of every car. 

Track surface grip variability and dynamic weather, with day, rain and night, make it hard to predict your best hotlap time.

Driver safety measures, pace, consistency and many other stats are recorded at every race in the game so you can improve and race against drivers of your skill level depending on the servers requirements.

Update (@v1.0.5 public beta): The game has released in a content-complete state, but not yet a feature complete state. Certain things are still being worked on by the 25-person team. For the driving alone, I'd recommend it - but the 'game'-part is still lacking. You need to make it fun for yourself, which you can do by joining one of the many existing communities and/or keeping track of your stats yourself.

Update (@v0.6.5): Really taking shape now, but a lot of stuff left to fill in. Multiplayer is stable now, but missing loads of features. The racing itself is still so good, combined with some well driving guys online this game is awesome.

Update (@v0.5.2): Game has some new content, which is fine, I guess. The Jag is a real challenge to drive through mid-high speed corners of which the new track (Zolder) has many. Apparently, Kunos have hit a snag with the multiplayer so that is still non-functional. Yet, I'm still having fun with the AI, with the hotlapping, and more. I just wish Kunos would allow us to record our hotlaps already. The function and UI is already there, they are just keeping it for the full release. It would have been a good gesture for starting over on the multiplayer part. Still positive about the game, but I hope they retain other people's interest.

Update (@v0.4.0): Game is stable AF right now. Haven't played release 3 a lot because I don't like the track and car they released and the online play was moot, but this release (Hungaroring + Ferrari + basic online races) is big ffing improvement. The game is really shaping up nicely. Also - try playing this with quality headphones on, you can hear the individual sounds (wind, tires, brakes, everything) doing their work. Breathtaking stuff.

Update (@v0.3.4): Game is less stable, especially in 'multiplayer', which is just hotlapping with other cars trying to ram you. Still, very promising but needs a lot of content.

At release (@v0.1.0/v0.1.1): game is very bare bones. 1 track, 1 car. Practice mode, hot lap mode, hot stint mode (8 min or 35 min) and sprint race (~20 min). Still, hell of a lot of fun if you like racing sims.

Options could be improved upon, the way the UI interface doesn't show confirmations to your input is irritating at times (namely during set-up). Loads of little kinks and gripes like that, but it's Early Access so I hope Kunos will listen to the community and doesn't leave this kind of stuff up to modders this time.

If you like hotlapping the Nürburgring, then this game in its current state is for you. ACC has so ff-ng much potential and I am looking forward to the rest of the content. However, it is not for everyone. I hate to start gatekeeping here, but this is no Forza or GT Sport. You have to get a wheel to enjoy it, fully.

The game is a dedicated endeavor to recreate the Blancpain GT Series, now known as the GT World Challenge Europe, with an impressive degree of accuracy and attention to detail.

One of the most laudable aspects of ACC is its handling model. It strikes a delicate balance between realism and playability, catering to both hardcore sim racers and those new to the genre. The game's physics engine delivers an incredibly authentic driving experience. Every nuance of the car's behavior, from tire grip to weight transfer, is perceptibly influenced by various factors like weather conditions and track temperature, making every race a unique challenge.

Graphically, ACC is a marvel. The meticulous representation of renowned circuits and a diverse range of GT cars are visually stunning, complemented by dynamic weather and lighting systems that not only enhance the visual appeal but also affect race strategy and vehicle handling.

The game's sound design deserves special mention. The roar of engines, the screech of tires, and the ambient sounds of the track come together to create an immersive audio experience that puts you right in the driver's seat.

Multiplayer in ACC is robust, with a ranking system that ensures you're matched with players of similar skill levels. The game also features a single-player career mode that, while not as deep as some might hope, offers a satisfying journey through the GT series.

There are over 20 tracks and dozens of cars in each category (GT3, GT4, etc. - depending on which DLCs you get).

However, the game is not without its shortcomings. The AI can sometimes be unpredictable, and there are occasional technical glitches. Moreover, the steep learning curve might be off-putting for casual players.

In conclusion, Assetto Corsa Competizione is a must-play for fans of racing simulations.

Other sims allow this to suit each car variant and on the fly. Not ACC. I have had reasonable races in ACC, but like Christmas, they only come once a year. AMS2 eats this for breakfast.

Each time the  Game crashes with the ubiquitous UE4-AC2 game has crashed error that is littered all over the internet. I've not seen so many entries  for a fatal error like this  for a very long time.  I've spent waaaaay to long troubleshooting this reading the endless forum posts, steam posts, reddit  etc. etc. etc. to spend any more feckin time on this. FFS the issues people have and some of the fixes are just disgraceful - especially they one on having a too high sound codec output are a reason the game crashes - they had to put their sound output to 44.1 16bit to get the game to load. 

so devs - if you ever happen to see this -you slave hard to develop and realease the game,  I get it - the game looks great, apparently plays well and yet the issue folks have in getting the game to load are just appalling - on top of that the issues and some of the fixes just.should. not.be.needed. 
reluctant refund requested- maybe there is a v2 on another game engine otherwise I'd have grabbed PC2.

so for any prospective buyers if the game does not run after a reasonable amount of time to fix get your refund in.

But where Assetto Corsa Competizione truly excels is in its accuracy to real-life motorsports. The official partnership with the Blancpain GT Series ensures that every detail, from car liveries to the rules and regulations, is faithfully recreated. The realism extends to the car setup options, allowing you to fine-tune your vehicle just like the real racing teams do.

It's not just about crossing the finish line; it's about strategy, tire management, and mastering the nuances of each track.

In conclusion, Assetto Corsa Competizione is the apex of racing simulation, a testament to the possibilities of virtual racing in every dimension.

Can't wait what Kunos can do with Assetto Corsa 2 but i would also be happy if they just continued updating this game as a platform and i would be happy to buy yearly DLC.

My only complain is that unbought DLC is a little bit distracting and you can even start championship which you can't actually play if you do not own proper DLC. But after i bought them all it solved the problem. I am just afraid this could scare away some potential new simracers before they get their feet wet.

Any way game price is cheap when you compare it to the gear which you will wan't after understanding that this game is already enough satisfying to drive that it justifies expensive gear.

This 1:1 real life simulator also do not work properly with gamepad apparently for a same reason why games with good gamepad support do not properly work with wheels.",1688672243,1697726569,True,0,0,0.462085306644439697,0,True,False,False

so please i urge the new players reading this to take some time getting used to the game and how the cars handle, it will make your time playing the game more enjoyable and it means that when you do come to the multiplayer part of the game, you might actually have a fighting chance against the other drivers and at the end of the race you will get a ""GG"" instead of many obscenities shouted at you because you got in someones way one too many times.",1696679388,1696679388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most online friendly races are 20 min, so not exactly your 3 lap sprints. However, there has been a recent surge of trolling. these include:
- parking on the racing line behind blind corners and waiting for the lead pack
- parking off the track to wait for cars to t-bone
- blatantly deliberate t-1 crashing
- deliberately ignoring blue flags to hold up/crash into lead lap cars

Obviously some people find it fun to ruin other people's, but when a game is doing seemingly nothing to prevent this, its inevitable that people are going to wreck it.

The community is great and you can find plenty of advice starting off and for advanced drivers. This is one of the few games that exist where I genuinely believe that you take some of the skills you learned back into the real world.

  at high point what i am talking about. As noob (13H) I enjoy this game, but i wish it had modding support to 
 play open world and also non-sport cars.

Then I happened to see a review on Assetto Corsa Competizione and as the name in the title states this is much more inclined, polished and orientated towards competition racing. I decided to by also ACC. However it took me some time to get the same level of visuals and performance that I have on the original AC. Now its almost there and today I managed to enjoy a few online races and its fun since the drivers are human and prone to pressure and mistakes unlike AI. In general I like the setup of the game and user interface. I like the fact that you can personalise the car livery. 
The following is not a dislike but just a comment , the simulation is oriented to GT3 and GT 4 type racing. I would have more appreciated ACC if it also included other classes and vintage tournaments like DTM and not only focused on GT 3/4.
Would i recommend it - yes for those that alreay have AC definitely a must have because its an awesome experience . For first time buyers I still suggest get Asseto Corse first and work your way to ACC.",1694905854,1694905854,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get full grids , with many guys (and girls :O) to compete with.
No allways you get polite competition but you have the chance at least.
With Low Fuel Motorsports you get some fine action with rating and goals :).

Worst thing:
FFB and physics are not the best, in some aspects AC 1 it feels just better. Of course no comparison against rf2 and ams2 (but this last one it depends so much on the car selected ..).

Imo AC has one of the best physics to date, and ACC continues that trend. What I really think benefits ACC is that it doesn't overextend itself with a massive selection. The development was focused to GT cars rather than having to adhere to multiple classes such as open wheel, rally, sports cars, etc. What this resulted in was a very disciplined sim, becoming a FAR more complete package than AC. 

The UI feels like a real game this time, multiplayer functions are easy to understand, singleplayer is viable, and the AI isn't hopeless. The immersion is even better, cars look fantastic and sound impeccable. The tracks are beautiful and diverse. The game helps you understand the philosophy of racing with it's rating system, and creates conditions just consistent enough for you to notice your short comings and where to improve. Out of all the sim games out there, this is the one that I like to actually race championships in, shave time off of lap times, and experiment with setups, other than maybe Dirt Rally.

It has got my daydreaming about buying new gear and a proper rig, even though I certainly don't have neither the cash or space for it.

I don't have that much experience with other sim racing titles so I can't really comment on how authentic it feels, but it's a huge difference between this and arcade racers such as Forza Horizon and Need For Speed. What I can say, however, is that even on my little setup it is very immersive. Sound and graphics are very nice and the cars behave on track as I would expect them to. Compared to the racing-line-hugging, rubber-banding AI from titles like Forza Horizon, the AI is much better. Can't comment on multiplayer though because I'm still learning how to not be a wrecking ball near other cars.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, absolutely. Even just practicing, doing hotlaps and racing against the AI is incredibly fun!",1692396628,1692396628,True,65,0,0.857817530632019043,0,True,False,False

While yes, there is [i]muuuuch[/i] more content, that is completely dependent on how good a mod is (and more importantly, how much you're willing to pay). This game on the other hand? Perfect content, across the board. The AI for it as well, holy shit! They don't feel like they're too weak or too strong. They're still AI of course, but compared to the dive-bombing, tunnel-visioned speed-demon AI that you have to deal with if you don't wanna play with other people, they are good enough. One thing I really liked was how customisable the cars and your character is. There's a lot of colours, a fair amount of pattern options and most importantly, you can have your own number on your car!

TLDR? Expensive including the DLC's, but 100[b]0[/b]% worth it if you want a good experience for GT racing. Would absolutely recommend for a good simracing experience.",1691037189,1691037453,True,8,0,0.632107019424438477,0,True,False,False
805550,134473161,76561198056605454,0,8,14783,0,661,1704547964,"The good things:
+driving in the rain - really feels like actual wet weather racing with aquaplaning and a believable grip level
+runs smooth and looks good
+simulates an actual race series rather than just throwing some random cars and tracks at you
+Night racing - headlights actually do work as they should on GT cars
+collisions actually work - the cars do not suddenly become glued to each other or start flying for no reason like in some other sims

The bad things:
-ffb gives no feel whatsoever - there is simply no indication when the tires begin to lose grip. As in regular Assetto Corsa, you need damn witchcraft to make this behave at least somewhat believable
-suspension simulation is odd in some cars - in the Ferrari 488, the slightest bump can send the rear end of your car flying. And I don't mean a slide. I mean actually launching it into the air. Slightly touch the gravel on inside of the Warsteiner-Kurve and it's as if someone planted a landmine there. I tried a Honda NSX and BMW M4 and those cars behave much better over bumps. EDIT Update 1.9 fixed this and now the physics are great!
-the UI is unintuitive
-stats sometimes don't work: I went online, won 3 races (even have replays) and in the stats it shows only one win. 
-If someone rear-ends you on braking you both get a safety rating drop. Even if it's some moron in a lapped down car. It would be a good idea to make it that if a collision involves a lapped down car, only that vehicle gets a penalty
-The rolling start procedure in online races. Seriously, this is badly done. It's overcomplicated and especially annyoying in online races where it sometimes throws random penalties for the driver starting in pole position.  Seriously, NASCAR Racing 2003 Season managed to get rolling starts working online without issues 20 years ago. GTR2? Same, rolling starts worked fine. And here we are with ACC in 2023 and it's an absolute mess EDIT After updates this seems fixed

Overall a mixed bag this... Played some more time and actually enjoyed some online races but still, there are some annoying issues with this game.

EDIT As of 1.9 the game has improved a lot! I really enjoy it!

I could not find a setting that wasn't too twitchy at speed but could also make a realistic slow tight turn.  My first problem was that there was zero tutorial at all, the closest thing to training was testing to see what difficulty to put you at.  As someone with significant high performance track time, I was most disappointed with realism.  It was more work than fun, like a sim, but it wasn't even very realistic.  There were also way too many helper systems build it that you couldn't turn off, like counter steering in a slide was always on; this really made it hard as sometimes the system helped and sometimes it didn't and the transitions were awkward.  You could also mash the gas and sometimes you'd uncontrollably spin out and letting off the gas wasn't enough to recover traction for a few full seconds; otherwise, it would just keep spinning the tires.  The control system seemed to punitively break the car if you ever lost control and didn't allow for a realistic quick recovery from minor losses of traction.  I've intentionally and unintentionally put real high performance cars into slides and the most amazing thing about them is how fast they recover full traction the moment you let off the gas or ease the steering input.

Also, like many simulators, be prepared to spend a ton more on adding cars; the game price only includes a few cars so you have to spend a lot to get to drive everything you want to drive.",1689821628,1689821628,False,2,1,0.47701147198677063,0,True,False,False

It was build special for Steering Wheel and the animation for hand on the steering wheel it looks very weird when you play with controller. So the developer instead to try to fix the animation they just add an option in the settings to hide the hand or / and the Steering Wheel.

I want to give it a no... maybe even....... BUT... it did it's job... Like.. ABS and TC atleast if i switch it on and off my theoretical knowledge transfer over to here ... so yea

ahahaha okay so its been what.. 3 years? 2? idk.. 

Anyway.. they bumped up the price in 2019? 

so the performance was shit.. when i had 29 cars on the track. dropping to 10 helped. its 60fps now. tho its busting my 1060 6gb's kneecaps at the moment. I had to put everything on low.. and then it fucking asks for 100watts on a 50-65% used gpu? what the fuck? Well that makes the game just .... stop for a second before it can rev up again..
and it has a 1/3 chance of WORKING. and sometimes i shuts my GPU down so I have to restart
So bad... but in a different way now....... but better than before

So i had a chance to try out the gameplay...like test gameplay wise and not just go around in circles breaking and overshooting and giving up.... and then just forgetting its a sim memorizing how much speed to do cause fuck racecars. and get time... Just to check graphics and cpu in practise and quck match

god i still need to test career mode. 


Basically it is a car sim... for sure... with the ABS and TC working as intended... If i switch it.. my tires spin when i break too hard to accelerate too hard respectively. 
which makes it cool.. gives my analog buttons on my joystick SOME functionality advantage  , ever since i bought it , over the keyboard. But then i just set it to max and welp.... I don't care i only play offline. 

but the car.. omg
I expected... A race car. The one that goes fast. turns fast.. Has insane cornering speeds cause its chassi makes the air push it down giving it more grip , which helps its turn faster 
:D :D 
OH ITS A SIMULATION ALRIGHT
its simulates my dad's FUCKING VAN FROM 1989 WITHOUT POWER STEERING
The santro had more fucking grip than THIS.... The HONDA CIVIC.. THE CASUALS FUCKING CAR.. HAS MORE TURNING SPEED! 
ugh omg... I can see another jester award from the fanatic cock thristy basement dwelling neckbeards who might as well get paid as much as the clickfarm in my country at this point 
(on an off note...who fucking does that? In LIFE? you don't play? you go around this 1 game's NEGETIVE REVIEW SPECIFICALLY... to give out jester awards?... WHO THE FUCK???) 

anyway yea.. its a realistic simulation of how me and my friends can buy stock cars from 2009 and race. 
which ... I mean... once you think of it THAT WAY.. Its pretty cool not gonna lie. its like a real race people can have.. And have that feeling of not just accelerating turning braking.. and nothing in between..... it feels like you might crash your very expensive car , even expensive hospital bills and insanely expensive insurance . 

I learn that when i basically kept going off track and i went ""WELL HOW HARD I CAN PUSH THE CAR THEN? THE AI SEEMS TO DO IT WELL AND BETTER THAN ME AND THE YOUTUBERS ONLINE JUST FEEL LIKE THEY DRAG THE CAR INTO THE CORNER BARELY BY THE LAST THREAD OF THEIR UNDERPANTS"" 

and i spectated the AI and felt ""wtf they are doing the same. did the players pick up the bad AI's bad habits""
then i watched the replay without the racing lines thing and tried to get a feel for when the AI brakes , how it turns and basically what that tells me about the car. If i understand one. I will understand the class of cars... Sort of like learning the pattern of what's going on. Rather than just 1 car. 

And it really did feel like the drivers were throwing the cars into the corners BEFORE the corner even came like they didn't trust their cars to make the slightest turns. Like if they had to get out of their apartment's gate they would need a runway's length of turn to make that possible and if that wasn't there , they would make 1 by cutting all the corners they could.

and i realise these GT cars aren't SHIT. They are regular cars

So i did 1 more race and that's when i learnt the obvious.. If you turn the car and it isn't turning as much as expected INSTANTLY. it isn't because turning is an Acceleration.. meaning it would EVENTUALLY turn faster.... That or...like Elite Dangerous . there was a Speed limit within which the car/ship turns with the max speed. Below it , its slugish . After it. There is no grip. So i had to hit the perfect speed. Which i Just couldn't .. nor could i understand why

It isn't turning as much as expected INSTANTLY because i'd already blown past the grip rating for the tires REGARDLESS of speed. And the slower the speed the more I can turn... Or rather the more range that turning will feel responsive cause im not ""understeering"" as in slipping on my front wheels and thereforenot turning just burning rubber on ground. Sideways.... the tire.. not the car. 

Meaning there was no need for me to hold a certain speed.
Now WHY did this false logic enter my head

Well cause of my entire reason for this rant ofc
I EXPECTED RACE CARS TO FEEL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT . What the hell is the point of going fast in a straight line. trains can do that . Planes can do that SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. So can horses but they atleast feel like a powerful thing. 
I thought ""OFC I AM DOING SOMETHING WRONG OFC.. NO WAY A MILLION DOLLAR CAR TURNS LIKE LEPROSY INFLICTED DEAD MEAT"" 

nope...

The moment your car turns slower than the amount your joystick is turned. Or Steering wheel if using KB+M i guess. the moment it feels like the car isnt turning like an f-22/Su-57 thrust vectoring jet in full force. You've blown past the limit
and the limit it turns out.... is insanely small.
which is why ofc.. the AI keeps throwing cars into corners way before the corner shows up.
As if the track designers tested every car on the planet for 25years.. Including the future... and then decided to purposefully make turns on EVERY CORNER smaller than the normal turning radius of cars at normal speeds , forget racing speeds

that or... What i suspect is the true cause
ofc a Van , honda civic and a Santro Hatchback i think they call it... Can't outturn a GT car. 
The problem is the sense of speed.
its been an issue for so long.
Im doing 200km/hr and it felt like i barely even spedup. I feel its cause of the rendering logic. 

90km/hr 25mtr/sec. does look fast and scary. 200 barely even registers. 

Alright something is off. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5txHl5mrWUY
Replicating that had me learn.the joystick is pointless the visual turn of steering wheel matters.
MORE TESTING
who fucking looks at how much their steering turns. and not just trusts how how much they turn their joystick
all options add acceleration. Which is bad. i want control not.. 1 , 5, 25 , 2500. 
its like they compel you to buy a steering wheel. So fuck it. i'll never do that. Even if i want to




Its like.. okay? anytime you have a problem just think of a bicycle. and how the braking would work
too much power. not enough grip.. I would like to turn faster

going after old man enzo's heart. im sure he'll come out of the grave saying bellisimo to the devs
they both care about the customer about the same
they don't

its like regular cars. Why would i buy something i already have IN REAL LIFE

Anyway i wanted to give it a negative but at the end. There is something to play with. There is AI. I did end up solving most graphics issues. There is a campaign..
and  most importantly. I actually felt like i learnt something and it wasn't just cheese or unfair nonsese that if ofc beatable cause im human but it would be like work. 
i can probably spend a few hours perfecting the turning speed thing... and the push it and drag my car into the corner at the last second by the thread of my underpants like all the rest of humanity and AIs made by them. and it would be fun not guesswork...work 

SERIOUSLY controller players. turn off rumble. your brain can simulate more than it ever will

This is the best simracing game to play with a controller (you need a good one; PS5/Xbox's are great).

The way you can feel the vibrations of the track and the car's stability through your controller in this game is unprecedented in any other simgame. It's incredible; you can sense exactly when you start to lose control, when your tire is degrading, or even slight elevations on the track. Moreover, all of these vibrations feel distinct in your hand.

The handling is utterly amazing. You can feel the weight of the wheel; the car responds to any feedback and you can truly sense it. The camera feels great off the car and really good on it (almost perfect in some cars, not as good in others). Both front cameras offer Gran Turismo-level quality (which, in my opinion, is the best in any ""simracing"").

The sound. I can't deny it's close to the real thing, but perhaps due to the mechanical precision of the car in the game, I think the sound team couldn't keep up with the level of detail it should have. It can get a bit unpleasant when you're using too much Traction Control or ABS, but nothing unbearable.

Tracks. All of them feature laser scan fidelity, which is crucial for a simracing game. The 3D work on the tracks is not perfect. In my case, I don't mind that, so it's a minor issue for me, but I understand that's not the case for everyone.

DLC. Most of these are worth it. They usually come with a major update, which is nice for getting some people back into the game. As of writing this, I own 4-5 DLCs, and I don't think any of them were not worth it. Each one has at least one good car or great track, but there are some less impressive cars here and there, yes.",1603195981,1688258536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many have already said it; graphics, bugs, physics and sound design are NOT this games problems apart from wonky VR.  

You pay 40 euro's for the full game, for this you get 11 track in just one configuration (?) and around 22 free cars in multiplayer while 25 of them are locked behind a paywall.  

No problem you say to yourself, this game is not FH5 with 5 million 'meh' cars but focuses on a rather niche part of the total racing world while making it the best experience there is.. works great and all is well. 
You start racking up a better safety score to play competition, 10 hours later you qualify for it, only to find out that you have to buy a damn DLC pack to even play it?! ('THE IGT DLC IS REQUIRED TO JOIN, BUY NOW ON STEAM') 

In my experience the game does not have a big player base. At the time of writing, 1133 players and 10 quick join candidates are available, 810 are out of reach due to track medals (which can only be obtained by the f*cking competition server + dlc pack) and 510 by means of safety ratings. In and of itself is's probably fair enough, the scoring system seems decent apart from the occasional: 'Lap time invalidated, you did magic', 'Crossed track limits, you touched a grass pixel', 'Penalty, you get a DNF for not knowing you had to pit' and 'Someone hit you so here is your reduced safety score' kinda thing. 

Even if you get a full online lobby, it is always the same Monza track in daylight with perfect conditions and that is that.. try to increase the probability for another track or different weather conditions/more realistic rules and disappointment will set in.. at most you'll find five players to do a race with. (before three of them quit in the middle of a race because they are last) 

It remains ridiculous that a full decked out game like this, with all the DLC's, costs, a full-priced 140 euro's. (12,99+17,99+10,99+12,99+8,99+19,99+14,99+40) Why price the game at 40 bucks when only 30 percent of the 'content' is available upon buying it? 

Kunos, you make great games and this one is no different technically wise, but f*ck you for triple dipping your c*ck in anyone's wallet for no good reason. 

To this day, the original Assetto Corsa remains more popular/fun and with good reason: that game is actually affordable/configurable, offers a wide range of cars/tracks and has a good/experienced player base behind it. Oh, has it been mentioned that it still receives updates?! Go out and buy that one instead if you need a realistic sim experience.

Do not buy this game unless it is on sale, even if you buy it on sale, expect only a small part of the already little substance it has to offer.",1663943900,1687604996,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having that said, I've never seriously dabbled into a real sim like ACC, mostly because I don't own a wheel, but since it's on sale today I figured why not. I'm happy to report that it's very much playable with controller if you're just a casual driver. You might not be as fast as the fastest wheel drivers out there, especially if you use steer assist, but if you're just looking to have a good time, this game can be a lot of fun. I recommend getting the GT4 DLC if you're new to sim racing. GT4 cars are slower than their GT3 counterparts so you'll have an easier time learning the ropes with them, but they're also super fun to race with. Keep in mind that most people only race GT3 cars online, so you'll probably only get to use your GT4 cars in singleplayer.

These are my controller settings (found these somewhere on Reddit). I've found these to be really smooth. I play with stability assist off, and TC and ABS on. Increase your TC/ABS levels if you keep spinning out. Do a few test laps on your favorite track to get a feel for the cars, and be gentle on the steering if you're on controller.

From the moment I dove into the immersive world of GT3 racing, I was captivated by its stunning attention to detail and unparalleled realism.

The graphics in Assetto Corsa Competizione are simply breathtaking. The meticulously crafted tracks and beautifully rendered cars make every race feel like a true spectacle. Whether it's the gleaming sunlight reflecting off the sleek machines or the dynamic weather effects that challenge your driving skills, the visual fidelity is second to none.

But it's not just the visuals that shine in ACC—the driving experience is where this game truly excels. The physics engine is so intricately designed that you can feel every nuance of the car's behavior. The way it grips the track, the weight transfer during braking and acceleration, and the subtle feedback through the force feedback steering wheel—all of these elements combine to deliver an unparalleled sense of immersion.

ACC goes beyond just being a simulator; it captures the essence of GT3 racing. The attention to detail in the car models, the accurate sound design, and the comprehensive race weekend structure create an authentic racing experience. From practice sessions and qualifying rounds to heart-pounding multi-hour endurance races, the game offers a comprehensive and satisfying motorsport journey.

The multiplayer aspect of ACC is also a standout feature. The competitive online races, with their real-time weather and day/night cycles, bring an extra level of excitement and challenge. The matchmaking system ensures fair competition, and the active online community ensures that there's always someone to race against. Myself race a lot with LFM (Low Fuel Motorsports) and the competition there is absolutely amazing and fair. 

Moreover, the developers have demonstrated a commitment to improving the game over time. Regular updates and patches have addressed bugs, added new features, and expanded the content (I am racing with update 1.9 at the moment). The level of support and engagement from the development team is truly commendable.

In conclusion, Assetto Corsa Competizione is an exceptional racing game that sets new standards in the genre. Its breathtaking graphics, unrivaled physics engine, and authentic racing experience make it a must-have for any motorsport enthusiast. Whether you're a seasoned racer or a newcomer to the world of GT3 racing, this game will undoubtedly leave you in awe. Strap yourself in, hit the track, and prepare for an unforgettable racing experience!""

— Physics-wise, it's better than the first game.
— Graphics-wise, it's better than the first game.
— Sound-wise, it's better than the first game.
— I don't believe there's a better racing simulator (I haven't tried iRacing, rFactor 1/2 or Project Cars 1/2 yet).

The bad:
— Significantly smaller car selection, compared to the first game (all cars here are GT cars and I didn't find a single car with a manual transmission; and, oh boy, I really love using that manual gear shifter! (flappers don't count)).
— DLCs here are mostly licensed racetracks and are quite pricey.
— Mod-unfriendly (unlike the first game).
— The damage model is still a f°kken joke. If a car doesn't break as a real car (at least approximately) would, this definitely has consequences about the way a person drives in this game (e.g. you don't care about your car in ReVolt, because it's basically invincible, so you drive like a madman; and that is precisely why ReVolt is not a simulator).


There exists a game that introduces this last really important part of reality, and it's called BeamNG.drive. So, my recommendation would be to get the old Assetto Corsa and BeamNG.drive and wait for Assetto Corsa 2.

Obviously the car handling is a lot more punishing than in GT7, but what surprised me the most was the absolute lack of assistance when it came to understanding how much fuel you need, or how you need to setup you car before a race. On top of that, all of the cars handle very differently, so it is important to try a few different ones in search for one (or a few) that you enjoy to drive. 

Now that I've gotten past those obstacles, I find playing ACC to be a very rewarding experience. The AI is excellent, and can be tuned both in skill and aggression. If you feel secure enough, you can join a league or try your luck in skillbased matchmaking. I strongly recommend downloading Crew Chief (its free) so that you get a proper race engineer and spotter to give you callouts during races.",1683394757,1683394757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Completely leaky car setups have absolutely nothing to do with physics.

I don't say anything about the brake at all - its easier to put it on the button and not think about what trail at all.

HAVE to downshift to 1st gear on every turn to even cut a corner. Breaking and accelerating with the keyboard puts you at an automatic disadvantage, it's immediate 10000000000% to the throttle because why? Keyboard!! When you break you don't get the full breaking power, why? Because keyboard!! No break/gas pedals and no wheel make you feel like its your first time driving again. Compete trash game with no wheel.

Also the GT cars are great and there are some major tracks in the game.

Bad points are there doesnt seem to be any AI mistakes or them getting mechanical damage that I have seen to date, so races can be a bit dull, the AI can ram you from behind if you get in their way. The rear view mirror is really laggy and pixellated - this is by far the worst thing about the game, I absolutely hate it.

It is a toss up whether this or AMS2 are the better racing game - AMS2 provides far more variety and exciting racing with better graphics and faster framerates, whereas this game has better AI generally, better GT cars, some really good tracks, plus really good wet track and rain graphics.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game due to the fact that it can be a ton of fun, but at the same time extremely unforgiving.  This game will take your lunch money, throw you in the mud and take your girl all in one afternoon.  It can also be very rewarding when you get it just right.  I am what I consider a slower pace racer, usually between 10th and 20th for qualifying, but I have also learned so much.  I watch racing, I enjoy racing, but I never got into the mechanics of it, like set ups, camber, tow, blah blah blah... This simulator makes you pay attention to all the little details that go into winning a race.  If you load in, don't bother with set ups then don't expect to beat anyone.  The top racers here are the best at what they are doing.  
A lot of people complain about the force feedback, but again, you have to adjust settings depending on what equipment you are running.  I have used several wheel and pedal combos and the set ups are all different.  You have to find your sweet spot and that takes time.  The games visuals are stunning, smooth frame rate, audio is amazing, (I love all the little creaks and squeaks of the car, engine, road...) and for the most part the community is amazing.  You will always have your crashers but some of that is just inexperience.  
If you enjoy GT class cars, this is THE simulator for you.  If you want to invest your time and really become a better racer, this will teach you.  You WILL struggle at first, don't give up, and when you get that first win, it feels amazing!!!  Now, get out there and have fun!

I got this game because it allows you to play in vr. The vr performance is not great but i like the immersion. I use a controller to race because i dont have $300 to spend on a wheel/pedals and this game is particularly horrible with its default settings. the steering and breaking are too sensitive and often fuck u(you can change this but most people dont care too). Next: the piss poor set up tab. if you have any experiance in racing then set up is key but this game just does nothing to educate its community on how to use all of the settings and options. So if you dont have any experiance with that stuff then good luck. the basic setup it gives feels like your ass slides any time you really try to turn. 
AND now the beef that i have with the game...
The game it basically tag team racing where you have several drivers drive the same car and switch when you pit. I am running 40 min races. i play the WHOLE race and LEAD the WHOLE race cause the AI are slow as fuck on some tracks but are unbeatable on others(on 1 difficulty). I go into the last set of corners of the race and i spin and basically cut the next corner by going throught the grass during my spin so i just get on the track and continue thinking maybe i get a 5 sec penalty at max 10 right? WRONG. I get teleported to the pit lane and it says controls locked 2 min. so in the final 200 meters of the race i get fucked by the half assed rules in the game... i could wreck the entire field and get 0 penalty but i cut a corner 2 min time out and all that work gone.. my 1st place was taken by the bot that was 15 sec behind. 

the AI are follow the leader kind of racing AL very little passing or action its single file line racing but when you spin on track they dont move nothing they plow ur ass and dont give a fuck they will stick to that racing line like cocaine. what makes this worse is multiplayer is non existant i checked all race class lobbies and found a grand total of 17 people in online lobbies... truely heart breaking. 

i hope to find a good vr racing game with advanced AI and multiplayer lobbies

edit update: I have since purchased a logitech G29 then upgraded to a fanatec environment(CSL elite pedals, formula v2.5 wheel, and GT DD pro mounted on a playseat(fuck that company)) and have put several hundred hours across several titles and it has completely changed the genre for me. 

i still do not recommend this game to people who want to race casually, the F1 games are more forgiving, as most people i have raced with in multiplayer is about my pace maybe a little slower(i have top 5% time trial times on all tracks in F1 22 so im no slow boi) so these guys are FAST. the people who are significantly better are insane. they consistantly do 1-3sec better lap times than I can. Multiplayer is only really active on weekend days and usually on a hand full of tracks. After spending probably 40 hrs doing research on setups and all that I am starting to understand what to do and look for while driving but this is an advanced level driving skill beginners will be hard pressed to complete clean laps let alone consistantly drive at a pace to be able to detarmine what the car is doing. Just know you are as fast as the amount of time you put into understanding you car.

multipalyer: this game is one of 2 games that i will say that you RAREly see unsportsmanlike driving(like indentional crashes) and the other is iracing. I have only been wrecked on MAYBE 3-5 occcasions. People are usually very respectful of the space and leaving it for other drivers and when stuff does happen usually multiple players will speak up and tell the offending driver to get their act together. the only downside here is on week days the multiplayer can be unpopulated although they have daily compitention servers you need 80 safty rating to be able to praticipate which takes a long while to get when driving clean. the BEST part of ACC is the fact it is a GT racing game, only 1 class, therefore everyone playing only races GT and on a handful of tracks so most people know the braking points where to pass ect. It makes for racing that has much fewer incidences and more racing. you love to see it.

i have a friend that i am walking into sim racing i got him my G29 and we started iracing and regret it as it throws you into the thick of it. ACC guides you into the game and shows you a little about how to race and gives you the tools to be albe to improve with metrics and telemetry. I wish my friends sim racing learning experiance was in this setting and not the can be demo durby that is iracing",1634341731,1680726629,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The problem with that, at the start you have no rating, and are thrown in with all the rammers and sore losers who punt you off for overtaking them. And then YOUR safety rating gets penalised for it, condemning you to open lobbies that are seen in arcade games where its just a survival simulator.

Physics and Graphics wise, its brilliant, but I can enjoy it with the online player base.

So many improper driving. players have weak skills even in high SA such as 70 75. And people think they are right in every situation. Plus public servers are so unfair. They prevent you from playing the game. (ban system) but people are purchasing this game and paying dlc extra money. Nonsense. if i wont be able to play this game why do i purchase. Server's admins can ban you for no reason or if you gave answer that they didnt want to hear even you said it in a kind way you can be banned. in according to my experiences i don't recommend this game if you want to play in Multiplayer mode but its your decision try and see. Singleplayer mode is good graphics are satisfying.

The online is complete DOG shit because player can't drive for shit they don't know what a blue flag or fair racing is they will block you in a race or qualy and in a wheel to wheel battle they will full on push you off. But it's the only decent sim that dosen't cost 200$ to have a full experience so i would recommend it to you if you want to have fun in GT3 racing but if you want to play and have a decent experience you will need a ton of patience (that i don't have) to get 99 SA and do some good racing Kinda so your call. UPDATE: i now play Iracing the online experience is 10x better the only problem is the price but you can actually have fun in open lobby's. the best time to buy iracing is wen the steam sales are up i paid 23 Eur for 6 months for a car is 10.50 Eur and for a track is 12-13, so if you can spend money for a better experience you should consider buyng iracing other wise ACC is your best bet. UPDATE: Iracing is shit aswell just go play minecraft it's onestly better for your well being UPDATE: ok after almost 100 more hours i do think ACC is the most viable SIM out there in terms of price and content. Tho i have to point out that the in game rank system kinda sucks and the only way you can play competitively is by using LFM (LowFuelMotorsport) it gives a competitive aspect to the game that can not be achieved in the vanilla game, the service is completely FREE.

I’m not saying it is the best, I just see Forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe that's an unfair or unbeatable advantage. I don’t think that, given the proper work to convince me.

Here’s inside the British and both GT3 and GT4 cars including the tracks of its respective events, and of course its drivers. More about that down the review because of the DLCs, this isn’t exactly a slideshow of “civilian” cars; I love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars, filled with corpo decals, rather than fantasy racing running all naked. Given that, naturally the game abides to Blanpainc rules and regulations. You can race casually, but this isn’t one of those games.

Steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there, even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it, still I have never experienced this before and you can impress other game’s drivers. Everytime I run Assetto Corsa Competizione I can almost smell the gas, if it wasn’t for a few things that still aren’t quite there but hopefully will one day. If you’re interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery, random npcs or how good the grass looks, you got another thing coming. The graphics didn’t impress me and screen shot “cinema hud” options are weird to work with.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513870458

Those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance. What the driver is really interested in after buying; emulation, simulation, steering - I emphasize that part, and competition with all that in motion. But if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide, they gotta work more on the outtern details too, more immersive particle effects. That screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place, that impacted my final scoring in this review.

My first phase testing with the Lamborghini Youngster Programme was humiliating, as if I have never been behind any steering wheels. Yes I had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro, but once I returned it, I had to readapt myself with a Xbone joystick - but don’t think this limited me, I managed to program it for the level of realism I like even with a joystick.

After taking care of my control situation, I decided to tweak my black demon. They give you a Huracàn Super Trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat, demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed. The devs decision to start the career at Monza was just too right.

So instead of 60 liters - the default fuel quantity they give you, I deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters, super basic but we tend to forget about these - because the game isn’t interested in doing everything for me which is great. Easing pressure, caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila, I could finally reach third to last position (better than last position) and with better knowledge I started climbing the ladder. I’m more interested in learning through experience and readings, but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up.

The dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical, so realistic, I could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather, to experience that for the first time in my gaming life - ever. Guys like Ayrton Senna in the F1 category for example and so many others.

The fight is different during the rain in the real world, your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced. Little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires. A driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet, not just water puddles because it is more complex than that - the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should. ACC proved me I’m a rainy racer, having greater time results whenever Jupiter is angry.

That doesn’t mean the casual should avoid it, but I’m afraid they would rather play something else, Competizione still can be tough even on easier modes. The setup isn’t like Dirt Rally 2.0 for example, with bars to slide around even on advanced setups (you’d see bars but it’s different) you either know what you’re doing or you do not. It is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it, experimenting, but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if you’re out of place. There are only a couple of basic pre-settings, but very often they’re not enough, just a rough bet for the things you’re going to face.

The hud seems overwhelming at first but you can remove things. I don’t recommend that because the devs thought about everything, even swapping colors in the speed meter when you need to shift but got no time to look at it, meant to alert your peripheral vision.

I don’t own any VR and no hero in my vicinity does, can’t rent around here either so you won’t have my views on that, as ironic as it sounds. There is a camera angle you can choose like a first person view from inside the helmet, but I don’t see much bobblehead physics, maybe it wouldn’t work? There is no gravity simulation shaking that camera angle nor when I brake too hard and I think simulation should start thinking about that.

[olist][*]The crowd people are what we call “cardboard audience” here where I live, very outdated. When the crowd is 3D (npcs from the pitstops for example) they’re badly animated. We’re not in 2006 anymore, so please.

[*]Rain sprites droplets are nasty, like most frames based graphics in this game are and it needs updating. It isn’t better, not even in “epic” settings. More particles are needed too.

[*]Not so rarely, impact sound effects are just repetitive even when you’re performing something else not related to that. You’d hear some clanks and bumps when not clanking nor bumping, although minimal it is undermining the attention to details it already has.

[*]Artificial intelligence does suffer from the conditions of the track, but it could be better. Most super simulated games only think about you and your sweaty fights. AI needs to be prone to mistakes more often, maybe some sort of fear-factor and stress like humans do. I don’t know how the hell they would do it, but it is awful to see that they don't do much.

[*]The game demands more identity, and the career mode is the way to do that. You’re welcomed by pilot Mirko Bortolotti himself trying to warn/prepare you for what is about to come, then not much is shown, game needs more style. Not just cosmetics but further expansion of career mode. I just think details aren’t enough to rival other games right now.[/olist]

About DLCs It could have been worse but they removed Imola circuit from the base game. Placing immortal classic circuits in different packs is as bad as car packs. They compressed it with little decency left, should stop increasing it as the base game isn’t really that cheap either.

In the game, the damage model is not as realistic as it could be, allowing toxic and idiotic racers to continue a race even after ruining everyone else's race. This can lead to frustrating game play experiences, especially in online races where reckless drivers can cause significant damage and ruin the fun for others.

One of the major issues with the damage model is that it does not accurately reflect the impact of collisions. Collisions that would cause significant damage in real life often result in only minor damage in the game, while minor collisions can cause substantial damage. This discrepancy can lead to frustration for players who expect a more realistic damage model.

Another problem is that the game does not always penalise drivers for reckless driving. While the game does have penalty systems in place, they are not always effective at discouraging reckless driving. As a result, some players continue to drive recklessly, causing damage to other players' cars and ruining the race for everyone involved.

Overall, Assetto Corsa Competizione is an excellent racing simulation game, but the damage model is a significant flaw. The game's developers should consider updating the damage model to make it more realistic and effective at discouraging reckless driving. Until then, players should be aware of the potential for toxic and idiotic racers and approach online races with caution.",1676475438,1676475438,False,164,44,0.634047389030456543,0,True,False,False

I honestly thought that regular assetto corsa with CSP, pure, sol, and all that jazz was going to be as close to real life as I could get, but something about acc feels even better. Hitting curbs is less forgiving and will actually knock your suspension out of wack and slow you down. The cars feel more lively too, idk. I just wish they can implement this engine and physics model for all cars in AC2 rather than just gt3 and gt4 cars. Because i prefer to race track built street cars, and even have my exact car built part for part in AC1

Graphics: So i only play in VR. And wow i’m really surprised i was able get this game to run stable while looking better than AC1. And i have AC1 built up to the absolute max with every csp/pure option maxed out that is compatible with vr. Using 3060ti. The only issue i have is the blurryness/sharpness in the distance. CSP has that perfected in AC1. I’m using Vrperfkit3.0 for this as well and it didn’t seem to help. All that helps is increasing pizel density to like 110% but i don’t want that performance hit.

So yeah, my only recommendation is to fix AA for vr and just keep up the great work as you guyd build AC2. Goodluck!",1676023968,1676023968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also if your a beginner you need to learn about psi n basic car setup! tho saying that there are lots of video guides on youtube n the in game setups will get you up n running tho the tyres need to be adjusted to suit the conditions to get the best results.

This game does not support shifter, H- shifter. The cars are not manual in that way. lol 

People here will say: Why would you want a H shifter, you would be alot slower?
My answer is: Because it boosts the driving expierence for common folks out there by insane amount. 

I couldnt refund this game because I bought it months before I unpacked my whole steering setup. This was supposed to be one of the realist sims out there... for a guy that doesnt follow the pro circuit, I couldnt grasp how a game of this magnitude doesnt support a simple shifter. Aparantly thats what pro racing is all about these days. 
For all the old school people I would recommend dirt rally, aparantly that game is realistic and shifter friendly.

Works well with most common wheels and brakes. Personally I am using fanatec v3 pedals with thrustmaster tx wheel before and now the fanatec dd.
The VR support is not so optimized speaking to the performance and image quality, but playable.
No rewind is a plus for sim racing, push you really concentrate on the racing without making mistakes.

The only downside is the people online and the AI system, so many Torpedos!! The AI is not fast enough and intelligent enough, when you race wheel-to-wheel with AI, they are stupid and would push you out. 

So far, if you would like to learn the racing and would like to treat the racing seriously, the best sim racing game I would recommand!

TLDR: Small car selection but very detailed. Good selection of tracks with alot of favorites. Works great with quest 2 vr. Fantastic physics. Feels good on gamepad if you're on a budget like me. Small game (only 15 gigs). 100% recommend especially if you can get it on sale.

As a heads up ACC is focused purely on GT3 and GT4 ( gt4 added with gt4 dlc pack) so the car list is relatively small compared to other games in the space. With that said the cars that are in the game feel absolutely incredible with each one having a unique identity from one another and an insane level of detail in both visuals and how they drive. 

Visually it’s what you can expect from a modern racing title: It looks gorgeous. As mentioned before the cars have been recreated in incredible detail and the same goes for the tracks you’ll race on. From the weave of carbon fiber on the wings to the LED’s in the headlights no stone has been left unturned. 

As far as how the game feels it does a great job of communicating where the weight of the cars lie, as well as how hard you can push the cars on cold brakes and tires vs when their warmed up. The cars also have a good sense of weight to em so don't expect to take every turn at full speed or sideways like it's need for speed, though you will end up backwards if you're not careful. 

If you're looking for immersion past the monitor ACC has you covered with both wheel support and VR. I can't speak on how the force feed back feels as I use a controller, but as far as VR goes it's a great addition. I use a quest 2 via quest link ( connected to pc over wifi) and it was a very smooth experience that furthers the great sense of speed this game already has. 

I'd recommend a hefty pc if you're planning on using VR as I did have stuttering issues and had to lower my settings, but thankfully not enough where it would compromise immersion. Game starts at max in vr so if you're having stuttering issues I'd take a look at what you're settings are. 

All in all this is a fantastic sim to jump into especially if you’re just getting into the scene. It might not be the best bang for your buck as it’s limited to GT3 and GT4 however I’m not sure if you’ll find a better representation of these cars anywhere else. There is a bit of a learning curve, but if you stick with it it’s a ton of fun.

 As a final note if you’re worried about being locked out of racing because of DLC, as of  the time of writing the only one that’s required is the intercontinental GT Pack (which imo is 100% worth it as it’s composed of 4 fantastic tracks that are racing favorites) for competitive ranked racing. Otherwise the open multiplayer is usually racing on tracks that are already in the game so you won’t have issues there unless you’re looking to race in GT4 cars. With that said I’d still recommend picking up the GT4 pack and Intercontinental GT pack especially if you can get them on sale.

The tire model though pretty good has such a tiny window for recovery from over driving once the tires break loose you basically just hold tight and wait for it to stop there is no degree of slip at all.

A pretty complete GT3 and GT4 experience.
Pretty good physics and adequate FFB. Update 1.8 added much but still somewhat inferior to Rfactor2.
Great reproduction of tracks. Standard of tracks and cars more uniform and often better than what's found in Rfactor2.
Pretty good telemetry support, works well with MOTEC. Some variables are missing by design, which detracts from the experience.  Setup is VERY important for on-track performance. Setup interface is more user friendly than RFactor2. Monthly challenges are motivational and great practice for online races (that demand proper setup, fuel management, tyre management and an eye to changing weather)

Cons:
Safety Rating system not very well developed, so cannot recommend online racing on public servers. Both players involved in contact get penalized for any accident, regardless of whose fault it is. This makes it hard to accumulate safety rating to get access to servers that actually race clean, and once you accumulate it you are wary to get docked.I will admit that the official competition servers which requires high safety rating races somewhat cleaner that the rubbish public servers.

Car control and consistency rating are nice learning tool, but discourages practice with new cars, tracks and setups if you care to maintain you overall rating. It drops rather quickly unless you drive perfect from the getgo. Then you have to grind your best track in your  main car to get it back up. Edit: Ratings can be suspended from options menu, which solves this problem. Edit2: Oh yes, turning of ratings disables recording of your fastest laptime. Why is that? How come active ratings are  a prerequisite for documenting fastest lap? I mean, the hotlap functionality is completely unrealistic, the car resetting damage, tyre wear, temperatures, minimal fuel load every lap. Show some consistency here, kunos.

Verdict: Great ambiance. Complete GT-package with cars and tracks. Physics and FFB much improved since launch, but still somewhat inferior to Rfactor 2. Fair competition servers. Godawful safety rating system.  Deplorable public servers.

Edit 2022: Changed recommendation from ""NO"" to ""YES"". Not perfect, but the most complete package for drivers interested in GT3. 

Edit 2022 v2.0 - Safetyrating system still broken. Changed  recommendatino to NO.

Edit 2022 v3.0 - Safetyrating stiill very much broken. Safety rating hovering in the mid-90, you get docked nearly 1 full point of safety rating per contact, regardless whose fault it is. Every single point may take several hours of ""work"" to recoup. Unacceptable, and very much a detriment to enjoying this otherwise good simulator.  The  REAL GT3 world challenge championship is awarding way less penalties for contact during real-world races.This along with superior physics makes Rfactor 2 a more attractive proposition for both sim-racer purists and  gentleman racers. When will Kunos learn?

Edit 2022 V4.0. Yep. Safety rating still broken. Now high 80s after a high watermark at mid 90s. I got replays showing me on the racing line, driving in predictable manner and being tapped by AI trying to overtake. Single contact results in multiple OBWPs further docking my rating through no fault of my own. Disgusting.",1573758355,1671573043,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: 2022. Finally managed to buy an RTX 3080 and this game is now playable in VR on high settings. Still leaving a negative review though as the visual quality still gives me eye strain and  the fact it's taken 2 years after buying it before I can actually play this game due to the extremely poor optimization. Minimum specs for VR (which are ridiculous) should have been stated people. 

All my other racing sims (RaceRoom, iRacing, rFactor 2, Project Cars 2, AC) can run pretty much maxed out with a 3080 and look and perform so much better in VR than ACC does.",1612785909,1671466710,False,4,1,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

The game allows for a fascinating degree of control over the car through playing with it's balance. It's hard to get, but once you start to feel it, the game opens up greatly and you discover more and more points where you can improve your lap times.

native multiplayer kinda sucks but some sessions are good
overall a good product.

Now to voice and vent my frustrations on this Genre called SimRacing. I hate it. It's boring and limited, You're only driving GT3 and GT4 cars specifically for this game. The game is constantly looking over shoulder during races and even practice runs on how you perform. This isn't fun. Sim Racing is already a Niche genre in an already niche genre. I prefer AC and Forza 5 currently for the SimRacing/Arcade Titles. 

AND Just in case some idiot thinks I don't play racing games, I've played more racing titles than most of you have been alive lol here are a FEW titles I'll grace you with across multiplatforms: 

NES: RC-Pro AM, Road Fighter, Micro Machines, 
SNES: Super Off-Road, F-Zero, Stunt-Race FX
PS1/2: Burnout Series, NFS Series, Ridge Racer series, Gran Turismo Series, Road Rash
Arcade: Initial D All stages up til 2021, California Rush, Rush 2039 or 49 I Can't remember.
PS3: Motorstorm, Split/Second, MTX VS ATV, Start of the Grid Series
PS4: OnRush is the only NEWEST IP and it got dropped, its the only title worth mentioning.

Edit: Thanks for the points for those giving the Clown Emoji. Since you guys wanna be clowns yourselves; How about you check the player count of this game VS AC and FH5?

GFX and sounds are flawless, cars behave like the real deal and the base package of the game gives you a great variety of stuff to race and do.
The DLC:s are not necessary, but I got myself the GT4 cars and EU tracks to boot, just because I love the MCL GT4 car.
This game is a great compliment to the ""other"" Simracers out there, but you need to remember that it's all about GT3 and GT4 is this game.
Haven't played that much online, but the games I ran was fun and friendly compared to ""other"" Simracers out there ;) You know what I talk about.

Great game, recommend it deeply for anyone into racing BUT, and this is really important; you NEED a wheel for this game, don't even try it without.

I have had this game since launch. For the first 2-3 years of the game I did a lot of single player AI races, as well as the occasional open lobby. I had fun playing this way for a long time. However, I always felt like I was missing out. None of my friends were into simracing, so it was just me. Summer of 2021 I joined a North American community and realized I had not really played the game proper yet. Racing with a good community brought some SERIOUS competition, and I saw myself get faster and faster every season. Now I am around 101% alien if I really grind a track. Find a community that fits you, and jump in. For the most part, simracers are very friendly and want new people!

Of course now you have LowFuelMotorsports that does hourly races, as well as endurance racing. It is set up a lot like iRacing. This is a fantastic option for you to find people around your skill level and just jump into a race.

Like any other simracing game, this game has some issues here and there. From a physics perspective, I think this game is among the best. I would say the weakest part of ACC are the curb physics. It isn't game breaking, but curbs seem to be more deadly than in real life. And also there is no floor damage, so yeeting curbs doesn't give you damage. Kunos has been good about BOP'ing cars, and trying to keep them balanced.

If you are into simracing, this game is 100% worth your money. This game has done nothing but improve since released. It is one of the cheapest games for competitive simracing.",1564251792,1670050911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The simulation is amazing and would be great fun, but good input for good simulation is only possible with dedicated hardware (e.g. steering wheel), otherwise it's like driving a real GT3 car with a GamePad, except gamepad support is not the greatest. This can be partially mitigate by using Steam Input, providing settings the game itself doesn't provide, but you cannot fully open up the game without a steering wheel. There are settings to tune steering input and after hours of painful tests you might finally find something that kind of works for you. Same for the gas, but it was even more painful for me and only Steam Input curve customization made it work in the end.

P.S. In my opinion Codemaster is already doing a great job killing the racing games, Please, Kunos, do not go down the same road. I believe most racers like a little challenge but want to relax and have fun racing.

For the controller racers, it is extremely challenging to race with a controller, so even though you maybe can pull it off, I would still suggest playing only on a steering wheel.

You can choose between a gt3 car that is older gen and new gt cars from the latest era(2022 and onwards). As a matter of fact a new championship, the 2022 one, has been added with the latest update. There's also gt4 cars that you can race on, coming with dlcs, and more, such as the Ferrari 488 gt3 challenge evo, the bmw m2 cs racing version and the list goes on. 
The physics are very true to what real gt racing feels like and the devs are working very closely with the teams/brands to produce an as close as it can get 1:1 picture. 
There's a variety of tracks(with dlc you'll get a track from almost any continent). The attention to detail can be observed at those tracks. Such could be the draining rails on kyalami or the bumps and sausages on Zolder. 
Updates come and go and 90% of the time they are quite meaningful(having to do with gameplay/bugs/ui etc).
If you are looking into more serious racing there are also leagues that you can take part. Some of the daily ones can be found at the LowFuelMotorsport site and on the pitskill.io site. You can participate weekly on some leagues that you can find on SimGrid,SRO and lots of other sites.

The wheel-to-wheel racing in this game is great too, the AI fights hard and mostly is fair.

I have been trying out other sims in last few months, I dont feeling the same about ACC anymore and updating the review.

Engineering Sim not Racing Sim - Tire temperature is a big deal in ACC, that's a barrier for me. You can't just hop in do a sprint, you have to do practice laps to get the setup right. You need to join a league to get quality races. It's fun to drive but too many hassles. There's no concept of fixed setup races. 

Setup Scam - There are paid setups from 3rd party, which is fine but ACC advertises them in-game with track side banners. You pay for the game, the game gives default setups and then markets paid setups by taking money from them, does ACC deliberately provide bad setups to make the paid setups better? 

Ugly - And the Graphics, I stopped playing it mainly because it looks grainy, out of focus, undersaturated and weird contrast. Modded AC1 looks better, it looked fine a year back, now it's all muddy.

The American DLC is another disappointment. 

AI is the worst among all Sims, they drive like they are following an Ambulance. 
The Career mode has not got updated Cars, you drive 2018 cars 4 years later. 


Old Review - 
Probably the best Sim Racing game out there. 
The handling is predictable, the sounds are great, the AI is professional. 
The Tracks are detailed, you feel the road like your do on a bicycle. 
You can even play it single player and save long endurance races to go poop. 
The rating system is well designed. too late to review already at 250 hours play time (which is actually on the lower side, should play it more).",1640601967,1668688633,False,1,1,0,2,True,False,False

I now prefer watching GT racing over all other motorsport. Made it to Oulton Park in 2020 when spectators were allowed. Oh and spent a week in the Ardennes on holiday in 2022...so I could watch the 24h of Spa... Now THERE'S a tangible marketing outcome!

Massive ""THANKS"" to everyone at Kunos, SRO, and anyone else responsible for developing ACC into the great package it is today. I appreciate AC2 will open the door to Prototypes, TCR, and the 'other' classic 24h tracks... Which I'm really looking forward to! But please consider having a skeleton crew keep the lights on at ACC until AC2 is in-service. I'm sure it would keep a lot of us happy :)

Gráficos: 
Bem feitos, não são o foco principal do jogo, porém não deixa a desejar.

Jogabilidade:
Mesmo com volante de entrada, é possível perceber a qualidade do simulador. É possível perceber facilmente situações onde o carro está saindo de traseira, por exemplo.
A física é muito bem explorada no jogo.

Iniciantes:
Assetto Corsa Competizione é bem amigavel com pessoas que estão tendo contato com o jogo pela primeira vez.
Existem diversas configurações bastante avançadas, porém do jeito que o jogo já vem default, é possível correr e se divertir bastante antes de mergulhar nos detalhes das configurações avançadas.

Corridas contra IA:
Fiquei bastante impressionado com a qualidade da IA.
Mais um ponto positivo para quem está iniciando nos simuladores. É fácil de alterar a dificuldade da IA e também é possível já ir praticando dirigir próximo dos outros carros sem atrapalhar outros pilotos reais das corridas online. 
Inclusive, saber dirigir próximo de outros carros sem bater é fundamental para quem quiser ir para as corridas online.

Corridas online:
Existem diversos servidores, muito bem organizados, que permitem a entrada nos campeonatos apenas para players que já tem nível superior de dirigibilidade, assim como também existem servidores para pessoas menos experientes (meu caso).
Dessa forma, é possível se divertir sem que players iniciantes ou avançados tenham conflitos durante as corridas por haver um gap muito grande nas skills.

Resumo:
Assetto Corsa Competizione é sem dúvidas o simulador de corridas ideal se você quer passar horas se divertindo com carros GT3 (ou GT4 se você comprar a DLC).
É um jogo cheio de possibilidades, não sendo enjoativo.
Recomendo, seja você iniciante ou avançado nos simuladores de corrida.",1668524692,1668524692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For reference, VR runs flawlessly with my Quest 2 on my system with other VR-compatible racing titles.

Seeing as I don't have a big monitor or a triple-monitor setup, VR is my best option for optimal FOV and immersion, so since ACC can't accommodate that, I can't enjoy it in its current state.

That being said, for users with a wide, curved monitor or a triple-monitor setup, I think you'll have a lot of fun. The physics, handling, and multiplayer lobby are great.

Kunos Simulazioni focused solely on GT World Challenge when developing this game, and they nailed it. This game immerses you in the sensation of driving GT3 cars on licensed tracks, and the physics, tyre performance, and sound design enhance this sensation.

Despite the fact that the regular version of the game is already outstanding, the DLCs are worth mentioning separately. Each DLC contains several new tracks or cars that I highly recommend checking out after you've gotten used to the basic cars and tracks. The game's balance allows you to win with basic cars, but there are several worthy tracks in add-ons, as well as a whole new class of GT 4 cars that are extremely fun to play with.

There is a large community surrounding the game, as well as public servers with high online, which offer great multiplayer opportunities.

Yes games like Forza Horizon 5 aren't as ""realistic"" but they offer more variety, and are just better overall games. If you are hardcore into simulations, this is for you. If you want a little bit of variety and not so much repetition, go elsewhere.

In the beginning, I missed the absence of achievements, but in a way, the ranking system are your achievments. The ranking system is a nice addition and it helps if you race online (since you can join servers with good safety ratings). Even if you're not the fastest, you can have some good battles in the mid-field (or behind). The AI seems good so far (no stupid crashes).

The Special Events are sometimes interesting. The career itself...mixed feelings. It's not bad, but in a way I miss season standings and stuff like that. It's all about earning medals and points. So most probably the normal championship may be the better solution once you finished the career.

--VR UPDATE - same rig but using the latest 'Opencomposite' (OpenXR) to remove the need for SteamVR I can now get rock solid 90fps with a full grid - It's worth the effort of setting it up and tweaking to get there--

Yes, it's really badly optimized for VR, and the unreal engine probably will never address this. No, I wouldn't recommend it in VR for anyone with less than a 3070 GPU or equivalent. Yes, the original Assetto Corsa running Sol looks better in many ways and runs far smoother never missing a beat at 90fps and high/very high settings...

But tweaking the settings down a little, and reducing anti-aliasing gets me to a place where I get zero frame drops, even on a 20 car grid start and reprojection mode looks better in ACC than many other VR games I play.

Once you get to this reasonably happy place you can finally start having fun; the driving model, sound design and force feedback are amazingly immersive. It's the little things, like the noise of the brakes as you leave it late into turn 1 at Monza, the sound of the chassis and car floor as you cut over a kerb that you really should have avoided and the feeling of the back end trying to get away from you on overcooked tyres.

The longer you play, the more you see the skill and effort that's gone into it. I'm just glad I persisted to get to a graphics setting that worked so that I can now appreciate why ACC gets the praise it does.

I fully intend on playing this game more in the future but based on my current experience with the game I would advise anyone playing on VR to steer clear of this game.

To recap my time with the game so far:
After 3+ hours of tuning the games graphics settings, watching multiple youtube tutorials, tuning my graphics card settings, tuning the oculus software settings, tuning my fan profiles, and overclocking my GPU the game is now just barely clear enough that I was able to complete the opening career assessment practice at Monza. Of course the very next part of the career mode had rain making everything a blurry unplayable mess again. Guess its back to tuning the graphics for me....

Silver lining though, the original assetto corsa, project cars 2, and dirt rally 2 (all of which had almost flawless performance right out the box btw) now look unbelievably gorgeous and I have a new found appreciation for a developers ability to properly optimize their game to run in VR.",1664242303,1664242303,False,34,8,0.679808259010314941,1,True,False,False

Game takes you seriously, perhaps a little **too seriously** It doesn't tell you anything at all to improve your game-play. There are ways to raise your rating and the game tells you to do it, but no way to achieve it unless you already have an idea on how to drive (hint: you dont). Trail braking, apex's, BoP? what's that? Something you'd already have to know or look up in a real driving guide. How to do setups? Forget it, you literally will need to take a college course on your own.  Which is odd, because the prequel did give you more explanations, apparently. And thats what makes it so fun. 100 hours in, im barely learning what aerodynamics and dowforce is, 50 hours ago, it was tyre pressure, 100 hours, ago, was trying to do  just 1 consistent lap without spinning out or locking up. This is definitely a great sim and one of the games of all time

ACC is the official SRO GT racing game, it focuses mainly on GT3 cars and tracks from the SRO championships. The base game has 11 track locations, DLCs add another 11 locations as well as additional cars. Unlike AC1 ACC doesn't support mods, but the overall quality of the game makes up for the lack of mods imo, and if you get base game + all DLC there's enough replay value to keep you occupied for a long time.

My PC specs: i7 4790, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 6GB, Windows 10 Pro. ACC looks really good at 1080p60fps but it can be demanding on hardware. I run with most settings on high and the game performs well with 30 cars on track. Sounds are also good. Controller support is really good (probably the best controller support out of all the racing sims I play), there's a few more options for customizing controls compared to AC1, I use my own custom controller settings and controls feel very responsive & smooth with my Xbox 360 controller, and controller vibration is very helpful to know when the car is losing traction or when I go too aggressive on the curbs. 

Handling of the cars is very consistent. Cars are challenging to drive on the limit but feel intuitive and predictable. Both safe & aggressive setup presets work well depending on car and track. All tracks in the game are laser-scanned and super accurate (track layout, elevation changes, curbs, trackside objects, etc). Since ACC is the official game of SRO GT racing it uses racing rules from that championship, meaning there's only timed races and no lap-based races, you have the option to have either 1 or 2 races per race weekend, and the option to enable mandatory pitstop. There's dynamic weather, full 24hr cycle, and track evolution. Career mode is very bare bones but there's custom championship. 
AI is good in terms of race pace but their racecraft is bad: they always block me in practice & qualifying during their outlap, and during races even with aggression on low setting I have to give them plenty of space otherwise they might hit me and push me off the track. Once you learn how to deal with them offline races against AI can be very challenging and fun.

Base game is short on content (especially tracks) but if you like GT racing you definitely should get the base game and at least all the track DLCs. The high quality of cars & tracks in the game makes this one definitely worth it imo.",1662599213,1662600775,True,5,0,0.507284879684448242,0,True,False,False

We all want to be max Verstappen except GT3 cars are easier to drive so we grab our pretend steering wheels and flock to circuits like spa-francorchamps and only spa because we're simps like that. We destroy each other on T1 and argue about who was to blame, we look for another lobby to sign in to, get destroyed at T1 again, have another argument and we f#%$ing love it.

Sometimes you avoid the first lap chaos and participate in what is commonly reffered to as a motor race. These moments are special and it's during these moments you see how good this game really is.

We all like to pretend we know how a real race car feels to drive then use our self perceived knowledge to judge racing games on accuracy, but realistically only a very small amount of people who have played this will have had a real life comparison point. They say it's pretty good so I'll take their word for it.

This game feels amazing to drive, I don't think there's another game avaliable right now which translates detail in car behaviour as well as this one does.

The detail sent to your hands through the force feed back, the sounds of not just the engine, the sound of your car reacting to every bump, curb, corner or even pebble put together with the visual experience is in my opinion unparalleled.

I've tried every major racing simulator I can get my hands on and ACC does the best job at making me feel like I'm driving a real car.

Back then it has been the norm to release well-polished product free of bugs and glitches, with all the content a user may want with no DLCs. That was then. Times have changed. Today the release of the new title brings the promise that the game will be finished in some vaguely defined timeframe. In most cases developers fail to meet the deadline and promises of incredibly immersive gaming experience never come true. Words are cheap. This is true with Assetto Corsa Competizione.

One may think that 4 years can be enough to hone and polish the game. Apparently, it's better to milk users by releasing car packs and track DLCs, than to make the game actually playable. It's just lazy attitude on Kunos part. The game is broken on a fundamental level and I am going to explain that in detail.

Broken physics.

ACC physics are worse than the original Assetto Corsa. Worse than RRRE, worse than BeamNG Drive, worse than original Simbin titles like GTR, GT Legends, Race and so on. rFactor 2 comparison is laughable.

Tires. Tire is the only physical object that connects the car to the road surface. The tire model has to be nailed 100%. Whole gameplay depends on that. You may have all the fancy gravity simulations, weight distribution and suspension kinematics, but with failed tire simulation all efforts in recreating real life physics are pointless. The grip is bad. While you can maintain some grip on a straight, keeping the car planted inside the turn is a gamble. To put it by Ermin Hamidovic's terms, it's like driving on calculations instead of the rubber. There's very vague distinction between rubber compounds (wet or dry). There's no feel of rubber whatsoever. No feel of contact points transferring your inputs, no feel of road surface, no feel of tire flex, nothing. You can't sense neither what front nor rear wheels are doing.

Cars in ACC have understeer problem and it feels like developers are not familiar with the concept of rotation. No matter what you do, you can't rotate the car inside the turn. Oversteer is present only in the form of severe grip loss. There's no ""in between"", it's either the battle to turn the car against all odds or 100% grip loss. 

Cars feel heavy. There's the distinction of weight distribution between front-engine, mid-engine and rear-engine cars — I give Kunos that, but the way the car reacts to steering input... The best analogy I can come across is Need For Speed. No kidding. In ACC you drive the same heavyweight refrigerators with wheels, but with added complexity on top.

The rating system.

Despite having single player career mode, ACC is meant to be 100% a multiplayer game, so Kunos developed complex safety rating system that collects the data from your inputs: trajectories, acceleration, braking, crashes, etc, on which the game builds up your profile for fair matchmaking. The track is divided in segments. Every segment gets the rating based on how clean was your driving throughout the section. Red, orange, yellow, green — the cleaner your driving is, the ""greener"" the segment will be. Ideal lap will have all the segments labeled green. The bad lap will have all the segments labeled red. You get the idea.

The problem with the system is that it punishes you for 1 wheel getting slightly off the track, by reducing overall score, but does nothing to punish you when you cut deliberately. For instance, in Zolder you can cut through 3 chicanes in a straight shot at 200 km/h. The game will give you ""green"" rating while displaying the message that the lap time will not count. In real life you'd get DSQ'd immediately for such bravery. In ACC I can cut through corners like nobody's business while gaining 10 seconds per lap. I can overtake the leader after flying into the gravel trap. All of the opponents may pass me by and I will still regain the lead later.

Kunos should stop embarrassing themselves by having a rating system effed like that. You can just compensate all the physics engine issues by ignoring to follow track limits. Easy-peasy: you will get 1st position at the finish line no matter what, just cut, cut, cut. Yes, your score will suffer, but hey, the 1st place is still the 1st place, who cares about those rules! Pity I can't turn NFS-style by flying into a wall @300 km/h.

By the way, no matter who's to blame in a crash event, both opponents receive the punishment. The game doesn't draw the line between light touch or the sheer ram fest. It doesn't matter if you're the victim of some toxic no-lifer behind the wheel or dumb AI, you will receive the punishment regardless. Which leads us to...

The dumbest AI ever.

Oh boy. These buggers don't recognize you on the track. They don't respect your trajectory and make no evasive maneuvers whatsoever. If you happen to be on their way, they will ram you hard. I can't remember AI in any gaming genre to be THAT stupid. Counter Strike 1.6 has bots more clever than that. With AI so dumb why bother with the career mode at all? When the AI car is in front of you, AI will deliberately slow down, so you have to smash the brake pedal. AI will deliberately send you into the barrier, AI will timewarp towards you if you happen to be too fast for the game. I'm getting strong Need For Speed vibes there. “Catch-up”. Sounds familiar.

Bugs.

You can drive through cars on pit lane, there will be no crash. The game sometimes has a will of its own: the game will push the gas and turn the steering wheel without you touching any controls. Gotta call my fellow exorcist to figure that out.

Missing functions.

The game doesn't give you the ability to assign the throttle and brake response (only brake power and bias can be altered in individual vehicles). I get that Kunos is proud of their simulation of real-life traction control system used in GT3 cars, but I want to fine-tune the throttle input the way I like, especially for the cars like Porsche 992, which has no TC. rFactor 2 and RRRE allow that. Also, hard-locked 3rd person camera is annoying as hell. Some free movement is a must for 3rd person view, because when the car loses traction, hard-locked camera may disorient the player trying to correct the slide. 80% of the time players use cockpit view, which Kunos nailed perfectly, but hey, it's still the game. Sometimes I want to get less claustrophobic gaming experience, because on the sim rig with only 1 monitor the peripheral view is limited and altering FOV to UWA messes up with the distance perception. I drive 50/50 cockpit/3rd person view. YMMV.

Internet security problem.

Recent DDOS attack on the server uncovers another area where Kunos cuts corners. Maybe they have this ""we're just a small company"" mentality, but when important race is being spoiled by DDOS attack, it's inexcusable.

For me this is a huge step up from the likes of Grid/Forza/Gran Turismo which I have spent many hours with before. 

It looks absolutely amazing and the handling and physics make a lot of other other racing titles feel poor in comparison.

Its good for single player vs AI/Hotlaps and online. It has a really good in game driver skill rating system to help you improve your driving skills. 

I have finally switched to cockpit mode since playing on bumper cam since the days of Ridge Racer on PS1 and its great.

Highly recommended.

I am reviewing this game from a purely VR perspective. Currently I would not recommend it to anyone for VR. There are some workarounds to gain a couple of FPS but sadly the choice of engine has clearly made this game exclusively a pancake game.

If you play on a monitor/monitors I highly recommend this title. The level of detail in graphics/sounds/physics is top notch. Plus you get a ton of content for a one time purchase, plus you get affordable DLC content every now and then. The work Kunos are putting in this title is great. 

What isn't great is the choice of engine and VR optimisation (or the lack of it).

With updates the VR performance has gotten better but I fear with how the game is built, there is a kind of a performance ceiling in unreal engine and it's implementation (or Kunos implementation).

For example the original tracks all are ok to run in VR with a lot of tinkering in the settings (and outside the settings for all kinds of openfsr/openxr/nvidia control panel workarounds) but when new content is released it is painfully obvious the new tracks do not have that same amount of polish/optimisation as the original tracks which have been updated many times over. So then you have to wait for Kunos to ""catch up"" and start working on optimising the new content.

Overall I am just very sad this game doesn't (and might never) run in VR properly. For the record I did get it running at around 60 fps but you have to sacrifice SO MUCH visual quality in terms of graphics details/anti-aliasing/render resolution it is simply making me sad. Especially when I go back to iRacing and it actually looks better to me and runs at a higher resolution? I mean, that game is like a billion years old and it looks better than ACC with all the graphics settings maxed out? So sad...

Maybe when I get a triple screen setup or an ultra-wide monitor I will play more but for now I do not recommend it for VR.

This is a great game, easy to get into but as complicated as you want to make it, I ditched automatic gears and ideal racing line after five minutes, but still using an automatic  clutch, it is customisable to to a level where you are comfortable with it and has easy to navigate menus which makes finding the right mode , track and car very easy (not always the case with racing games). Graphically it is a pleasure to look at and the physics feel right, feed the power in too soon coming out of a bend and feel that rear get squirrelly, fail to catch it and  you are in the gravel pointing the wrong way. Seven hours in I have only scratched the surface, but I already know this will be a long time favourite. Oh, forgot to say, it lets you practice any track with any car, none of that having to unlock tracks as you progress through a career!

In the beginning I brought you with my refund money for Cooking Sim VR as something i play in a stop gap before buying Iracing, but in the past few weeks i've grown to love you...

In the beginning I thought it was nothing much, i jumped into a single player race, felt the AI were okay and then found the M4 GT3 at the height of its OP(ness) and jumped straight online! I didn't understand anything and then left for Iracing... But that wasn't the end..

I've been slowly getting back into this game in the last 2 weeks, picking a car and just driving...

At first, sit in Practice by yourself, learn yourself! How you drive, what you need to change to be quicker with the car of choice, Right, you feel you're half decent, now look at a quick lap. Don't cry in a corner start looking into the setups, CHANGE TO BRAKE PAD 1 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! *ahem* Now see how the game makes the car faster round the track! Tire Pressures, Temps! aha, I have no clue... Now go ponder if you should buy a setup for a game you are really only just starting in... Bite the bullet and immediately love it!! Now you have some speed, now... Learn about Multiplayer...

See that SA is really important and then realise all public lobbies are death traps, along with all of them running Monza, T1 is genuinely the stuff of nightmares EVERY. GODDAMN. TIME... Somehow get to 80 SA and now start looking at orgs outside of ACC...

LFM, RCI...

You find the amazing drivers... Just be prepared to race the same track 15 times a day...

After ~200 more hours on record I am really enjoying it now. ACC is not a game for quick fun. You have to bite through the first 50 hours, look up the regulations for GT3 racing, learn how to find a racing line, learn how to brake properly, getting the tyre pressures right, learn how to savely(!) overtake others (or let others pass), ...

Edit: I have changed my review to negative, and I will continue to tell people not to purchase or sink any more time into it until Kunos fix their server issues.

Multiplayer is pretty much unplayable with hackers/skids finding ways into servers and crashing them.

There is no more point spending weeks and weeks of practice for a league/endurance race, it will only get DOS'd, and there is still no word on when the servers for the general public will be fixed. 

Our 7hr endurance race server was crashed TWICE by these people at the weekend. A race I put aside a whole day for, plus all the practice, time creating setups, pit strategies. All gone.
Needless to say, my frustration at the weekend woke up my new baby, and I am still in the doghouse for getting angry at a video game.

Kunos, can you fix your servers and explain to my wife it is your fault I was getting frustrated so I'm allowed back in the house?",1600150176,1656965720,False,3,0,0.536208271980285645,0,True,False,False

I originally thought that I was going to get bored with this game very quick seeing as it was only the GT World Challenge cars. However, I was sorely mistaken. The game feels very immersive. Unlike its older brother Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC as I'll refer to it from now on) sounds absolutely amazing. You can hear the marbles going under you tires and through the wheel wells. You can hear every little bump and knock that the car takes throughout the whole drive of the circuit. In fact, the first lap I did in the game I genuinely thought that I had broke something on the car while taking a kerb, as one would through the turn 1 on Monza, because I had never heard such a sound in any other sim racing game that I have played (I've played Assetto Corsa, Rfactor 2, and Project Cars 2). You can hear the suspension creak and pop as you go over some of the rougher kerbs in the game as well as if you go in the grass. The cars also sound very good in ACC. The popping of the backfire, and the individual sounds of each car manufacture engine makes me feel like I'm genuinely on a track in a Mercedes AMG with a Lamborghini and a Ferrari on either side of me. The game not only sounds breathtaking, but the game is visually breathtaking as well. I'm lucky enough to have a 3070 Ti so of course that helps a lot, but the game runs very well in VR on medium settings for me. The game is super smooth whether it be while doing a night time race in the rain or on a nice sunny perfect day. The game is visually stunning. I feel like anyone could get a solid amount of time played with just the base game. I personally wanted some of the DLC and with only 4 out of the 6 DLC I still haven't gotten bored with the game yet. Yes, you can't race an LMP1 or Formula 1 car in ACC, but I feel like the game is good enough audio wise, visually and content wise that I never find myself saying, ""Man I wish I could rip around in an F1 car right now on this game."" After all that's why Assetto Corsa and other sim racers are available, to race any kind of car you want. This is its own sim racer and is an improvement on Assetto Corsa, just without the modding and variety of different types of cars. Physics wise I feel like the game has improved and so have the AI. The force feedback feels a little bit more immersive and the AI actually know how to properly block and pass and even can be forced into making mistakes. I believe that if you are an avid sim racer and are looking for something new, then I recommend giving ACC a go (especially if it's on sale). Even if you are new to sim racing you can't go wrong with ACC. It's a very good sim racer and is well worth it in this humble sim racer's opinion.

I've spent over 100 hours on the regular Assetto Corsa, and, even without mods, had a great time! I waited a bit to buy ACC until the bugs and physics issues that i read about were worked out, and now i do not regret getting this game!

My main game before for sim driving was PC2, and I also regularly visit Automobilista 2, but ACC for me takes the crown. PC2 has major FFB and wheel issues with my G923, whereas AM2 and ACC work flawlessly out of the box. The level of  FFB quality in ACC for me however is far superior to the level in AM2, even though it supports trueforce.

Get this game if you want probably the most true to life GT simulator out there! And Kunos are still releasing more content over 2022! The only thing i had hoped for was that GTE would also have been featured in this game. Oh well, maybe ACC2 will fix that !

I am by no means hardcore into racing sims---I am a complete noob to GT racing but have been having so much fun racing trying not to place dead last in career mode. The AI is very challenging and aggressive and you have to watch out not to get too close to them. Luckily you have a team mate in your ear telling you when they are coming up behind you and on what side of the car they're on. It's up to you whether you want to listen to him or not. 

I recommend using the OpenFSR mod to increase performance in VR. I will include a link to my quick guide below. I was getting a lot of reprojection glitches at first but this eliminated that issue completely for me.

The GT cars are amazing. I've been racing with a McLaren. The graphics and sound quality are a step up from Assetto Corsa so that's a plus. Besides OpenFSR the sim doesn't need any freeware or paywalled mods unlike it's predecessor which is nice. There's a multiplayer option as well as a championship mode, career mode, and custom single player races.

I play with a Xbox controller and with some adjustments to the settings it makes it a lot more fun and easy to control. Below you'll find the settings I've found to work best with my controller.

Overall I recommend ACC despite it not being as popular as the OG Assetto Corsa and it can be more challenging. Whether you're a total noob like me who just wants to have fun racing in VR or on a flatscreen, or if you're a hardcare racing sim enthusiast, ACC will not disappoint.

Got a 3080 TI and wow, just drove it properly in VR. It now drives really good and looks clean and flicker free in VR. Still probably could use more power, never understood why ACC is so poorly optimized. Just nice to finally be able to truly enjoy it. 

After more fiddling, got it running pretty awesome. 

Put on VR, turn up big speakers loud enough to rattle windows and tear it up. Sound is A+ Racing is A+. Too bad it took a wicked video card to be able to enjoy it, but it is pretty spectacular. And the summer sale has all the DLC at huge discounts. Really love the way this feels with my TS PC Racing Thrustmaster wheel.

Settings: 
Steam VR Render Resolution to 100% Global / 130% in ACC Game specific box - I swapped these around, it felt like I had a 1050 video card..settings are crucial.  Above 130 in game specific looked good, but definitely had some reprojection ( look at wings, you'll see a faint ghosting) However at 130 it all went away and sense of speed increased as well. Tried at 110, drove incredible, looked good, but nothing like 130.... this is where some fiddling comes in.

Using DLSS - think this is better than FSR, went back and forth. DLSS is a little cleaner with almost zero flicker
PIxel Density in Game of 170 makes it look amazing. So much in fact, you can lower most items to med or low and it will look better than high on a lower density.  I do keep Draw Distance and textures at High or Epic and Car LODs at 100.  

I can't believe how good this game is in VR after lots of fiddling and ading a 3080Ti.... still on 2017 mbd and processor, I7 8700 with 32gb ram. Using Game Booster in ASUS tools kills all external stuff and frees memory. Makes a great difference if using an Asus card.

Theres a lot of Positives about the game. The cockpit perspective is gorgoeus. The cars behave like cars. The sound is fine and I neither have any graphical issues in terms of framerate or speeds. The ""Driver growth"" is pretty nicely done, I really like the idea of that system. Shows details on what and where you can improve the most. Car setups can be personalized for everyone if you invest the time and... HEY! Stop! Stop! this is supposed to be negative!... Well ok.

The one thing that makes this game unplayable for me, even though I only driven 3 relativly clean laps... for a bad setup in that obviously tiny time window I've got recorded.... I am certain that It's specificly for me, unplayble. I use a controller. This game is made for wheels. But has controller support... Which is good!... but yeah. I need my speed control on the right analoque stick. It's impossible to change brakes (gamepad L2) and throttle (gamepad R2) to ANYTHING else. It's impossible to change in the options. Remapping neither helps or the stick turns into a on or off button aswell... which is very bad in the rain especially.  My brain is trimmed for more than 15 years occosionally driving in racing games to use either L1+L2 or R1+R2 to shift. I can alternate between that. I cannot take it that my right thumb is doing essentially not a single thing in the whole goshdang time. The stick is a lot more sensible in my opinion aswell. It's a lot easier to control the throttle for me. Also the R2 and L2 buttons VERY often malfunction after just a couple months lifetime of a controller.... which doesn't help the issue at hand at all. Please. I believe I am not the only one with that issue. Please give us old-time controller players the option to use the right stick as brake and throttle. Please.

Problems:
- Driver Change: Sometimes it just plainly does not work. The second driver is selected and when its time for him to drive, he just sees an invisible car sitting in the pitlane with locked controls.
- Setting Pit Stop Strategy: You can only change pitstop settings while driving the car. That is really really stupid, they should orient themselves on iRacing and how they approached it.
- Connectivity problems: Disconnects happen often. Discord, Spotify, Streaming like OBS does not loose connection, but you're are loosing connection to the server.
- Track cutting: Cutting the track and gaining an advantage most of the time does the job pretty decently. Some tracks have the problem that even if you lift or brake you will still get a penalty.
- Tire selection and Setup: Why do I need to save a setup before I can load a setup from a teammate? Because the folder is not created until you yourself make a setup and generate the folder that way... Unnecessary. Also: Tire selection is way too vague. Sometimes we actually don´t know if the change will work when we are in the garage. On track with a pitstop it works fine, but in the garage you dont know what tire was used and is currently fixed on the car. (Also effects the temperature when leaving the pits, bc your car is standing in the pitlane, forcing you to leave the pits sometimes with tires that are stonecold)
Performance: The game looks good. But you'll need a rocketship to get it to look that way. When your PC is <2000€. Don't even think about running the game consistently above 60 FPS on a triple screen on Low Settings.

Unfortunately those problems really suck when you are competing in an endurance championship and you're relying on the stability of the game over a period of 24h. So I cant recommend the game.",1655547231,1655547231,False,1,2,0.468559682369232178,0,True,False,False

Being a simulator enthusiast and a bit tired of combat flight simming (still my passion, but you know... humans sometimes need a bit of variety) i thought about getting back into the racing genre for quite a while now. A friend of mine recently got himself a Fanatec steering wheel and pedals and since i tried these out, i´m sold. I decided to get 2 or 3 simracers and a decent wheel/pedal combo and jump in. Since i´ve always been a huge fan of GT racing, ACC was the first game on the list to get and i have to say it is a blast to drive. I have only played SP so far, as i´m by far not good enough to participate in online races yet and i don´t want to kill the game for others. Also i can only compare ACC to AMS2, as this is the only other racer i got for now.

The game does have some cons, but the pros outweight the cons by far. First thing i want to mention is the AI. My biggest gripe with it is that there is no AI in multiplayer possible. For online players, this isn´t a large issue. But for me it was a bit of a disappointment to find out while me and my friend wanted to set up a dedicated server. Starting a private session with only 2 players and no AI is just no fun, so ACC sadly is useless for that. Unless you have like 15 friends owning ACC as well. If you´re looking for private sessions with just a few friends, AMS2 will be the better choice even while its AI is at best annoying to race. The AI in ACC on the other hand, behaves great in SP so far i have seen. They fight for positions, respect the flags and keep the line (unlike AMS2, where they sometimes block the whole track when grouped, making it impossible to overtake). It does have some issues such as not making too much mistakes i.e., but racing them is realy fun and far from beeing as frustrating as it can be in AMS2. 

Graphics are nice and do realy offer some sweet eye-candy on a 4K screen setup, even while it´s already a few years old and the pit crew animations are a bit.. let´s say outdated. Especially having the AI glitching into their pit box. In VR the graphics are ""only"" good. AMS2 offers a significant sharper image in VR, hands down. VR performance however is good for me (definately better than with DCS, but that´s a different story), i´m running the game on a 12900K, 64GB DDR5-6000 RAM, RTX 3090, installed on a PCIe 4.0 NVMe and have the very most options maxed out (haven´t tweaked the settings yet, so might still be some overhead left), 35 AI opponents on the track, HP Reverb G2 with 100% Steam SS and i´m getting constant 60FPS (locked) under all circumstances. Wich is absolutely acceptable. I´m aware that this is not an average PC and that this may be different on crowded servers, but i´m confident VR performace should still be acceptable with a weaker machine and still good in MP. Maybe sacrificing some eye candy, but the game will still look good then.  

Driving physics and force feedback are great. I never drove a real GT3 car, but as far as i can say the cars in ACC do feel very realistic to drive and way better than in AMS2 imho. Every car is different to drive and feels unique, you can easily feel the difference in front-.engine and mid-engine design in the corners or when your tires wear off (wich is also highly dependent to car, track, setup and weather-/ track conditions). The force feedback is also great in ACC. It is hard to describe, but curbs, bumps, over-/ understeering and tires / grip just feel perfectly simulated. Again, i can only compare to AMS2 and ACC realy excels here. Setting up FF, the wheel itself and the pedals is pretty easy (unlike AMS2) and takes only a few minutes. This is propably dependent on the type of wheel beeing used, but those having a direct drive FF wheel won´t be disappointed, that´s for sure. ACC also offers great sounds. The cars just sound amazing and you can easily hear if there is a Porsche, a Ferrari or a Aston Martin next to you.

Maybe the biggest downside of ACC (at least on par with the lack of AI in MP) is the damage model. While the mechanical damage is pretty accurate (as far as i can tell), there is only a very minor optical damage model. The car starts to look wrecked at some point, but there aren´t any car parts flying around nor are there any dings in the chassis. Compared to what ACC offers overall, this is realy sad. That´s not a deal breaker for me as i´m playing ACC in VR only and therefore using exclusively the cockpit view, but for others this might be an issue.

The game also offers a lot of options to setup your car, even while i´m missing a few (such as setting up the transmission of the separate gears). But i guess these are just not allowed in the GT3 class, due to Balance of Performance, but tbh i cannot realy say for sure if that´s the case. Also setting up the pit strategy is a bit marginal. You can set up the amount of fuel, type of tires and tire pressure for separate pit stops, but driver change (wich is mandatory in the champoinship) must be set up in the car via pit stop window. That is a bit annoying and can easily get you disqualified if you mess that up. Was a bit frustrating after giving away a 2 hour race just because of missing to change the driver during a mandatory pit stop. 

ACC does not offer different racing series like AMS2, but is focused on GT3 series (does offer GT4 as well, at least with the DLCs). But therefore offers a large number of GT3 and GT4 cars, also in different versions (i.e. 488 GT3 and 488 GT3 Evo). Might not be too important for some, but i like it. Beeing able to create your own car (team, paint) is also a nice feature to have. The track selection is bound to the SRO Blancpain GT3 license, so the included tracks are limited to those beeing part of the Blancpain GT3 series. However, there are quite a few and some iconic ones like Monza and Nürburgring. Also the DLCs offer some more wich also inlude a few gems like Kyalami, Suzuka, or Bathurst. The next DLC coming June 30 will also inlcude some amazing US tracks like Virginia and Watkins Glen. Realy looking forward to it. 

Overall a realy great simracer with good physics, awesome force feedback and only very few shortcomings. For those who love SP racing with touring cars particularly GT3 / GT4, this simulator is absolutely amazing.I´ve read the online ranking system is not as good as it is with iracing or RaceRoom, but i´m confident ACC is a blast racing online as well.

Sound is very good in my opinion. There is all kinds of things going on around you and it's audible and that adds to the experience.

Graphics are fine to me. They look crisp enough and it still runs smooth.
Driving online is my kind of thing and that can be very addictive and rewarding. Public server racers can wreck your first lap, so take care.

Overall a very nice and addictive sim that can immerse someone into being a racing driver.

One downside is the fact lagging on a server is not a rare thing. At first one might think it's a cpu/gpu thing but it is in fact something else.
I have run multiple sessions in row on 1 server and the lagging varies big time.

Boy oh boy... After logging in 200+ hours and started doing it competitively, I have to say, this is indeed the most realistic thing you can play. Yes, I know, the FFB is not the best out there, but the simulation is insane. The physics are also on the not-so-sane side.

After patch 1.8, the game became even more realistic by the change of the tyre physics.

10/10 would still recommend, if you want a sim experience like no other, and if you are into GT3 and GT4 racing. If you don't care for these disciplines, then I'm afraid you have to avoid this title.

It is one of (if not the) greatest sims of all time. The handling model is really similar to the ""vanila"" Assetto Corsa, but the physics, the textures and the environment are tremendously improved.

Since then they have continually updated and improved this title. Each update and DLC brings you high quality additions and improvements. For GT racing there is no better sim than ACC it for now has asserted itself and the king of GT sim titles. iRacing, RF2, AMS2, etc. all have their perks but for the best GT driving experience ACC is a must. No other title competes when it come to driving feel. There are a few negatives. You will see people complain about how this titles runs in VR all of those complaints are valid it is awful for VR. Another chief complaint will be about the online ranking system or lack there of. These complaints are also valid. iRacing takes the crown as far as structured ranked racing goes. However with a little time investment ACC and Simracing.gp are slowly getting there. Competitive door to door racing is out there just takes a little more time to find and with the right community could make it better than iRacing in some cases. 
    If you are new to sim or have not given this title a shot in some time I would highly recommend ACC. IMO this is the Best bang for your buck sim title out there. Just understand if you want to get the most out of this title joining a League is a must. But there are leagues for EVERY skill level weather you have never simmed before or if you are a veteran. Leagues are the best part of the ACC experience. For all the NA driver's who may be concerned about the amount of drivers on in our time zones I am on mountain time and over the last two years the NA player base has gotten SO much better.

Do NOT recommend for VR users - unless you're system is a top-spec

Good game, great physics. Easy to navigate menus. Multiplayer is good and the rating system work well.

Bad bits: Resource hungry but fine if you're using a single monitor. Super resource hungry if you want VR, to the point that I'd rather play the original assetto corsa (AC), Automobilista 2 (AMS2) or rFactor 2 (rf2) in VR. Both AC and rf2 have great VR implementation and support higher frame rates with higher fidelity graphics, yet they are the ""older technology"". VR Optimisation for this game sucks. The best optimised sim racing game however is AMS2 for sure.

 Update: I've been playing this game more and more through my VR headset (Quest 2 with knock off link cable) but not in VR. Essentially I've been using my VR headset as a huge screen and I must say it plays decent. Not as good as true VR obviously but as the screen in the headset is so large I still have to turn my head to look to the left and to the right and that really helps place me in the car for that immersive feel.",1636816566,1652736606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like GT3 cars then you won't be disappointed here.
And I don't know why it took so long for a racing game to have a feature to save mid-race so you can continue the race from the same point later. So I was finally able to finish a 24-hour race.

Once everything is going well and you have a decent pace, you can get involved in multiplayer. From what I have experienced, there is sometimes a big gap between the different skill levels in the races, but you can still race wonderfully together. Ramming, poor driving behavior etc. is actually rather rare here. It doesn't matter if you're fighting for a podium at the front or battling for midfield further back, you will have fun regardless.

If you're coming from Assetto Corsa and expect the same level of sandbox and modability then you will get dissappointed. The only thing you can mod are paintjobs/liveries. Assetto Corsa Competizione is a more streamlined and focused experience compared to Assetto Corsa. Of course you can still adjust weather, track, classes etc. to your liking but you won't be able to race trough a city with an F1 car for example.

The game itself if, of course, excellent. The driving experience is sublime, the AI put up a good fight, there's a good selection of cars and tracks, and the DLC is relatively cheap and is on sale fairly often. You'll know all this from the rest of the reviews, really. Playing on a Steam Deck is largely a worthwhile experience as well, which is surprising given that racing sims are frankly not the best candidate for playing while on the toilet. Will it be a locked 60fps, high resolution experience? No, no it will not. I've found that for time trials, 800p Mid graphics preset will give you largely 60fps, while a race with a packed field requires you to drop down to the Basic preset to get somewhere between 30 and 60fps (depending on how many cars in your vision are bouncing off each other at T1 on the Monza public lobbies). Locking the Deck to 40fps is a fairly good compromise here.

As for controls, this is a more mixed bag. I've found the default settings for the gamepad are very twitchy and need a lot of work to dial into something workable. I would advise swallowing your pride and turning on Steer Assist at least, it does make the experience a lot more manageable. Using a wheel, on the other hand, is surprisingly easy - I had the Deck plugged into my USB-C dock, and tried using my G29, and it worked without having to monkey about in the OS settings. Result! The game admittedly looks a bit naff at 800p Basic settings on a bigger monitor, but the driving experience definitely makes up for shortcomings.

To summarise, is ACC viable on the Steam Deck? I would say yes, even to the extent that you can use a wheel. When playing portable, it's great to do a few laps while lounging on the sofa. If you're really into your sim racing then obviously this will not be the ideal way to play the game, the compromises on graphics and performance are too great to be truly competitive.

TLDR: Great game for experienced racers, but if you're new to sim racing maybe start somewhere a bit more newb friendly.

I watched a few videos about getting started and set up my wheel and then went on my way learning my wheel and some of the cars the beginner videos recommended. So i was doing laps around some of the tracks with different cars finally find a car I enjoy and then think ok time to start to career mode to work on my driving against AI instead of trashing online lobbies. The tutorial and skill challenge is on a lambo, which I had no idea how to drive it, especially at monza so I suck it up but get through the test and get a bad rating whatever I am new, then I am thrown into a team selection with a bunch of cars I have never driven, with no options of cars I had gotten used to already. So I pick a team and of course what you expect happens, a new sim racer, at a new track, in a car they've never driven, I can't keep it on the track, it's also only the second time I have had traffic and the first time I have had real traffic. This is probably a fine transition for experienced racers but for a new player I felt pretty dejected. This should be changed, I don't need to be placing first, but I went from doing some laps around silverstone in a 720 to warm up to a lambo at monza, and then a mclaren 650 at a new track. Maybe find a way to make it a more linear path with cars if in the first test they are trash like me or something.

Assetto Corsa Competizione is great. It's a more focused version of the sandbox that is the original Assetto Corsa, with more convenient ways of getting a balanced race up and running. It's also very comfy on account of the ability to control menus and open up the pause menu without the need for a keyboard and mouse, that is a godsend. ACC's focus on GT3 and tracks from a single licensed racing competition may be interpreted as a lack of content. To be honest, I really wanted to be able to drive in the Nordschleife in this one, and I REALLY miss that. But I also appreciate the small install size (as of writing this, with the game taking up about 13 GB apparently).

One thing that really upsets me and which verges on dealbreaker territory (were it not for me having just bought the game with a sale price, I guess) is that, when playing online, the game has occasional, sudden ""sync"" type lag spikes that freeze the game and then teleport you up ahead with total loss of control of your car for a good entire second or two. This usually results in crashes and completely ruins races and lap times alike. It also seems to happen when playing single player for some reason, but the spikes are shorter and more rare.

Still, ACC is a great, fun experience, and trying to improve your lap times is kind of addictive. While playing, I highly recommend you listen to some Eurobeat mixes or some Need for Speed music by Rom Di Prisco, it'll really add to the experience.",1651948741,1651949314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When a driving sim with VR comes out, I go full Digital Foundry try-hard and test every possible settings combo for 10 hours before even enjoying the game. This game is a joke for VR and the DLSS option somehow managed to be more taxing/blurrier than simply editing a config file/being smart with settings. I owned this game back in the day with an RTX 2070 and now with an RTX 3070 and it's always been 80/90fps stable (whatever your headset does refresh-rate wise). The problem is how low the settings need to be to achieve stable fps and how bad the game looks compared to even the older Assetto Corsa or PC2/AMS2. Sadly this game is an AMAZING GT sim, has great multiplayer communities, and some of the best audio I've ever heard. This means if you're a VR guy you have to just shutup and deal with it performance wise. Please make sure you have an understanding of how your headset is doing super sampling and how the game itself is and setup/benchmark things. This game is NOT plug and play with VR like iRacing/Mad engine games but it can be made to look decent while keeping the performance headroom at 10-20%.",1651111960,1651893760,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Well this can be true, but ACC is good for online racing, anytime you can find a lobby if you are not picky, and cost is really low even full price. Compared to iRacing this game is more accessible both in terms of cost and licence system. You need to spend more time in iRacing to reach GT3.

Also GT3 is kinda main racing series in sim racing, sure LMP would be great but, like I said, if you are not going to spent money on iRacing, that game is pretty much mazda mx5.

so I recommend this over iRacing for this aspects, but if you got money go for iRacing. Also if you have good amount of money to spent on iRacing, probably you can try this game, at least on sale.

Comparing to previous AC title, this game is refined, dont need UI mods, dont need to join a league, just install try some cars, find a car suits you, then pick a track and drive, get good and race. Also you can google track + free setup, most of the tracks has setups for some cars, mainly porsche, ferrari and bmw m4. you can copy them and good to go.

Main assetto corsa game is pain in the ass compared to ACC. Sure i have that one and I install mods like imsa etc however racing on populated servers not easy as this game. 

Like I said, GT3 is popular, and many cars in the series so it cool. There is also ai, so you can drive on unpopular cars and tracks with them.

DLC also really good value, Imola, Panaroma, british small tracks etc. I really appricate this game, pretty much best online simracing game for buck. If you just like hotlapping maybe first AC is better with mods but I like easy accessible online racing with populated lobbies for reasonable price, only option is this.

I do find that you have to use a car that works for you, and stick with it. For me, this was the V8 Vantage and now the M4 GT3. While it is a bit of a nuisance, it does highlight the realism of the handling each car has, and how you cannot just directly transfer your driving between them. You need to learn the differences.

This is a GT World simulator, so there is no ability to use modded cars or drive on modded tracks, which is a shame in some regard.

Physics, cars, liveries and tracks are on point. Visuals are good, though not impressive. Sound is considered the best on the market or second best. And that's about it. It really shows what simracing is in 2022 when in this game the most fun car is a low powered BMW and driving a Ferrari is a snorefest. At some point one wishes to say just get the first Assetto for dirt cheap, mod the hell out of it and do togue or wangan-style highway races in crazy modified JDMs, but that's like saying your car of choice should be an early 2000s hatchback with an engine swap and 4 turbos. At some point physics alone can't carry these games when the content is just boring. Yet devs and fans still insist on mimicing real world racing series down to the cringe cigarette adds on liveries, while real racing has become boring hi-tech garbage.
Yes, I recommend this game, because out of all the competition, it's at least competent at what id does and consistent while at it. 
Online? If you don't mind not being able to host your own game and invite friends without googling for a soution and thus be forced to interact with the most insufferable community next to people who play Dark Souls, yeah, I guess it's great. Just remember to turn off the ranking system for offline play, otherwise you'll screw yourself during your first AI race when they bump into you dumping your rating into the abbys and then no server will let you in. Great game desing.
Anyway, hotlaps at Bathurst in a Porsche at night, during rain is the best driving experience in any modern game of the sort to date and it doesn't have the Nordschleife too, so if you insist on simracing, this game is a must-buy.

Tried using an Xbox controller for about an hour before realising you really need a wheel to play properly. Bought a logitech G29 (A very good budget wheel if you're in the market for one) and just clamped it to my desk to begin with. started setting some decent lap times on my favourite tracks before deciding I really wanted a good cockpit as well so bought a playseat challenge (A folding cockpit) as im pretty limited on space. I then decided I needed a bigger monitor and all the DLC to really get the most out of my new simracing setup. So all in all I'm £700 poorer and i regret nothing. This game has got me hooked #simracinglife

I've seen some drivers doing a 0.2-second gap between a car in front of them, down a straight, and think that it is perfectly fine to continue to stop at their normal braking point they used the lap before... 

Conclusion: IT'S NOT!

Why?

Because doing a 0.2-second gap from the car in front down a straight, lets say Blanchimont, Spa at ~255km/h, both cars are travelling around 70 meters per second. 

That 0.2s gap at 70 meters per second is a 14-meter gap nose to nose from the cars

14-meter = 3 car lengths (average car length in-game is about [b]4.7-meter[/b])


[i](kmh x 5) / 18 = speed in meters per second
(255 x 5) / 18 = 70.8 m/s

m/s x gap in seconds = gap in meter
70.8 x 0.2 = 14.16 meters[/i]


So, If you were to brake at 0.2-second gap on your normal braking point into a tight corner such as a bus stop chicken (chicane) or a hairpin down to ~80 Km/h.

At that ~80Km/h, both cars will slow to ~22.2 m/s... Your distance from nose to nose will now be about [b]4.44 meters[/b]... (a number less than that average car length mentioned earlier)


If you were driving behind a guy in a Bentley with his [b]5-meter[/b] car length... your nose will now be [b]22 inches deep[/b] in Mr Bentley's backside! ([i]That's 56cm![/i])


Mr Bentley surely will not appreciate you penetrating him like that, and taking a sniff... As both of you's will now spill your SA everywhere due to those [b]22[/b] inches of action!


This wouldn't happen if you backed off just before braking to a much safer ~0.3s gap ([i]6.6m nose to nose, with 1.6m social distancing between the cars at braking[/i])
or even better is to brake earlier, and then modulate the brakes to keep close to him after the braking zone, and into the turn in.

[b]Brake modulation[/b] = Brake early, then let off very slightly to come closer to the car in front again, and brake again to slow the car down to appropriate speed for the corner.


Remember,
[list]
[*] - Don't penetrate, tap or grind people unless they consent to it.
[*] - If you're unsure about the gap and/or car distances at certain speeds, back off.
[*] - If you do know the gap, always brake earlier in situations when you're close to the car ahead.
[/list]

It’s much better to focus on the corner exit and get alongside your competitor before the next corner
Only ever brake normally (in this case 'later') if you are side by side and your car has an overlap, and you are on the correct side of the track.

Do not listen to people who say braking late is the way to overtake, there is no such thing as [i]""braking late""[/i], it's ether [b]Braking on your optimal braking point[/b] or [b]Braking earlier[/b].

Because [i]""Braking late""[/i] = you doing an [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL3MtMLMW8g]EXTREME-ULTRA-SUPER-LATE-BRAKING![/url] and going off [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wycf3sbxPNk]into a ditch in front of some old grandmas house[/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Vrtpr4CWI]The Lord of No Consent: Return of the Penetration.[/url]

The lack of some iconic circuits like the Nordschleife, Hockenheim, Sarthe and the classic American circuits besides Laguna is real. Considering they put in two years of work laser-scanning the Nordschleife for the prior game, I have no idea why they would omit it here. Also all of the alternative layouts that were present in the original AC are gone - it's just the main circuit now, and I think a lot of that is due to the licensing restrictions they had with SRO/Blancpain.
Besides those points, the circuits you do get are all top-notch, the cars are all phenomenal (I've only dug into the GT4 cars because I'm slow) and the driving experience is a blast. You can relive some of the past championships, or you can create your own championships. You can even have multiclass championships going even if you don't own the GT4 DLC - they can still be included in the grid.
Overall it's a fantastic sim, the physics are top-notch, but the overall product is just slightly stifled by how strict they follow the SRO calendars. It's a video game, let your hair down a little bit Kunos.

Yes, the car selection may not have the breadth of other games/sims, but it's enough variety to make each track a learning experience each time.  Also, getting multiplayer is a lot more involved than creating a lobby in Horizon.  You'll be forwarding ports on your router and editing JSON files or paying for an ACC hosted server.

You've to drive super cautiously at the beggining, because YOUR safety ranking is getting lowered everytime a rammer hits you, which means, you'll more likely play with rammers, because your safety ranking match their safety ranking.

My recommendation to new players is to try a cars at first and then pick one you like and spend time trying to master it. Every car behaves differently and can't be driven in the exact same way so there's bound to be one that fits your style.

400 hours edit: I still stand by my review. This sim offers a lot more than meets the eye at first. The time and weather simulations bring a whole new level of strategy and behaviours.

If you don't learn how to navigate your pitstop system mid race changing every little finnicky thing including turning your motor off you will be penalized with times of 4-6 secs per little thing you F%*$ up. You spend more time researching your vehicle specs that have to be set perfectly for every individual track  and part on top of the pitstop nightmare you might as well just do it in real life because it's a waste of your time to do it in a 2nd/3rd world simulator that does it badly.,1647824311,1647824311,False,0,5,0.337514132261276245,0,True,False,False

I was only a Assetto Corsa sim racer, but I wanted more competitive racing. So, I had to decide between Assetto Corsa Competizione or iRacing. I chose ACC.
This game caught my eye because I already knew the developers, I love GT3 and above all, it was cheaper than iRacing.
Let's start with the good stuff:~
As this game is licensed by SRO Motorsports Group, the content presented is from SRO's championships. At the time of this review, it has GT Europe, GT World, and British GT with the GT3, GT4, Porche Cup and Super Trofeo classes. The quality of the content is quite good as well as the realisticness. Many people get angry because of the bad power balance between cars, which also happens in the real world championship. Drivers also complain about bad BoP. Tracks like Le Mans or Nordschleife will never be implemented unless SRO races there IRL. Kunos is trying to keep up to date with the new tracks that SRO races every year.
Talking about up to date: DLC's. You might think that the game + DLC price is quite high. I must agree, but the quality of the content is amazing. Besides, you can get the game+all DLC at 50€ during steam sales! It is much less expensive than iRacing subscription policy plus the track and car content.
People might think iRacing has better online racing. While ACC doesn't seem to have MP races every half hour, it has CP races every hour where you can get or lose rating (although rating on ACC isn't that important). There is daily racing on other websites and various communities on Simgrid and on Simracing. gp where you can enter every type of race. Basically, ACC has everything that iRacing has in terms of online racing, the only thing is that you have to search for it :D

The bad stuff:
""No Singleplayer career"".
Although AI isn't that bad, SP races can be a bit boring. There is a career mode, but it isn't very good.

Rating is non-important
There is a rating system but no one cares about it mostly because there isn't much conected to it.

Bugs
There is a lot of bugs, especially on MP team racing, For Example: When changing driver, the virtual mirror disappears. Most of the bugs arent that bad and you get accustomed to it.


This is a very good sim. I recommend it to everyone! It's the sim where I race everytime and, in my opinion, it's even better than iRacing.",1647729608,1647729608,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I also love the sound in the game.  I drove the same car, on the same track, in rFactor 2 (which I also really like) and the audio was noticeably 'fuller' in ACC.  I can;t say whether the audio is more realistic, but it was more engrossing.  Really good game - just wish they'd release more sims for other classes of cars.

- You mastered arcade racers like Forza Horizon and Dirt.
- You mastered simcades like F1 and Forza Motorsport.
- You saw some streamers playing ACC, and it looked pretty cool.

How it's going:
- You try playing ACC with a controller, only to spin at every turn on your first lap.
- You get good enough with a controller to know that you need a wheel to do a proper lap.
- You get good enough with an entry level wheel to know that you need a sim rig, load cell pedals, a direct drive wheelbase, an authentic formula wheel, butt kickers, and a VR headset to truly feel immersed and squeeze every tenth out of each lap.

Gave it another go a few months back and just suddenly started to click, and now it is 80% of what I drive. Absolutely love it, so rewarding to actually see yourself getting better.

What's good:
+ Graphics: they look AMAZING on the right hardware, which mine is not.
+ Physics and gameplay: the realism you'd expect from a PC simulator. It's also done the implementation of GT rules very well.
+ Online and SR: This game actually requires you to be good at it to play online. F1 2021, take note.

What's average:
= Mediocre menus, but they're at least better than the AC ones.
= Controller/wheel support - there's no setting to set every car to the amount of lock you like, as in rFactor 2. Controllers are also heavily delayed.

What's bad:
- There is quite literally next to zero base content. IN A 50 DOLLAR GAME. You have to pay hundreds for extra content. 
- There REALLY isn't much to do except race, as there's no fun modes or anything. I understand it's a full sim but at least add a couple of fun modes that someone can play after the game gets boring.
- Driver swaps are kinda shit

Verdict: As good as ACC handles and plays, its embarrassing lack of content hinders it significantly.

Graphics, sounds, physics, everything in this game speaks volume to the passion and care Kunos have with motorsport in general. 

This is a SIM, not your average arcade/simcade. It's hard, it's frustrating, it needs a proper wheel to be enjoyed fully. But if you keep your mind open to learn the craft, it's incredibly satisfying.

I was very skeptical about the ACC experience, even though I had driven Kunos's stuff from way back and know how good it can be.
A buddy of mine was driving ACC and saying positive stuff and seemed to be somewhat addicted to it...so I thought I'd have a peek.
  I bought it and starting driving.  First I thought the cars felt stiff compared to the previously mentioned titles but the more I pushed the more I thought 'this feels really good!'  I can get a great sense of what the tires are up to and push accordingly.  The more I pushed the better it felt.
I went back to my favs and drove them and decided after all, the ACC actual physical driving experience is AT LEAST as good if not better.  Plus the sound and graphics add up to a very strongly immersive experience.
Yes it's limited in scope but the subject it covers is not small and has a great capacity for variety within the somewhat confined limits.  There are several cars that I haven't even heard the engines for much less driven...potential fun!!
The single player work-up is really good.  A full campaign to be Mr. Awesome Driver and really good practice oriented stuff to play with.
Also there is a deep ratings system that requires the driver to prove he/she is serious about actually RACING and is just a lot of fun to learn and develope your own personal ratings.
I really can't think of anything bad to say about the sim.  It drives great, sounds amazing and is thoroughly fun!

If you struggle with the intricacies of setting up a car, or you don't understand the engineering aspect of it, this game will be frustrating for you.

V1.8 Edit:
When the V1.8 was released I saw several positive reviews of the update. I started practicing using the aggressive set ups, with different cars. Before the update, the thing that frustrated me so much was that if you got off the racing line you would lose every bit of grip you had and just slide or spin off the track. After the update, the cars feel so much better, you can actually leave the racing line and still have enough grip to make a move, and my lap times are significantly lower than they were before the update. I still race on IRacing, but ACC is once again my main simulator. In my opinion ACC is the best simulator on the market. The multiplayer still needs work, but you can definitely find races, join servers, join communities for league racing, and have a ton of fun. It's not nearly at the level IRacing is for multiplayer. IRacing will probably always be the standard bearer for organized multiplayer sim racing, but I think Kunos and ACC are going to be the standard bearers for physics, audio, graphics, and immersion. I've logged hundreds of hours on this game in the past year. I'm sure since the update, I'll be logging even more this year. If you're on the fence about this game and you enjoy sim racing, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.

This is not a beginner simulator. While there are very good default set ups that are really quick, you still have to know how to race and use a wheel and pedals. A Logitech or Thrustmaster will work just fine. I used both of them when I first started playing this game. I guess you could use a controller, but this isn't one of those games like Forza or Gran Turismo. Even if you have experience with other simulators, this simulator takes patience and practice to learn the physics of the game. You will not be setting record lap times or winning podiums within the first few times of playing. 

And please practice overtaking in single player. If you're racing on line and you don't know how to overtake, please don't. You'll gain more safety rating and trust by following and learning from the person in front. If you are faster and better than the person in front of you, then they'll make a mistake. Forcing you're way and pushing people off the track is not overtaking. It's a game. P15 pays the same amount as the race winner, $00.00.",1581108802,1644042953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like GT3 & GT4 racing then you'll enjoy this sim, career mode is good I enjoyed it. Single player has a lot of modes to choose from, I spent most of my time there, custom championship mode is one of my favorite parts of the game, making your own championships is so much fun.

The best part of this game is the endurance racing it's some of the best fun you'll have from offline to online, it's really good. The graphics are great, car physics are good, overall I really enjoyed this sim, it's one of my favorites.

Whilst all of the cars are very similar in terms of performace, each has its own characteristics and nuances... a personality if you will. All of the tracks are laser scanned and with the overall graphics quality, you really can feel like you're driving a real GT3. The only other issue with the game is the hardware required to run the sim. DLSS has certainly helped improve performance but you will need a medium-high end PC to run the game smoothly.

[i]Updated review for version 1.8.x[/i]

A racing simulator mainly focused on GT3 cars and online multiplayer. A lot of people love this game and you might too if you like racing GT3 online and don't use VR. You won't like it as much if you want a wider range of content, need a good single player experience or race mostly in VR.

This game does some things really well, I enjoy it sometimes and understand its addictive qualitites. But overall I keep my thumbs down conclusion, because it has a poor VR implementation, poor career mode and a limited content to offer.


[h1]Positive[/h1]
[b]Driving feel[/b] - is good and gives a believable feeling of GT3 cars, handling and road or kerb surfaces. The GT3 tire model feels a bit different to other games, the tires can slide easily and the cars are quite sensitive to steering and slip angle, relative to other games.

[b]Sounds[/b] - the sound scape in the cockpit is raw and immersive, engine sounds and the bumps and knocks on the chassis. One of the best sounding games currently.

[b]Popular multiplayer scene[/b] - organized and casual players can easily find sessions with a lot of players. You can spend a lot of time online.


[h1]Negative[/h1]
[b]Just GT3 online[/b] - the multiplayer is almost exclusively GT3 cars. Nobody is racing the GT4 or cup cars. If you pick those and join a mixed race or official competition servers you will be the only car in that class on track. Expect to drive GT3 all the time if this is your main game.

[b]Poor career mode[/b] - this mode is opaque and dull, it schedules a sequence of testing or race events you enter. You earn points and medals that seem to have no context or visualization of progress, just a percentage completion of the mode. Also if you are not familiar with SRO rules the career mode will disqualify you a few times becaue your pit stop was outside the window or you did not select a driver swap. Also in 1.8 loading an old saved career mode crashes the game.

[b]Heavy graphics engine[/b] - ACC uses Unreal Engine and needs a powerful GPU to hold steady 60fps on monitors.  Expect to dial down graphics options [i]a lot[/i] unless you have a flagship GPU.

[b]Poor VR[/b] - in VR the heavy graphics rendering problems get bad, even with powerful GPUs. It renders blurry or oversharpened images. The images look bad at the mid distance where your eyes are usually focused. There hasn't been significant improvement; version 1.8 has added DLSS and FSR, these can help a little but with mid-range GPUs it looks then ""less bad"", still a blurry, messy result. ACC VR is still way behind the results possible from other racing titles (AC, PC2, AMS2, RF2, even R3E) despite using the most advanced game engine and upsampling technology.

I tried various complicated solutions to fix this but was unsuccessful in making those work. You have no idea what the tires are doing like in rfactor2 and automobilista or pretty much every other racing game I have played. Other things like the cluttered controller set up screens and obscure button assignments not easily configured due to layout. The overzealous track limits that go off even when time was not gained or even lost is made worse by the 1970's cadillac overboosted numb power steering. If you like the feeling of hurtling around a race track when your in the passenger seat this game is for you. Positives are the great graphics & sounds, physics seem realistic but you just dont feel much of them with a G27 like all the other games. Until I am able to fix this steering problem ACC will remain parked in my racing game garage.

Update: The force feedback that has been missing for my G27 Wheel has now been added and I am very thankful To finally get some use out of this game.

Anyhow when you know iRacing, it's hard to get back to ""gaming"" racing sims. Especially if your goal is online competition. You can tell this game is attempting at online racing but it's just a bunch of servers and lobbys waiting for players to connect. Its not organized at all like iRacing is with their series, fixed schedules, etc. I joined one server just to test, it was dead.

It reminds me a lot of Project cars,
I sucked in that as well and did not play it for long.
With the combination of driving Project cars and Shift 2 the tracks are not entirely new to me.
I'll still have to get a lot of practice before I could race anybody online though.

The graphics are good,
The vehicles sounds great.
I think friends could have great fun racing each other and pro's sure would be able to knock out fast laps.

Even in it's early access stage (2nd build as I type this) ACC shows so much promise. It looks incredible, even beating out Grand Turismo in term of visual fidelity, and the replays in rain and dark conditions look so real you have to blink!

Bear in mind that this game includes one car available to drive, on a single track each month. Each month we'll get a different Blancpain car and track to use. At the moment the weather conditions do not cycle as you drive - so a wet track won't become dry. But tbh, that's not a restriction, as it's such a pleasure to drive a physics engine that tops Assetto Corsa, with graphics that look so nice. I'm running a 7700K and a GTX1080 and it looks awesome, even though I've not maxed my settings.

Older games like RFACTOR2, RRE and PCARS all seem to stutter and drop frames when their respective game engines supply gameplay to my TFT (144Hz) when they drop below the setting I have chosen. So, 100hz, 120hz, or 144hz. But amazingly ACC does not suffer this same problem. The action is much smoother.

I can watch a race replay (with 21 cars(20 AI and me)) and even in rain I'll get 100fps, but it'll look smooth compared to that same framerate on RRE or PC2 for example. So, I don't know what Kunos are doing, but at this stage it's awesome and I'm really impressed. Never did I imagine that a PC sim would get visuals like Polyphony's gfx engine. By the way, if a replay is running at 100fps, it's doing 30% more than that whilst driving. They've done an amazing job of optimising UE so far. 

There are plenty of settings you can tweak too. So even if you have a slower gfx card, you can nudge the settings down and it'll look nice. I did note that for the UE, I was forced to set AA to high, and set the method from FXAA to temporal - this was the only way I got jaggied lines to almost complete go away. It looks much better with these options on IMHO.

I've never had the game crash. I can drive fine without altering settings with zero assists on the pad (aside from the factory ABS and TC settings enabled). If you purchase ACC anytime in the next 2 months you'll get ACC for £22.49 - and this will include 2019 liveries for free - post launch next year. If you can cope with one car and track then don't sit on the fence, there's so much to fall in love with.

There are blogs on assettocorsa.com in the forums that explain what new work has gone into the physics engine. This is not a port. The feeling you get when the cars drop off a curb is great, and as I say, I say that as a pad user. This has already exceeded my expectations tbh.

There may only be one track and car per month, but just getting chance to drive with a more detailed physics engine at night and in the rain is amazing. This sim is going to force others (hopefully) to up their game. Going back to RF2 now, is going to seem like playing RF1 in terms of visuals.

After using ACC, I'm not sure I can stomach the stale graphics in RF2 and RRE. This one title will likely force the others to gather dust!

Buy it, it's a complete steal at under £23. Just be aware you are getting a developing game, with lots of new features that are yet to be completed. We've already had a game update to address a few bugs. A brilliant start to the early access program.

The title hasn't even crashed once, so Kudos to Kunos.

* Set FPS limit to my monitor refresh rate which is 60
* Turned VSYNC ON
* Disabled ""High precision event timer"" in device manager on my PC
* Locate the file ac2-win64-shipping.exe (which in located in your ACC game folder 
  SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Assetto Corsa Competizione\AC2\Binaries\Win64) - Right 
  click on it, select Properties, select the compatibility tab and click on Disable Full Screen

  ACC game folder SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Assetto Corsa Competizione\AC2) just 
  in case.
* Windows Game Bar Mode also needs to be disabled for this to work.
* Also confirm these settings in the Nvidia Control Panel where applicable.

Yes you can race in stuffy alien only areas, but who wants to do that apart from those freaks and special people who are not even playing the same game as you anyway. 

The SA system massively penalises ANY contact, intentional or not, from you or anyone else, you are blamed, JUST like the God awful system in Iracing too.  So it basically forces you to race in gay, law abiding only leagues where you will usually find very few people at your level, they are either pathetically no life fast or very slow in my experience. 

And the best bit is, the ONLY way you can increase your SA rating is to race very close to other cars, so you can cheat it by racing AI, but online is fraught.

But get this, one yes ONE damn incident will drop you a whole point, but does it take only a few seconds to build it back?  No way, it takes lap after lap within .3 of a second to do so and then usually only by 1 point. I did 15 minutes as close as I could earlier and got only 1 point, yet in an online race was hit three times and lost two, it is not fit for purpose at all. 

It is flawed, and totally ruins an otherwise very good game.

Having played a good amount of racing titles I decided to jump into ACC because I was looking for more realism. I started out ACC with my Logitech G920 but was immediately hooked by the realism and immersion. After a couple of months I upgraded my setup to a Fanatec CSL Elite with pedals and was enjoying it even more, even before the ""big"" updates were rolling out.
The money value is extremely high compared to other simracing titles but can still feel pricey for those starting off in the big world of online racing.
Long story short, the developers at Kunos have but so much love and passion into this title and therefor I highly recommend it! And if you can spend it, the combination of ACC and the Fanatec CSL DD is truely amazing, I promise ;)

Pro's
- Money value extremely high
- Unreal visuals (pun intended)
- Sounds are insanely good (neighbors love my revving skills)
- Force Feed Back (FFB) keeps getting better (were in my opinion already the best)
- There is always a race to your liking (track/car/time combination)

Cons
- Steep learning curve
- Ranking system/Multiplayer not as developed as its competitor (but https://lowfuelmotorsport.com/ does exactly that, so...)
- No custom liveries
- The rolling start with an online race (you'll need some practice and time to get used to the system)
- Car list exists only of GT3/GT4 cars, for now :) (And for it doesn't matter because I always enjoyed the GT3 series the most)

I had it since it came out, got all DLCs as they were appearing over the years, but recently my iRacing subscription expired and I have been playing it a bit more, both vs AI and against other players online.
It started slow, but at this point this is a must have game. You need wheel and pedals to fully enjoy it. A good list of cars and circuit, nice simulation, and very good graphics, with amazing weather effects, both visually and how it affect driving and strategies. Works like a charm in VR. Online rating system works quite well to make sure you race against people similar to your level. Obviously doesn't have iRacing numbers but you can always find an online race.

2019 | played time: 132 hours | 10/10

The racing simulator Assetto Corsa Competizione developed by Kunos Simulazioni allows to have a very immersive GT3 driving and thus racing experience.

First off, this simulation cannot be compared to its predecessor due to the different focus on certain aspects and the evolution of racing simulations over the years. Kunos Simulazioni provides us with one of the most detailed simulations on the market along with a huge attained player base for even more enjoyment. The selection of cars seems smaller than it is. As of November 2021, we are provided a total of 29 different GT3 cars including cars from DLCs and 11 GT4 cars also obtainable through the GT4 DLC. These cars can be used on a total of 19 different tracks including Nürburgring and Brands Hatch however 8 of them such as Imola or Suzuka are only accessible through DLCs.
The graphics in this game are thoroughly detailed on the cars as well as on the laser-scanned tracks. This is meant for both the models and the textures in the game. The cars have a rather vast selection of different liveries depicting their real-life equivalents almost perfectly. Throughout a race, there are also wear and dust marks visible. Over the duration of time on track, an increasing amount of wear and dirt marks are getting visible showing the usage of the car. The tracks oftentimes show tire marks in braking zones, turns and curbs. Tire marks because of cars spinning on the track will also stay for quite a while. The buildings and the environment are just as well modelled and textured as the track itself. 
Something very noticeable is the behaviour of the sounds in this game. The cars’ engine sounds are portrayed realistically and do not feel artificial at all. The tracks themselves do not have any environmental sound such as cheering or birds twittering. However, depending on the events with the cars on-track, the sounds are very detailed such the rumbling upon driving over curbs or the echoing of the engine sound on the walls of the paddock buildings upon driving on the pit straight. 
Each car, even though from the same racing class, behaves differently depending on the amount of fuel loaded, position of the fuel tank, position of the engine and the setup. This results in having stronger cars on certain tracks compared to others. The laser-scanned tracks ensure the detail in the immersion through bumps on the tarmac and differences of grip on certain spots.
This simulation provides a highly comprehensive and detailed experience especially for players using a steering wheel. The force feedback is very customizable for different amount of detail on certain aspects of the driving experience. The single player mode offers a career mode where you can skip certain sessions and custom race weekends. The beauty of this simulation lies in the multiplayer mode where you can join one of the many open lobbies, which although have specific requirements to join or join a private lobby with a password for example the server of a racing league. The mentioned requirements ensure you are matched with online opponents on your skill level who know their race craft. Private lobbies are also easy to host via the steam app ‘Assetto Corsa Competizione Dedicated Server’.

This game is recommended to every user especially with a wheel for realism in the simulation. The online mode is best experienced with friends or in a league where you can race and learn from each other.",1638102365,1639373237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Performance issues got kind of adressed in patch 1.8. With VR pixeldensity 70% and FSR the game is playable for me to be fair.






130 hours in I am pretty disappointed.

It is a SIM, yes and a pretty good one. I am sure it looks beautiful, when your nuclear reactor doesnt overheat running it.

My problem is, that is sais it is VR compatible when it actually barely is. My PC is not a big thing, R5 2600 with rx 5600 XT, but still can run AC with Shaders, RF2, Elite Dangerous very nicely. No epic settings, but everything is more than playable and actually looking pretty nice in my old Vive.

With this game i can't tune the thing down enough to get a steady 40 fps, but the more annoying thing is the latency. It is unplayable at some points even alone on the track.

I bought this game before i had VR to play it later in VR, and now i'm just stuck with it, and can't really play it. Waste of money i could say. And all of it could have been spared if the title wouldn't say ""VR compatible"".

I feel really betrayed, but I didn't want to write a negativ review first, because i was hoping for some updates/patches that may fix the VR experience at least a little. I don't need a photorealistic picture in VR, but I don't think, that my PC should not be able to a run title like this at least 60 fps on minimum graphics in VR.",1622119092,1639237519,False,2,0,0.444888025522232056,0,True,False,False

Just tried it again after update 1.8 November 2021. Haven't changed my opinion at all. Same type of car round a small variety of tracks. Still boring. The original Assetto Corsa with CM CSP and Sol etc. is still far more fun and more interesting than this.

It's not perfect by any means, rubber banding while racing online, the out of the blue server maintenance, the ranked servers could do with some work to get to the gold standard of iRacing's multiplayer system, but all in all, a very well rounded Sim Racing title with a focus on GT3 cars.

While acc may only have a limited selection of cars and tracks, it makes up for this with extreme quality. So if you're looking for a high-quality (albeit limited in quantity) circuit racing sim there is just no better option.

Acc comes with a rating system that ensures you will (almost) always be racing with people of the same skill level. And because no one likes getting rammed in the first turn there is also a safety rating, so if you're a clean driver, you will race with clean drivers.

The dlc is also very high quality just like the base game, the tracks are laser-scanned for example.

The sim racing community didn’t take it very well when Assetto Corsa Competizione came out in Early Access, back in 2018. Unlike the spiritual predecessor, Assetto Corsa, there was no mod support, and the game would rock the Unreal Engine instead of Kunos Simulazioni’s proprietary engine that used to power Assetto Corsa and NetKar Pro. And it wouldn’t be a jack of all trades either: Blancpain GT3 content only, which meant that the car and track list would be limited to the ones that are used in real life. From a brand that consolidated itself thanks to being the people’s favorite moddable platform, one could say it was a bold move. Would it still be able to stay relevant and stand out from the competitors that also offered GT3 content? 

One of the advantages of narrowing down the content variety is that it allows for extra care and attention to detail, which Kunos took full advantage of. Every one of the 32 (!) GT3 cars handle differently, with realistic performance figures taken directly from the manufacturers, along with unique engine sounds that make real-life sound dull in comparison. By far the best sound effects out there, making the competition sound like bumper cars. The modeling is also impeccable, both internally and externally, with fantastic texturing that looks just like the real thing. When they meant an authentic GT3 simulation, they weren’t kidding.

But we all know that a racing simulator isn’t just made of cars. Tracks are important, too. Kunos knows that very well and doesn’t disappoint. Each one of the 11 base game tracks is masterfully replicated through laser-scanning, which means they are just like the real thing in every sense of the word. Every bump, crack, elevation change, weathering, and so on is carried over to the simulator so that both cars and surfaces can offer unparalleled accuracy. The other 8 DLC tracks are equally as good. 

As far as game modes are concerned, ACC delivers the usual stuff: career mode, multiplayer, hot lap, practice, and free race. Unfortunately, it doesn’t sport a full-fledged career mode like the F1 franchise, for example, but it’s good enough. From humble beginnings to the top of the category, with an excruciatingly slow introduction in Monza, which takes away from the experience a little bit but doesn’t fully compromise it. If you want to buy it just for the career mode, don’t. With that being said, the single-player races within and outside the career mode are very engaging, thanks to a very good AI that can either be very fast or very forgiving, depending on difficulty. You can customize the length (10, 20, 30 minutes, and so on), weather, time of day, grid size, mandatory or optional pit stops, qualifying length (or just disable it altogether), just like most modern sims would. Races are very engaging, and the rating system is a stimulus to keep you going. Oh yes, the rating system. It goes up if you race cleanly, goes down if you crash into other drivers. It might be strange at first, but it certainly helps to transform you into a clean racer, making you drive like the gentleman driver the sport expects you to.

The multiplayer mode is decent, thanks to the rating system. There are official races (where you get competition points for winning that improve your driver rating) and non-official, where only the safety rating gets deducted or increased and, the track and car control related ratings. Server owners can set a minimum amount of safety rating points so that people with low SA can’t join and ruin the race by crashing into everyone, making it so most races are trouble-free. This doesn’t mean that incidents don’t happen, they are just less encouraged because the perpetrators get punished.

As far as additional content goes, there’s a DLC that brings the International GT series and 4 new tracks, another one with GT4 cars (11 of them!), and a British GT DLC that replicates the 2019 BGT season as accurately as it can be, along with three new tracks. For their respective price tags, one could say it’s a whole lotta bang for the buck, transforming a very complete GT experience into an even more refined product.

Assetto Corsa Competizione, like fine wine, got better over time.

+10/10 would recommend it
+ great all rounder (graphics, gameplay, realism, FFB effects)

+ great track quality and track conditions evolution

Cons:
- small selection of car class (probably next assetto corsa will fix that, as ACC is basically a GT only game)
- the online rating system is punishing both players, no matter who is at fault
- optimisation could be a little bit better

Finally, Kunos Simulazioni has done an amazing job. This is the best driving sim at the moment. It has everything: realistic driving, incredible feeling, superb sound, amazing tracks, astonishing graphics, plenty of FPS, and, for me and my needs, more than expected VR quality. Moreover, the competition, either online and offline, has been developed perfectly, including the rating system. Now let’s hope the servers fill their grids with racing drivers because now the game deserves it.
My review was negative from the very moment they lied to us because they delivered a beta product as an “official release”, abandon VR completely, and set at the back of the to-fix list many features that were promoted from the very beginning. Their commitment was there, I cannot lie, they kept delivering updates after updates, yet none of them was aimed at improving the disastrous VR, which, as I mentioned before, is a must-have feature in any sim-racing game. So, I have kept my negative review until today. After 9 hours of racing the new BMW GT3 2022 on a TV and on VR over two days, I am satisfied with the result of the latest 1.18.2 update which is a breakthrough in terms of quality and FPS.
Thanks to the implementation of DX12 and nVidia DLSS, now the game is amazing.
I can race a full grid view, epic-level graphic settings (using the recommended GForce Experience settings) on a Samsung 52in TV screen at 100+ FPS and a resolution of 3840x2160.
Furthermore, I can race viewing 18 cars, most graphic setting at mid-level and some and high-level graphic settings on my Vive Pro VR headset at 70+ FPS.
My PC is not anymore the top of the brass, but decent enough to let me enjoy my racing passion:
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz   3.19 GHz
32.0 GB RAM, Z370 Aourus Ultra Gaming WiFi
nVidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
Windows 11 21H2

I should mention that for me Kunos Simulazioni deserves a special mentioned for their relentlessness; they kept working on ACC, heard all the enthusiast like me complaining about many things and fix them, and more importantly finished the game (well, I guess we will have more updates, but now there is a solid game base).
Sadly they did not do the same with AC, which was completely abandon in order to create and develop ACC. Hopefully they will return to AC and finish it or, as I have heard, create an AC2 using the knowledge acquired through the painful development of ACC.
Congratulations to Kunos Simulazioni and all the sim-racing fans, we have an outstanding game to race, and a benchmark for the competition.
See you on the race track.

I always hated how easy it was to skid out in Project Cars 2.

I'm 13 hours into Assetto Corsa Competizione, having played a few endurance races, and a majority with the Audi R8 LMS Evo on Nurburgring, and I enjoy this game much more.
The physics feel so much nicer, braking, steering, and even ABS and TC feel much more authentic. Tire pressure and temperatures also feel vastly superior to Project Cars 2's model.
I know in this game, that if I happen to make a mistake, it's entirely my own fault that forced it.

My only complaint (and I'm not entirely sure if it's my roughness/aggressiveness in racing sims or it's an AI issue) is that the AI tend to be overly-aggressive/ ignorant of where you are. There are times I take an alternate racing line to accommodate the AI's racing line and respect their space, but they overstep their own line, and either take me out, or force me to emergency brake. I feel like I know enough about racing lines and racing safety that this isn't entirely my fault when these incidents occur. These AI are on 0% aggression setting.

Nonetheless, I still enjoy the game for what it is, and can forgive the setbacks for the amazing physics and gameplay that it offers over other racing sims.

As a fan of GT World Challenge series and GT3 cars in general, this game is awesome, and is my main racing game from now on. It's everything I want in a racing simulator especially used with my Logitech G920 racing wheel.",1609346830,1637800350,True,9,0,0.628977119922637939,0,True,False,False

Previous Post - Negative feedback
Looks and sounds awesome, But unfortunately its an FPS killer in VR....barely get pass 60 fps. and i am running i9-11900F RTX 3080, 32 GB RAM, NVme, Reverb G2 

I blame the simulation and my hardware, so i guess until they find some performance in it, guess ill park this one, and keep AMS2, AC, IRacing where i have a solid 90 FPS.

The physics definitely don't feel like Mario Kart or Sonic and Sega All Star Racing Transformed, which are the racing games I was most familiar before that. I also played F1 2018 and 2021 after I bought a racing wheel,  but those games didn't feel similar either. When I started out this game, I thought the way to win was going into corners with full speed, crashing into the other cars since there are no power ups to take the competition down and also getting an exit at near full speed but somehow it didn't work as well. In fact, crashing into other cars is no good at all! 

There's also a morale meter called the safety rating, if you are a good guy, it gets higher, if you are too clingy aka touchy (which is a criminal offense) it gets lower. Why does it matter? If your safety rating is low, you get put in with other bad guys in online races, who crash into you with no remorse. So in a way, it's like being put in a prison of convicts if your SR is below 60. Right now, I'm doing mostly community service in single player mode as of now to get to that acceptable member of the racing society status to get out of prison. It's a long grind. 100+ hours and I finally got to around 50. I was never incarcerated, but it still feels like a realistic depiction of the state prison system. 

So, as of now, I matured, and I realised that winning in ACC  is basically all about surviving corner 1. You also have to keep track of your tires and brakes to keep consistent track times, so there's definitely a survival aspect to it. There's also pit-stops. which are definitely the most nerve-wrecking, horror-influenced aspect of the game next to corner 1. Think of Silent Hill when the world turns foul. I'm a big fan of Silent Hill, so I appreciate this homage. If you don't get into the pit correctly, the mechanics bump your car into position. I guess that counts as a bumpscare. 

The handiling is amazing once you get used to it. This part of the game is basically a dating simulator. Dating with pieces of metal. Oh and I'm definitely into metal.  I like the Ferrari GT 488 because it doesn't make me feel like I'm walking on egg shells. The Porsche 911 is good too, but a bit more sassy, but also speedier in the straights to compensate for its temperament, basically a hot-blooded Italian. My first car was the Reiter R-ex in career mode which I choose purely based on looks and it wasn't very nice at all. Felt like one of those abusive super-attractive girlfriends that you stick with for far too long. ""Oh, it will work out somehow!!! It has to.""  We all had a relationship like that at one point. I was about to give up on the game and give it a bad review around 20 hours into the game because of it. Well, I dumped the Reiter R-Ex for the aforementioned cars which have more inner beauty and the game became really fun. The Lamborghini sucks as well, moves like a tank. Curves are beautiful? Yes, but not with this car, cause it has no curves. The Aston Martin is quite awesome! A bit like a mix between the 488 and 911. I haven't tried the others yet. 

The sounds are good. I wish there was more of a wind feedback though. I feel that's missing in every racing game I checked out so far.

Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10. I never give out 10s because they don't exist so that's pretty close to perfection. I wish it had a more colorful and engaging story mode. Otherwise, it's pretty good, very fun to play. A mix of survival Horror, dating Sim and a racing game all in one.

On mid/lower end PCs the game doesn't look so hot. Driving and FFB feels decent enough on most cars. Unfortunately, the devs messed up in two very important places, multiplayer and VR support, which lead most in the sim community to spend their time racing on other platforms.

[b]TL;DR -[/b] If you like racing against real people and/or racing in VR is important to you it's a no brainer to go for iRacing over ACC. iRacing is leagues ahead of ACC in both those key areas. If you're the type that only likes to race AI and you don't mind being limited to only racing on 2D flat panels ACC may be a better fit for you. 


[b]MULTIPLAYER ISSUES -[/b]
Personally, I find that racing against AI gets pretty boring very fast. They become very predictable and it's pretty easy to cheese your way past them. Racing against AI causes many people to form all types of bad habits which can be very dangerous if they ever end up racing vs real people (in the real world or in sims). Racing real people just adds so much more depth and complexity to races that it's a night and day difference when it comes to replayability and enjoyment. Winning a race against peers who tried everything to stay ahead of you is much more rewarding than winning against the same old AI that lets you dive up the inside on every corner.

Very few people play multiplayer on ACC. So it becomes very hard to find a server with decent ping, more than 5 or 6 racers, and on a track you want to play. There is usually only one or two servers that are populated enough to play on at a time. They are almost always racing at either Monza or Spa (because those are the most popular tracks) but being forced to run the same two tracks with the same cars gets boring very fast. There is also a huge variance in both the skill and safety levels of the drivers in these servers. So for the vast majority of races you will be crashed into on the first few turns but if you manage to avoid this you'll likely be all by yourself for the rest of the race as the few people left will either be doing dramatically faster or slower laps than you.

The only way to get decent MP races on ACC is to spend a bunch of time on discord and reddit looking for racing leagues that fit your skill level and schedule. Even then you'll only get one or two decent races a week. To put things into perspective on iRacing (ACC's biggest competitor), you can hop on 24/7 and find dozens of great races with people at your skill and safety level. People take sim racing much more seriously on iRacing which leads to much closer and fun racing. Not to mention the platform has a much bigger selection of cars and race types than ACC. 


[b]VR ISSUES -[/b]
The devs have put little to no effort into VR despite marketing that this game supports it. If you have gotten used to racing with a proper VR set-up you know its almost impossible to got back to racing on flat 2D monitors. When ACC released, there was pretty large backlash over how awful VR was on the game. Devs said they would continue to optimize it for better performance (which was the one reason I did not refund the game) but here we are 2.5 years after the game's initial release and the devs have still done basically nothing to improve the game's terrible VR experience. I have and Valve Index (which has a relatively low pixel count compared to most modern VR headsets) and even with a 3090 and a Ryzen 9 3900x I can only get a choppy 70 fps with all the graphics settings on low/med - it's a very choppy, pixelated mess that is literally unplayable.

[b]COMPARED TO IRACING -[/b]
To put things into perspective, I can play iRacing at a buttery smooth 120 fps in VR with graphics pretty much maxed out. It provides a much more immersive experience and better races with real people. So it's hard for me to find a reason to ever play ACC again. Yeah, iRacing can get pricey but I bought both iRacing and ACC around the same time ~2.5 years ago. Since that time, I have played ACC for 37 hours (Over 10 of those hours were spent testing different graphics and FFB settings. Trying to get to get VR to not stutter and/or checking if things had improved after updates. Actual playtime closer to 25 hrs) and in the same period, I have almost played 3000 hours of iRacing. So while I have spent about 5x-6x more money on iRacing over the years than ACC, I've also played iRacing about 100x more than ACC. Meaning iRacing's cost per hour of entertainment is at least an order of magnitude less expensive than ACC. So for me, iRacing provides a much better experience for less money.

If racing real people and/or racing in VR is important to you its a no brainer to go for iRacing over ACC. If you prefer to race AI on flat panels ACC may be a better fit for you.",1637280798,1637281073,False,8,4,0.492102324962615967,0,True,False,False

Great racing in Multiplayer (competition server).

The guys know how to stay safe. Sure, sometimes their will be some contact, but its ok. People mostly are fair, because you need a high rating to join the competition server.

That said, however, ACC is certainly worth getting and trying out. The cars are brilliantly made. Each one is different, feels different, handles different and more. I went through the cars to find those that suit my and my driving style, and there are quite a few cars to choose from. It really takes a lot of trial and error, but is very rewarding when you finally start to do well and understand your car. It's also a pleasure to listen to the car's soundtrack.

The weather effects and lighting are slightly superior in Project Cars 2.

The tracks in ACC are very similar to the iRacing versions since both use laser scanning, but the kerbs are generally more detailed and accurate in ACC. For example, turn 6 at Hungaroring is missing the orange sausage kerb in iRacing but it is present in ACC.

The force feedback is greatly improved compared to the initial release and it gives me enough confidence to try to learn trail braking without fearing I'll crash on every occasion. Also, it's much easier to recover control when pushing a bit too hard compared to iRacing, where only the smallest mistakes can be corrected.

No modding WTF!!! only gt cars really!!! & handling is sub par !!! what about VR i hear you say well its a shambles it runs the worst of any vr game i have ever had with a 2080ti ?
in our racing community with over 200 members its called ashito corsa competition ozone layer !!!!! cool story 1/10 kuno idiots you made a triple AAA title into a triple peice of shit!!! only thing i wish is i had  played under to 2 hrs and not had hope in updates as i could have returned to get my money back to by better cars in raceroom or iracing.
heres an idea kunos how about releasing a patch that actually fixes this rubbish game like maybe fix the VR would be a good start.",1589367008,1632389857,False,2,7,0.416927903890609741,1,True,False,False

Compared to Assetto Corsa the menus and details as well as accessibility is far better. 
Some settings like ffb and button mapping is kinda confusing and not that great.
The ffb.....well i was disappointed to an extent due to the lack of detail and i couldn't find an option to make my racing wheel have a heavier feel.
Once you're in the car and start drive and not comparing the ffb to Assetto Corsa then this game is amazing and just beautiful. The cars feel amazing with realistic sounds and you just feel racy and captured in the moment. This game just makes you want to push further and improve lap by lap. 

My problem though was the performance of this game. On normal free practice the game ran fine with minimal stuttering. But once i added AI, the game became completely unplayable. My pc does meet the minimum requirements and my gpu is actually abit above the minimum requirement.

- It doesn't teach you how to calibrate your wheel and pedals properly.
- It has inconsistent braking points, most of which are too early.
- The traction control doesn't really work properly. I tried it on all the variations and even on the highest settings it still spins you out on some corners and unnecessarily stops you accelerating on others.
- It randomly decides how many clean laps you do on the tutorial. Sometimes it says 1/3, and then suddenly, halfway through a lap, it says 0/3 or 2/3. They also have to be consecutive, even thought the game doesn't tell you that. Without leaving the track, you can go from having 2/3 clean laps to 0/3, for no apparent reason.
- The game doesn't tell you if your lap is invalidated, should you leave the track.

Positives:
- Good graphics and car noises.
- Aside from the traction control and the other random bs, the driving within the game is as realistic as possible.

Yes - I'm sure this game is great with a full on rig with a wheel and pedals and screens all around and dolby digital all-round surround sound. But with a controller, (with steering assist enabled - don't email me), you can have a blast racing against a full field of bots, that can be made as challenging as you desire.

Realism can be dialled up, pit stops, weather, etc (would recommend), but racing crucially remains close and aggressive. As everyone says this is a great racing SIM. But with a few controlled tweaks, it's as easy to drive as F1 202*, challenging but forgiving. Worth getting.

This game saves me from all that other nonsense and hope the next DLC will be great too like a Zandvoort 2021 season update and perhaps the Nordschleife one day with the DTM league and a Safety Car with a more realistic yellow flag procedure. Not to forget Le Mans!! Too much great things to add right.

In terms of vehicle feel and track behavior it feels very detailed and every little adjustment does something. Also the track details like bumps and detailed track features that make a certain track special can be found ingame due to the laser scanning project done on the real locations. F1 does not have that in this detail for instance. Day/night temperature and even tire air temperature has noticeable effect in how it feels and handles, where your optimums are.
Some tracks are very specific and might not see them elsewhere like Bathurst for instance.

Visually great too with too many nerd options to tweak it just right for your taste. Many great cars with some specials in the DLC like the Reiter or the KTM. Love the liveries in this game.

With a lot of AI in single player mode the game can become stuttery and feels like that has a lot to do with optimization perhaps. Hope that is in the pipeline for improvement on the PC port. It becomes less or goes away with less AI, but damn a full field with GT3 and GT4 mixed and a shitload of cars on the track is a lot of fun even flashing high beams at AI for lolz. Bet they can hear you when you make fun of them. The AI is very pragmatic though like I miss the unexpected things humans do unless you trigger them to react. AI on AI with updates who is kicking some bum when elsewhere on the track would be nice for immersion.

This title has no flashback features as some other games. When you are used to having that you could cheat your dumb mistakes by going back in time 10 seconds, but this game no. No more cheating muppets! You can still evaluate the race recording after the race.
At first you miss it maybe, but it also forces you to become better or just always lose like Mario in the 80's with 3 lives and no game saves. Turning off damage in single player mode is something to get around it, but you will still fall behind due to human stupidity. Love it.

Before going online the game wants you to learn tracks and techniques first too by a scoring system, before you have a minimum score level at knowing what the yoink you are doing before joining a multi-player server.

Different years and classes, short races, 24 hour races, 2 hours, whatever rocks your socks.

It does not have a campaign with a story line, but that is fine. This is pure racing with realism.
Solo play has a lot of features and sponsored events like LogitechG challenge competition and other things.

The sound design in and around the vehicles between the different brands seem to be as realistic as possible. That Aston Martin V12, Reiter and Maserati as well as all others give you a sound that might be very real.

All cars have their own specific settings with a few presets programmed for u, but beware not all presets might do what they do what they promise due to your own driving style like forgiving stability or unforgiving advanced setting that could get better lap times.
After some derping around with all the individual adjustments you can get handy at it when you know the a car and tracks a little bit with preset saving so once you found what feels right that's it.
It also has things like fuel load so you need to keep an eye on how much fuel you bring. 80 liters for a qualy hot lap is bs of course when you need to perform within 3 laps. Some things are not documented ingame like the specific engine mode settings for each car. The vehicle setup screen can have some more specific explanation, however exploring it all for science without a manual is great too. You lap times will not lie.

At this moment most def. the top race SIM for me with a new experience of looking into the GT3 and GT4 classes of racing. 

This is one of those titles that actually warm you up for the more expensive playseat gear. Personally I play it with a settings optimized PS4 Dual Shock 4 controller with gyro functionality and by using all the little detail settings you can really tweak it very good so it feels just right. So no expensive gear needed when you want to step away from the controller joystick and want to steer with gyro for that level up in control, because most other do seem to have better gear to play this and you can see on the track who that is by results.

I used to think this was an Italian car racing game only keeping me from looking into it, but boy what was I wrong! Great game Italians! MOAAAAR",1630659723,1630664491,True,9,1,0.62798774242401123,0,True,False,False

- Changes to TC/ABS/BB show up on your dashboard in real time. 
- Each car has it's own MAP settings.
- Each car has it's own TC settings. Some cars have TC Cut along with  your standard TC.
- Your driver's hands reach out to the actual respective buttons on the steering or side panel, whenever you change something (like TC/ABS/BB/Lights).
- There are multiple dash pages to cycle through to suit your needs.
- You can configure the RACELOGIC as per your requirement during the session.
- You can feel even the smallest changes that  you make to your car's setup.
- Tyre temperatures and Brake Temperatures are very well simulated. Brake temperature can leak onto the tyre temperature and heat them up.
- The weather engine is fleshed out and everything looks spectacle. 
- The windshield VFX are pretty darn good. 
- Every track is laser scanned.
- The sound design is phenomenal (you can even hear the chassis flex sometimes)

I can keep going but I think you get the idea. Out of all the sims that I've driven, ACC has been the best one yet. Physics is good, just like some other sims out there but little things that I've mentioned above make it stand out more than anything that is available in the market.

The GT experience is captured authentically, if that's what you're after then it's a great game and encourage you to buy it.

For example... Want to jump on a track with a friend and have a blast one on one? to do this, you'll end up running game servers yourself, running your own chat app and trying to bring it all together. It's a lot of faff and you end up spending more time in setup than you do enjoying it's fruits. 

Other major call-out would be the lack of ghost support. It's very rewarding to drill a track in time practice mode, but you're left with little clue of how you might compare to others or how you might compare to prior laps. Also means you end up on youtube to discover new lines etc.

Just as preface, I'm on the newer side when it comes to realistic racing games, so that'll probably influence my review.

This game has been a masterclass in GT racing, and racing in general. My ""sim racing career"" thus far has been limited to the F1 games, so it was neat to expand my library. In the beginning of my ACC experience, I figured I should customize the settings, of which there were quite a lot. I guess this is because the game is realistic, so this is expected, but I was impressed with the amount of settings and preferences available. In other words, no matter what kind of set-up, computer, or play-style you have, you can make it work in ACC. Furthermore, regarding the settings for each race session, there are many, from hot-laps, to quick 15 minute races, to full 24 hour endurance races, and everything in between. As far as the cars go, the variety available is nice, as one can find a car that works for them. The liveries are plentiful as well, and if you aren't able to settle on one, you can make your own. It is rather limited in terms of what you can do, but I won't complain about my glossy purple Huracan GT3 that I use almost exclusively (at the time of writing). Along with cars, you can also customize your 3 drivers, so that your entire GT team can be of your own design. To touch on my racing experiences in this game, I must say it has been spectacular. It has been both a fun time and learning experience. At the time of writing, let's say I've exceeded track limits more times than I'm willing to mention in my quest to build consistency, but that is okay. I have had to hit the ground running in this game, but in some cases, like this one, that's the best way to learn. Full immersion. I have found myself frequenting multiplayer servers, as I enjoy online interactions, but more-so because I want to dive right in. I've encountered fellow novice drivers, but also advanced drivers, whom I like to try to keep up with during practice and qualifying. After maybe a few turns, I end up skidding out, but I don't let that stop me. I get back on the track and keep going, and perhaps I will find another professional to attempt to tail, but, I digress. Pretty much, ACC has given me both an engaging racing atmosphere as well as a drive (no pun intended) to improve. Speaking of online experiences, I must mention the community. In my several hours of online driving, I've only been hit by a dirty driver once. In one lobby, I recall talking with the other players, making remarks on each other's lap times and such. Additionally, the game's subreddit (and player-base in general) seems to be really great. Many more experienced drivers are willing to help those who are less experienced. In a sense, they will help you in individual practice to get you going, and they will help you with anything you need right up until the green flag, where they will then stop helping you to focus on the race. But they will be there for you afterwards.

If you're a fan of racing and haven't played ACC yet, I recommend this to you. It is likely that you'll have to devote some time to this game though, for practicing and for racing itself. My favorite part out of my current 20.2 hour playtime has been the several cases of close-quarters racing. Driving in close proximity around a circuit while trying to overtake but not go off the track or collide with others is truly awesome. The adrenaline of racing, really, is the best part about ACC.",1624937879,1629057765,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

In terms of graphics, and UI/UX experience, having played AC, ACC is a much, much more smoother and polished experience than AC. It even has a Career, which makes this a game, rather than just a simulation like AC. The UI is finally good it looks like a modern game. The setup customization is so much more polished and it gives you so much more details. When AC looks like a game from 2012, this looks and feels like a modern game from 2019+.

In terms of simulation, I've never been a simulation expert, so you'll have to look other comments from people who feel more comfortable speaking about it.

tl;dr: You're forgiving the game more often than the game is forgiving you. Feel like this game would be more popular than GTR if it were more welcoming to new players.

I picked up sim racing about a month ago with Gran Turismo Sport. After a couple of days playing I was pretty much hooked. It's been a lot of fun learning about the racing world, driving techniques and trying to improve myself. I started racing online and while I'm definitely still a noob, I was enjoying it immensely. After the latest update to GTS though, the online penalty system broke and has become a total wreck-fest in my driver ranking group. So, I figured I'd pick up something for the PC and after doing some research I ended up with AC & ACC.

First off, the driving simulation itself is great and I highly recommend it. I'm liking the realism and I can clearly see why AC is the creme-de-la-creme of racing sims. My problems with the game really start to stem out of how the game itself is set up and the problems it's giving me before I can even start racing.

1. Every time I boot up the game, my driving wheel is off. The game seems to have a bad habit of throwing off my wheel's calibration. I open up the game, go to race only to find my wheel's off center. I have to back out of the game, spend 20 minutes calibrating the wheel before I can even get going. It's immensely frustrating. 

2. You have to know to set your wheel up properly. If your wheel/pedals aren't set up appropriately you're going to have a bad time. When I first booted up the game and started career mode, I was clocking about 2:06 in the Monza tests compared to the AI's 1:56. At first I contributed to the fact that I must have really just sucked at the game, but come to find out that the wheel/pedals just weren't set properly. After doing some research, I finally got it set up and almost instantly shaved 6 seconds off that time. The problem here is that I had to spend time outside of the game to even come to that realization. 

3. Career mode just seems awful. I'm not expecting some grand and immersive career mode, but there just doesn't seem to be any progress. After you finish the first tests that set the AI level, etc, you get to select a car to use during the course of your career, but you can't seem to change it after you've selected it. If you're like me and totally new to this, you need to be able to experiment, go back and try things differently, but that option just doesn't seem to be available. If you select the wrong car and want to change it, you have to start career mode all over.

4. Sometimes it seems too realistic. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes it just sounds like the engines in these cars are about to fall out of the underside, or like there's just gravel all up in the engine. It's incredibly distracting when you feel like the engine is about to break out of every turn you come out of.

5. The track competency system doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense and my laps seems to get invalidated for the tiniest mistakes. In the early career mode tests at Monza my laps kept being invalidated coming out of turn one and I just could not figure out why, even if I felt like I took the turns perfectly.

6. The game doesn't seem to be too keen on explaining the basics to you. During the first race at Zurburing, after spending a number of hours even getting through free practice and qualifying, I was doing pretty well, but I almost missed my pit window. I had 0 idea that I needed to pit. Pitting's fine, I just wasn't aware and it cost me my position in the race and I finished in last. At that point I was at least happy I had actually finished a race, but now it's like ok, I'd like maybe a course on pitting or something. I don't want to have to get out of the game and search youtube videos or something to learn how to do this stuff.

Overall, I really want to like the game, it just feels like there's a mountain to climb to even get there. I guess they expect you to have a basic working knowledge of racing sims before you even get the game. I think it would really benefit from a plug-n-play style like Gran Turismo while also having the capability of being a full blown sim racer.",1628346710,1628356946,True,64,4,0.768526136875152588,4,True,False,False
