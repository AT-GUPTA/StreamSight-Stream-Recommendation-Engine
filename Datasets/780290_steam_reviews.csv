It was when the console versions were released that the developers apparently stopped caring about the PC game because it has been nearly unplayable ever since.

You can restart rounds, but only at certain points, which feels kind of arbitrary to me. You can just be unlucky at times and it is possible to deal no damage at all, because there is no mechanic to prevent to draw x0 attack modifiers all the time.

Then there is a bug, that after some turns the camera rotates. Sometimes it's often, sometimes not. 

It's also still unclear to me, in which cases you can attack 'through the wall' or around a corner. 

I miss an ingame wiki or encyclopaedia, where the basic game rules are explained.
And please fix this rotation bug, this is so annoying, especially because the rotation always happens, while manual rotation is blocked, so you have to wait some time to rotate back!

Also there is one thing I am not yet certain of: If you are bad, then you can grind your way through the levels.. but as you gain levels, the game also becomes harder. At the same time, you can lose reputation and get little gold, which in total may lead to the game becoming even harder after 'grinding'..

A lot of emotion blasts during gameplay, especially when you barely barely make it in the last turn on the hardest level - damn, what a flow of emotions goes through you, can't even describe.

Each character is unique, with own battle mechanics, with their flaws, I mean one character may suit well for one quest and at the same time is very bad for another one. So it's cool to always keep balance in a squad.

First, the game mechanics -- this game is a lot of fun. I don't normally go in for cooperative games, but I've really been enjoying this one. Every scenario, it feels like the choices are important, and the game has a really clever exhaustion mechanic for making decisions count. The tactical variations amongst the various classes you can play are interesting, I don't at all consider myself a Gloomhaven expert -- I've played maybe 50 or so scenarios (some of them repeatedly), and all I can say is so far, the play has been very well balanced, interesting, and challenging. You really feel like you've done something when you get a win with a character down to his or her last remaining hit point. It's a really good game system.

I'm older, and I played a lot of tabletop role playing and war games when I was young. Compared to those, the rules for Gloomhaven don't seem all that complicated, but I'm sure for someone just starting out with these kind of games, it would be more challenging. This computer version has a great tutorial, which I thought made the game mechanics very clear and easy to learn.

I've played the tabletop version of Gloomhaven as well -- again, I'm no expert, but this port seems really solid. It feels really good, and in many ways, the computer version is far easier to play, just because of the great tutorials and hints, and the fact that the computer keeps track of the bookkeeping and whatnot. Also, the computer version supports having multiple games going at the same time (many of the choices you make in the game affect the world of the game, and change the available options). It's really nice to be able to have multiple versions going without any special bookkeeping. The feel of the play is very good, it feels like the tabletop game, and as far as I know, the experience is identical.

Anyway, I bought this on sale, but knowing what I know now, I would absolutely have happily paid full price. A really fun, challenging game system, and a really good port of that system to computer. Highly recommended for those of you who enjoy turn based tactical games.",1705245631,1705245631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whoever designed this game succeeded in ruining the experience of what should be an awesome game.

What should a game do when the save file is weird? Probably not permanently delete ALL your save files including older versions, right?
Well, apparently Gloomhaven Digital if, on loading the main menu, thinks the save file is 'corrupt', it then practically deletes it by moving EVERYTHING to a ""corrupted saves"" folder and changing the format so it can no longer be used. It doesn't ask you if you want to do this, it just does it.

WHO IS THIS GAME FOR:
+ People who like turn based games, classic cRPGS, min-maxing their decks (yes, it is a hybrid of isometric cRPG with card game) and builds.
+ People who have a LOT of time or have no problem playing a one year campaign when playing 1-2 times per week with friends.
+ You tried the tabletop version, but it was too much of a hassle to set it up each time.

WHO IS THIS GAME NOT FOR:
- People who like fast paced games and action. Anybody who gets bored quickly or don't have a patience to wait 15 minutes for his move.
- People who don't play well with others
- People looking for a good story

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVIEW:
Interesting mechanics, challenging. Some missions can be a breeze, and some You will replay several times. My advice is to pick missions depending on your team's capabilities. On some missions, we literally won with the last card in hand and the last man standing. Many times we made a ""misclick"" kind of mistake, and thankfully the game allows you to restart the round.

I played with 3 guys and really recommend it. Nice interaction and some discussions about who takes gold,chests, etc. Game was designed so there is no ""Captain"" who throws orders, but everybody thinks for themselves, sometimes quite literally sabotaging the mission just to take more money or perk.

We almost stopped playing two times after heated discussions. Loved it.

PROS:
+ In short, mechanics, gameplay itself, and progression system!

+ Interesting, balanced and original mechanics of a limited actions because of burning cards(which are actions)
+ Good Card(skill) based character system
+ Fun!
+ Variety of enemies with really different mechanics
+ Variety of missions
+ Nice variety of items and equipment
+ Many Party combinations
+ Challenging and Rewarding


CONS:

- Too random enemy actions that can make or break missions
- Not interesting story (or maybe even non existing) - one friend after few missions stopped reading any ""lore"" and introductions to missions. He didn't miss much.
- Graphic are mediocore.
- Artstyle is quite frankly poor (most of characters look like some fanwork of a kid who doesn't know how to draw).
- Music and audio - non existent.
- UI - targeting system is an abomination (try to play Craigheart). There are two main problems with UI when targeting:
   1st- strange logic of the order of applying skills effects etc. (especially when multitargeting);
  2nd - coloring(everything when comes to targeting is yellow/orange/light red with same border on hex)

UPDATE AFTER 100 HOURS:

Worst boss ever in game history. Literally. I killed him with my eyes closed. Game got very boring in 2nd half -  everything was too easy. Money was always the problem but other stuff we had abundand of. So freaking boring.

I've never played the Gloomhaven board game IRL, I found this game from looking for turn based RPGs on Steam, and especially if you like difficulty and a lot of options with how you can assemble a party, if you are patient, there is a lot of gold here (A pile of 4 per mob you kill). Most of the missions are well balanced and quite a challenge at times on normal, but later in the game its easy to get a bit OP in certain situations so then you can crank it up to hard and it will remain tough. Even after the end of the campaign, there are many more missions left, DLC and classes to unlock. Overall a strong 8/10 from me overall, if you like turn based combat games, board games, and MtG, have some time to kill, and like to go down RPG rabbit holes, you should check this game out. 

If you like the game but your having trouble finding a party that you enjoy planning, you can look up guides for the board game to help you pick cards and build viable decks as you level up to help you get the hang of building a party. Look up a tier list and try to unlock a few of the better classes then turn up the difficulty because its honestly much more fun and dynamic than the less fun classes down in the lower tiers.

Unless these developers get this game in order, it is not worth purchasing this game. It is absolutely atrocious and I have never seen a more incomplete game. These developers can't even manage to properly allow a scenario to finish. 

Issue #1: I am on PC and friends are on XBOX X. Anytime we go from Gloomhaven to a scenario, there are road scenarios that pop up and I am immediately kicked from the group. I am unable to re-join until the host is in the room and he has to select my objective for me. 

Issue #2: As soon as I join the scenario after missing the road scenario, I pick my starting space in the scenario, I then pick my cards and I cannot ""end selection"" and the whole party has to leave the scenario and rejoin. (I know you may be thinking, ""let the host take control of your character."") This does not work either. 

Issue #3: When I am in the merchant tab and trying to buy or sell something, I can do it with no issue, but as soon as I buy or sell something, everything disappears to buy or sell. Not only does everything disappear, when I go to my inventory to equip a newly purchased item, I can no longer see my items to make changes or equip them. Also, all of my cards have disappeared after doing a transaction with the merchant. I cannot make changes to my cards or my inventory unless I leave the game and rejoin again. 

Issue# 4: The developers did an update in the past week suggesting that online play had been patched to create a smoother online experience. What has changed? I can now sell and buy things in the merchant without them disappearing. Well then what is issue #4? We are now being forced to leave a scenario 9-10 times a scenario because a mercenary will take an action and then freeze up. To the operating player, it looks as if the mercenary has done their move, but to all other players, the merc is sitting as if they haven't even started their action. It got so bad that we all just decided to quit after the 10th freeze up. 

In conclusion, My spat for years with Gloomhaven has been the ability to get it to the table. The digital copy is a great way to get Gloomhaven to the ""table"" more often. That being said, it is near impossible to even complete a scenario without having major hiccups along the way. Prior to the update, the game was frustrating, but manageable. This new update as of November 23rd has been an absolute disappointment and makes the game unplayable. I understand that games are released with errors and glitches at times, but this isn't even a finished/polished game. This is a game that should still be in development. I'm trying to understand why this is even available to play? The decision-makers at this company said, ""Well, we gave publishers/creators a deadline for release, and even though we aren't finished, we are just going to release it with bugs and all."" There is also a chance that quality control, alpha/beta testers are just lazy and didn't even check to see if their game worked. I guess gone are the days when we got a complete game. This is a massive disappointment and I would wait to purchase this until this is more polished. Keep an eye out for other reviews and patch notes.

The digital edition replicates the extensive Gloomhaven campaign in its entirety, adds a completely new mode, Guildmaster, along with online multiplayer. Although it is impossible to replicate the magic of sitting around a table, designing it to work on a screen offers things that a boxed board game would never offer.

The game is a dungeon crawler at heart, where fantasy stories and adventure read by a deep Scottish narrator sit alongside tactical missions that take adventurers through a series of rooms and monsters to accomplish quite simple objectives. Everything between missions is a ‘choose your own adventure’, where decisions are made and give static bonuses or penalties for the campaign as a whole or for the next adventure.

The simple campaign mode is engaging enough to keep you coming back night after night as you plot an epic fantasy, building the city of Gloomhaven and watching your adventurers level up, retire, and be replaced by fresh blood. The Guildmaster mode is new to Gloomhaven and should tempt even a board game veteran, as well as the integrated level designer and modding support.

Although it is perfectly fun to play with friends, Guildmaster is actually a purpose-built way to experience all of Gloomhaven alone. It is not voiced, and the story is much looser, but it has its own advantages: your characters never retire, so you can tinker with them at will, and the scenarios are randomized, allowing you to do similar crawls multiple times without literally repeating the same settings.

Both modes can be played by yourself controlling one to four adventurers, or with up to three others controlling one each. The dungeons are tactical battles driven by cards, some of the best you can find, that use a flexible system where you choose two cards per adventurer each turn, then perform the action from the top half of one card and the bottom half of the other.

In summary, Gloomhaven is a digital game that offers a classic board game experience for one or more players in an almost flawless way. If you like turn-based strategies and dark fantasy, Gloomhaven is the game for you.",1699368871,1699368871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[see EDIT at the bottom]

Since last patch multiplayer is crashing and desynching a few times during a single scenario which is highly unpleasant . Up until last update it was going flawlessly. Unfortunately it is for now almost unplayable for me since this game really shines in my opinion while playing with friends.

As soon as the Devs bring it  to the previous stable state  again I will change my review to ""recommended"" since this game is very fun, strategic and difficult in a good way.

Buy it if you plan to play it singleplayer.

If you want to share the experience with friends you should wait for a fix.

You can do this, Devs. I believe in you...

Much like how some people think the ""souls-like"" genre are the best games ever; despite them being virtually unplayable for the majority of gamers because they're too ""casual"". 

The game really can be fun; but this game def wants EVERY aspect of it to feel difficult.

*Your turns? very limited: considering you're losing cards of your deck permanently (within the scenario) and when that ticking clock runs out; your guy is dead (HP doesnt matter). 
*Your badass abilities? All pretty much 1 time uses (again, per scenario) and therefore shortening the literal lifespan of your character in terms of ROUNDS you have to meet the objectives.
*The gear? Impossible to know in terms of seeing what you can earn in missions without a Fail Run to witness the match before re-attempting; or just straight up ""looking it up"" on the internet to find needed improvements based on whatever Merc you're trying to upgrade. And the merchants gear usually costs you a couple of scenarios worth of gold for a ""basic"" item - in which is SOULBOUND to that specific merc that had to LITERALLY PICK UP each little stack of gold during a mission where your turns to complete the objective are much more limited than usual in terms of other games in this genre. 
* Character improvements? Mind-numbingly SLOW. You undoubtedly can just grind it out and spend DOZENS of hours just chipping away for XP/GOLD from failed missions to just get better over time. And your merc will start feeling like a badass inevitably. At least until you ""Finish their Mission"" in which case you LOSE THE CHARACTER and have to start over with a New Merc straight ""MONSTER RANCHER FLUFF THE CLOCK WITH DEATH LOOPING YOUR INVESTMENT"" style. Of course, you do unlock ""new mercs"" which are unique and have cool new gameplay elements and such; like finding new pokemon later in the game. MUCH LATER. Like 20 hours later...

Despite what looks like a rant above: im dead serious. The game is good - and works well considering how complicated it is compared to typical ""Tactics"" games. But I wouldnt recommend this to normal players. I wouldnt recommend it to people who are looking for a fun time. 
I'd recommend it to the EGO players, the CHESSMATERS of the genre - the guys who are willing to block out the world and play the same game for thousands of hours with little-to-no communication from the outside world as they immerse themselves in a hardcore grind of a RPG where only a few players where ever truly master or even ""beat"" the game due to its complexity, challenge, and length. 

I for one, go in for a scenario or two every once in a while; but knowing the grind ahead of me: I have no desire to jump straight back in day-after-day.

I have only recently started so I don't know what the previous state was but right not it is a problem.

This game has one job above all else: be a digital copy of the boardgame.
Not with a twist, not inspired by, as far as rules go, a 1:1 copy.
And right now it just isn't.

The boardgame is a precarious balancing act with a rulebook with 80 pages and it assumes all of the rules are being followed in its balancing.
But the game straight up violates the rules time and time again.
So even if you don't care about the boardgame, the balance of this very hard game is broken since the rules are not followed.

One example: you can give yourself the ability to draw 2 cards instead of one and pick the better card for the damage.
This is something you usually need to setup so it requires a decent payoff to be worth it,
I have seen the game pick the card that is worse multiple times.
So if you have the choice between +2 damage and a critical miss then the ""advantage"" you get is to miss.

Right now, coming from the boardgame with experience, I can still finish the scenarios and nothing gamebreaking has happened yet. But I don't need to softlock myself to say: wait till the recent reviews start talking about fixes.

The game itself is quite buggy even after years of development. Scenarios don't match the official book in many places, they re-balanced things with no option to reset them to vanilla rules, and in many situations where you would have an option in the tabletop game, you don't get an option in this game.

For example, there's a scenario where all 4 players are split up into 4 different zones and can't get to each other. In the table top game, you can choose who starts where because each of the 4 zones is unique. In this game, you can't. Another example is when your character's initiative is tied with an enemy's. No choice given to decide who goes first, the game just picks for you.

They also added workshop support near release but now pretty much every mod is broken and unfixable. This is the first game I've seen who has essentially removed workshop support by just breaking everything and giving modders no tools/ways to repair them.

Lastly, the multiplayer is laggy and slow when playing with other people. Every input feels super sluggish and makes it painful to get through menus when all 4 players have to click things. This game does crash and soft lock itself in multiplayer quite often too. The 2 crashes we experienced in the past week were:
1. Player left the game while we were on the post-scenario stat screen. Required a game reload and had to replay the last turn of combat again.
2. When a player unlocked a new class the game crashed, once again requiring us reload the game completely and replay the last turn of a scenario.",1664862259,1697743434,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The upside is most issues are resolved, though my friend has had the missing tooltip bug a time or two in the last couple weeks. I can at least change my recommendation to positive because it's playable again, with the obvious 'once bit, twice shy.' The amount of content and depth in mercenary diversity, itemization, difficulty makes it quite easy to overlook having to restart a round twice across 100+ hours of gameplay now.

For context: I'd never played Gloomhaven in person nor even heard about it 'til a friend online wanted to get a group of us playing. The strategy aspect is enjoyable, the narration is entertaining, and it's generally friendly to playing solo and in a group flexibly within the same campaign. 
That said, the newest update really threw a wrench in things. There are a few prominent UI bugs that make it either incredibly difficult to play or literally impossible to perform actions. Sometimes the mouseovers stop working so you have to google what the cards do because there's no way to get them back. I had one round with Sunkeeper where after recovering an ally's discarded cards it seemingly returned sunkeeper to the card selection and I couldn't do anything but restart the round and hope it didn't bug out.

- To opt into the last pre-update version, v.28009, right-click on the game in Steam -> Properties -> BETAS and select the ""v.28009"" from the drop-down list.

- Important information: switching to the open beta or this v.28009 version might corrupt the save files if you have launched the newer version before doing it.

You simply have to do a backup of the initial save file to protect your save - Save files are located in C:\Users<USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\FlamingFowlStudios\Gloomhaven

If you are moving from the regular version of the game to Open Beta, simply create a copy of your GloomSaves folder and rename it to GloomSavesV28009.

Second - I was having TONS of fun with my buddies while playing this game until Saber took over. They released one update and broke pretty much everything. Instead of rolling that back to the previous version (leaving out their inability to literally open the game for more than 3 seconds to see that it launched to know half of the functionality was broken), they sent out an apology regarding the issues about how ""This is technically complex and we don't want to make false promises and potentially further disappoint you."" 

As far as I can tell, they don't want to roll this back because they expanded out to allow for console to work. COOL - did you regression test literally anything? No. Multiple patches later (last I saw was a few days ago), and the latest mentioned ""For anyone having trouble playing on the last updates or wanting to return to the latest pre-Saber version e.g. the same version as the latest Mac release, it is available on Steam, and here is how to opt in"" - oh, yea, did I forget to mention that people on Macs could no longer play with their friends - even in its current, broken state?

Anyway, the fix is to go into properties for the game to the BETAS area and select an old version from the dropdown. BY THE WAY - this might corrupt your save file if you switch to it, so make sure you back it up. Overall, my group decided to take multiple weeks off (usually played once a week) to hope that they fix this new dogpile of a version and stop making the people who already had a fully working game that they enjoyed to recommend that it's easier to spend hours setting up each scenario and getting together in person rather than clicking a few buttons to play anywhere at any time.

This is a great game. It's great because it's not for everyone. Exactly like a tabletop version, this is a game designed to be best-in-class experience, with no compromises to attract wider audience. 

* It requires some patience, especially at the beginning. Unique mechanics and design choices may discourage you, but give it some time and they really shine. 
* This is a dungeon crawler-puzzle game, quests are interesting, but for most time you will be figuring out how to best build your characters, team and traverse dungeons.
* This is  a game where you embrace randomness. It's part of the game. Pushing your luck gives these extra sweet moment of heroic achievements. 
* This is a game you need to learn and explore. Learning and exploration are part of the game. It pushes you out of your comfort zone. 
* This game is meant to be actively played. It does not entertain you, it's a tool you can use to entertain yourself. Don't blame the tool if you suck at using it ;)

By these traits the game delivers exceptional value and hundreds of hours of fun.


------ First review -------
192.8h on the clock. I love Gloomhaven, both digital and tabletop. Very good games. But the latest update broke it in so many places that it's almost unplayable. I can get use to UI changes (like swapping buttons locations) or some unnecessary changes that gives no value added (sounds maybe? some graphic update? I can't tell for sure. Nothing that would improve my experience).

But still - test your game before releasing it!

However, a recent update that coincided with the console launch has introduced many bugs and crashes.  Some are merely graphical, and there are many with the UI (due to the need to make it more controller-friendly), but some are so severe that they are game-breaking (my 400 hour campaign file is now corrupted and seemingly lost forever).  

The developers do seem to be actively working on addressing these issues, and state that they have hired more people to help address the new problems, but because of the significance and severity of the bugs I cannot recommend playing this in its current state.  I have submitted many bug reports myself, but there are so many that it is becoming a second job, and the hassle of playing is now outweighing my enjoyment of the game unfortunately.  

I would recommend waiting for more hotfixes and watching other players' discussions in the forums to see when (or if?) the game is stable enough to play.",1696887885,1696887885,False,10,0,0.583424687385559082,0,True,False,False

My heroes are either exhausted because they run out of cards, or because they are beaten back by some fiendishly lucky draws by the monsters, while my heroes attacks are normally 0 -1 or -2, most of the time.  I was thinking to buy 'Jaws of the Lion' and the other DLC, but now I am going to wait and see.  If I cannot play the game, why spend more money?  Don't get me wrong , I relish a challenge, but  perhaps on the hardest two levels, not the EASY level.  The game is great but I find running out of cards extremely frustrating, What you could have done is use the cards again once they were all burned, that way we would at least have a chance to win, sometimes.

This is a faithful recreating of the board game so if you're a fan of that you will like this. The big bonus being that the computer game take care of all the tedious micro management between missions. 

It is however just that, a computer version of a board game and so game play is turn bases and distinctly feels like a board game, with miniatures, cards, counters, etc. so if your not a fan of board games this probably isn't for you.

But if you do like board games then this arguable one of the best with an excellent background story line, 100's of scenarios and loads of playable chars each with their own unique set of abilities and play styles. 
This is however a gamers game, meaning it has a complex crunchy gaming system that will have you deliberating what the right action sequence is and whether now is the right time to trigger that power ability or not. 

For the most part the interface makes playing the game fairly straight forward. The only time it gets a little frustrating is when you miss click something and find you can't take an unintended action back. 
In my opinion you should be able to undo any action unless it resulted in revealing something hidden or resulted in an attack ""roll"" or taking damage. We are after all playing this game for fun not playing a rated chess tournament, if i want to undo something then just let me.

Having played more than 100 hours and still not finished the base game there is more than enough game here to satisfy. 
Playing it with friends does make it more fun but also more difficult as you really need to communicate who will be doing what or you will end up missing opportunists and taking far more damage, fortunately you can adjust difficulty level between missions allowing you to adjust for your party.

Gloomhaven the board game is hailed as one of the best board games of all time, due to it's complexity, variety and unique depth. It is also mostly unplayable unless you have a very specific set of circumstances that probably include being unemployed, having a dinner table you never use for anything else, and having a bunch of nerdy friends.

Gloomhaven digital is a fairly faithful adaptation of the board game, with the majority of the time-consuming activities like setting up the board and moving monsters fully automated. It does have a couple of bugs/inconsistencies but considering the complexity of the game this is probably still a good tradeoff.

Gloomhaven digital really shines if you can play it with 2-3 friends, as it was meant to be played in the board game. There is a fairly extensive Guildmaster mode that is completely new to digital and that has a bunch of scenarios aimed at single play, but the game's longevity lies in playing the multiplayer campaign.",1674908471,1696051658,False,2,0,0.544378697872161865,0,True,False,False

It has got some flaws but those flaws can be overlooked in the physical version of the game. Those flaws CAN NOT be overlooked in the digital version since the game is hard coded the way it is.

Probably my biggest gripe with the digital version of Gloomhaven is that you can't choose a path when your action has multiple ways of getting to the result. What I mean is, in the physical version if you have advantage during an attack and roll into (+1 and immobilize) and a (+1 and stun) you get to choose which is best. In the digital version the game seems to just randomly pick. 

Maybe you really needed the stun this attack but then the game doesn't pick it. This was clearly implemented to speed up the gameplay but it makes the game feel unfair at times. I've had several moments of attacking a monster with advantage and roll into something like (put up an element) and (curse miss) and the game freaking picks curse miss. Would I rather do 3 damage and put up an element or do no damage, which is best??? It's an obvious choice... that you don't have any voice in.

Another gripe I have is down a similar vein but revolves around summons and their movement. Same kinda deal. If there are multiple ways to get to a certain target that are the same number of spaces of movement in the physical version you can pick which is best. In the digital version again, the game just randomly picks for you. Maybe you want a summon to end in a space so another summon or character can move forward and also attack an enemy. Its usually one of two spaces next to an enemy that this happens and is not a problem in the physical version because you get to pick, as the game intended.

The game also feels like it rubber bands at times. We seem to get crit misses a lot more often in the digital version than the physical.

A lot of the Guildmaster quests feel very over tuned. if you aren't playing some strong characters some of these quests are just insanely hard even on normal difficulty. 

The digital version is also very buggy and it is pretty obvious they put more time into graphics than how the game functions. The UI is weird. There are moments where you may want to look at the board state or yours cards and just can't. Lots of actions are unclear and poorly worded which can lead to confusion and actions you may have played differently. Again something you can debate with your teammates and redo if needed, but you can't do in the digital. 

Overall, the digital version is nice for its automation of setup, who goes when etc and obviously its cost compared to the physical game LOL. But it enhances some of the flaws of the game. I'd love to see an update that adds the option to choose when there are ""ties"" or when summons move as I talked about earlier.

My group reverted to the beta branch and was able to play the game as we would have pre-update, which frankly is all we wanted.

I'm still very disappointed that this update was forced on everyone without any playtesting, in an apparent rush to meet deadlines related to the console release. Also, I've heard nothing so far about the complete disregard for everyone playing on Mac, other than a comment on the discord that this feedback was being noted and ""passed along."" I don't think that's good enough for people on Mac that have found themselves in the position of either 1) forcing their friends on PC to downgrade to the beta branch; or 2) not play in their groups at all.

So if you're on Mac, I wouldn't purchase this game until you see some reassurance that your version will continue to be supported. If you're on PC, I would say definitely play on the beta branch. The game itself is still amazing, so long as it works.

***

I've put a LOT of hours into this game, which should tell you how much I enjoy it. But I feel it's necessary to say at the moment--the ""update"" released on September 18, 2023 completely broke the game. It is evident that the devs did no testing whatsoever prior to release because the game is unplayable in its current state. Many basic mechanics like enhancements are simply inaccessible, and there are a host of UI glitches and graphical errors that would have been apparent within 60 seconds of starting the game.

So if you're interested in the game, check the discussion board and see if things have been fixed, or better yet, check if this garbage heap of an ""update"" gets rolled back until it's playable once again.

Also note that Mac players can no longer play multiplayer with PC players, and this appears to be an intentional change since the update hasn't been made available to Mac players. So if you're in a group that includes both Mac and PC, again, don't get this game until you see that this has been fixed. This is the case with my group, which infuriates me to no end since we had no warning whatsoever this would happen.",1695090126,1695519340,False,40,0,0.733818113803863525,2,True,False,False

I thought it was a pretty good game, 7/10 on BoardGameGeek. Leveling up is fun but doesn't happen all that frequently; the way your characters deteriorate in power over each scenario is a little weird. There are exciting and dramatic moments but maybe only once every 3 scenarios or so. It's a pleasant time with the right friends.

This digital adaptation is unfortunately not very good. It has lots of user experience problems - we've been playing with 4 of us weekly for several months, and we still regularly mess something up during our turns and find ourselves unable to undo, in a way that is frustrating and wouldn't happen in paper. Recently we had one entire boss fight where a major mechanic (where the boss would appear each turn) simply wasn't presented to us, and so it was very difficult to devise our tactics, which was a bizarre choice compared to the paper game. There are lots of pointless pauses after all players have confirmed where you still have to wait for no clear reasons.

Just this week, they released a ""major update"", but unfortunately that seems to have introduced at least one hard crash bug. It wasn't difficult to discover; whenever our Quartermaster used an item they had refreshed, we had a ""desynchronization"" and the game ended and dumped us to the main menu. In their Discord, it was clear that this repeated, consistent, easy to reproduce hard crash was affecting many players. We had to adjourn our game and hope that there would be a fix to this broken release before the next week.

The card mechanics are overwhelming (you have to learn essentially 22 unique actions per character just to get started with the game), the UI is confusing at times (why am I being asked to ""confirm an action"" without telling me what the action is?), and the core game design is balanced around making things as frustrating as possible for the player (looting requires you to give up your movement for the turn in most cases, you *will* eventually run out of cards so you're on a constant timer, interactions between abilities are extremely hard to grock, etc.)

The game has been far more stable in my most recent attempts to play. It's been about 10 hours of play now over two days with no crashes, so I'm happy to recommend the game.

It's hard to recommend the game right now, because while it says I've played 85 hours let's talk about what those have been.

Start game - get one mission in, get bored for a few months, return and not remember how to play.
So I start another game, and the same thing happens.
And a third time, and the same thing happens.

This weekend I finally sat down and really took the time to play. First two scenarios play well. Third scenario crashes. After the restart I discover it autosaved at the beginning of the round, so cool. I finish the third scenario, fail the fourth, redo the fourth, start the fifth...crash. Restart the fifth...crash.

When the game is playing correctly, I'm having fun, but too many crashes for me to recommend it right now.",1679881032,1690766505,True,0,0,0.498392283916473389,0,True,False,False

Pro:
The various classes, unlocks, etc. as well as the world progression mean that despite it's essentially a dungeon crawler and tactical hex combat mix, the replayability is very high.
The graphics, animations and sounds are all pretty good, and the art style works well.

Contra:
The game is unnecessarily tough with the core mechanic of limiting your deck. The difficulty level does nothing to help with this central problem, instead making enemies weaker when really, the health of the NPCs is rarely the issue. Fortunately, there's mods available to fix that, but this really should've been part of the difficulty settings or gameplay options. It can be aggravating when you lose a level despite wiping the floor with the enemies, only due to the exhaust mechanic. This is one part of the board game that could've been improved upon.
Some parts of the game can be repetitive, and when you're on your 2nd or 3rd campaign, you really wish for an accelerated start or better cutscene/dialog skip (skip all).

It's like the devs were given the choice to make sane choices but then stepped back and asked themselves how could they better fuck over the players.

When you use some but not all of your movement, you're prompted to ""skip movement"" instead of ""end movement"" for example. In the tutorials if you don't pick the exact card they want or move to the exact square you want, you fail instantly and rather than just restarting a turn, you have to reload the whole scenario. The tutorials don't teach you to play, they condition you to pick the correct cards and outside the box thinking (like using your push card to push a monster into one or more traps for extra damage) is actively discouraged.

Often you'll make a choice if you want to move or attack first as your ability. Even before you get to the point of confirming any damage and revealing whatever modifiers you'd roll, the game locks you in. You have to be absolutely sure of your choices and never miss-click or you'll risk restarting the round or the full scenario. Always the full scenario if you are doing a tutorial mission.

Also if you buy stuff as you're forced to do with you first start a campaign, you'd better figure out on your own you need to go into a separate screen for each person in your party to actually equip that gear, or you won't have it. Not that this is every explained in any pop-up message or tutorial.

Multiplayer has frequent desync issues (the host's data not transferring in full or correctly) even after it takes 10 minutes for other players to load in. The solution is for the non-hosts to delete any local save data in LocalLow and the host to re-sync on Steam.

There's apparently plenty of soft-locks where missions are unwinnable because the game is broken: My group got stuck on Infernal Throne (Scenario #21) and in trying to find a solution, found posts reporting the bug in 2021 but with no solution from the community and much less from the devs. With my own knowledge of Unity3D, I believe it should have been an easy fix.

The graphics are so-so.
The narration is top notch, but it's all one guy.
Gameplay is **hard** but house rules + mods make it more casual-friendly and a tolerable challenge.
The events are the same as in the physical game. I don't know how much, if any, of the narrative content here is unique.
All the localizations are player-made mods, which means quality will undoubtedly vary.
Whole game ends up feeling cheap and flimsy with just as much time wasted debugging it as getting clobbered in 1-2 hr long dungeons.

Character progression is limited and most levels have to be executed flawlessly in order to succeed. The issue with that premise, is that you may not even realize that you've made one too many sub-optimal moves until 40 minutes later, when you're staring at a no-win scenario. That's a massive amount of time that you'll never get back in your life.

Another issue I have with the game is that it always favors hyper offensive play. Because playing cards brings your characters one step closer to death, it's always critical to be moving forward while dishing out as much damage as possible.  

There are many defensive cards available but they will almost always be sub-optimal and not worth playing, as hanging back and playing defensively only hurts you.

Good old times, when people were ready to play anything to have a bit of fun. You would need something to keep people gathering and playing, so prolonging sessions and adding some gimmicks would be fine for a tabletop.

Take your friends out, and what's left is an extremely gridny, poorly balanced, punishing, anti-fun game.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Allows coop
- Challenging at first glance
- Voice acting is good.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- [b]Poor optimization[/b]: 50 fps dropping with freezes at RTX3070
- [b]Bugged[/b]. The camera is crazy during enemy turns, frequent Network crashes. Enemy AI like archers walking into their own traps, refusing to act. Sometimes enemies from hidden rooms will move faster than you even if their initiative is lower.
- [b]AI in general[/b]. Enemies will metagame their best to counterplay not only players abilities but even quests and dungeon challenges. The summoner is able to teleport into doors but is still trying to summon minions onto blocked tiles. Enemies are damaging themselves. Enemies sharing the same action locking them on undesirable action (1 low-HP skeleton would lock 2 other skeletons on ""heal + shield"" action even if they could've killed you).
- [b]Meta-abuse[/b] and grind are intended and encouraged. As you don't get basic rewards such as exp and gold by doing missions in this game, you need to abuse it by repeating the same missions over and over in order to keep your level, stats, cards, potions, and gear relevant.
- [b]Events[/b] are pure RNG and meta - encouraged. You can try to ""roleplay"", but ultimately they are the same gimmicks with no logic or explanation. Just metagame it (or just Google it). Blue water = poison, yellow water = healing. Ha-ha, joke on you, yellow water = nothing happens, as events are not counted as ""Rewards"" in this game. There is no ""carrot"", only a ""stick"". We've played 4 missions, and in City events (which should be a reward after doing a mission), we've lost 35 coins—more than my character was even able to loot in total. After that, we'd done an Extremely Important Task For The City and we were rewarded with...20 gold coins.
- [b]Grind[/b] in general. All enemies drop 3-4 coins on death. An item costs from 20 to 50 coins. You can't share items with teammates. If I bought a shield for 20g and I want to give it to my teammate - so I need to sell it for 10g, then my mate would be able to buy it for 20g from the shop. Once your character retires, all of your items, enchantments, and perks are gone.
- [b]Fake difficulty[/b]. As maps and AI are predetermined, there is no real challenge in completing the map. You just have to find the optimal solution for that map. Once you get the idea, it takes another 3-5 runs to ""perfect"" it, as a single mistake can cost you a run. There is no variety, so re-doing the same map over and over is not fun, plain boring. One might watch a youtube walkthrough from the start.
- [b]RNG[/b]. Other people have already said it, but it does not seem ""random"". A ""Cancel"" card reshuffles the modifiers, that's fine. So you can reshuffle the deck and draw 3-4 ""Cancels"" per 5 turns - typical scenario, we've seen it a least once per two missons. Have we ever seen two x2 in a row? Nope, sorry. It is OK for this game to draw your full negative hand of modifiers, then draw zero, reshuffle the deck, and draw them all over again.
- [b]Music[/b] is nonexistent, even 200$ budget indie titles had better OSTs in 2020.
- [b]QOL[/b]: No fast-forward animations, no simple hex map view, no damage-modifiers chance preview etc.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
They sell you this game as a ""Tactical coop RPG dungeon crawler""
What they don't say is that it lacks actual content, requires tons of grinding, has no respect for player time, and that you have almost zero agency in ""playing"" your ""role"" in this game.

The first impression did not live up to the bare minimum expectations. I played the singleplayer tutorial and the game played mostly fine. The tutorial did its job of tutorialing. It looks so far to be decent for singleplayer.

But as soon as I tried to play with said friends and family, I was massively let down. Aside from the tutorials, all of my recorded hours have been filled with crashes, hardlocks, and disconnects. When this hasn’t occurred, we’ve seen significant desyncs and lag. The game does not handle system or network constraints gracefully at all, and it fails to use LAN when available, meaning that playing in-person with friends annihilates your bandwidth, worsening the aforementioned issues.

We have yet to finish a single room of actual combat, and the events completely fail to be ‘cooperative’ in the slightest; the host decides entirely on the party’s course of action.

Overall, the game seems like it might be good at a glance for singleplayer. I’d look elsewhere for a multiplayer experience, especially when one party has performance limitations.

That said, in fairness, these are my first impressions. Maybe a patch will change things or it’ll redeem itself when playing long-distance multiplayer, but I’d be wary of significant performance issues (that have been documented for years on Reddit at the very least) in multiplayer at a minimum.

It certainly isn’t worth the $40 I paid for it in my opinion.

Edit 1, 19.1hrs: The multiplayer was better when it was distributed across multiple networks, but it still puts significant stress on weaker networks when multiple Gloomhaven clients are running on one network at once, and it's yet to fully live up to the $40 in my eyes. But the first impression was a bit harsh.

Edit 2, 30.6hrs: The multiplayer has desync issues that cause the game to lock up if multiple people try to level up at once. Sometimes items get desynced as well. The game also does not take solo scenarios into account in multiplayer; you have to awkwardly pass a save back and forth. Once again, yet to fully live up to the $40, first impression was harsh.

Among MANY problems this game presents, I could find:
a. Long-a*s needless yet inefficient tutorial text
b. A few overcomplex mechanics that add no depth whatsoever, but rather just feel taxing for no other reason than... well, taxing... without any bit of representativeness of whatever the hell it might mean or why that particular thing might be taxing to begin with (and this is not to say that EVERY taxation is poorly done, but quite a few are)
c. Bad or inexistent visual aids when accessing new content, such as leveling up, getting new skills, getting perks
d. Impossibility to Load in town
e. Impossibility to access specific bits of information on game mechanics when browsing content like items or abilities. This is mostly relevant during dungeons, where you might want to check or be reminded of what a symbol means, but you can't.
f. Lack of visual aid for synergic abilities among your roster
g. Punishment for misclicks or misreads, which could EASILY go unpunished if you are single player, by the fact it's a turn-based game. The punishment comes in the form of frustration and/or, more countably, time loss. This could be fixed by an Undo button for movement actions that haven't revealed information, or healing/buff abilities. However, since you do get a ""Restart Round"" function, which tells us that apparently the devs didn't deem cheating the luck of the draw too relevant, you could just get a free-to-use ""Undo Last Action"" button and cheat the luck of the draw all you want, but for far less precious seconds of your life.
This punishment happens in dungeons, where actions are tightly limited and wasting turns can result in failure, but you won't actually find out until after many, many turns later (and turns take a while).
h. The option to accelerate animations is quite unhandy to find. It's in the ""Scenario"" section of the controls, and you have to Enable it and bind a key to it! It should be a standard, pre-built-in common function for any game of this kind, and should be included in the tutorial (even if the tutorial sucks anyway). 
i. To deepen the hole in time-wasting problems, when a group of enemies of the same type executes the exact same action that does not involve movement or any kind of aggression towards you (such as when they heal up or buff themselves), you have to watch how they all resolve the exact same action, ONE BY ONE. So yeah, you have to be a full minute looking at 8 dudes setting their shields up. Bummer!
j. Unreasonably recommending the x0/x2 modifier variation instead of the -2/+2 one, which is FAR less punishing and favors strategic and tactical combat compared with the x0/x2 one. x0 ruins turns, and x2 makes them trivial. Which sounds equitative, but thing is you don't really play this game counting on getting a x2, and when you get a x0, everything you've done until that point probably goes to waste (and this is truer the higher the difficulty you are playing).
k. Difficulty to make inventory of what you've gotten from a dungeon. I don't remember whether this is due to visually uncomfortable display of information, or if the information isn't detailed at all. But I remember I can't clearly tell what the hell I got from a dungeon, even if I win it.
l. Some inconsistent/erroneous keywording in mechanics descriptions. An example is the Mana Potion. It states it ""Creates an element"", when in fact what it does is it ""Starts creating an element"". Which is fundamentally different, given elements always ""Start"" forming (so the potion gave the false idea that it was superior) before being usable. Therefore, the character you use the potion with is just setting the element up for another character or for a following turn. You just get artistry-ed into failure, again!


What all of this mostly does is f**king up the first few dungeons for no other reason than poor polishing of the design of visual data elements and the balance between mechanical depth and accessibility.

But I guess if you like losing for being conned by bad artistry, this is a great game. It would otherwise be an excellent game, because the way the mechanics handle the concept is impressive. I have myself theorized about a game with this kind of setup, and these people made it true. But it's too dusty, and for a game that is fairly complex (particularly on higher difficulties), it needs more love to feel fair, smooth and friendly. 

To be fair, I've played dozens of games like this one, and they all have this kind of issues. The difference is this game is much better, and brings much of the same content, but with very interesting and original elements, but becomes lackluster in comparison with what it could be if they hadn't overlooked all of this, which makes me angry for tarnishing it. If the devs look into these things and make improvements, I'll mention it and revert my review to positive.",1689305000,1689481856,False,4,0,0.498570144176483154,0,True,False,False

The computer game faithfully recreates the board game and so all the people giving bad reviews because it's too hard or whatever. That's how the original board game is. 

The rules to the game are challenging, not because they are difficult to understand... but they are challenging because I've never played a tactical board game that had such unique flavor and very interesting mechanics. The steep learning curve comes from the fact that the mechanics are incredible.

Pros:
- Amazing recreation of the board game
- Computer version makes it so easy to play without having to understand all the rules monster's use (although at some point you'll want to understand them if you play higher difficulty
- So much fun multi-player! It's just like the board game but I can play it without everyone needing to be in same place.
- A lot of people get frustrated by the exhaustion mechanics and I initially did at first, but then with some persistence you can see how beautiful of balance they are and also you learn to hoard your cards that are 1 time use.

Cons:
- The computer version is missing giving the clues you normally get about what character would have helped or whether they are completely random for road encounters in the base game.
- Navigating the campaign arcs is a bit confusing. It wasn't clear when we got to  ""the end"" whether we were really done. That might be similar to the board game but I think it's an area where the computer game has an opportunity to fix the board game.

After hearing all of the fuss about this game, boardgame of the year, innovative 'no dice' system, great dungeon crawler, etc I decided to finally give it a try. I dont get it at all. It's not all that exciting and quite repetitive. Most of the starting 6 characters are head scratchers as well. The rogue-y character is actually a melee character with the fewest amount of action card of them all. The big behemoth guy is actually an archer who damages his teammates if they stand near him. Except the starting tank, every other character is overly flawed in ways out of the norm for that type of character. OK fine, things dont have to be like everything that came before, but trust me, there are some serious 'huh?' moments with these characters.

The game is ridiculously hard, it's built to drag on and on, fail, fail, victory, fail, fail, victory. rinse repeat. So the first couple of scenarios are pretty basic but the level increases you get are extremely minor compared to the monster ramp up. You made level 2? ok here's 1 extra hp and you can swap in 1 SLIGHTLY better action card. 1. Now instead of fighting pretty tame bandits, you are fighting thinks with 4 armor who are doing 6 damage instead of 2. Thanks for the hp. When you run out of action cards you are exhausted (dead for the rest of the scenario) but although the dungeons get considerably harder and longer, you still have the same number of action cards. So instead of having to clear three rooms with 6 soft monsters on your limited actions, now you are fighting 14 monsters in 5 rooms, having to attack walls because there are no doors. All with the same limited number of actions or you fail. Thanks for the hp, though.

I am a veteran gamer, 45 years plus. Dungeon Crawlers? Ive played them all. DnD, DDO, Baldurs Gate, Patrhfinder, the list goes on and on. I'm no stranger to deck builders, either, and I've actually won MTG local tournaments (back in the day) and I play a few deck builders still. I do well in them. I only mention this because your first response to this review might be that I'm just bad at these games. That's what I thought when I read some of the other reviews. I started the campaign on normal, where you would normally go when new to a game but not new to gaming. It was ridiculously hard right out of the gate. I had to start over on easy but I could scarcely tell the difference. I beat DCs on hard or harder regularly. I thought 'maybe I'm just not doing it right?' so I went and watched some 'tips and tricks' videos and lo and behold.....I was playing exactly as these videos suggested. Item use, burn options, you name it, I was already doing it as suggested. at 2nd level I had to fight 'the colorless one'. Two tough rooms of his guards I finally get in the boss room (with the two artifacts) and not only does he have 30 hp (thats massive for 2nd level in this game) but he has 2 elite monsters with him that I'm not sure I could have taken even without the boss) and...........he heals like 8 points a round. What? You are lucky if between your 3 toons you do that much damage in 1 round at 2nd level. All this and you are quite weakened from just getting to the boss room. This game needs a 'concede' or 'surrender' button so you dont spend 40 more minutes playing a scenario you've already lost, because that will happen to you often.

I do not own the physical game, but I can tell you right now it's better than the digital for 2 reasons (at least). First off, all of the negative comments about how UNrandom card pulls are, they are not exaggerated in the slightest. The RNG in this game is without the R. I saw all of these posts about how people draw the crit misses and - mods all too often. I was skeptical, I have heard that in other game reviews before and often found it to not be true. People notice the bad pulls and forget the good ones. Not here. Because that rumor was out there I started recording the results from the beginning. It's not a huge sample size but in about 300 pulls I get the x0 card (miss) about 20% of the time (there is ony 1 of these cards in the deck). That is more than double (nearly triple) what it should be. ATM I have a character with 6 +1 cards and only 2 -1 cards and in my last battle I pulled 6 -1 and 2 +1. This is actually quite typical. The digital copy give AI assist on card pulls. At least the tabletop game you can be sure that the pulls are as random as they are supposed to be. If you are coming down to the wire (every single victory is very close, just in the nick of time nonsense) The laws of probability say that with RNG and customization of toons, you should have a couple of breeze-throughs here and there. Not a chance. The game forces 'close calls')

The AI movement in the digital game does not follow the rules of the game. I have a copy of the tabletop rules and the FAQ on the subject. The game cheats. Monsters mostly refuse to be lured and often choose not to move at all rather then move to their disadvantage, something that can clearly happen (if you play it right) in tabletop. Part of the reason you have to fight 5 times the size of your party and several of them being stronger than anyone you have is because the AI NPCs are bound by these movements that can be manipulate. Digital version? It cheats. It doesnt follow it's own guidelines often times. I have literally been looking at the rules, comparing to the faq and saying 'without a doubt this monster will go here if I do this and am here'. Then the AI monster just skips his move and doesnt attack either, because it didnt move. Keep in mind, this is on easy, lmao.

Cant recommend this game at all, and if you really want it I suggest the board game where the AI cant cheat. Game of the year, smh.",1688309474,1688507689,False,7,2,0.526808440685272217,0,True,False,False

Differing opinions on which is better, the powerful, high-level play, or the novel mercs and interactions, can cause your party to suffer from awkward disparities in power and goals. The further we got into the game, the more we felt that issue.

For example, earning perk points through secret missions was lame. If you're not planning on retiring your merc, then completing your secret goal is important. More important than keeping it a secret, since there's no penalty for telling people or just letting them find out. Irl, you can just house rule that if people find out your secret mission, you don't get the points. No such option in a video game. Meanwhile, if you're planning to retire your character soon, the perk points, the gold, the items, etc. are all pretty meaningless. 

Also, some of the enhancements are so expensive, even playing with the rules that make them non-permanent. Who wants to invest that much into a character just to have them retire? Who wants to make a new character knowing that they'll have to stand on the same stage as the brute that's been growing in gold and power since day one?

Unrelated, the enemies and summons could definitely be made smarter in a video game than they can in a board game. Completely random actions are annoying in that they're difficult to plan around. For example, the enemies may end up staying where they are and attacking the air. That could be super convenient, or it could have ruined the turn you were planning. But you won't know until after you've chosen the cards you want to play. That's made worse by the time pressure the game puts on you to complete a mission. The number of rounds you get is limited, and it's not unreasonable to fail missions because you didn't go fast enough. Dealing with output randomness from enemies just exacerbates the issue, and isn't necessary in a video game.

Plus, the number of uses you get from items doesn't feel great, and the classes as a whole don't feel super balanced. I don't know. It felt like a slog and a bit of a mess at times. I wish I could recommend it, but I think there are better video games in the genre.",1687996455,1687996455,False,6,1,0.551753520965576172,0,True,False,False

The voice acting is great and for those who have no experience with the tabletop games campaign, the world-building is amazing, a very unique fantasy world with creative races and magics.

I want adventure, I want challenge.

From the graphical design to the gameplay itself, it's all here - and the content for the money you get compared to the box version ($150!) is tremendous. The guild manager is essentially a completely new campaign to try out, replete with achievements, unlocks, and various narrations. 

The game does suffer from a few flaws, some more grevious than others, but these are overshadowed by the competence in the rest of the game...as well as just not having to set up the physical copy of the game if you have one. I will probably never play the tabletop again after having played this - the ease of use is just too nice. Boot it up and go instead of..taking the fifteen minutes to set up the next scenario and clean up the last one.

The good;
* You can tell the game was made with a lot of love. The areas you explore are interesting and colorful, they're not some dull background affair you're going to get with..basically every other board game to PC port in existence. There are small details to look at and discover on almost every map, even if the doodads are re-used from time to time. Unlike a *lot* of other games, this has a great color palette and is just pleasing to look at while you're actually playing
* The actual play time! If you're familiar with the board game, you'll know it's one of the best games out...but it's an absolute chore to get out, set up, go through different scenarios, just everything involved with actually playing it. This takes all of that away. 
* Faithful recreation of the board game's mechanics. Sure, the targeting doesn't always make sense, sure there are a few things that may be 'off' from what you're used to with the board game...but everything is there and is true to the board game.
* The price. This game is worth every dollar. The board game is a $150 one-time use affair. 

The bad;
* The UI needs some improvement, from multiplayer 'lobbies', to using the cards, interacting with the map/area interfaces, to the ability to look at your cards without covering the screen. The UI as it is is bland, just simple radio buttons. Using the cards can be tedious at some points. Not having an easier function to view your own cards between turns to play out card burns during long rests is a pain. 
* Simple quality of life updates. One of the worst is the time waste that could be freed up by just a few tweaks - having someone use their stamina pots should effectively 'pass' the turn off to the next person so that the rest of the group isn't waiting for the previous player to choose which card(s) to keep. Having to wait for each person, in turn, to discard cards due to a road event prior to starting an area, rather than being able to do it individually, is also just another time sink that could be avoided. 
* The animations for attacks could be a little..more vibrant? Having the spellweaver's abilities go off and essentially just be a ball of light sort of flying around is underwhelming - I like that the speed of the animations doesn't slow the gameplay down (as opposed to some long, drawn out animation to have to watch every time) but they border on pathetic at times - it wouldn't take much to spruce them up while not expanding the amount of time they take. 

I'm excited to see where this game goes and what the devs could do with DLC, from the expansion characters of Jaws of the Lion to updating musical scores, animations, and unique skins (such as character loadouts with gear).

I have the boardgame, beaten the game twice on deadly and finished almost everything you can do in this game. I would not recommend this game if you do not have the patience or the time to learn or appreciate the game. It is very easy to exploit and riddled with RNG mechanics that can tip the scales drastically into losing a scenario or winning. Overall, it is a good turn based game and has a lot of content to explore.

-Characters: This is the strongest point of gloomhaven. There are several different characters with different builds. Surely you will find a mercenary that you are enamoured with. A lot of variations and most of them are bloody fantastic to play with. I would say many of the secret characters are broken and can make the game trivial.

-Digital version: There are more pros then cons for having the game on steam. Having to setup the boardgame can take up to 30 minutes and clean up is equally as long. Here, you do not have to worry about clean up and setup. Unfortunately, there will be cases in which I would prefer more control over my game/rules.

For example: When choosing a card during an attack with advantage. For some odd reason, the computer loves picking 0 + color than +2 and I noticed it when playing ""Jaws of the Lion"" expansion. It mostly ruined turns as I was counting on a +2 but it picked a 0.

There are house rules and is a very nice addition, wish there were more added to customise your campaigns more. There are also differences from the boardgame. They made some changes like minor stamina potion gives 2 cards back in the boardgame and in the digital version, only gives 1 back. To be honest, the changes are very insignificant but if you have played the boardgame, you will notice. I do not mind the changes.

-Game design: It is really terrible if you ask me. I do not have space for all my gripes with the game so I will summarise.

Playing two cards per turn sucks and gets very tedious when playing 3 or more mercenaries. Since you always have to play 2 cards unless when you are resting, doing nothing means you are getting tired. Doing nothing is the equivalent of sprinting and attacking. This means doing nothing = doing actions and you will exhaust at the same time as a player that is doing actions. Absolutely stupid. If there was a way to only use one card out of the two and get the other refunded, this game would be insanely way better. Hell, doing nothing should refund both cards in my opinion.

Battle goals are useless, temporary and very stupid. Retiring characters is not only the best incentive for anyone to get more permanent bonus perks, it gives bonus prosperity and possibility to unlock new quests and items. Never try to go out of your way to get a battle goal because you could just ruin the scenario out right. Why risk it when you will retire the character anyways and, lose any gold/perks you have accrued? Absolutely stupid.

The basic mechanic for items sucks. You need to long rest to refresh your items. It is a stupid gimmick and it should be replaced with a system of uses/charges. For example: You can only use boots of speed 3 times, non-consecutive in a single scenario. Also most items give very slight bonuses to the point they are not really worth it the gold you pay, especially early. I would prefer if chainmail just gave a flat +1 shield permanently than having to track charges in which when depleted, it gets spent and you need to long rest to get it back, If that is not a solution then just make it have 6 charges, once depleted it is gone. I would prefer weapons and armour just gave flat attack and shield bonuses.

Enemy action cards is a terrible system. Having enemies doing random dumb actions is not engaging and feels massively exploitative, sometimes cheating. For example: Skeletons healing themselves at full health points. It makes absolutely no sense at all. Why they would heal? It would be better if each enemy had abilities like bosses have. Action 1, 2 and 3 and they all have thresholds. For example: Skeletons if below 50% HP rounded down, ability 3: +2 heal +2 shield. Skeletons if able to be adjacent to 2 or more mercenaries, ability 2: Receives target 3. Skeletons if only able to only single target, ability 1: Target 2 and all attacks hit the same target. I think this system would not only benefit the digital version, but also the physical version. This would avoid enemies not taking actions when they should be attacking.

There are more dumb mechanics I can think of but to be fairly honest, it works very well but super exploitative. These are just frustrations I have, nitpicks.

-Game Balance: It is bloody dreadful. When picking new cards when you level up, there is never really a choice. You are making a huge mistake for choosing the wrong card and the game will punish you severely. Sure there can be different builds and such, but the reality is most builds all look the same with different variation of some cards. There is obviously a meta, with half of the cards being bad cards and the other half being good. You will learn eventually which ones are good.

Same thing with mercenaries, there are mercenaries that completely suck in certain situations and others that are godlike level one and can do everything. Once you get the secret characters, you basically never touch the basic 6 mercenaries. The amount of crazy stuff the secret characters can do made the entire game trivial. I was breezing through deadly like nothing, beating most scenarios pre-round 15 while I was suffering early scenarios with the basic 6 mercenaries. Retrying deadly scenarios 10 times in a row trying to beat them and just constantly failing, mostly because of terrible RNG. 

-RNG: Like I stated previously, it is definitely the worst part of the game. You can have a tank selecting all his shield abilities and ramping everything up, to then have the enemies not attack because.... reasons. Or having a CC/moderate dps oriented group and have all 6 cultist summoning skeletons 4 times in a row. It is truly a pain in the ass even when you are playing perfectly. RNG can ruin your scenario attempts and it all boils down to terrible game design. You know how to negate all RNG? Unlock and level up secret characters because they are busted and can breeze through the content.

-Graphics: Looks decent enough. Having the scenarios with their correct aesthetics adds to the immersion which is fantastic. Looks faithful to the boardgame but, the art design of some of the characters are off from the original.

-Multiplayer: Have not played it but it is there. Great addition to the digital version and I wish I had friends to play with.

-Mods: Exactly what this game needs. Great addition but you might have issues adding mods to your current campaigns. I definitely did.

-Theme: I think this is where this game absolutely rocks. I really enjoyed the city gloomhaven and being a party of mercenaries doing quests. Travelling to different locations and fighting off varied enemies is great. Also the rewards are sparse but there are definitely gold mines to find. It is very well done.

-Story: It is alright, typical RPG type story telling. Nothing too special and did not really pay attention to it. Did not mind it and the voice acting is pretty good.

-Bugs: There are bugs here and there. Also my fps were all over the place even though I have an extremely good computer. I am shocked that I cannot run this game on the highest setting, as most of the time I am getting 30 fps even with everything on low. I also noticed that the more you play your campaign, the longer and longer the loads get.

Its actually a strategy/puzzle game that is disguised as a high quality tabletop RPG conversion sort of like the Pathfinder games.

1. The card use system is great. Every character uses the tops and bottoms of cards to do abilities and some characters can hold more cards than others. Every turn, a character picks two cards. They all have numbers on them to determine turn order for the round and everyone uses the top of one card and the bottom of the other which can lead to very interesting gameplay when done right. Unfortunately, it is not beginner friendly and the game does not smooth you into the system, which we'll talk about later. It is a pretty unique system that I think is good, but other things make it not as pleasant as it should.

2. Unlocking things are quite nice. The methods for doing so are questionable, but its always nice to unlock a new mysterious location with enemies you've never seen before that come with new small stories. Unlocking characters is usually exciting as well as your options for forming a party open up a lot. This is almost a ""thing that is okay about Gloomhaven"" because the things you unlock are cool, but the things you need to do in order to unlock them are usually quite baffling and not done well.

Things that are okay about Gloomhaven:

1. The characters. There are some cool ones but how they're handled is very strange. The starting characters are no less complex or strong (sometimes) than the ones you unlock. 2 out of the 6 starting characters have a ""High"" difficulty/complexity rating while some characters with difficult and time consuming unlocking methods have a ""Low"" rating. You unlock these characters by completing Personal Quests, which are basically your characters' motivation for coming to Gloomhaven and being a mercenary. We'll talk more on those later. Anyway, the power disparity in the characters is pretty large too. Some have to work really hard to be good while others can just break the game in half. One character has an infinite XP farm exploit that also has other very powerful actions, one gets ways to consistently kill any monster from full health and is so rigid in gameplay that some guides mention the specific set path to repeat every 4 turns, a few characters can consistently stop monsters from attacking entirely while other characters have to do specific setups to output good damage. There are definitely enjoyable characters to play as and they usually have 2-3 different ways to play them, adding flexibility on paper, but there is a rule that interrupts that somewhat.

What is bad about Gloomhaven:

1. Personal Goals. They sound like cool motivations for your characters similar to others TTRPGs. The issue is you can only pick from 2 randomly selected quests out of a big pile of them when you first make your character. Quite a few Personal Quests don't even give you characters, some just give you items or other miscellaneous things. When you complete a Personal Quest, your character must immediately retire and they are gone forever. Then you make a character and the cycle starts again. It gets even worse when you see what some of these quests are. Every unlockable character has 2 different Personal Goals to unlock them. Some of these are extremely easy and are only limited by the scenario variety you currently have, such as one that says ""Kill 3 of (X monster), 3 (Y monster), and 3 (Z monster)"". There are a few where if you aren't using a scenario guide (Most people don't) and are unlucky, you will be stuck with that Personal Quest long after you reach the max level for the character. If you get a Personal Goal that has a set gold amount tied to it, good luck, because this game is quite stingy with gold. The worst ones (and these are unusually common) are the Personal Goals that make you exhaust yourself or your party 15 times! Making yourself lose a scenario 15 times is both time consuming, tedious, unrewarding, and annoying. I cannot fathom how these goals passed playtesting. You cannot change your Personal Goal, so if you are stuck on a goal you cannot complete or you unlock a character/item you don't really like, then sucks for you. The only way to get a new goal is to delete you character and make a new one. To me, Personal Goals rarely felt good to do.

2. Difficulty. In my opinion, the game is not THAT hard. I want to talk about something else entirely. Ideally, the difficulty curve of a game should slowly, but consistently ramp up the difficulty in order for you to push past your previous limits of knowledge of the game from start to end. If a good difficulty curve looked like a professionally made line graph, Gloomhaven's difficulty curve looks like a chaotic mess of scribbles that a child made with crayons. Gloomhaven has to have the most drastically shifting and inconsistent difficulty in any game I have ever played. There is no difficulty rating next to scenarios and the difficulty settings just make enemies higher/lower levels (More/'less HP and damage), makes traps deal more/less damage, and increases/decreases the amount of gold in loot piles. Otherwise, in terms of difficulty, you are at the mercy of your attack modifiers, the attacks the enemies make (which are randomly picked out of a deck and cannot be predicted), the characters in your party (some characters are worse with fewer party members), and the design of the scenario and its rules. Some scenarios are very easy (for me at least), and some kicked my ass on *easy* difficulty. There is no way to tell how hard a scenario will be unless you go on Google and search for anyone that is having problems with the same scenario. These whiplash inducing difficulty spikes are annoying and they also destroy any desire to play that newcomers might have.

No longer do you need to spend time setting up and tearing down this massive beast. No bookkeeping or upkeep, let the app handle the AI for you. I love the digital artwork and design too. 

However, the digital version is not without its flaws. The monster AI can be a bit slow, and the game can slow down especially during online games. I have experienced crashes, bugs, connection issues, and technical glitches, although, thankfully, not enough issues to discourage me from playing this. 

Another hurdle with this game is that the learning curve may be steep for new players. Its easier to learn when you're playing the physical version because you have the rulebook next to you, and you can pause stuff to check the rules when in doubt. It's very common to select a wrong card or misplay a card when you're learning the game. This makes things a bit challenging in the digital version, because you can't even undo your mistakes, and even veterans might find themselves stuck with actions they accidentally did due to a brain fart or a slip. Yeah, this implementation is not very brain fart friendly. 

However, the good outweighs the bad by far, especially for returning Haven players. If there's someone in the group who knows the rules (that is if you're playing online), that smooths things a lot for new players. 

I've finished the entire Gloomhaven campaign with 3 friends and I still found value in this digital version. Thanks to this implementation, I'm playing a campaign online, and an offline single player campaign. 

This is easily my top 3 boardgames of all time and I highly recommend this version to anyone interested in card based puzzle RPG dungeon crawler, albeit with a few caveats. Expect a steep learning curve and complex ruleset, minor but persistent technical issues, and a very high difficulty level, especially in the opening scenarios.",1679803263,1686110021,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Go read reviews on boardgamegeek if you want an in-depth discussion on class/monster/item balance and how vague/binary the city/road events are. 

The good:
-At least you don't have to muck around with monster AI manually and setting up the board compared to regular gloomhaven.
-The voice acting and music.

The okay:
-The board, monster, and player textures
    -However it can get hard to tell what's an obstacle versus background flavor

The bad:
-No Undo last action so long as no modifiers have been drawn, necessitating a round restart if you misclick a bottom move/top attack action.
-Terrible Line of Sight tool that should just be hold button at a hex and it highlights tiles that are in/out of LOS 
-Hexes are sometimes highlighted showing that you can possibly target an enemy in an AOE attack, when you actually can't target them at all unless the card is fully enhanced for additional hexes.
-Related but minor quibble is that you should just be able to click on an enemy when you are choosing an AOE attack and just be able to rotate around or let the player know if there is only one configuration where you can target the enemy you want.
-Guildmaster mode having an unlimited cap on enemies unlike the boardgame, removing door rushing, and inadvertingly buffing enemies that spawn other enemies when they were already kill on sight 
-inability to switch host mid-session 
-There should be a setting to skip animations for enemies/players/all

The dealbreaker for actually playing this over tabletop sim:
-The AI is very unoptimized at higher target/mini count, taking ~3 minutes per monster to act. With an average of 8-10 enemies on the board, you're sitting there for a good 20 minutes for some scenarios waiting until its your turn again with no player input and the fastest animation speed.

While I prefer the real thing, playing campaigns is a tedious job, setting up scenarios, not making mistakes during the plays etc, is not easy, you need a pretty big table and a reliable group who doesn't abandon the campaign. 
The digital version helps with this a lot, no more setup, no more mistakes etc, I think it looks pretty nice , I'm even ok with the controls. It was quiet buggy at the beginning but most of them were fixed. 

There is one thing that ruins the game for me though, and I can't look over it, and that is the rate of pulling curses and misses on high brutal+ difficulty. I played the game a lot of times, but I'm still enjoying it with a friend and we still enjoy playing it on very high difficulty, however it looks like the developers using different algorithm to decide what cards we pull from the attack modifier on different difficulty. 

This is prety damn annoying. And I'm talking about pulling a miss with 1-2 characters out of four, for about 4 rounds every turn. Now, according to the rules, whenever you pull a miss, you supposed to reshuffle the deck, the chances to pull 4 misses for several turns continuously.. well they are very low, but somehow it keeps happening on every scenario with us. The enemy also seem to pull every single curse from their deck when they have 4-5+ curses. It's just really not realistic, and even if you put Maths on the side, I played a lot with the physical board game, it's not happening. This ruins the game for me, I want to finish it on Brutal and Deadly but even with a deck, with no negative modifier other than the miss, I pull a miss 5 times in a row... BS.

Not sure how it is implemented, but it really feels like on higher difficulty, the algorithm is different, which is just stupid, you have increased damage and HP for enemies and traps, just stick to that, introduce more difficulty levels with even more damage + hp, but changing the ""luck"" element of the game is a joke.

Gloomhaven is the digital version of its popular board game namesake, and it does a great job of transforming the physical elements of the game into a stimulating digital format.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Deep and Immersive (9/10): Gloomhaven’s mechanics add a profound level of strategic depth and tactical decision-making. Fans of turn-based strategy games will find the intricacies of combat and character-advancement to be a rewarding challenge. The game does a commendable job in emulating the depth and complexity of the original board game, but newcomers might find the learning curve steep. The game offers a tutorial that eases players into its mechanics.

[b]Graphics[/b] - Immersive and Atmospheric (8.5/10): The graphical fidelity of Gloomhaven is impressive, which further enhances the game’s immersive nature. The dark and atmospheric dungeons, with a consistent and pleasing art style, bring the world of Gloomhaven to life. Minor bugs and glitches occur, but they do not much affect the overall experience.

[b]Sound[/b] - Mood Setting (8/10): The sound design in Gloomhaven is a fitting accompaniment to the visual aesthetic. The sounds and music create a captivating, yet grim atmosphere.

[b]Replayability[/b] - High (9.5/10): With an expansive variety of scenarios, characters, and items, Gloomhaven offers a massive world of content to explore. Each class feels distinct, and the permutations of party composition add layers of strategy and re-playability. The procedural generation of scenarios further amplifies this.

[b]Accessibility[/b] - Room for Improvement (7.5/10): Gloomhaven could improve is its accessibility for newcomers, though plenty of YouTube videos and Steam guides exist. The complexity of the game, while a boon for hardcore strategy and RPG fans, may be daunting for beginners, even though the game’s tutorial and help pop-ups do a decent job of easing players into the experience.

[b]Verdict[/b] - Gloomhaven is a top-notch digital conversion of the iconic tabletop game. It captures the depth, strategy, and immersive world-building of its source material while utilizing the advantages of a digital platform to give a seamless, engaging gaming experience. This digital adaptation is, without a doubt, a must-have for your Steam library!",1635582572,1684188539,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- coop pretty stable
- the board game without all the bureaucracy - the computer rolls, moves creatures, etc etc so it's a huge timesaver over playing the Real Life table top game.

 - The game seemingly has mechanics to ensure dramatic close finishes.

 - Kicks along a bit hard for a while. Then you start retiring characters and it is impossible. Turn it down to ""as easy as you can"" if you like - you are still wasting your time.

Gloomhaven represents a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) adaption of the same name tabletop game (2017), developed by the company Flaming Foul Studious and published by the company Asmodee Digital. 

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ By the book; which means a slow-paced, tactical, and unforgiving experience with permanent choices, and a pinch of random number generated (RNG) luck. The right ingredients for a quintessential RPG.

++ Up to four player co-op game. I am playing it with family and friends; we argue about decisions, laugh at our own stupidity, and cheer when we emerge victorious. 

+ I consider the standard difficulty level to be challenging; sometimes it feels like going against overwhelming odds. In addition, the masochistic player base will find the Deadly difficulty stimulating. The name is program, I guarantee that.  

- Occasionally, some scripted events will not trigger correctly, e.g. the Prime Demon in the campaign. Another point are the irregular disconnection issues within the multiplayer.

[i] Summary: [/i]

The faithful adaptation of the source material combined with the multiplayer co-op create a challenging and sophisticated dungeon-crawler. And I do enjoy it the most by playing with family and friends. 

Recommended for fearless adventurers ready to delve into unknown dungeon depths.

I don't understand the design of having to use 2 cards per turn, why not one if this is my choice? If the balance must be adjusted after just do it.

I also appreciate how easy it is to unlock all the characters in guild mode.  It's been fun to try all of them and mix and match to test out different synergies.  Second positive is how easily the game accommodates the original mechanics.  It is so much quicker and easier than setting up the board game and trying to run all the monsters in the right order each round.  Two minor negatives that both revolve around the Sunkeeper level 9 protection card, the one that let's you take damage for allies.  I've noticed that if you have that out and mind control a monster onto a trap it forces the Sunkeeper to take the damage for the monster.  This is unthematic and frustrating because even when you have bonus NPC allies she always has the option to not take damage for them.  The other glitch I noticed at least once was with friendly summons.  If they take damage and the Sunkeeper directs it to herself, the summon on rare occasion runs of the map.

And this is, on the whole, not a bad board game conversion, by the standard of board game conversions. It's better than most of the Asmodee-made crap out there (this was still published by Twin Sails, which is an Asmodee subsidiary, but they didn't develop it in-house). The visuals are nice, and they reproduce the board game mechanics reliably, and expand upon it with some new modes. In general, the UI design is decent, once you figure it out, though some of the UI is not very intuitive and it doesn't do a great job of illustrating it all when you first play.

The main reason I give this a thumbs down, though, is it's missing one super critical feature, at least for me. It needs an undo. I've had NUMEROUS runs ruined when I looked over the whole situation, figured out what I needed to do, but then I need to select 2 cards on 4 characters, which is a LOT of stuff to set up. And then when their turns come up, I need to correctly execute the actions. So there's a lot of opportunity to forget a detail or two about your intent, and get something wrong, and in this game a single mistake can often be disastrous. But I generally realize the mistake pretty quickly. If I were playing the board game, I'd just go ""Woops!"" and fix it. But in this, once I hit the button, I'm committed. So if I make a mistake like that, I'm screwed.

I've pretty much given up playing the digital version of this game because of this problem. It's just too frustrating constantly losing because I failed to perfectly execute the plan I'd already figured out, and then having to do the whole level over again.",1680828080,1680833311,False,0,0,0.435975611209869385,0,True,False,False

Gloomhaven on Steam is a tactical RPG and a digital adaptation of the ultimate strategy board game by Isaac Childres.

At first, I thought they would be fun. But the combat mechanics are too complex and tedious. I played for almost 15 hours and was only able to finish 3 quests due to the number of battle restarts after ridiculous things happen with the AI during the gameplay. There are a couple ways to lose a battle, you can either run out of cards to play which ""exhausts"" your character. Or you can have your health go down to zero and that also exhausts the character. The AI seems to be programmed for you to lose the battle and therein waste your time. That means, that the AI will try to ""exhaust"" you by running out of cards too. Let's say that you choose to pass up some enemies to fight in another room on the map. Well, those enemies sometimes won't follow you, so you will likely be ""defeated"" and not because your health would go down to zero, but because you ran out of cards to play trying to go back to kill the other monsters on the map. The AI driven monsters that either chose not to come after you, even though their purpose is to kill you, or don't even move from their initial positions that are spread all over the map, can easily force your characters into exhaustion. So if you happened to move one of your characters too far on the board, or make some mistake in calculating your next move, then you may just have burnt up all of your cards too quickly and waste hours of tedious strategic moves that you spent trying to kill every monster sequentially so you don't ""exhaust yourself"" coming back for them later. It's not very fun.

Also, all the character animations are practically the same for many multiple actions. It's pretty repetitive and boring. I found it all too much of a waste of time to play any further. And don't even attempt to have more than 2 characters on the board at any one time. That will turn your 3 hour battle into a 6 hour battle, easily. Best hope you don't make any mistakes either with micro-managing 4 different characters on the map with the enemy scaling in difficulty depending on your character levels and party size; it never takes less time to play a quest battle because of this. 3 quests is way too low for 15 hours of gameplay. 

And, although Gloomhaven stated it is ""Full Controller Compatible"" on its page, it in fact is not. When using a PS5 controller to play the game, I am given error messages on a regular basis. And those errors don't only pop up and then go away, they force the entire battle to be restarted. Those battles often take hours to complete as they are so tedious!

Keep in mind that even with all of the defective qualities of this game, Steam also will not refund you unless you played less than 2 hours.

Old review:

This game is a nightmare to play. I cant remember a time i played it and didn't ragequit and it always boils to one simple thing: targeting, targeting, targeting. The targeting system is really bad. It should always warn you that you can target more targets before proceeding. It is hard to see which enemies are targeted and i have targeted 1 enemy when I could have targeted more more times than i can count. Really frustrating. It is also very easy to missclick especially when you want to move and instead confirm skipping movement.

What I would improve:
-Add notification, that you could hit more targets when you target less than possible.
-Add notification, that you are about to use a spell without using an element when possible.
-Some sort of Undo button for certain actions, since it is really easy to missclick.

also I think the modifiers should be bigger and flashier and of the same colour as they are in the board game.

I have many hours spent in the board game and many of these things are really frustrating since you can ""undo"" all of your misplaced pieces. You may not want to include these changes in the base game, but they should at least be a toggleable option in the game settings.

As it stands now I cant really recommend the game to anyone coming from the board game, since it is a really rough transition. I can't really play it more than a few minutes at a time.

SECOND: GET JAWS OF THE LION. THE GAME IS NOT QUITE COMPLETE WITHOUT IT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO FULLY APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT IT

THIRD: This game is a great game AND A CHALLENGE! YOU WILL NOT WIN THE FIRST LEVELS AT FIRST. GET UP AND TRY AGAIN! THAT'S PART OF THE FUN PART OF THE GAME! DONT BE DISCOURAGED ITS PART OF THE GAME TO LOSE SOMETIMES.

That said, Gloomahven can be described thus: Xcom, Space Crusade, Hero Quest and Magic the Gathering became a thruple or quaple I guess and had a baby. THIS IS THEIR PRIDE AND JOY!!!

You can play the base campaign missions or make your own missions fighting bandits, theives, demons, ghosts, tribal savages, the undead, bosses and so on. Descend into crypts, dungeons, explore forests towns ETC your characters are diverse and have a wide wide range of powers that increase as the game plays on.

THE BASE CAMPAIGN IS 95 LEVELS, THE JAWS OF THE LION ADD TO IT ALONG WITH ENHANCE THE GAME WITH NEW CHARACTERS

You can play solo or have a team go head on against the unknown.

Keep in mind also the more characters in your party, the harder and more challenging levels get!

Whatever. Its awesome! The actual board game is also awesome but this digital version is a compliment to it! If you loved HeroQuest, Space Quest and Wizards and Warriors, you'll love this!!!

************************************************************************

Please read and hear me out.  I'm rating this as negative for now.  HOWEVER, I think this will be a really, really great game if the developers truly are listening and fixing the game based on the early access feedback.  This digital version of Gloomhaven gives me the feel of the tabletop game, which I love.  That will keep me coming back to it over and over again.  But there are so many bugs still.  From not being able to ""push"" the enemies to not being able to move onto the next scenario, this game is just really, really, extremely buggy.  
I have really high hopes for it though.  Seriously.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the tabletop game.  And getting the chance to get that feel from the digital version really appeals to me.  But the devs have quite a long way to go.  
To the devs: Please do this game right by making sure that this is as clean of a playthrough as possible.  The current bugs are really distracting and seriously ruin the experience.  I almost (almost) wish that it hadn't been released early, before these bugs were dealt with.
To the potential players of this game: Give this game a chance.  As long as the devs keep making the right improvements, this game will give you the exact same feel as the tabletop game.  In a lot of ways, it's an amazing port from tabletop to digital.  Definitely give it a chance.  Maybe purchase the Early Access version to give additional funds to the development of this game.  
I have really high hopes here.  I'm crossing my fingers that this will end up being what I hope it's promising.",1564300083,1679510832,True,0,0,0.52708512544631958,0,True,False,True

[/h1] You can find [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/780290/discussions/0/3594464960494398953/] my thread on Steam Community asking about it[/url]. I agree with what people have said in that thread by the way.

If you're into board games, you must have surely heard about Gloomhaven. Always on top at BoardGameGeek, and you probably have wondered ""what's all that hype about it?"", as I have in the past. It's a game that my group and I have been contemplating about buying it, but it's quite expensive and it's a ""legacy"" board game(for those who don't know; legacy board games are supposedly the games you can only play once), so we were never sure if we should invest our time and money on a really expensive board game. After all, we've been told that there's a campaign and once you finish it you're done. So, I was skeptical. When the digital first came out, we wanted to buy it but there weren't many positive reviews back then. So we gave it a couple of months and we purchased it.

First of all, it is very well made. A friend of mine has a review here, calling it ""The Elden Ring of Board Games"" which is quite accurate. Every aspect of the board game is very well thought, we always feel amazed when we finish a dungeon. It has really low RNG, you have to strategize as a a team to complete the dungeons. It does require thinking and strategizing but not to the point that you would feel overwhelmed, at least if you're an experienced board game player. If your board game experience is limited to Monopoly, this game WILL feel overwhelming, the mechanics might be strange to you, so keep that in mind. I mentioned above that it's a legacy game, but honestly its campaign does have replay value, considering that you have multiple characters to play with. Besides, the campaign is not something you'd be done in couple of days, if that's your impression. Digital is obviously faster than the board game, I've got 40 hours played on Steam and that's only 27 scenarios in one campaign, and we play REALLY FAST. There are 95 scenarios in one campaign. Each scenario (I called them dungeons above, same thing) is very well adjusted to the point that when we win it (you lose too, but not to the point that it breaks your game or sucks the fun out of it), always win it by a hair. You find yourself immersed in the campaign, as you level up and improve your character by getting perks, new items, new action cards, upgrades to cards etc. And there are plenty of characters to play, so in one campaign, the game eventually makes you retire that character and pick a new one, which somewhat adds a replay value in the very same campaign.

Boardgame itself is an EXCEPTIONAL game, so what about the digital? Honestly speaking, this might be the only game I'd prefer playing the digital over the tabletop version. Not that the board game is bad, far from it, it is just too much work. The setup takes a lot of time, it requires a lot of attention to follow the game and the combat, the perks, calculating everything correctly, you get the idea. This becomes especially overwhelming if you're kind of the GM, which means you know the game best thus you must follow everything so that a more casual player or a new player doesn't mess up. If you really want to see what it looks like, try Youtube or even better, the versions on Tabletop Simulator. Even scripted on TTS, it's a pain in the butt. The digital takes away all that ""chores"" away and lets you just play, without doing all that work. You can find other people saying that setup itself is a big darn chore. I kid you not, there are people I see online selling their tabletop copies because they can play digital now. Another thing I liked about the digital was the tutorials. Most digital board game tutorials (this is not exclusive to board games, even AAA games now lately) make you do stuff but you don't really understand why you're doing that particular action. You finish that tutorial and you have ZERO knowledge about the board game and just are confused. Not in Gloomhaven though. Gloomhaven's tutorial teaches you the mechanics pretty good and it makes you learn via giving you puzzles, letting you to figure out how the game should be played in that particular situation. Tutorial is relatively long but I suggest you do everything if you've never played before. I was told in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/780290/discussions/0/3594464960494398953/] that Steam thread I mentioned above[/url] I'd need some extra knowledge on the rules, tactics, monster AI, aside from the tutorial and they were right. If you like the game, that won't be a problem at all, to put in some research. Digital has good friendly UI, which is a must of a game of this caliber. Graphics are pretty, and immersive enough for a board game and I like playing it. 

If you're planning to play it as a board game group, I say go for it, you won't regret it. As a solo player you can have fun, but controlling 2-3 characters will be exhausting and tedious. In my humble opinion, it's really entertaining as a shared experience. And you cannot soloqueue to play with other people (It's not like Catan, you cannot play with some randos), that's something must be told, thus you cannot just buy the game and join someone's session (it requires invites or session codes to play multiplayer). However I'm sure there are people on forums looking for players online. In conclusion, my suggestion is to buy it as a group to play with friends.

Original negative review was 4 hours in and just got WAY more null (0 damage) rolls than necessary. The beginning scenarios are an absolute nightmare and sometimes feel impossible to complete in normal difficulty. Beginning experience was not fun at all. I still stand by that.

If you manage to suffer through and make it over the hump - beginning ~3 scenarios in Campaign, then the game rewards you by opening up with great feelings of progression and massive content. As you progress you can choose to mitigate the RNG you felt at the beginning. After a few levels, your characters definitely feel way stronger. There is a ton of complexity in builds, characters to unlock, playstyles, and the game feels like an open world.

If you are a fan of the board game then you have probably already bought it and why are you reading this review? It's a faithful adaptation and let's you play by yourself or online with friends.

For everyone else, the game is a lot of fun. The characters can play very differently from each other and one of the main incentives is to unlock and try out new ones. You can adjust the difficulty to make it very challenging or easy so it very accessible. There is a lot going on in the game with items, perks, cards, and summoning elements which changes what your cards (an some enemies) can do but you will catch on quickly. On the downside, the game is slow. There can be a lot of enemies and the animations are oddly slow (movement, attacks, especially buffing themselves).

Overall, it a great experience with tactical gameplay built around a diverse group of characters. Figuring out how to play your character (and new ones as they retire) and then fitting them into your party composition is very engaging.",1678636006,1678636006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like a turn-based strategy game and RPG, this is the game for you. It's playing X-COM2 but with more characters, enemies, variability in strategy. What is well thought out is the character classes and personalities which provides flexibility with the author of this game to do something outside of standard attacks, AOE, and movement. Where some games, it may just be ""attack"" and ""move"", this game can manipulate it where you chain a movement, ranged attack, and enemy pull in one half of the character's action, then a strategic immobilization of a melee enemy where you retreat avoiding damage. The cards for each character allows all the variability.

Also what makes this game great is the leveling and party system. Within the leveling, the game will scale according to your level always providing a challenge. Party system allows new characters, which may be low level, to be mixed with a current party of higher level characters. My lower level character is not demolished because we are playing at a higher scenario level. It also allows many different party combinations so there is reply value.

Then, the things that are famously less good about TRPGs, like complex, esoteric, and over-bearing rules and a glacial round-by-round pace, and it makes those things much worse.

Obviously this isn't a TRPG, though, so totally my bad for hoping for a dungeon-crawler that provided *some* level of the above positives. But the real problem is that the game isn't very much fun. I gave it a real shot with an experienced guide and an open mind, and wish I had my 7 hours back.
 
The core exhaustion system is deep and strategic, but highly punishing when you make mistakes (or even just make moves that aren't optimal). Turns takes forever if you want to do things ""right,"" as you negotiate turn orders and next steps with your party. The action-by-action random modifier rolling prevents the ""solved"" gameplay the designers are clearly trying to avoid, but it adds a lot of unwelcome variance that is generally ignored when it goes well and feels terrible when it goes bad. There are clearly optimal moves to make at most times, to the point where one friend I was playing with gave me hell for deviating a couple of hexes to pick up some gold, rather than heading straight for the closed door we needed to open (and worse, he was right. My slight deviation put me in non-optimal spot to use my esoteric and highly restrictive abilities in the following rounds).

So the core gameplay is full of punishment by design.

The world is dark and depressing and really doesn't like you. Nearly every interaction in the between-combat scenes results in a negative outcome, so you come to dread doing things that should be fun especially as you're on your way to a dungeon and really need to be in tip-top shape to do well. Fight the wolves? Take a bunch of damage. Hide from the wolves? Get poisoned.

But all of the above *could* be worth pushing through if the rewards for all the pain feel worthwhile, but in Gloomhaven the rewards are tiny and infrequent. You're heavily discouraged from picking up treasure or gold in dungeons, for example, as the gold lying around is rarely worth the effort, the infrequent treasure chests are regularly trapped, and collecting either burns your most important resource, the cards the keep you from becoming exhausted in dungeons that seem to be tuned so you can *just* barely complete them if you're playing correctly. 

Hilariously, treasure you *do* collect in dungeons gets added to the merchant's stall, but you don't get it and then you still need to buy it from the man, which is complete nonsense in any logical sense but likely a necessity for the designers to maintain the oppressive feel of the game.

And that's a fact across all of the systems in the game—there's little world-building here to enjoy outside of some excellent voice-acting and solid (or better writing), but even though what's here is pretty great, that lore is all just set dressing to justify the complex card-based round-by-round meta the game is built around. The result is that you have to bend your mind around the reasoning for merchants who steal your goods and gold left lying on the floor and a mad rush to get the doors open in the dungeon to ensure you don't get so tired in the dungeon that you just die. Gloomhaven is a resource-management puzzle, not a dungeon-crawler, despite the aesthetics and the dungeons you crawl through.

And finally, levelling up feels bad. After five hours of punishment I reached level 2 with my identity-less character and earned a single HP and the option to add a single card to the possible cards in my deck. Oof.

And a quick note on stability; we had two players on Steam and one on EGS, and we regularly DCed and had to reload. During our entire first session our host disconnected every single turn, and we learned he was on a slightly different version, but we had to dig between sessions to uncover the issue.

So! If you're looking for a punishing, slow, and rules-heavy strategic board game skinned like a fantasy dungeon crawler, you'll probably have a great time (like so many people have had for years playing this board game). There is a ton of depth here and I see a glimmer of the fun you could have with creating the optimal deck/play style etc.

But if you're looking for any of the things that feel *good* in a TRPG, you won't find them here.",1678151535,1678151535,False,81,6,0.642796814441680908,0,True,False,False

The narrator does an excellent job the entire way through as well. If you already like Gloomhaven and aren't sure if this does it justice? It does. 

Some things to be aware of - This game's ""story"" really just acts as a vehicle for missions. There is a through-line, leads you follow and mysteries here and there, but there isn't really any sort of character development or over-arching plot, at least so far, 40 hours in. That said, there is a ton of lore for all the races and regions and Gloomhaven itself - so it doesn't feel like a washed-up fantasy setting at all, but the story you follow throughout isn't anything special. I personally have no problem with this as the game is fantastic anyway, and the lore is interesting by itself, just thought it was something to keep in mind though.

If you buy the Solo missions DLC, you can no longer play online with anyone that doesn't have it. That's poor design, or a stupid oversight. It's not expensive, so the issue isn't drastic, but it's still something that shouldn't be. 

Other than that, I highly recommend this game.

As someone who has only played the digital version I can say that this is a solid pick up and play tactics game either solo or co-op. Just know that this game is very difficult and you will need to fight tooth and nail for every victory. On the bright side, there is practically no penalty for getting wiped out since you get to keep any XP and loot you earned during a given attempt. If you are the type to get frustrated easily I would suggest playing on friendly mode first. Even though this is the easiest difficulty you will still be required  to play optimally. If you plan on playing on Normal or above be prepared to reattempt missions many times before succeeding. The game takes no time to ramp up the difficulty as even the very first quest is super hard.

Lastly, it will probably take a few hours to learn the ropes so do not be surprised if the game mechanics do not click at first.

The real gem of this game is the tactical depth, but i'm still not sure if that's really a thing. its a card based system and you can use some cards only once, you exhaust your deck and rest to get it back, losing a card when you rest. the key is not to discard all your cards before the end of the dungeon, or you die from exhaustion. this usually happens when you are forced to ""rest"" and recover your cards but you don't have enough left. exhausting.

I have played the board game a little bit and found it both much more fun, and much more forgiving than this version. Playing on normal on the first campaign mission has you face 3 rooms of increasingly difficult enemies, where you can often barely clear the first room. I understand that 'stamina' in the form of not burning cards unnecessarily, and pushing enemies into traps is a thing. However, that doesn't really matter when you are outnumbered approximately 6 to one and the enemies generally do double damage against you.

The interface is pretty horrible also. There is mission-critical information that is only available by viewing tooltips on various cards in the interface, where the icon for the tool tip isn't big enough to register unless you are carefully dissecting each visible element.

On top of this, the game is extremely time consuming to play, so attempts to get better at the game require a much larger time commitment than usual as mistakes are generally unforgiving to the point of wrecking a session.

I am going to give this game a couple more tries I think as I have been learning some things and wan't to give it a fair shake based on the board game, but on balance I can't recommend it to anyone who does not meet the criteria above.

My advice to the developers: Look up the term ""difficulty curve"" as it applies to gaming. See if that gets you anywhere.",1676615055,1676615055,False,0,0,0.421935945749282837,0,True,False,False

It's a hex-based co-op board game with 1-4 players (the more, the better, though I enjoy occasionally testing out characters solo). Each player has a character with different roles (Brute=tank, Orbweaver=mage/glass cannon, etc) which carry out quests in a war-gamish, hack and slash way. However, your actions are controlled by your cards- you play cards which can allow you to attack (in various ways- AoE, single-target, etc), shield yourself, move, create traps, heal, modify the terrain, buff, debuff, etc. The cards are each unique to the character type and define the character's role.

As you play, in addition to quest rewards like equipment and gold, you also gain experience, which allows you to level your character. This adds HP, but more importantly gives you access to new cards and ""perks"", which provide yet another way to customize your character's strengths. You can also modify the cards directly through the Enchantress one you unlock it, allowing you to, say, add damage to an attack, or expand the range of an AoE attack, etc.

There's additional character progression (like unlocking new classes through gameplay) and other mechanics that offer near infinite replayability. 

While I won't say you can't play solo- it is fully supported, in that you can accomplish anything solo  that you can in the main campaign with other players- it is very much intended as a multiplayer game that you play with friends. As you play with a character, you develop an almost intuitive understanding of their capabilities; as you play with a party, you start to really understand their characters. It creates a real sense of camaraderie, as you discuss strategies, tactics, and how best to progress in the campaign. There's not much in the sense of role-playing- this is a very ""crunchy"" game- but you can definitely have the hack'n'slash part of an RPG with deep tactics and intra-party synergies.

It does not include perks, items have durability and are automatically discarded, gold is cashed in periodically at towns to buy items (that have durability), there is no prosperity/reputation track, there are no city events, road events happen randomly, and so on.

Bottom Line: I don't think it's very fun.

(Edit: Response to Developer comment below)

Why are you asking me to consider the things you promised in your road map when my two primary criticisms are not a part of it? The ""x"" level cards are not stated in your road map, and secondly, I state that the game, as it is, is dry and not very fun.

If you know about Gloomhaven: this removes the overhead of setting up maps, tracking monster focus, managing stickers, cards, envelopes etcetera, but in turn removes some player-resolved ambiguity and some fringe interactions based on mid-action item activation. Also, obviously, you cannot houserule what you want if you don't like it. Also there are a couple of bugs still scattered throughout the game, but they don't hurt the overall gameplay much.
If you don't know about Gloomhaven: this is a game that by itself onboarded me onto an entirely new hobby and into several communities by being an accessible and simple introduction to an otherwise very complex and daunting boardgame. The unique twist of combat mechanics combined with wide variety of characters makes for a lot of space to explore. Some of the shortcomings or things that could turn some away are:
1) It's not easy, and it's not necessarily welcoming in a sense that the first scenario can easily be the hardest due to users not knowing the tactical nuances and the enemy spawns not being adjusted much to account for it.
2) Having to deal with stamina. Your strongest actions can only be used once per battle, and every 4-6 turns you'll have to part with one of your cards for the rest of the battle, so you'll have to make a lot of tough decisions and you will always be on the clock. This is a key part of the game, but it can lead to some feelings of ""being gated from the most fun attacks"" and/or ""I was winning and then I died"".
3) The game is making its best attempt to replicate the original(duh). The aforementioned original lacked testing in certain areas, which results in potential powerlevel disparities between: different classes, levelup options, items, enemy sets and even basic abilities.
The last point isn't as bad as it can sound, because the game's difficulty can be widely adjusted between any two scenarios; any class is perfectly playable at Normal difficulty once you get the hang of it, you just might sometimes find yourself not really having a choice of your upgrade or still using starting items mid-campaign.
Points for it are: it's super tactically deep, has a cool combat mechanic I've never seen before and gives a lot of stuff to discover and explore even past your first playthrough. If you're not playing alone, then you're even more likely to find something else to play with or as during the rerun.

TL;DR: a rather faithful adaptation of a very good tactical dungeon crawler boardgame that removes a lot of boardgame-related hassle. Save for a few bugs and balance irks inherited from the original, it's very fun and pretty replayable, especially for Multiplayer.",1675861530,1675861530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. you have to equip every item you buy, there's no indication of it, no prompt to the player, and the game doesn't care if you go into a level without one equipped - and there is no way to equip in a level. In a physical version this would be a non-issue. In a computer version, it's a pain (and I am not the only party member caught out by this).
2. random encounters are just ways to punish you, often for a) doing the right thing; or b) engaging in the fiction. Very poor game design imo
3. the way the modifier deck works is obscure at best. It would be nice to have an in-game explainer.
4.  once you get to a level and want to modify your cards, the UI covers part of your cards at the bottom of the screen - and there is vital information there. Very, very poor.
5. card deck design doesn't feel internally balanced, but maybe that's just me.
6. I challenge anyone to give 2c about the story after the first 5 hours, lol.
7. UI for targeting things is bad. You get used to it, but at first it is going to catch you out when you try to add an element or item's ability to your attack.

People who can looks past its core problems will enjoy this game, but it is clunky and obtuse by design and it would seem they have no intention of changing that. I have put a lot of hours into the game and it does feel rewarding once you master it, but that climb will be obnoxious for all but the most dedicated player. Because of that I would hesitate to recommend this game to anyone, even those who generally like grid based strategies.]

TLDR: The game needs serious polish but has a lot of potential if it gets said polish.

First things first, the game functions fine. If there are any bugs, I have not run into them and as near as I can tell all the features of the game are based around the actual tabletop version. (which I have not played for the record) In fact, the core systems of the game are really interesting. Each turn you have to choose two cards for each of your characters which determine their initiative as well as what actions they have access to once their initiative comes up. You can use each action in one of three ways generally speaking which typically amounts to: some sort of offensive/defensive action, some sort of movement/utility option, or if neither is something you want then you can use any card as a generic attack or move. At it's core this system is deep and interesting, if a bit complex for something you have to do every turn, but overall I like it in concept.

The main issue I have with the game arises from a system that is core to the functionality of the game: burning cards. In Gloomhaven, you generally start each match with ten cards (this may change as you progress through the game but at this point I do not see a way to increase this limit) and each round you use two of them for your turn. Eventually you run out of options to play and you have to take either a short or long rest to refresh your card pool for that character, but in order to do that you have to ""burn"" one of your cards which permanently removes it from your options. (until you leave that area) If at any point you no longer have enough cards left to play a turn or rest then that character instantly collapses. (I guess from exhaustion?) In principle that is fine, but in practice it is CRAZY annoying because of how it is implemented, particularly because the game gives you loads of incentives to make numerous small movements. There are loads of offenders here but to give a few examples most enemies drop gold on death and that would be perfectly fine if moving across that gold picked it up. Nope, you have to burn two cards whether or not you are in combat to go stand on some gold and pick it up, assuming you are within single move range which is far from guaranteed. This leads to some truly amazingly unsatisfying deaths where you die essentially from bending over too many times to pick up loot. Essentially you have to choose between actually getting the rewards you have earned by killing the enemies or risking death and losing the whole run each time you decide to pick something up.

Believe it or not though, it actually gets worse. Remember how I said before that there is a somewhat complex decision you have to make each turn to decide what actions you take? Well, there is no ""out of combat"" mode in this game so even once all the enemies are dead you still have to be making those decisions and planning super hard for what's beyond the next door while your goal is..... take one step and pick up some gold. And remember how you get a somewhat active action and a somewhat movement/utility action each turn? Well, you don't stop having to choose those just because nothing is happening leading to the baffling outcome of having to meticulously plan out actions that you are willing to throw in the garbage just so you can take a single step to the left. It is truly extraordinary how clunky this feels and any hint of actual tabletop RPGs that the game is striving to emulate just gets sucked right out during these insane moments of fiddly micromanagement. This could all be solved, I think very easily, by having an out of combat mode that allows you to move using both actions (perhaps just turning the generic attack into a generic movement for the top half) and allowing stuff on the floor to be picked up as part of movement rather than requiring you to end your turn on each individual thing. That would radically reduce the amount of tedious planning required for out of combat movement. (the stuff that really has no business impacting your chances of survival in the first place) This mode would activate once there are no living enemies in any active rooms and phase out seamlessly the moment you open a door.

I have several other issues with the burn system (I would genuinely throw it out and make the main focus of the game life if I was the game dev but *shrug*) but for the sake of brevity I'm just going to talk about what I view as the most significant among them. I've touched on the fact that each card has two functions now multiple times in this review but it is important for this to understand that the different effects of even a single card are wildly different depending on which piece of each card you decide to use. As a fictitious example of a card you might expect to see, you could have a top effect that causes you to attack three tiles ahead of you with the bottom option being jump three spaces and then push an adjacent enemy away. Every card also has an initiative value, generally speaking basic and/or weaker cards tend to have low initiative (meaning you go earlier) while more elaborate or powerful cards have a higher initiative. (meaning you go later) In total, this means that each card that you select requires that you analyze at least three points of information (almost always more) in order to decide whether it is the right option or not for the current situation. This very frequently results in choice paralysis, particularly since the card effects are often not great at staying in their lane.

Now, this in and of itself is a bit clunky feeling but in isolation is probably not enough to be a huge problem. The real meaty issue is introduced when you add in the fact that a good chunk (probably a third or more) of the cards in the game have at least one of their options result in the card being immediately burned without being used for a rest. As we have already established, this is incredibly bad because you only have a maximum of 48 actions (24 turns) for each character before they run out of cards to burn and tap out in the best case scenario. What this effectively means is that any card effect that ends in ""burn this card"" essentially translates to ""never use this function unless you are in the last room and comfortably winning."" Even then I probably still wouldn't be burning cards willy nilly because the treasure chests cannot be looted if your objective is met before you get to it. (I guess your character is just too tired from slaying monsters and bending over to pick up gold to bother looting the treasure they fought so hard for) This could once again easily be solved by simply allowing the player to decide when to leave rather than automatically forcing them out once the objective is completed and I really hope they make that change prior to launch if nothing else.

I know that the tone of this review is very pessimistic but please do not take it as me just bashing this game. I really think there is a diamond buried here and I hope that the devs manage to dig that diamond out of this rough. This game could truly be something special if it is given the polish that it really needs to shine. They just need to stop emphasizing the worst parts of 2E and make the focus of the experience the actual combat (which is quite good) and deck building. (which may or may not be in the game at this point, if it is I have not reached it)",1564276540,1675454105,False,6,0,0.531693756580352783,0,True,False,False

Much of the original critiques I had with the game still stand. However there have been notable improvements that would tip me over into recommend, especially if you enjoy or want to try the board game. Hats off to the devs for their continued effort and improvements. 

Notable Improvements. 
- Content complete - There is substantially more content
- Additional game options (difficulty levels, campaign vs generated, etc) 
- UX improved, still would love some extra work here, but it is better than the original version I played and there's less painful delays and painfully long animations. 
- Performance is improved. (Still a bit long load times, and sluggish, but very playable)


Keeping Original Review below from early access. 

This game needs too much work to recommend, and I get that Gloomhaven is in Early Access but I'm not optimistic. Good Early Access games tend to have all the content and can focus on polish and improvements, -or- the game is very polished and lacking content. Gloomhaven is painfully unpolished -and- missing basically all it's content. 

I feel the reviews are being carried largely for love of the boardgame and the promise it has rather than the merits of the current product. The current product feels clunky and lifeless (even excluding the bugs). The UI/UX is serviceable if you are intimately familiar with the rules of the physical game but critically lacking if you are not.

I cannot recommend this product in its current state. I was excited for this as much as anyone and I seriously hope I'm wrong when the game enters it's final release state. Wait and reassess when the game is finally released to see if it's worth picking up.",1563643739,1675443758,True,1,0,0.534313738346099854,0,True,False,True

What Gloomhaven Digital does well is wrapping the core experience of Gloomhaven up in a nice pretty box with a bow and marketing it to a much wider potential audience. It's an overall pretty faithful depiction of the original game's rules and scenarios in a new format, and I don't really take issue with much when it comes to the few changes that were made to both the overarching rules (adding center hex as an LOS option actually helps a lot in one specific scenario that comes to mind, where if you play by the original rules there's quite literally a hex that doesn't have LOS to any other hex on the map) as well as some card/perk changes to enhance mechanical cohesion, as is the case with Demolitionist getting more obstacle manipulation tools and having its level 5 card option buffed pretty substantially.

What I ultimately dislike about this version of the game is how it actually handles. A lot of the UX elements are somewhat unintuitive (like how an AoE pattern or multi-target attack will deselect if you choose to spend an item or element on the attack), and while they can be worked around it's not something that you should really *have* to work around ultimately. The most egregious example by far of unhelpful UX in the game definitely has to be the infamous Restart Round button existing in place of a simple undo button, especially given how unforgiving the timing for the button's usage is (let alone how painful the load times can be). I won't go into too much detail about the Restart Round button's problems, but just know that they are as varied as they are painful.

Ultimately, I think Gloomhaven Digital is a great gateway product to let people know about a fantastic board game, but it's far from the definitive experience. I would sooner recommend picking up a copy of Tabletop Simulator, if nothing else than for the sake of being able to roll back miscommunications with relative ease and being able to recapture at least some of the tactile experience of playing a board game, which this adapatation of Gloomhaven sadly lacks. Additionally, the Tabletop Simulator mod for this game has the critically acclaimed fanmade ""Crimson Scales"" expansion as a playable option alongside the much more divisive Forgotten Circles, of which the latter's inclusion is of debatable virtue but which the former makes a great addition in terms of sheer content volume and quality. Obviously for the ultimate Gloomhaven experience I'd recommend throwing your back out of alignment by trying to unbox the physical version and playing that instead, but we don't all have the luxury of a fully-staffed friendgroup we can lock in our basements and force to play whatever board games we want, so this and Tabletop Sim will have to do for those who aren't so lucky.",1675138458,1675138458,True,9,0,0.634316325187683105,0,True,False,False

This is a game deeply-deeply-deeply focussed on strategy that at my opinion goes too far every single damn time. Going too far means that the game's randomness can often be your downfall. Normal difficulty is a no go, but Easy is still over-the-top hard for me. I think as a board game or a cooperative multiplayer experience, it is great, as we can all suffer together or encourage each other the many times the game utterly destroys us, but as a solo game, this is not great. Too much limitations, game pace way way too slow, too many missclicks completely ruining the scenario unless you do the whole turn all over again, and again, etc. Repeating the same scenarios to beat them is not much of a fun either and break the immersion a bit. And finally, level scalling feels too intense, as leveling up to gain more chances of beating a scenario you are struggling with does not help, and sometimes even make things harder for you. Imagine failing a scenario at the last moment, leveling up, and trying it again to realize it is way harder now? Unnecessary.

When playing IRL the process is much more rewarding.  The narrative is more fleshed out.  Maybe the issues weren't issues after all. 
In Gloomhaven you can fail at a scenario and keep the xp and gold.  With friends, cardboard, and plastic that seems like an ok solution.  In the digital format it makes me think, ""What is the point?"".  I can just continue to play a scenario over and over.  I can collect gold and xp and just repeat the scenario again.

The Gloomhaven digital implementation is no exception: the combat animations are typically lacklustre or unvaried; the user interface lacks in places; and it’d be nice to have Steam’s remote play together as an option. However, you have to remember that Gloomhaven on release was an approximately £120 board game with over 100 hours of play in it, and it’s now being offered to you for under £30 with the full campaign, Guildmaster mode (which includes another 100 scenarios worth of content) AND all the fiddly bookkeeping and setup/teardown (which Gloomhaven is known for) taken care of for you. What’s even crazier is that you can find it on discount around the web, or just wait for a Steam sale, and you’d be getting even more value on what is already an incredible package. It’s just unfair to hold any criticism against it when you consider you’re getting not just the number one board game on Board Game Geek (BGG) for several years running but additional content on top for this low of a price.

Essentially, if you’ve ever been interested in Gloomhaven and haven’t had the group to play it with, or are a fanatic that wants more, then it’s a no-brainer to pick up, however I would caution that Gloomhaven is not a game for everyone despite its high BGG ranking.

[b]Cautionary note[/b]: at this point you’ve read my review of the digital implementation: it’s superb with some tiny flaws that aren't meaningful relative to how much content you're getting. I’m going to be using the rest of this space to talk about Gloomhaven as a game, so don’t feel you have to read on if you like the game and just wanted to know if this digital version was good.

In a way, I’ve never really understood why Gloomhaven has held the number one board game position for as long as it has. Gloomhaven is pretty much all about the combat system. Yes, yes, there’re story and light RPG elements, but you’re going to be spending the majority of your time grokking over your hand of options trying to figure out how you want to tackle the current battlefield situation. And this is not to say the combat’s not good, it’s a really solid system, and the problems it poses are uniquely interesting with a myriad of solutions and approaches to consider and enjoy, but, as games go, it’s very same-y. Room, monsters, option selection, planning, execution, repeat, repeat, repeat.

In-between scenarios there’re occasional level ups, shopping, and the infrequent unlocks with sprinklings of story, and those’re all fun too, but the combat is the heart of it all and if you’re not into that aspect then I can’t see anything else keeping you in. If you’re willing to obsess over min-maxing your character then I think you’ll find a lot of mileage in tweaking your hand of cards for each mission and choosing the best equipment and level up options to suit your playstyle, but even if that’s not your thing then it’s still a game for thinkers at its core. There’re vanishingly few easy decisions in Gloomhaven and the scenarios will remain challenging throughout your playtime.

I suspect my view of Gloomhaven’s play experience is too reductive, but I tend to find I can only play small bursts of Gloomhaven when I’m playing solo. My experience playing the tabletop version with friends does generally feel fuller and keeps me wanting more even after we finish a scenario, so perhaps there’s more to be had from that. But when I play live I’ve often seen the same fatigue from the game’s repetitive gameplay structure setting in behind their eyes. I guess your mileage may vary is the take away from this. Know that for those that are into what Gloomhaven offers then it’s a resplendent feast.",1645493431,1673701179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Disclaimer: I haven't played the tabletop game so I can only judge this as a video game, not as an adaptation.

✔️ Excellent tactical depth - each choice you take during a battle can have huge consequences on its outcome, and the game has some surprisingly astute combat mechanics I have seen nowhere else.
✔️ Incredible balance - while every action counts, it is possible to win often, but expect most victories to be very close ones.
✔️ The graphics are very beautiful, with a particular care given to the environments that not only have a tabletop feel to them, but are also varied, crisp, and detailed.
✔️ Smart character build customization with a unique deckbuilding mechanic. Like for the battles, each choice you take can impact your gameplay in a major way, and synergies between abilities (and characters) are many!
✔️ The world is rich and detailed, filled with intrigue, factions, strange creatures, and surprising events.
✔️ Despite the game's focus on tactical combat, the narration still offers an interesting amount of player choice.
✔️ Full voiceover of the narration.
✔️ Nice music.
✔️ Flexible difficulty options that allow anyone to experience the game.

💭 Some people I know complain about some degree of ""sluggishness"" in the game, due to the fact that the time between turns of a given player may be somewhat long, especially in full groups of 4. Personally it doesn't bother me, since the tactical sharpness of the game requires some degree of maintained attention in order to avoid fatal misplays, but it wouldn't have been fair if I didn't mention that.

2. Do the in game walk through.
3. Play the game on the easiest setting in the beginning. Understand the game is way over tuned in the beginning and expect to die on the first 2 scenarios quite a few times. Just power level and learn until you can beat it. The difficulty level in the beginning even on the easiest setting is ridiculous. The Dev's should not have done this as I am sure 90% of the people that gave up would really enjoy this game...
4. Personal Quests matter! They decide which characters you unlock when in character creation you choose them so I don't feel this is a spoiler. I restarted after playing for weeks a ton to choose my starting party and 'ending' party better. I hope this saves others a lot of time.

I quit playing several times and started over every time. You don't need to do that failing doesn't do anything permanent or long term. Just keep learning the decks when you start off and things will make sense eventually and you will be able to form strategies.

Edit:

This game is incredible. I'd give 6 stars if possible. I am so glad I chose to not give up. The mechanics and math are perfection. The diversity in classes and skills is vast and awesome. The definition of 'original'. Creative beacon of light to the videogame industry. I will put hundreds of hours into this one. I really hope it gets lots of expansions. I will buy every one of them.

Ultimately. I find the game so well made that I am still calling it positive.  Just expect to use mods to adjust your experience level to make up for the awkward level design.  Some as simple as a mod for stamina potions or to add to your card limits to lower the chance that RNG will ruin your one-two hour effort no a level.  

I love TBS and card combat, though this game as sold fails HARD in a level design that is uninspired and tries to make up for it with astounding difficulty and RNG. Near perfect strategy and luck are needed to win, which is a sign of bad game design.  That our you put it on ""easy"" and spend 30 hours leveling up your character.  I put 4-6 hours in, and the game design is so clunky all I could do was try the tutorial and the first level 5 times before getting too frustrated.  Very strong promise, but missing out on level optimization.  I'm sure fan-made levels in the board game are much more fun, this is not. :)  Thankfully the mods are there on steam to adjust for these mistakes.

Your deck diminishes over the course of the dungeon, using cards for actions or movement. Taking excessive damage will also cost you cards, sometimes more than half your deck in a single turn if you are very unlucky, which can make your run very short.

The idea of fusing movement and actions into a limited set of action cards is novel, but ultimately given the games aggressive RNG this will mean most players will exhaust their turns part way through a dungeon. There are certain classes with the ability to restore discarded cards, which my party relied on heavily.

The game itself is designed to be punishing, but mostly not in a way that can learned or overcome. In our experience, rolls typically skew unfavorable. Using one of your ~10 cards for an action doesn't mean it will happen, often you will fail a dice roll and just waste one of your precious cards. Our party began at Normal difficulty, and after failing to clear the first mission more than 6 times, we tried other missions, and also failed all of those. Eventually we began periodically lowering the difficulty which allowed us to finally progress. There appears to be a massive disparity between the games easiest difficult and all other difficulty settings. Ultimately we had to choose between an unchallenging easy difficulty and an unassailable Normal difficulty. As you progress the game does become somewhat manageable as you can afford items and unlock new cards.

The game also has ""encounters"" which occur between dungeons. They involve a bit or story followed by a binary choice. Regardless of the choice, most encounters will hurt your party, either by taking away your progress towards action points, money, or giving your party a debuff at the start of the next dungeon. There is no way to predict which choice will provide what detriment, the only way to learn this is through experience and repetition. There is also a chance that encounters can benefit a party, but these appear to be extremely uncommon.

Playing with friends, the game needs to be reset roughly every other dungeon due to technical issues such as desync, crashes, and other bugs. The game has a dedicated bug report menu, which our host used frequently. The game does not allow players to rejoin mid-turn: you have to wait until turns are over, so the host ends up having to play many of other players moves. Rejoining is not a guarantee that users will be able to retake control of their characters and we experience several soft locks where our only solution was to kick all players and stream the hosts perspective in a voice call.

I write this review after having narrowly completing an escort dungeon by one turn before exhausting our last standing players deck. We are not sure if it was a deliberate design choice or buggy pathfinding AI, but the NPC we were required to escort would not move if any enemies anywhere in the dungeon were positioned in a doorway space. It took many turns during the session to even understand how to get them to move, as they just stood by at the entrance turn after turn.

The game is not bad, I personally think the aesthetic of the game is wonderful. The dungeons feel somewhat underwhelming in design, but the game definitely captures a tabletop map and deck game motif. The abilities are varied and choosing which card to play definitely involves understanding, strategy, and a degree of chance. It definitely involves a different mindset. The games story is largely driven by each dungeon, episodic and sparse. The game does provide art and narration.

This is perhaps one of the few games where I do not feel a sense of accomplishment when overcoming difficulty, and unfortunately felt strongly enough to leave a negative review. It's a nice game if you're a glutton for punishment, but I do not think most people would find this game enjoyable. The game will roll the dice, and bad rolls are extremely punishing and will make your experience short.",1673077739,1673078965,False,49,12,0.576294600963592529,0,True,False,False

It is just excessively difficult and after failing the first missions over and over I think a lot of people will just stop playing and trash the game - that is what i almost did.  

But I sucked it up and after reading a ton of complaints about the difficulty I bit the bullet and did 'easy mode'...  That is much more what I expected 'normal' to be -  and it is not easy at all, but i can do most scenarios in less than two tries. 
 
It is like buying a chess program that only has AI setting for GM. I know, white knights will point out a video showing someone crushing the hardest difficulty, but i can point them to Magnus Carlson crushing GM level chess... most players are not Magnus.... As a new person to the 'world' it should be common sense to play 'normal' difficulty and win the early battles in a try or two. I think they are really doing the game a disservice by making the early game so difficult. 

I recommend the game because if you can stomach playing 'easy mode' it offers a lot of content and is a good value for the price - but i can also see giving this a big thumbs down as the first impression is terrible.  it also suffers from the tight restrictions on card use making it a must that you highly optimize every card decision - but the first run of 'dungeons' you will not have a perfect optimal move path etc. and so it is very punishing for first time thru a level as you will fail often due to running out of cards toward the end.",1672981544,1672981670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You and your friends decide to get together for the first time in months to play some board games. You've got one night to throw in all of the games you've been wanting to get to for like seven years. Gloomhaven is agreed upon by everyone but Todd. Todd wanted to play Twilight Imperium. It takes you 2.5 hours to learn how to play. It takes you another 30 minutes to physically set the game up. It's going smoothly and then someone forgets to move a monster. You have to back track five moves or have that nagging feeling that you're playing the game wrong because of one mistake. It's cool. You get over it. Someone forgets that they aren't invisible anymore. Or they're muddled. Or they're stunned. The cycle continues. You lose the scenario. Todd flips the table and decides he's going to divorce his wife. All because of Gloomhaven the board game. 

With the digital version you don't have to invite your friends over. You don't have to deal with Todd and his drinking problem. You don't even have to pretend you have friends for this example. You can just purchase the game via steam and go right on playing. Sure there's a tutorial, but it's useful to go through once. And it can frustrating to become fully exhausted in a dungeon, but you don't have to keep track of tiny pieces or physical cards. Plus that's something you would deal with in the board game anyway. And better yet you can play solo, as a guild master, or build a campaign. Or if you forgive Todd because you've known him since middle school and he's always been there to help you move, you can invite friends to play without being in the same room.

More confusingly, are from the few negative reviews this game has gotten; nobody appears to address any of the complaints I'm about to bring up. I got your back!

There is plenty to pick apart, but I've narrowed down my disdain to these insufferable aspects...

--- STAGES [ part 1: the hidden size ] ---
Lets start off by stating the obvious, the card ""burn"" mechanic is f*cking obnoxious! Yet, it is made far worse whenever exploring a stage for the first time. Are there three rooms? Four? More? Who the hell knows! But, you better hustle because you'll eventually run out of cards. Or, don't hustle, because alerting too many enemies is securing doom. Who knows? Certainly not you, on the first run. Don't despair, keep losing your progress and you'll eventually come to...

--- STAGES [ part 2: familiar layout ] ---
Now you know the stage. Might have taken a few tries, but the mystery is gone. There isn't any randomization for: corridors; room size; enemy type and layout; traps. It's beyond dumb and feels like the game could have saved me some time if it just revealed the layout. But, what's the fun in that right? Though now you're subjected to just...

--- STAGES [ part 3: same place, same strategy ] ---
Once you've figured out what works for the layout and characters, just repeat the same strategy. RNG might change things up a bit but for most situations, you'll figure out the best opener for a particular level and when to have that ""push"" card on standby for pushing monsters into traps you know they'll be standing adjacent to. Hopefully this redundancy won't be boring for you because...

--- STAGES [ part 4: purgatory ] ---
You will be stuck on the same levels multiple times during the early game. This won't always be the case as you gear and level up, but when it does happen, it will test your f*cking mettle in ways few games of this nature ever do. Good luck!

--- ENCOUNTERS ---
Having to endure encounters isn't an issue rather it is the perceived choice they claim to offer. Play the game long enough, you'll memorize which choices have idealistic outcomes or offer lesser punishments. Why even bother? I'd much rather the game would randomly give or take crap from me. Don't insult us with the illusion of choice, when I already know choosing option 'B' will always give me reputation, whereas option 'A' would have robbed me. These options are fixed. They don't offer a percentage outcome of risk or reward. Oh, and take note, be prepared to lose a lot of progress until you familiarize yourself with the correct answers.

--- COIN ---
Wow! Sh*t gets crazy expensive in this game. It's already challenging enough trying to complete a level in the hopes that the cards won't burn out before the area can be cleared. Yet, I'm expected to squat on gold piles or utilize loot cards to collect what starts off as paltry amounts? This doesn't appear too unreasonable until you unlock card upgrades. I took a look at the cost of those and decided for everything else this game has pissed me off about, I'm done grinding my way through mediocrity.",1672680880,1672680880,False,8,1,0.497670084238052368,0,True,False,False

Gloomhaven is one of the best board games ever made.  Period.  The game plays as a dungeon crawler and uses a Card based action system that is simple to explain but extremely nuanced in its complexity.  Each round you play two cards and then, when it's your turn in initiative, perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.  It's that simple but there are ten thousand reasons why it is actually more complex than that.  Which top action do you choose (for you are not locked in to an action until you perform it)? What do you target with your attack?  What is the enemy doing?  What are your allies doing?  Should you use one of the game's many powerful items?  Should you use all of your items in one bombastic turn thus sacrificing yourself in a white, hot blaze of glory?  The possibility space is nearly unlimited and thus this game's main mechanic is just perfection.  I simply cannot rave about it enough.  You NEED to play this game!

So, all this digital version has to do is adapt the board game faithfully without any game breaking glitches.  Gloomhaven digital does succeed at that but not perfectly.  I've played a lot of this game by now and I would say one out of every dozen play sessions something goofs up.  That's only a 8.33% failure rate but still, it can be frustrating.  Most frequently it just requires a reboot but occasionally my play group and I have lost progress.  Never huge amounts of it but we have lost multi hour long play sessions to the ether forcing us to replay scenarios.  

So, do I recommend the game?  Yes, I do.  I would also recommend that you, or someone in your play group, back up your saves.  Speaking of play groups, this game is enhanced greatly by playing it with others.  I would still recommend the game if you are forced to play it alone but it's worth playing at a slower pace just to accommodate friend's schedules.  

Good luck friends!

I'm playing through the campaign solo, so can't speak to the multiplayer aspects, but being able to focus on the core turn-based strategy gameplay without having to worry about any setup or AI actions is the best way to experience Gloomhaven. It also looks a treat, with fully animated characters and enemies, and 3D environments being vastly superior to (badly) painted miniatures, cardboard standees, and tiles (not a criticism of the board game, which has to work within the medium).

However, while the gameplay being pulled from the board game is great, you also get the plot, mission structure, and writing which is far below the expected quality from modern PC RPGs like Divinity and Pillars of Eternity. The campaign is effectively a random bunch of missions connected very loosely by some overarching narrative about generic fantasy monsters and baddies. There's no proper journal or quest log, and missions branch frequently, so you'll probably end up with 15+ available missions and hardly any idea of what stage they are in their various 'quest lines'. The writing is abysmal and doesn't provide any sort of narrative hook to continue. The main drive to continue playing will come from the satisfying combat puzzles and the lure of more ability cards and eventually more classes to try out.

Overall a great turn based strategy game and worth playing if you're into that sort of thing, even if you know nothing of the Gloomhaven board game.",1672615771,1672615771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core play mechanic, where on your turn pick two cards for each character to determine their actions, is easy to grasp. The quests provide tension as characters lose cards over time and are knocked out of action (until the quest is over) when they do. So each map is something of a card management puzzle. Encounters between quests present snippets of story rooted in binary choices that add context to the main narrative. 

The software is a bit buggy with network hiccups too easily dropping the connection (6x, so far) and the occasional full game crash (2x, as of this writing, in 12 hours of gameplay). However, the big win is not having to take 30+ minutes to setup and tear it down each time you want to play one more mission. Not to mention saving shelf-space and the environment from having another giant box of cardboard and plastic pieces. Definitely a keeper.

This is by far the hardest table top game I have ever played. First, it was hard to understand the mechanics, then tactics came into play but after that (and with the help of my smarter comrades) the game really opened up for me. It's challenging. It's beautiful. It makes you use your brain for once. The amount of content quest-wise and character-wise is huge. Can't be certain, but I reckon it may take up to 300 hours to try out every max level character with all perks and cards unlocked and beat all 95 scenarios.

I would especially like to note the work of the narrator. Boy did he deliver an outstanding performance! And yes, as many before mentioned, it's better with friends. You will fight, argue about choices and laugh at your stupidity, basically having a great time. 

There's one technical issue though that could ruin the fun: the game is VERY sensitve to your internet connection so if you have a bad one prepare yourself for frequent disconnects.

I wouldn't call it hard as much as unbalanced even in the easiest mode. I burn as few cards as possible and only take health damage but still no luck. I guess the game forces you to rush to the end room instead of playing smart?

Edit: 
I understand this is in alpha, I'll try this game after a few more updates and may change my review as I've heard great feedback about the boardgame from friends. I thought it would have multiplayer already since the video mentioned partying up (guess that only refered to creating a solo party). I'm most likely overlooking some game mechanic even though I did read the entire compendium and am not new to Tactical RPG's by any means. I tried a few more run-throughs and at this point it just feels like candy crush saga where I'm waiting on a lucky layout or enemy fault to gain any edge.

The ""timer"" on each level is your action deck, which means that you don't actually know how long you have to win unless you do a ton of math. And even that is impossible unless you have done the level before, and know how many rooms/enemies there are. Plus, any ""cool"" move your character can do shortens your timer even further. 

Out of the 3 missions I tried, all 3 resulted in my character running out of cards before even half the enemies were dead, even when I avoided using any burn cards (cards that exhaust themself) and brought a stamina potion as well. This mechanic is horrible for play experience, and makes no flavor sense either.

The rest of the game is incredibly unintuitive, overdesigned, and inelegant as well. Every action card is actually 4 different possible actions, often with confusing descriptions.

Variance is also way higher than it should be: at level 1, enemies can do anywhere from 0-6 damage. Crit fails and crits make sense in a D20 setting, where they only happen 10% of the time; but in this game, there are only 7 results that can be rolled, so crits and crit fails make up almost 30% of ALL attacks.

Flavor is some of the worst I have ever seen: animated skeleton enemies will choose to sit there and self-heal (why can skeletons heal themselves?!) which just runs down the clock on the players. And players dying to running out of actions makes no sense at all narratively, nor does it make sense that your options for actions naturally dwindles over time even if none of the actions have any permanent cost.

The narrator of the game is pretty good, and I like how well the multiplayer recovers from crashes (my friend was able to re-join mid session after a crash, which was nice.) Sadly the anti-fun core mechanics ruined the experience for me before i could even really get into it.

A static, visible turn timer would do wonders for the game. For now, just play Wildermyth or Slice and Dice instead, much better games for a fraction of the cost.",1670817375,1670817375,False,11,1,0.511877238750457764,0,True,False,False

turn card mechanic can be dumb in some situations. the clearing of a dungeon, to not be able to loot (even with a time limit of one sleeping round, or until exhaustion) is dumb,lame,unrewarding.  



There should be a house rule created for this. 
Also when trying to get to the next door, or when you have to open many doors (maybe I just need a 4man group). To discard(expend) cards just to move feels bad.  When there aren't enemys close, and you have to get through a long room with obstacles, (5spaces birds eye, but 12 spaces from the door, it seems dumb to have to decide which of your 4 cards and 2 turns you will burn... just to get to the other side of the room.  So silly that your character would get ""exhausted and need to rest from moving 12 spaces around obstacles, such as boxes). Whats so un-immersive is that one character jumped 5spaces to get across the room, rather than walking 13 because that would be fast, less turns, less tiresome.. lol  


 I would think they would have solved this mechanic to add a ""standard move action"" something like a card to be used only once or twice every rest that allows movement 4-10 spaces, consuming both actions on the turn. [and to add circumstances of using this movement for only out of combat movement, ] must not be adjacent to any enemy's from the start of movement- throughout movement-and end of movement.

Has a different feel to the game when just clicking as oppose to physically handling all of the figures and tokens. I enjoy playing both versions of Gloomhaven. It can be difficult to get people together for a session playing the tabletop version, especially if you want the consistency of playing with the same people. So when I have the itch to play, I just hop on my laptop and play. Graphics and animations are okay. Having the voice acting for scenarios is nice. For those who don't want to spend over a hundred for the tabletop version, this is a nice alternative.

Like:
- Not having to spend so much time setting up and cleaning up
- Playing with others online
- Being able to stop play and pick it back up another day without having to leave everything out and worrying if the pets will knock over everything
- Not having to make decisions based off of ambiguity of rules
- Plays true to the table top version (except for the bugs noted below)

Dislike:
- Game has many bugs that can ruin game play and make it very frustrating:
1. Attack modifiers are not randomized. The algorithms used to determine modifier appears to make them predetermined. There are certain tendencies when the null modifier will show up and it can be pretty predictable when it will appear. It is NOT BAD LUCK. More like bad programming.
2. The same thing can be said about when you have to discard a card when you short rest. 
3. I've noticed a bug with an issue regarding enemy targeting in a recent scenario I played. In the scenario I was in a situation where two characters were right next to an enemy, but the enemy targeted a character with the faster initiative. This happened more than once.
4. I've also came across another targeting issue where the enemy would target a character that was actually farther away. I moved a Brute in the line of fire of a spitting drake and it still attacked the Beast Master's Bear that was behind it.
5. This other issue I've come across could be a use case. I was using Cragheart ability to move an adjacent obstacle and drop it in an open space within a range of 4. The game would not let me drop it in an open spot adjacent to a spitting drake and two cultists. The damage would've taken out the drake, but not matter how I rotated the camera, I was not allowed to drop it into that open spot. So instead I use an area attack that targeted all three enemies and of course I would draw a null for the drake. Prior to that round, the Cragheart had just drawn the null card when I was trying to finish off a cave bear with low health.",1664182487,1670230186,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

First off, if you're expecting a CRPG in the vein of Baulder's Gate, Divinity, or Pillars of Eternity, this is [b]board game[/b] adaptation that is pretty truthful to the source material. If turn based combat with semi-randomized modifiers turns you off, this might not be the experience for you.

[h1]Review[/h1]

I had no idea how much this game would draw me in, and keep me there.

Gloomhaven seemed like one of those board games that came way after I'd have the free time to fully enjoy it, let alone find a committed friend group to enjoy it with. And for the longest time, it seemed like the harsh reality. The formula looked to be the perfect combination of games I already enjoy: MTG and Slay the Spire's card battling and customization, DnD and CRPG's fantastical setting, and even a dash of XCOM and similar strategy based games. While those are pretty decent comparisons, it undersells the intricate and unique systems that make Gloomhaven such a rewarding and fascinating experience, with so much content and replayability for the price. It also has the added benefit of solo play without needing to spend several minutes to an hour setting every piece up.

I'll admit, like most people who ventured into Gloomhaven's campaign without a whole lot of prior experience, it took me a few tries to make it past the first two missions. It is a LOT to take in for a first timer. Once you do figure out what the game and its systems are trying to teach you, it leaves you with a sense of satisfaction that few games can match. For those who want more of a guided experience, the Guildmaster mode does a fine job of acting as an extended tutorial. However, in terms of scenario design and narrative, it feels more like a free-form mode where the Campaign is a much more curated and optimized experience.

The game starts out relatively conventional as an RPG would. You've got your 6 'sort of' archetypal classes, most of which fit into a Tank, Damage or Support role where some manage to fill multiple roles depending on how you build them out. As you start to venture into the world and uncover more secrets, items, and classes, you have so many different combinations and synergies that keeps everything feeling fresh and unique.

But what elevates the game to the level of brilliant is how most scenarios are balanced. There are very few scenarios that feel like a walk in the park, and this could either inspire or frustrate you depending on your tolerance for failure. Classes and encounters are designed with a very low tolerance for wasting turns. Almost every single choice you make should increase your chances of success. You are rewarded for synergizing with your team, thinking a few turns ahead and situational awareness. While luck is still a factor in some regard (each character has an attack modifier deck with limited cards that only replenish on a 0X or 2X draw), as character improve and classes are unlocked, there is a far greater possibility of reducing poor draws by unlocking perks. You have the ability to unlock special status bonuses, reduce penalties and even do multiple 'draws' in a single action. There are also various spells and statuses that can negatively affect your enemies attack modifier deck.

I wish I could say more in this regard but if this already sounds like something you'd enjoy, stop reading and give the game a try. I mentioned solo play convenience being one of the better aspects of this game, but the unpredictability of friends in co-op improves the experience in so many ways. I could gush about the game and it's systems more but I don't want to get into spoiler territory and want to touch on some negatives.

While it is easy to see why Gloomhaven is considered to be one of the best 'Board Games' of all time, it is almost certainly not one of the best 'Video Games' of all time. When I say this, I mean this with the best of intentions as this is clearly some of the best work Twin Sails Interactive/Flaming Fowl Studios have put out so far.

Here is a short list of personal gripes that could improve over time or on next release:

[list]
[*]The music is functional. It's not bad, it's not particularly memorable, it's just very limited for such a long and expansive game. The ability for a 'radio player' similar to what Tabletop simulator has could improve this in some regard. I've found myself muting the in-game music in favor of something else.

[*]Some UI issues in regards to item displays and some abilities. Sometimes, you'll open a chest only to find out that you can't read the item you just looted because it's partially cut off. Another weird issue is sometimes abilities wont trigger if you consume an element after you've selected a target. You sometimes have to sequence abilities a certain way in order for them to trigger correctly

[*]While there is a 'restart round' feature, there isn't an 'undo move' action. Sometimes, you just want to fix the one mistake. What's worse, if the mistake is on the last person to go, you lose the 'restart round' feature unless you happen to catch the mistake before the next round begins. You also can't use this ability at all when it's the enemies turn. It's a little odd.

[*]Not sure why some enemies take so long to move and execute their attacks. Some of the flying enemies and demons can take up to 20 seconds to do their moves.

[*]There's a 'fast mode' tucked away in the options menu that increases the speed of animations / actions. Even with this on, sometimes enemies take far too long to do their sequences. Really wish same enemies moved simultaneously where a contextual window summarized what the group did to which member (and potential damage mitigation actions could be decided)

[*]Jaws of the Lion is incredible yet I heard it was inaccessible unless you beat the first two campaign missions? Seems like an odd choice to allow those who purchased the DLC to not have the ability to jump right in. Maybe adding the ability to skip the first two missions if the DLC is found?

[*]The Solo missions DLC are the exact opposite. They are actually pretty great for what they are (and the price is fair) but I don't know why enabling it forces all participants in a co-op save to purchase it if they want to access their content again. The solution seems relatively simple too: Enable Solo mission visibility for all members as if they have it purchased, but limit access to these missions unless a certain 'file' is found on a persons system proving they own it. If the fear is that people can abuse this system, it's far better to take the chance than ruin hours of someone's playthrough

[*]There are a few exceptionally hard missions in Scenario that were more obnoxious than genuinely challenging. They are still possible to win but tactics feel more like cheesing and exploiting rather than actually solving the scenario.
[/list]

I'm sure there are a few more small gripes but otherwise, this was my unexpected favorite game of the year and I expect to invest many more hours into the base game experience and any future DLC to come.

If there was a perfect board game to PC adaptation, this is it. Gloomhaven is one of those games that in the tabletop format costs a ton, takes hours to set up the million pieces, and then you're stuck weeks later trying to find another friend to fill in for the guy that left but nobody else knows what's going on. On PC, none of these are a problem anymore. When we decide to play a few missions, we're all booted up and ready to go in less then 2mins. We have 4 people that play in my group, with one guy cycling in and out occasionally as he is able. This version makes it super easy to drop people in/out on the fly, even in a mission where control of their character is just handed off to someone else. It's great, and no cleanup afterwards!

The game itself is fun, lots to see and do. Being able to change your build by swapping cards in and out of a deck between missions is great. The biggest positive going for it is that absolutely every turn is filled with choices that seem critical. There's almost never a boring option, and the way the cards are played keeps things flexible if something is about to go sideways.

Here is what I think about the digital version: I played it since its very early access. Back then we encountered bugs or glitches here and there and had a few connection issues on a regular basis. It's what one can expect from a game still in development. We had a lot of fun and they released new classes and content every few weeks / months.

After the early access phase ended and it was officially released, it got worse, strangely. We encountered some really annoying stuff I can't describe here because it would spoil a few things. Mixed with some inconsistency regarding the rules and save-game problems, it was game-breaking and we eventually quit Gloomhaven mid-campaign.

BUT: We had nearly 500h on the record and I played a lot of games for a lot less time, to be honest. It is still an absolutely great game; if they can address some of the issues I mentioned briefly, it's even better. You wouldn't even notice some of them if you haven't played Gloomhaven before.

Not defeat the enemy, not to discover treasure, not to find a cool storyline, but just to not have all my apparently narcoleptic characters, be exhausted!! Thought, ""Neat a non-D&D based CRPG with a new system, maybe like Elder Scrolls, Solasta, Fallout, etc""... argghh, that was true but in all the wrong ways...

After spending most of my time just going thru the first %$# scenario before realizing it's just another crappy puzzle game and not really an RPG, I then also realized that I seem to be stuck with these pre-genned characters, so no freedom to play with the races and classes a la most other RPGs... maybe if I spent another dozen frustrating hours you can do that but doesn't seem to be the case.

If only after my first play thru i had given up and got my money back, but thanks to all of those useless reviews that make it seem to be more then it was, I kept trying and read tutorials on how to play which just made me realize my mistake in buying this dud... if you do like CRPGs avoid this dud...

I love the board game and if you're looking for a computer version of it to avoid dealing with all the components, book-keeping and monster movement then this is the game for you.

As a computer strategy game in its own right, not so great.

It's slow and clunky, every turn required so many clicks. Imagine a simple turn where you play a Move 2, Push card. You click where you want to go, click confirm, click the monster you want to push, click confirm, click the hex you want to push him to, click confirm. 6 clicks for one action!
Even effects that have no valid targets or that you're always going to want to do (blessing yourself for example) require a click.
If you're being attacked every hit you take requires a click to decide if you want to take the damage, or lose a card. 
To make matters worse, each action is accompanied by an unskippable animation. This goes for monsters too. If there are 6 guards on the board shielding and strengthening, you have to watch 12 identical animations one after another.

All of this exists in the board game, but something that takes seconds of real world play, can take minutes of clicks, confirmations and animations. It's just doesn't translate that well and considering how many great strategy games there are out there I'm not sure why you'd choose to play this if you're not already a fan of the board game.",1667663476,1667663476,False,9,3,0.578589260578155518,0,True,False,False

- Cooperative multiplayer. Since the full version release, I haven't experienced a single disconnect.
- Unique and novel card mechanic (to my knowledge): Combining halfs from 2 different cards to a single action as well as burning cards to recover cards on your discard pile. (If you have played too many Slay the Spire clones and are searching for something new, which requires you to think differently, this game is exactly that.)
- Nice atmosphere and graphics.

Neutral:
- The game is complex and very difficult. The novel mechanics in this game require you to plan ahead. Managing intiative as well as trying to keep good remaining actions sides on your cards can be overwhelming at first, but also very rewarding if done right. (For me this is Pro)
- Some RNG, but you roll enough so you average out over a scenario. It can be annoying sometimes, but you can also get lucky and by leveling up you can reduce the impact of RNG. I usually don't like RNG, but cooperative/pve games need some RNG so they don't get too repetetive.

Negative: The UI, basically all these points are just about the UI...
- In this game every card has a upper and lower part and you have to play 2 cards in your turn, 1 upper and 1 lower half. Usually you plan ahead, which side you want to use, but the game does not support this in any way. This way it can often happen that you choose 2 cards, where you wanted to play upper or lower half on both cards. I think with a bit of highlighting, what you have planned to use, it would make the process of selecting the 2nd card much easier.
- You have to confirm every part of an action, which could actually just auto through. (e.g. a move 2 and shield yourself by 1, will require you to move, then press ""Confirm Movement"" then you have to press ""Confirm Action"" to gain the shield, which feels very unnecessary).

Tips:
- Burn cards are not worth it most of the time until your last rounds. Only play burn cards, if that helps you to avoid having to burn a card through damage. (Comparing to basic attack actions, a burn card would need to deal X damage, where X is the amount of cards in hand+discard to be worth it. But since you usually don't play basic actions the actual threshold, is probably more around X*1.5. To give you an example a character with 10 cards, should only do a burn action in the first round, if it deals 15+ damage.)
- Get healing potions.
- If possible let the last enemy live with like 1 hp while your characters loot everything.
- Wealth effects which items you can buy at the merchant and starting level for your characters. An easy way to get it up is by spending gold at the temple.
- In campaign mode: Always try to fulfill your personal quest for the scenario, because you get these perk points in addition to normal perk points.
- In guildmaster mode: Losing personal quests is actually more efficient, because gaining less XP means you can farm more gold per XP and enemies level with you.)

Since the game does not do it well, I will give you a short description of Guildmaster vs. Campaign:
- Campaign is a direct clone of the physical board game with the same mechanics. Guildmaster simplifies some of these.
- Guildmaster has some story, but it's mostly ""Jump in to kill monsters"" whereas the campaign puts meaning behind the encounters.
- In campaign characters you need to retire characters to gain access to new classes, in Guildmaster you unlock everything by just playing and never have a ""step back"". (Note: the campaign uses a wealth system to minimize the drawback from retiring characters, basically if you retire enough characters new characters will start at a higher level)

Conclusion:
If you like complex tactical games and have a friend to accompany you on the journey this game is probably for you. The UI can definitely be improved a lot, but it's not that bad, that it had an effect on my fun at the game.",1666130937,1667263322,True,26,0,0.724917948246002197,0,True,False,False

I was not going to get this digital version until I finished the paper copy, as a sort of reward for finishing it. I could not wait, and I am glad I did not. This is the best implementation of a board game I have ever seen, and the amazing part is that it is for one of my favorite board games of all time. What a gem.

The interface is as simple as it can be and works well. The only gripe is the rotating of multiple attack hexes. If I had not played the tutorial and known I had to hit ""R"" to rotate the hexes for multiple target attacks, I would have had no idea I could. I guess that is why it was covered in the tutorial!

The graphics are stunning. The detail and level of work that went into it are staggering. For instance, when a monster strengthens, the animation and type of movement they do to express this is unique to each monster. The hexes on the floor are thematically designed (bones in hex shapes in crypts, etc.).

The multiplayer is not only good, it is seamless and amazing. A friend can drop in and out to play with you just like the real paper game.

So you get all the original scenarios plus can play 100 more unique ones. It will take you 100-200 hours or more just to get through the basic core campaign.

This is a faithful reproduction of a very good board game. It is nice to not keep track of every number while playing but I cannot recommend the digital version in it's current form. There are a few mechanical bugs, but the main problem is a terrible UX that could be mitigated with multiple levels of undo to replace the overused confirm action button.

Did you accidentally use a card to move that you meant to use the top action on? Too bad, you're stuck with it.
Did you want to do nothing instead of use up a burn card? Better make sure to click the little default action icon instead of skipping your burn ability.

You can restart the round if you mess up badly, but if you are in multiplayer only the host can do that on their action. You either have to hope the mistake was before they acted or tediously wait for their turn to come up to restart the round.",1644256967,1666460272,True,0,0,0.556129395961761475,0,True,False,False

Pros:
No setup time 
Automatically does game upkeep
It's a pretty game
Round Undo button
Scenario creator

Cons:
Can be info overload on screen
Can't do house-rules stuff (although there is some available)
Each player must own the game and must also own any DLC the leader has effective in the campaign
The board game does have some stuff the video game can't recreate (nothing too big, but it's neat if you find it in the board game)

Seems so much crap burns cards left and right. Also... WHY do I have to use cards to move when nothing is around us... That should be free like normal but no.. You gotta use card which are your LIFE basically. Second attempt at this finally get to last room. Two characters instantly die due to... guess what... lack of cards because everything else is burned. 

So many things require you to burn the damn cards.
Short Rest - Burn a card
Long Rest - Burn a card
Use a strong ability on a card - Burn the card
Take tooooo much damage - Burn 1 card from available OR burn 2 from the discard!

So many damn burn requirements that basically make it impossible to go past turn 10 because you just die from lack of cards. Let alone I can't chose just to use 1 card... no I HAVE to select 2 cards to use and if I don't have 2 cards available guess what.... dead...

If I could return this game I would but the damn first dungeon and tutorial took up 2 hours so now I cant return the damn thing.

Oh PS. If you think mods will fix it think again, the developer wont let modders have the ability to modify base game mechanics because thats obviously a big no no.

I picked up normal difficulty and started with campaign - I had no worries since I'm a veteran with the genre. OH BOY, game chewed me up and beat me up senseless like a rented mule. I found myself coming back to this abusive partner over and over again, it was like I was enjoying the beating. I think in my 7th or 8th play through I figured out the gist of it and started beating the campaign - although I had to replay some of the campaigns several times. 

I hate that I love it. 

Here is small tips for people coming to digital for the first time:
1) Start on easy, you can change it up when you feel like it, easy means mobs will be 1 level lower than you. It's not really easy. 
2) Everything scales to your party. So there is a great difference when going in with 2 mercenaries or 4. I feel like 3 mercenaries is the right spot. Crag is hard carry. Crag+Brute+Scoundrel works like a charm and fun to play.
3) Buy defensive gear first.
4) Don't use the burn cards unless you are sure that you have enough turns/cards to last the fight.
5) Game gets easier as you progress (levels+items+enhancements etc). 
6) Dying is a part of the game. There are mechanics actually expecting to exhaust. As long as one of your party members survive, you are good.
7) Battle perks are really important Try to figure them out early in game and do your best to achieve those. 
8) Don't be an idiot like me, you don't have to start over the campaign because you lose the first couple of fights, when you press ESC there is an option to restart the round (you will fuck up picking up cards etc) and you can forfeit and that menu will have ""retry"" which lets you replay the whole scenario from the beginning. 

If you like the genre, once you get the hold of the card system and use enhancements to negate some of the bad RNG, you will love this one imo.",1665731765,1665731765,True,7,0,0.58379817008972168,0,True,False,False

 The campaign mode (Guildmaster mode) suffers from bad writing and a tutorial that drags on for too long (which can skipped, if desired). I found myself completely ignoring any flavor text the game threw at me because it felt painful to read.

É um jogo bem extenso e divertido de jogar com um grupo de amigos. Tem uma grande variedade de inimigos, diversas fases para explorar, e um total de 17 classes. Só agora, com 40 horas de jogo, que vamos começar a explorar a 6ª e 7ª classe.

É um jogo difícil. Morremos algumas vezes até decidirmos jogar na dificuldade ""Fácil"" e ainda assim de ""Fácil"" não teve nada por um bom tempo. Depois com mais itens, níveis, e maior conhecimento do jogo que a situação equilibrou.
Sugiro que pesquise um pouco sobre as classes e como funciona a IA do inimigo, isso dará um maior entendimento sobre o porque eles tomam determinadas ações e te permitirá escolher melhor as suas ações.

Divertido pra jogar em galera. Você até tem a opção de jogar sozinho controlando quantos personagens quiser, mas aí boa parte da graça é perdida porque o mais legal está na comunicação entre personagens pra gerar uma estratégia viável de acordo com os movimentos de cada um da equipe.

Como vídeo game está um tanto quanto mal otimizado. Espero que mais pra frente acrescentem algumas coisas que otimizem o jogo e permitam usufruir melhor de ser um vídeo game. Por exemplo: se você clicou errado, já era. Mesmo que ainda esteja no seu turno. Isso no jogo de tabuleiro não ocorreria. Nesse sentido um simples ""Desfazer"" enquanto ainda no seu turno seria muito bem vindo. Apesar disso é muito legal ter um modo pra aprender a mestrar, e um modo para construir seus próprios níveis.

I've played the physical boardgame and while it is reasonably fun in small doses and short campaigns, the full campaign is far too bloated, far too shallow and badly designed to keep going. What killed the game really was lack of anything interesting to do. RNG events are *extremely* common and do nothing but annoy the hell out of everyone most the time. Or just the devs telling you to eff off. The combat is....I would say at best OK. But often is either far too challenging or far too repetitive. You are actively punished for adding new cards to your deck which is just mindboggling to me and it has this weird conflict of trying to be a rogue-lite game while then actively punishing your party by throwing you into the deep end of the pool of enemies with lvl 1 characters. 

But really, the most active sin of this boardgame turned videogame is that the videogame aspect only highlights how incredibly poorly this stacks up to its peers. Poor performance, mind-numbing gameplay and more make it incredibly obvious how this should *not* have been ported to PC in this way. A lot of boardgame-to-videogame ports do the smart job of more or less replicating the physical experience in digital form. This one went out of its way to craft essentially a whole new videogame and then tried to *balance* it. Which, didn't work.

The card burn system serving as a soft time limit is obnoxious, and I don't see how the game (and its board game variant) are as popular as they are.

I know, part of it is ""git gud"", but I've lost several times with a single enemy remaining with 1HP for no apparent reason. I had cards left, but the game just... ended. The last remaining character died and it was not made clear why. Also the amount of enemies they expect you to be able to defeat just feels impossible, especially when you roll a -2 on the hit that would've made the difference between victory and defeat, and when you've finally cleared that second room half beat to death -- wait! There's a third room with five more enemies. Good luck with that. And this is on Easy difficulty.

I want to like it. I understand the combat. It just feels impossible to win, and spending 45 minutes in a dungeon to lose to the last enemy that has 1HP left because the game rolled badly on the hit and walk away with almost zero reward for the effort is just not my idea of an enjoyable way to spend my time. It's surely popular for a reason, but after failing to clear the 2nd quest (or ANY of the side quests) after many many attempts, I just can't get into it.

One of the moves that knocks enemies into obstacles works fine and one of them just doesn't, for no reason. The movement animations go completely weird, for no reason.
The thing is though, it lets you play Gloomhaven whenever you like without having to corral some friends into it with no set-up or tear down and even with all the issues I've clocked 140 hours on it, so it can't have annoyed me too much.

When this online version was first released with early access, it was not like the boardgame, and it was definitely a work in progress.  Now, it is very similar to the boardgame, and while it has its positives, there is one massive issue, and that is the RNG.  

When pulling combat modifier cards, you start with six +0, five +1, five -1, one +2, one -2, one 2x, and one Null, thus twenty cards total.  So the odds of pulling one of these cards (initially and after a reshuffle) are as follows; 30% +0, 25% +1, 25% -1, and 5% each for the +2/-2/2x/Null.  But, over the course of twenty battles in a couple recent games I played, this is what I pulled: -2/Null 60%, -1 25%, +0 10%, +1 5%, and +2/2x 0%.  

I understand how RNG works.  Yes, this could have been a fluke, and yes I will continue to collect stats.  But 12 out of 20 pulls with a 5% chance of pulling the -2 or Null card?  The odds of that occurring are astronomically low.  

I don't need an easy mode or an ""I win"" button, but I need to enjoy the game.  But when I'm taking my time, planning my attacks, and the entire round is zeroed out repeatedly, its just not fun.",1664582690,1664582690,False,3,0,0.500657856464385986,0,True,False,False

- Gameplay: This is why you play. Up to 4 playable mercenaries cooperate in a hexagon-based combat system. Just watch a video or something, it's hard to explain. It's so good. 

- Story: Very good, and not intrusive. Able to be enjoyed at each player's own pace.

Pros:
*well made campaign/story mode
*side quests actual have meaning to the story/ don't feel like some inane fetch quest
*narration is quite good with a skilled Voice Actor
*Over world art is also well done.
*still hold the spirit of playing the IRL board game (if that's your kind of thing), combat in particular.
*great for anyone looking for a serious strategy game.

Con:
*damn hard starting out (I've been playing on easy aka lvl 2 of 6 difficulties) and it's still a close call by the end of most missions
*takes serious planning and/or luck (especially on harder difficulties) to beat mosty missions. though this maybe a pro for some, it wasn't what I was expecting going in.
*not all characters mesh well together nor is it clear from the get-go which do/don't (had to look that up online and I recommend you do the same)

Second through fourth I also died from exhaustion but those times I didn't waste any cards and minimized burning cards to mitigate damage.

There are many things that the digital version obviously does much better than the tabletop version, but above all else it removes all the bookkeeping/management overhead and setup that makes the tabletop version so cumbersome. On the whole I think it's pretty unambiguous that the digital version is a big improvement if you already liked the tabletop version.

The port is not completely perfect, and honestly can be frustrating when trying to figure out something that would easily be possible on tabletop. For example, attack decks for players and monsters get re-shuffled from time to time, but it won't tell you when, which can be super frustrating when you've already pulled your x0 and pull another one. There also isn't great communication about which effects are being evaluated and how all the time (e.g. a door closed on a teammate, and neither the damage nor push were in the combat log. Because doors don't graphically render once opened, we had NO IDEA what was happening).

Each class is so unique that this game has a high level of replayability and even within each class you can vary gear, cards, and perks.  Will be playing this one a lot.

Pros:
-No setup like boardgame
-Much lower cost than the boardgame
-Although also considered a con, each class has a learning curve, but they're unique
-Leveling seems balanced
-Multiplayer is a great experience
-Solo is awesome and enjoyable
-Unlock new classes as you explore, which is awesome
-Hand management is unique and mostly enjoyable
-Game has insane difficulty modes I can't imagine being able to play. Best on Normal/Easy in the beginning. Happy to have the option!

Cons:
-Gold pickup is frustratingly difficult. If you have cards left after you clear a room, you should be able to keep looting until exhausted.
-Although also considered a pro, each class has a learning curve
-Actions can be frustrating when you just want to take one step and can't, or you have one card left in your hand and instead of just being able to use it, you are exhausted instead (each round requires 2 cards).
-Not all classes are playable at first
-Attack card modifiers can be frustrating when you get a -1, -2, or X
-Most frustrating is the random encounters to your next quest - these feel like they're designed to screw you regardless of the decision made, hurting your chances for success in a 30 minute dungeon crawl.  Starting with low health, a wound, whatever... it is pretty harsh.

The early game is just bad. The game throws way too many concepts at you at once and actually expects you to know them all immediately, with all their synergies. I'm not kidding, there is no ramp in complexity, it just makes you fail the first mission repeatedly. And the ones after that, too. The game makes you go on the first quest with just two mercs, and doesn't tell you your free to have more. Even worse, the game is supposed to balance for different party sizes, but the difficulty varies wildly. You're just expected to trial and error your way through the introduction, when each try takes one or two hours. Often, your early decisions fail the mission, but as a new player you won't notice until the end.

I've played for almost 6 hours, managed to beat the first mission with internet advice, and the second mission is again so much harder that I feel zero motivation to try again. I've played challenging games in all kinds of genres, but never anything that felt so demotivating.

Pros

-Saves you hours of setup/cleanup -Helps you remember rules which you may have forgotten
-You can play on the go
-You can play with friends all around the world
-Decent graphics
-Faithful remake / port
-Adds Modding, scenario creation and a new guild master mode
-Adds a tutorial for beginners

Cons

-Multiplayer sometimes disconnects at random times which can be annoying
-Quite unforgiving, if you misclick something you’re stuck with it. (This is not really a con, more just an observation)

 * I think its a tough thing to get perfect but the UX is not always clear. Sometimes it looks like you are making the right selection and it ended up not being correct, and your whole turn is borked because of it.

I only played this for 1 hour, which I believe was enough to grasp the core of how the game works, so I'll try to make this short:

First of all, Gloomhaven is not extraordinarily complicated (per se) as most people claim. After half an hour or so of tutorial, you get it. The problem is the combat (which, as far as I can tell, is 100% of the game) is actually confusing. Also, it's card-based, which I wasn't aware and, by now, am pretty sick of.

OK, so, basically, each of your characters has its own deck of cards. When your turn starts, you select either the [i]top or bottom half[/i] of one of those cards, and the opposite half of a second one. That's what the character is going to do in that turn -- two actions, including movement.

That sucks, because it's very limited. Also, you need to open doors to access different rooms and, whenever you do, you have no idea what lies behind them -- so the cards you selected for that turn may be totally [i]not[/i] what you want to deal with what now lies ahead of you.

Whenever you play a card, it gets discarded. Or banished and unrecoverable. To recover the discarded ones, you need to Rest -- by banishing one of them! Or Long Rest, which I think also wastes a card somehow.

The ""cards' half"" thing, coupled with movement mixed in together with attacks, melee and ranged ones, jump, traps, initiative, not knowing what lies behind doors, cards being discarded/banished, rests, plus the fact that you also have to account for ending your turn over gold drops to pick them up (or even use actual [i]actions[/i] to that end alone!), makes up for a very confusing experience. I can do the thinking, but the way things are done here is just... not fun. You get more of a feeling of ""playing a convoluted chess match"" than ""getting stronger and fighting enemies.""

I didn't like how the game handles items, either. Equipping one means that, in certain specific circumstances, you get some extra movement, 1 shield, heal a little bit, or whatever. They don't seem to give permanent status to your characters -- you have to [i]use[/i] them, when the opportunity arises. Which, of course, also means you have to consider that as well with every move you make.

Given that Gloomhaven seems to consist simply in going from one mission, with a few, small rooms, to the next, nearly identical to it, it all just feels like you are wasting a lot of time and mental energy for nothing.

Simply put, not a [i]fun[/i] game, in my opinion. If turn-based-combat is your thing, there are many [i]much[/i] better options out there.",1661941432,1661941686,False,1,1,0.379605233669281006,4,True,False,False

But from someone who did not play the board game this game is very frustrating as many of the mechanics simply don't make sense.  For example; if I don't want one of my characters to take any actions this turn I simply don't have that option and I MUST use some of my valuable cards to then sit there and hit take no action, but the cards are still used.  Secondly, even on the Easy setting you get your butt handed to you the very first encounter.  Tried it twice and both times all my characters were almost out of action cards after the first of 3 encounters.  By the time I got into the final room, all characters were exhausted and I failed the mission.  This could possibly be because the game makes no sense to me and the mechanics of it are just goofy.

They did a phenomenal job ""porting"" to digital. It's exactly the same game (if you want it to be) just with about 1000% less set up and rulebook checking time. There are also digital only features that can tweak aspects of the game if you're feeling wily and wanna experiment.

The narration is awesome, the character and baddie models and animations are great, the environments are beautiful, the effect visuals are awesome...basically there's nothing not to love about this game. And it's cross-platform! The only bad thing I can say is it is ever so *slighty* buggy, but it's totally playable. The game may hang on certain maps and you might have to restart a session once in a while, but it saves progress at the beginning of each round so you never really lose that much in the off chance you restart.

If you've never played the TTRPG but love strategy/tactic RPGs, this is a must have. The campaign will probably take you 200+ hours to complete and there's DLC so it'll keep you going for a while. Each character ""class"" is well balanced and unique, the monster scaling is kinda genius, and while the map setups can feel a bit formulaic after several battles, there's enough differentiation in goals and enemy mixes and story that it never feels old.

While it's definitely fun to play solo, doing a campaign with friends is perfect as a break from weekly D&D or just a good excuse to get a crew together.

However, I have become (more than) slightly addicted to it now that I have figured out all the game rules. See below for some important non-spoiler hints that will make it MUCH easier on you. 
Somehow, either due to myself or at least partially the complexity of the game, I did not understand these rules and quirks of the game and that made playing it a painful chore at first. The only reason I kept going was because I had bought the actual $110 board game itself, and after playing it once with two friends where none of us had ever played it and I had only a cursory reading of the rules, they disliked the rigmarole that I had not grasped yet and we never played again. I bought this game on Steam to try and get the rules down, and I am now super-glad I did. I can’t wait to find another set of players to try the physical board game (I’ve moved since then—the PC game had not been created/released at the time either.)
1. Be sure to both play the Tutorial and be ready to look up all of the Icons on the cards and powers available. 
2. The SINGLE most important thing is to watch out for cards you have to ""Burn"" to play (the Icon is pictured in the lower right that is a hand that appears to be aflame, sort of), as there is a ""hidden"" timer in the game. That is, once you do not have two cards to chose from, then your mercenary becomes ""Exhausted"" and cannot continue. This by itself made me hate the first couple of times I played as I believed that you went through the cards so fast there was no way to win a battle. The game really came together once I figured that many of the best abilities requires Burning, making the cards no longer available (though there are ways and certain mercenary cards that can help in this, but not really early in the game so much) and exhausting the characters very early in the scenario. So, tldr: use the cards wisely, not wasting them on early Burns (even to negate damage taken0)!
3. Realize that there are default actions on the cards as well. By clicking on the little icons in the center of each card, you can always ""Attack 2"" with the top half and ""Move 2"" with the bottom half. In fact, you should sort of assume these abilities first and have the actual abilities planned to work if they are more beneficial and not wasteful, especially at the early parts of a scenario.
4. Importantly, there is no penalty for failing (being Defeated) or abandoning a quests. You even keep the gold, XP, and some of the stats if a character is exhausted or the scenario ends before completion. So, if you do fail, you usually come back stronger. Embrace that early.
5. My biggest negatives are: 
First, having to move the party to the next room after all enemies of the current room are defeated is a pain in the arse--I would like it better if when you are out of combat you could at least move to the next doorway.
Also, it is frustrating when your mercenaries have to just stand and do nothing (often not even a move) when planning a whole series of (especially melee) attacks, moves, and clever combinations. This occurs most often after any mercenary who attacks second (or third, or fourth) has nothing to do if you defeat an enemy earlier in the turn. As a D&D and other pencil and paper player of long years, the game limits creative things you can manage to do even if your best laid plans are thwarted.

Like, if you are a hardcore fan of the board game then you will enjoy it (and i tip my hat in your direction).

And you realize that you cannot return in, per Steam policy...  And you are out $35.  Uh ho.

So, what to do???  Well, cheat.  Yes, that's right--even just a few additional perk points or movement steps can make a HUGE difference in enjoyment of the game.  If you can hang w original version then good for you otherwise... (*cough* check out Wemod *cough*)

***
Initial (previous) thoughts below...

Learning-on-the-go is *not* a good option...  If you run out of cards (which is relatively easy) then you lose.  Do not pass go, go back to the start.  

A few ideas:
1)  There should be some sort of learning / suggestion option that suggests moves for people who want to learn to play.  e.g.:  Suggesting cards that one could play or that synergize well together.  SOMETHING to allow people to learn before they just start losing nonstop.
2)  There should be an option to look at ALL of your cards at the same time.  Hovering back and forth among different cards to decide which to choose is slow.
3)  Tutorials take forever (well over an hour) and are easy to lose.  And it's the TUTORIAL.
4)  Just really, really easy to lose.  Even on the lowest / easiest difficulty.
5)  Did I mention it's easy to lose?  It is that unforgiving.  

Conclusion:  IF you have an advanced degree in ""Gloomhaven"" and you are ALREADY an expert, then this game may be for you.  Otherwise, I would recommend other board games over this one.  It was designed with love, but it just demands too much to advance and the learning curve with a goal of ""just don't lose and start over"" which is unfortunately too steep to be fun.  And repeatedly losing early levels is like NO FUN.

The multiplayer is a bit screwy and occasionally missions will bug out. Some missions are just way harder than others.

But the tactical depth is just so good. You have to pick two cards to play each turn and you can't pick them again until you've run out. Each card has a move, an attack and an initiative value so planning what to do and when to do it is just ridiculously rich in tactics.

The one caveat: Gloomhaven is a ""learn by failing"" game. Similar to Souls games, Gloomhaven expects you to attempt, fail, adjust, and attempt again, which is fun once you know the tactic but quite frustrating when you're 90 minutes into a scenario and realize what you should have been doing instead -- and now need to start over. With scenarios taking 1-2 hours each, ""learn by failing"" really inflates how much time you'll spend playing.

Fortunately, Gloomhaven has several difficulty settings that you can freely change -- and I highly recommend using these as learning dials. Once you're comfortable, perhaps increase the dial to a harder difficulty.",1660315374,1660315374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having purchased this game previous to official release, and playing ever since, my board game group has transitioned over to this format during COVID times as well as to avoid having to drive long distances (or travel by air in a few cases).  As an adaptation of the board game, outside of a few bugs, is a nearly perfect representation.  

The game itself, #1 on BoardGameGeek as of time of this writing, is also one of the most brutally difficult euro-style dungeon crawler games on the market.  If you play on regular difficulty, let alone easy with newer players, you will sustain defeat if you do not play smartly.  There is also a tendency in this digital adaption for alpha player syndrome, as your cards are visible to everyone (including what is left in your attack modifier deck).  As a video gamer, you should not expect fast moving live action or turn-based roleplaying.  If that is your expectation, I would steer clear of this game for that reason.  

Summary:  My board game group has transitioned to this version of Gloomhaven and have enjoyed it.  There are a few bugs, no ability to take back moves if you make a mistake of your interpretation of a turn, and there is no online chatroom.  The latter can be overcome with video chat or multi-way phone conversation, though Steam is a platform that does support it.

As others have written, this game has a really steep learning curve and it is very challenging. I knew this going in so I played all the tutorials and also spent hours reading the very extensive manual for the physical version. It was still confusing to play but I gradually learned at least the basics.

What no amount of preparation could prepare me for is the incredibly steep learning curve. I don't mind a challenge but this game is over the top difficult. And when I finally start to make some progress the game throws me some absurdly difficult scenarios. 

For a game where grinding is pretty much pointless, the difficulty balancing is very poor. Grinding is pointless because as you increase in level the scenarios scale to become more challenging. You get very few rewards for completing a scenario - a tiny amount of money and maybe an item that you still have to buy (you only get the ability to make a tiny number of each item).

You do have the ability to upgrade your card abilities, but the cost of absurd. This may be the single worst design decision in this game. After playing 30-40 hours I have around 500 gold. This will allow me to upgrade perhaps 3 cards with a very minor upgrade. The better upgrades can cost upwards of 300 gold so you won't be using this feature very much. Worse, it seems that in the Guildmaster mode you can't sell these card upgrades, even at a loss. Apparently there is a way to sell the upgrades at 75% of cost, but this may only be in the Campaign (I'm playing in Guildmaster). I wouldn't know, the game leaves a lot unexplained and there is only one save so you can't learn by doing.

The game is so hostile to beginners I'm surprised it is so highly rated. I will say that when you play a scenario that offers a reasonable challenge (reasonable here still means tough, I sometimes win with only one character who is not exhausted), the game can be really fun. When get get a few of these well balanced scenarios in a row I start to think I've finally caught on to the game. Then I struggle to find another scenario of the many available that I stand the slightest chance at and go back to disliking the game and wanting to stop playing.",1655594900,1659998264,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are however, some very serious issues i feel need to be addressed, as it hurts my recommendation for picking up this title to an otherwise solid game.

Just so i am not mixing things up for people trying to decide on if this is a worthy purchase or not, i have a board game specific section that just briefly explains the game and what to expect, and a video game specific section to mention my thoughts on this adaptation.

[b]-BOARD GAME SPECIFIC- [/b]
To those that have never played Gloomhaven before, i suppose the most basic way i could summarise what to expect from this type of game is fantasy XCOM style combat with dungeon crawler elements.

There is an overarching story in the game, that open ups as you play through the game via scenario's or 'missions' if again you want to compare it to a game like XCOM.  There are at times multiple routes you can take for a quest line, which does impact future scenarios, rewards,  and potential conclusion for that quest line.

As this is based on the board game however, there are certain caveats to traditional video games.  you can choose to play out scenarios you previously completed  multiple times for the sake of farming for gold, xp, and other things.

Your roster of characters in this game that you use to undertake this game start off with 6 different characters and eventually, you can unlock more characters through meeting certain conditions in the game.  While a number of these characters are suitable to a certain class you would expect in a traditional RPG (Tank,support,dps, etc), in my experience each character is a different experience and unique.

This game is [u]BRUTALLY[/u] challenging with its combat, especially if you choose to play at higher level difficulties.  it is not uncommon for your first scenario to result in a failure, and does require alot of careful planning and strategy to succeed.  As a note, the game does actually get easier as you progress through the campaign, as your characters level up and get access to better abilities and gear.

Gloomhaven at its heart is meant to be played cooperatively, with up to 4 players, and the game does scale depending on the number of players or characters in play.  the game however does support drop in drop out between scenarios, so you arent necessarily locked out of playing if someone misses boardgame night.  You can also play this solo, but be ready for some mad analysis paralysis as your controlling 4 very different characters at once.

there is ALOT of content in this game.  You can at minimum expect to play for hundreds of hours, you definitely get your monies worth.


[b]-VIDEO GAME SPECIFIC-[/b]
The convenience of no longer needing to setup the board for every scenario is a massive time saver.  In the normal time it would take to setup, and play out a scenario in tabletop, you could play out at least two in the digital format.  it may be a very obvious thing to say, but if you have played the physical board game...you KNOW how big of a deal this point is worth mentioning.

Graphically this game does a pretty good job with its overall aesthetic, its not graphics that will blow your mind, but it does the job.  I have experienced no performance issues either, which, despite having a RTX 3090, is a rare thing for me to say these days with how poorly optimised games are being released.

You can dynamically make your campaign solo and coop enabled at the click of a button, including mid way into a scenario, which is excellent.  you don't have to start afresh, people can literally just be invited into your game and be assigned a character and play.  If they have to leave mid way and fine with you playing on, you simply take control of that character again, or make them 'inactive' and just play with the characters you were using before they joined.

There are extra scenarios outside of the main campaign the devs used to my understanding for play testing purposes that can be played separately from the main story. something around nearly a hundred extra scenarios outside the main gloomhaven game.  that is a definite plus!

The UI...at times is very unclear, and will catch you off guard on a number of occasions.  case examples being when you are trying to select multiple targets with an attack.  there are a large number cases where my cragheart's backup ammunition goes unused because the UI doesn't give me a clear indication if the multi target feature is even active.

Some abilities (such as mind thief phantasmal killer) give you the indication is can be used, when its pre-requisite's are not met...meaning you end up wasting your attack, when the game should just be hard coded (like every other turn based combat game) to not allow me to even select the option.

There is no undo button in this game, which is fine, but if there's no undo button, I damn well better expect the UI to not permit me to waste an action entirely, or not have a consistent indication that i can activate an extra ability from an active card.

The music.  Its fine, however, when you pass 20 hours of hearing the same 3 or so tracks, you will rapidly just consider muting the music and opening up a music playlist instead.  Other than dedicating resources to making a full blown multi hour OST, I don't imagine much can be done for this 

A game with so much going on i can understand there being a number of bugs, XCOM 2 for instance is still full of them so long after its release.  Still however, there are way too many bugs that happen in multiplayer that i can't really ignore anymore.  Desync happens often enough to the point it ruins the mood.

one player will see a coin on the ground that the host says doesnt exist, or a player cant see an obstacle, which the host can see, and then alot of things get messed up as a result when that player moves into the 'illegal' hex space.

Frequent disconnects, with no logical reason as to why, can just happen.  mid scenario, just in the lobby, it doesn't matter.  A player will just abruptly be disconnected, sometimes not for hours, other times within minutes.  Sometimes they can rejoin, other times the host has to restart their game to resolve.  In a game that is so heavily built around the multiplayer, this, to put it bluntly, is [b]UNACCEPTABLE[/b] that these issues still exist.

The devs acknowledge that these issues exist, and are working on it, yet, the fact it still exists for so long makes it really hard to recommend it to someone intending to play this for online coop.

Mind you, my group of friends put up with it because we enjoy Gloomhaven that much.

[b]-My Verdict-[/b]

If you are a die hard fan of Gloomhaven, you probably already own this game.

if you are playing solo, I can recommend, but with warnings of not very intuitive UI at times that will catch you at the start.

Multiplayer, i really want to recommend, because when it works its awesome!  the desync and random disconnect issues however, really make me struggle to recommend it.  if the issues with multiplayer get fully addressed, i will change my rating in a heartbeat",1659744347,1659744664,False,182,5,0.854181826114654541,0,True,False,False

I get that it's a battle of attrition, but when the fights require a certain number of cards to win, it's pretty easy to do the math to figure out when you will be down to having none left to reshuffle.    Keep working on it.  I'll try again later, but if the math doesn't work out, I won't stick around. As of right now it's a waste of 25 bucks.

I must be a sucker for punishment as I keep trying to play the campaign and simply find it too difficult for it to be enjoyable.

I'm finding myself taking such huge amounts of damage that characters are exhausting on turn 2 or 3 when I need them to last 10.  And money is so scarce that the thought of donating funds tot he Oak is not much more than that -- a thought.  A final thought:  replaying a mission after failing it several times DOES NOT get progressively more difficult in the board game like it does here. Not fun.  Sorry.

Gameplay is smooth, although it is surprisingly calculation intensive during certain scenarios with a lot going on.  Admittedly my laptop is near the minimum playable specs, so I don't think I can fault the game.

Gloomhaven is not a turn-based game or a strategy. No. It’s a set of tactical puzzles that involve mind-numbing repetition to the point that by the third attempt – and mind you one attempt costs you almost 2 hours -- they will feel extremely stale. 

The large number of attempts is explained by the padding layered upon the encounters. Being nearly impossible to complete, they require you to hoard gold, buy items and potions, and rinse and repeat. The catch is you have to try the puzzle first knowing you must inadvertently fail, plus there's no efficient way of collecting all gold, and you have events on the road that set you up negatively prior to quests. I have difficulty understanding why this design could be considered fun, because it’s just a mindless time sinker.

But how can a strategy game be mindless? Look at this scenario. You have six bandits in the first room, and you have three characters, so you choose between one best possible movement set. That’s it – that’s your opening move. Once you go over your cards, you can clearly see just one strongest move. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that all characters cards are essentially attack/move cards, and the differences between each classes are the bonus effects written on cards. Unfortunately, it’s a part of Gloomhaven’s design – the trade-off between you move or you do. It creates very noticeable shallowness. 

Ultimate question is can this game be fun? Yes if you have friends and too much time. Yes if you don’t mind the yawn-infested “puzzles”. Yes if you have nothing better to do. It’s up to you what you want to do with your time, and if you ask me this game is not worth it.",1658746798,1658748127,False,5,0,0.491216987371444702,13,True,False,False

I had been very interested in playing the physical game, but the shelf space, needing a consistent game group, set-up time, and fiddliness of handling monster movement have all kept me from buying it. In the digital version, there is no set-up, no managing monster turns, and everything just flows. I've played a few physical rounds of Jaws of the Lion, and  it so nice here to not have to keep track of tokens, and which monster is moving where, and remembering all the different modifiers currently in play. 

The sheer amount of content makes this worth the price tag.  I've played 76 hours and I haven't even started the main campaign yet.

My biggest complaint with the game is the graphics and performance. For a game with so little movement, it's crazy that it requires 16GB of RAM to play. Even with that amount of RAM, with shadows turned off, and textures simplified, it still runs choppy and clunky.

In terms of the actual game itself, I give it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because sometimes it's just a bit tedious waiting through nine enemies' turns and spending an hour or so on a single campaign - but that's my only complaint. 

The 3/5 comes from how slowly the game can run sometimes. Both the characters and the mouse input lag at times. And its really inconsistent.

Solo...is garbage. You will start to notice every bug and due to the way the game works those bugs are game breaking.

I am more than capable of understanding the rules and mechanics and while sometimes it can be user error I am most positive this game has some nasty hidden bugs. Which in games like this it always makes me wonder...what else is f*cked and we just didn't notice.

Gloomhaven is a tabletop, dungeon delving, turn based, card based, hex grid based roguelite.
The aesthetics look great, The overworld map is nice and random encounters give you new stuff to do.

BUT- 
I feel a MAJOR con lurking.
 
Which is the ""card based"" aspect of the game. And not it having cards, but how the cards ""rotate/recycle/revolve"" in each mercenary's hand, and discard/burn piles.
 
Also, each card (you get 2 cards per character every turn) has 2 usage aspects to it, top and bottom. 
If you use top on 1 card, you can only use the bottom on the 2nd card. Or you can resort to using 2 dmg atk or 2 move (only 1 per card) as basic ability on every card..

Normally, when you use a card's skill, or basic ability, it goes into your ""discard"" pile, which can be recovered by doing a ""rest"" (long or short, slight differences), BUT even selecting rest will ""burn"" one of your other cards, which becomes pretty much useless for the remaining mission (scenario), except few options to recover them by burning other cards.

But most good abilities will ""burn"" the card.

So - Each card has 2 skills, if you use top skill on 1 card, 2nd card must be bottom skill (or basic skill - 2atk or 2 move), most good skills will burn the card rather than just discard it. And you almost certainly won't have that to use again, while your already tiny deck (8/9-13ish cards on start, varying by characters), because resting only recovers discarded cards.

This feels extremely restrictive, a really bizarre system of managing cards, the variability of outcomes and play styles is such that only a few approaches will really work and you have no other choice, eventually just by resting, and trying to recover discarded cards, you'll have burned your whole deck if you don't play in a very limited style. The burning of cards becomes like a ticking timer time bomb! (and less than 2 available cards means your character AUTOMATICALLY DIES, for the mission duration)

Because the game is made winnable for sure, just without many ways to do so. I feel extremely compelled to refund the game, but I want to support the devs and I've already spent 7 hours in it.. so I'm going to try again a few times and see if I can get past this system.

Overall, it's a digital Gloomhaven is great as a standalone game and is worth a play even without prior Gloomhaven knowledge.

REVIEW
The digital version of GH has come a decent way since the initial beta. The studio does a good job of addressing issues and fixing bugs as it adds to the game.

There are still a few minor annoyances/issues, such as not having the option to skip enemy animations and goals showing in multiplayer parties.

Price aside, the digital port does a pretty decent job of bringing over the board game without all the setup and hassle. The Guildmaster mode is also a good option for those who are soloing and don't want to play the set campaign but instead want a more traditional tactical rpg party playthrough experience. There are some options for adjusting rules, but options may not cover all house rules.

However, my biggest issue is that at it's current full list of $35 USD, I can only recommend this to either the Gloomhaven faithfuls who want to play with friends digitally or the tactical RPG enthusiasts.

Although I have enjoyed the game, I have gotten full value from this game, I recognize this price point is not for everyone.
It's worth picking-up on sale for those who are curious, but current price is too rich for my taste to make a blanket recommendation to all.",1657140704,1657140704,True,11,0,0.633266568183898926,0,True,False,False

- The biggest reason... it's an absolute SLOG to play. There is NO animation skip and somehow the AI is coded so poorly that, even though they should have very simple directives to their turns, they take forever to figure out what they're going to do. What should be a quick 10 minute battle takes probably 40-50. I'm not even kidding. A majority of your time is spent watching this. It's cool once or twice, but no animation skip is just so asinine that I cannot recommend this game.

- The game is hard. Even on very easy, occasionally we still have lost a scenario. But that's not a huge deal. We win a vast majority of the time. It's just difficult even on the easier difficulties. Part of the issue is that it does not play 100% like the board game, though. Some things are much harder or just different. The problem is that, when it's combined with the above point, it makes the game MUCH more frustrating to play. Not only did you screw up, time to spend a long time watching it unfold. Every. Single. Time.

I just can't really recommend this in its current state because I feel like probably a vast majority of my hours have been wasted watching animations that I've seen a million times, or watching AI try to figure something out--that should take them <1 second for any sanely coded algorithm--for like 5-10 seconds (per AI).",1657063274,1657063486,False,1,1,0.510107040405273438,9,True,False,False

The extra content (not included in the board game) is a fun intro to the game.

UPDATE 2:
11 hours in, I'm really enjoying the game.  I can't imagine some of the more difficult levels, but I'm enjoying it quite a lot even at my proficiency level.  There is a lot of tension as the turns go by and cards get burned, and it starts to look bleak whether there will even be enough to complete a mission.  It's very satisfying pulling it off with very little margin for error by the end, and even some people in the party having been exhausted before reaching the end.

The game definitely encourages min-max thinking - where ""this will work"" is never good enough - you really have to strain to try to think of better solutions than the first idea that comes up.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I'm at the 120 minute mark, which is my ""should I refund this game"" moment of truth.  As such, I have only scratched the surface of this massive game.  So feel free to take this review with a grain of salt.  Or even flame me in the comments - I'll happily ignore them.

So what is Gloomhaven?  Well... it's a meticulously designed duplication of the board game Gloomhaven!  How's that for telling you something, but nothing at all?

Well... let me try again.  ""What is Gloomhaven?""  Gloomhaven is a DnD-like Turn-based RPG videogame - but if you've played Dungeons and Dragons or any other RPGs, something will stand out - already in the tutorial (which I have not even finished yet).

Gloomhaven is crunchy.  The tutorial is brutal.  I found myself having to replay the tutorials several times because I kept losing to them.  Yes there's a solution - you know there's a solution because it's the freaking tutorial - and yet they made it in such a way that there is only _one_ solution, and many ways to get it wrong.  And by doing this, they force the player to learn the very *subtle* and deep intricacies of the user interface.

The good news is that the board-game campaign has some easier modes so you aren't forced to just play on the normal (or harder) difficulties.

You start a turn - presumably when you've already gone into a dungeon's first room and there might be enemies around - you'll start that turn by choosing 2 cards, which will determine your initiative (what order you get to play versus the enemies), and for each of these cards there are 2 actions (well really for each action there is also a default action which can be used by burning the card, so really there might be a total of 3 or 4 actions, rather than just 2).  Cards can be burned to prevent damage, so if you're about to die, you may need to burn a card instead.  After all the players and enemies have chosen their cards, they can play their actions in order of initiative, and once all the actions have been played (i.e. the turn has ended) you can either take a short rest (which discards a card) or you can take a long rest (which will probably get you killed if there are still enemies around) or just go straight into the next turn.

To further complicate things, you might have equipment that also allows special moves in addition to the actions you select from the cards.  And even more complication: all the actions are either ""top"" or ""bottom"" as they appear on the card, and choosing a top action on one card means the top action on the other card is disabled, and vice versa for bottom.

There's more too, like multipliers to attacks, etc.  Again - I haven't even finished the tutorial!  So these are just the basics of fighting.

Beyond that, there are cities I expect to be able to level up (as that is part of the board game), and they grant access to various equipment.  There are 100 (or is it 99?) quests as per the board game, but also an additional 100 quests that are exclusive to the videogame.  At my rate of progress, I imagine each quest will take at LEAST an hour, and probably several hours, so there is a lot of content here.

So yeah - I think this is a keeper.  Feel free to invite me to any multiplayer-with-voice games you have.",1656698465,1656907587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I admit though that ""Restart round"" is an essential tool in my tool kit :P There were mission as well where I really just ended up with one mercenary and one card remaining. But I like how tweaking one's tactic just by starting later or using slightly different cards or turn order can lead to a totally different outcome. And as I said before: ""Restart round"" can help wonders, although - admittetly - it feels a bit like cheating then knowing what the enemy will do next. Restart Round won't help to get better dice rolls though, so it is not that strong of a cheat :)

Regarding the unlockable characters I have to say that there are some really big differences imo - in terms of strength and play style. The different play styles are really intriguing and cool to foddle around. 

But the different types of ""strengths"" is sometimes a bit irritating and frustrating. Some are useless in small groups, others are useless in big groups. That is also the intention of the developers if I understand correctly (as it is your choice if you play with 2 mercenaries or 3 or 4, as the difficulty will scale depending on the number of party members). Nevertheless, I feel some mercenaries are really underwhelming with regards to their ""intended"" niche. 

There are e.g. some mercenaries who have less cards available per mission than other mercenaries meaning they have less rounds per mission before becoming exhausted (meaning ""K.O.""). In my opinion they should deal so much more damage than other mercenaries to make up for that. But especially the Nightshroud is totally underwhelming in this regard. Sure he can kill normal foes instantly once per refreshed card deck. But so can supporter mercenaries like Sawbones who have additionally more support cards and total cards whereas Nightshroud does not. And the normal damage cards from Nightshroud are .... well ... just normal. Not making up for the lack of total cards. The mercenaries with lesser total cards also feel like you won't see the end of the mission and you cannot use any ""burn cards"" because otherwise they die even more prematurely. 

But maybe I also do not play those mercenaries correctly.

But beside those ""few total cards"" mercs there are plenty of different mercs to try out and have fun with, so I recommedn the game for anyone who likes a challenging difficulty and turn based RPGs.

I thought that was because of all the fiddly parts and setup, but playing the digital version I realized that I really dislike the way the mechanics feel. Being forced to plan your next move before the round starts just feels bad. I don't think predicting how 20 AI will move on the board is fun. It's obnoxious when a mob, or even more infuriating an NPC, blocks the path and forces you to waste the whole turn. Or when you line up a powerful move and all the mobs move out of the configuration that made that move a good idea. It doesn't even make sense in fiction-- in what world do you choose what you're going to do, watch all the circumstances on the ground that led to your decision change, and then decide the best course of action is to just sit there smelling your farts? 

I can understand how there's an argument to be made about how that's part of the strategy, it's just not enjoyable to find out that your prediction that you would have better initiative than the AI didn't pan out so now you have to forfeit your last cards and lose an hour long session only because an AI, that cannot fulfill the win condition, moved between you and your target and you can't get around it. 

I also really dislike the amount of time it takes for mobs/NPCs to take their turn. When there are 20 guys on the map you just have to sit there watching a bunch of skeletons move two steps or activate their shields for like five minutes (or what feels like it anyway).

I think I would really like this game if there was an option for real-time decision-making rules (the computer decides turn order, or dice rolls at the start of a round maybe?), and definitely an option to make mobs move faster.

Some scenarios require more than two characters to advance through (at least 3 at times) but the more characters you have not only are there more enemies loaded in the scenario, but they are significantly more powerful and micromanaging your health and card strategy becomes even more difficult. These advance enemies even hit harder than normal advanced enemies for some reason, even if you have the difficulty lowered. Once you get the hang of things, it starts to become a bit more fun but it will be a constant struggle at first, especially with some scenarios that are significantly difficult by default (like killing 4 times the amount of enemies per player).

I went in knowing it had a reputation for complexity, that it was a board game and not an actual RPG, and that was about it. 

I got started with the tutorial, and gave it a whirl on either Easy or Normal.  First off, pay no attention to the names of the difficulty settings.  They really should get rid of the names and change them to numerical values.  People will still make the mistake of starting somewhere in the middle, but at least you aren't BSing them by calling something ""Easy"" when it definitely isn't.

Part of the issue with this game is that it began its existence as a board game, and not as a computer game. The modern trend in downloaded computer games is one where you aren't given a manual and you basically learn by playing and through the use of tutorials. Well let me tell you, this game is NOT suited for that approach.  Perhaps it's easier to adjust to when playing the board game, because you have to actually read the rules thru to figure out how to do literally anything. But in a computer game, where so much of what you'd do in a board game is already done for you by the computer, I expect a tutorial to actually walk me through the basics of gameplay.  This game doesn't do that.  

The tutorial gets you started by prompting you to select two mercenaries and create them (really, just pick two, name them, and select their personal ""quests"" which, upon completing, will lead to them retiring).  You then go into town for the first time and have a City Event which is a random event that either gives you nothing or maybe gives you a minor bonus.  As far as I can tell, the City Events don't really make much difference.  They certainly didn't for me.  One time I got a ""Blessing"" and another time I didn't, and it never had any real effect on the outcome.  Anyway, after that, you spend gold on items which, again, seem to have relatively little effect.  The most impactful stuff I got was armor for my Brute, which seemed to reduce incoming damage.  That was handy, I guess.  

After that, it's off to your first dungeon, and that's where the tutorial promptly stops.  You get zero input about what your cards do, or how to actually do anything.  You're told ""Select two cards"" and that's the last bit of guidance you get.  I won't get into the mechanics here, due to lack of space, but suffice to say that you use cards for EVERYTHING, including basic movement, and you slowly run out of cards.  Ultimately, Gloomhaven is a card/hand/resource management game.  You effectively have a finite number of turns in which to finish a mission, because you'll run out of cards eventually. 

I wound up playing the tutorial dungeon of the campaign about 3-4 times and failing each time before I started thinking ""WTF am I doing here?"" and started looking around online.  Apparently, the campaign is notoriously difficult and the recommendation is to play in a different mode entirely. This is a colossal mistake by the developers. Whatever the best way is to learn, make THAT your tutorial mode, and lead players there first.

Ultimately, I decided to refund the game for several reasons.

1. I got it because I thought it'd maybe be a good game for my D&D group to play on off nights when we're short a person (especially last minute). I wanted a quick-to-set-up, straightforward game to play that would be fun right out of the gate. This game isn't that. It's too complex, requires too much time to learn, and is too punishing along the way. Wouldn't have worked for my group.

2. As a single-player game, I decided ""This ain't for me."" I'm happy to spend time learning a game. I have no desire to play games that approach learning by slapping your hand with a ruler and saying ""NO. Again.""

3. I gather the multiplayer is incredibly unreliable, so this wouldn't have worked for my group on that level, either. I didn't get far enough to test it, though, but by the time I read about that, I'd basically made up my mind.

I can't stand games like Dark Souls that approach teaching you the game by handing you your ass over and over, and forcing you to replay the same stuff over and over. As others have said, this feels like Dark Souls: the Board Game. If that sounds great to you, knock yourself out. If you can't stand games like that either, save your money.",1656610035,1656610035,False,2,0,0.500589251518249512,0,True,False,False

It offers Multiplayer and is mostly useful to train the rules or solo play, teamplay and character class decks. 
Gloomhaven is a yet unrivalled deckbuilding dungeon crawler game on hex tiled scenarios. The scenarios are varied, story driven and a lot of creativity went into level design.  

Currently Healing mechanics is still broken. Heal X will remove Poison status and restore Zero Health. It should rather be Remove Poison & Heal X-1 on poisoned Characters. This is not all to clearly stated in the paper version rules. It should at least be a house rule to do so. Means treat the Poison as -1 Heal to remove it. 

The reason is poison is a common status at Level 1. Heal X cards and Health pool massively grow on level up. It is unreasonable that higher level Heal action with adapted values of high Heal X would need to be expended to remove Level 1 minor status annoyances. The deckbuilding does not allow to carry low level Heal X actions just for removing Poison status. This is a game logic mismatch vs board game rules / house rule interpretation. Unfo Poison is very common in the game and the effect quite dramatic.
A choice to either remove the Poison or restore health would be needed, if you dont opt for Remove Poison & Heal X-1 solution. The current state is broken and makes higher difficulties unplayable. 

The game is best balanced in super easy and easy mode. You may find ""normal"" already quite offensive on the damage modifier decks wiping well stacked effects to zero damage critical miss and exhausting your team grinding down massively buffed enemy health pools. Some side quests may seem unwinnable or have entirely broken or buggy winning conditions. The main campaign should work out by now.

The loot cards are a broken game design aspect alrerady in the original board game mechanics. In the board game enemys don't drop coin. You just need to expend the action to plunder treasure chests and staches. Gold is really critical to buff abilities in the card deck. Drops seem to get more gold into the game and I'm not sure if comes out as buff or nerf.

The game has improved a lot since my first review. I reinstalled after getting the board game back on the table with friends. The game is now an optiion to play or train a kickstarter board game that is coming with a hefty price tag.

I used to do so for an independent website that reviewed different games, and honestly, I burned out on it. I’ve decided to return because I’m looking at a pretty decent game but it has some flaws that need addressing. My thumbs down deal mainly with the combat system, but we do have a few other minor issues as well.

I’m not going into detail on the mercenaries as they speak for themselves. What involves them centers on their combat abilities using a card system. Each mercenary begins with a core base which can range from 10 to 15 cards. You would think this would be enough since this is a turn-based game, but not so.

Each turn requires two cards per mercenary. At the end of the turn, they go into the drawn or a burn pile. You can retrieve draws but not burned cards with one exception. There is a mercenary that can retrieve burned cards but it’s a one-time deal. 

Each card has a top and bottom action as well as an initiative number, (who starts first.) Who goes first is important depending on the current turn. Each card has a header title giving some indication of its abilities. Unless you have great memorizing abilities, you’ll still have to read the cards per turn.

A turn requires two actions which are attack, move, heal/rest, and/or a special action. The part I’m turning a thumbs down is needing two cards to perform two separate actions. Every turn causes the removal of both cards. Having 10 cards on mercenary results in 5 or fewer turns. If you’re trying to act and the card you want is in the drawn pile, you’ll have to do a short/long rest.

Doing a short rest requires burning a random card from the drawn pile. If you don’t like the random pick, you can take a -1 point health penalty and pick the one to put into the burn pile. A full rest uses up your turn but lets you pick the card to burn. By the way, resting doesn’t heal you, it just gives you the ability to return the cards in the drawn pile. You’ll need your heal cards for that.

After a while, you’ll notice fewer drawn cards and a large pile of burned cards. Due to diminishing returns completing the quest becomes impossible depending on the goals required to complete it. Remember that the minimum requirement is two mercenaries. More than that increases the difficulty of the quest. The typical main quest has you eliminating all enemies in all rooms. That’s normally two or more rooms with 4 or 5 opponents per room. Side quests have fewer completion goals. We are talking about an easy setting by the way.

Part of my 30 hours of playtime has been quest repetition. The beginner quests have taken a minimum of 45 to 60 minutes to get to that point where I have to hit the defeat button or retry again. I’m talking campaign side as what I call the sandbox version hasn’t worked in-depth but it pretty much follows the same rules.

My take is to eliminate the two-card action and replace it with one card instead. You can do with one card what you are now doing with two. One card could have the attack on top and move on the bottom half. Those 10 cards can have an extended variety of options before you would need to rest at all. If you still want a two-card option, then eliminate the burn pile and the short rest part. Make it a full rest turn with a -1 point hit to the mercenary’s health.

Having to repeat the same quest over and over to gain a level and additional cards just to complete it gets boring after a while. I also point out that the rewards received from a quest are a bit underwhelming as well. Not to mention how accessories are used as well. The card issuer is my biggest dissatisfaction with the game.

If you like the idea of a crunchy, tactics-driven, SLOW, cleverly abbreviated version of a D&D-type adventuring game (sort of) with a novel game mechanic (character ability cards), where graphics don't really matter; this is the game for you.

Basically, instead of creating RPG characters from scratch, you're given fully fleshed out characters. RP barely matters - choices in the game are almost always ""X, or Y"", with X or Y often looking completely different instead of diametrically opposed (""coffee? or beef?""). The setting gives you the impression of a very violent, dirty world full of demonic and extra-planar magic causing problems, and often including some of the tropes you'd find in a D&D world/setting.

 The real meat of the game, and the part you'll spend the most time on, involves taking your character(s) through dungeons, attempting to complete pre-planned goals against a pre-planned set of monsters. Occasionally the mechanics of the dungeon or monsters are also modified to add some variance into the gameplay. 

Progression involves levelling up your characters (standard xp system), buying items to help you in dungeons (you get money from killing monsters in the dungeons of course), and levelling up the party's reputation and the main-city's 'prosperity'. New characters (which are often better), special items, and special dungeons are also unlocked by completing randomized, long-term quests assigned to each character in the party.",1656125442,1656126560,True,15,0,0.6948508620262146,0,True,False,False

Sometimes 3 straight turns with nulls on the same character, or 2 consecutive characters getting double curses on disadvantage draws. Having over a 100 plays in physical, I usually see a null on average once or twice in a game.

Biggest con about the game is that everything must be manually chosen and if you goof up just once you'll have to restart the round.  Play this with 3 other friends and you'll be doing this a lot which will become a chore.  Obviously the reason being is that there are so many ""moving parts"" that it would be impossible to hard code every card move and action. 

Guildmaster mode for single player lets you learn every class (and items) as you will unlock all of them rather quickly. However this is best played with friends campaign mode.

Today a dream come true - We can actually play Gloomhaven as a Campaign Game, like it was intended in the first place. Great work guys, thank you for bringing us the Board Game experience to the digital world! 

----------
Isaac Childres presented us a great boardgame - beside the unique Action System we see a game that has hundreds of hours spent in detail and balancing. Flaming Fowl Studios struggles at the moment with both.

Right now I am doing the first boss dungeon, the Bandit Leader. With two characters you encounter two Archers in the first room and then one Elite Archer and the Boss with 20 LP in the second. He can summon Living Bones and Jump to four Doors summoning more little Helpers. Thats the Board Game of course... It is a hard fight but managable.

Now to the PC Version: I am right now facing in two rooms 5 Bandit Guards with 9 LP each, 4 Bandit Archers with 6 LP, one Bandit Leader with 26 LP - he of course summons occasionally a living bone with 7 LP a shield and Self Heal...

Guys, with all my cards, and the best possible outcomes, I am not able to deal the roughly 90 points damage... 

Gloomhaven is not a game that allows random map generating - I encountered distances, impossible to manage, because there where five rooms and nobody bothered to count the approximately 50+ Moves and so on. The difficulty is completly random, did impossible and managed it, died countless times on easy taking the hardest path.

I love Gloomhaven, I paid the money, I know it is early access - but at this point it is a money grab, the game is not playable in the current version.

Came back to this to try the DLC and see how things ended up. This is hands down my least favourite RPG on steam. I really dislike everything about it, from the pacing to the convoluted systems.

Furiously unfair at first, it gets easier and delivers more fun as you explore the mechanics and exploit them.

Do not fool yourself, this game is not an RPG, it is a puzzle. A puzzle with lots of variability, including card-based random and building decks according to ever-changing party composition.

But for single player I would rather recommend trials of fire for a similar experience (though no multi player),1654280826,1654280826,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The card discard system is incredibly restrictive, with rules that essentially require you to finish in under a certain number of turns no matter what. The result is encounters that feel less like actual fights and more like puzzles where you find what combination of moves will allow you to get to the end of the level in time. I never found myself thinking, ""What cool thing could my character do in this moment?"" like I would while playing XCOM or Battletech. Instead, I was just crunching abstract numbers in my head, trying desperately to avoid yet another situation where I lose one turn from the end because I ran out of cards. 

From the first scenario on, there's just no room to breathe - no room to experiment or back off and regroup, no room to set up a cool synergy between team members, no room to do anything but press forward in exactly one particular path. That might appeal to some people, but I personally just found it exhausting. I can't for the life of me understand why the designers centered the entire game around such a punishing mechanic that actively discourages anything beyond the most stringent minmaxing possible.

It doesn't encourage exploration as much as trying to figure out the right combo in N turns before your cards expire. So I often play the same mission twice.  I wish there were options to remove the exhausted effect via a switch rather than a mod.

Still, I can't fault this for being a wonderfully faithful port and wish teams would do other games like Pandemic Legacy, Descent, Imperial Assault, etc.

So I have a love/hate relationship with this. But I still feel compelled to play ""just one more dungeon"", which is the hallmark of any good game.

As ever, I wish there was some kind of ""Yes, but..."" recommendation option.

For context: I do not own, nor have I ever played, the physical board game. My experience with Gloomhaven is exclusively via this digital product. Additionally, I play almost exclusively in Guildmaster mode. Keep that context in mind with respect to my commentary.

First, some ""technical"" stuff. This game gets patched. A lot. And often. Whether you think that's good or bad is a matter of perspective. It's good because the team behind the game addresses issues fairly quickly. ....It's bad because they have to do that because every patch breaks something fundamental to the game. So be aware, especially in multiplayer, your experience with the game will swing wildly from week to week. Also, performance for the game is.... Variable. Setting aside the loading times which are arbitrary at best, graphics regularly ""freak out,"" and calculations for moves can take anything from no time to almost a minute. You will, almost inevitably, find yourself wondering at some point if your game froze. It didn't! The enemy just probably has three or four effects on their current move so the game is having an aneurysm. I'll also throw in here that multiplayer, as a general whole, can be an exercise in frustration. Desyncs happen. Unfortunately, the game doesn't even attempt to rectify or work around them, even if there wasn't actually any desync. You just get booted back to the menu, and your session ends. The cloud syncing for profiles is really good, though.

Next, in no particular order, some general information about my play experience.

Rules: There's a lot of them. If you bought this because you were intimidated by needing to read and understand the entire rule book for the boardgame, I've got some bad news. You're still going to need to go and read it, more than likely. The game does a poor job of conveying information. I've honestly gotten more useful information from loading screen tips than I have from the tutorial. In a related sub point, non-player allies have the same AI as the enemies. That's bad. I'll spare everyone the excruciating detail of it all and just sum it up by saying that I've lost multiple encounters due to required allies committing suicide via trap. This is but one of many problems with the way the game handles allied/summoned entities.

Information: If you have a question that's not clearly outlined by the rule book that you want to learn about before doing something? For example, wanting to know how a specific item interacts with a specific skill under certain circumstances? Good luck. For reasons yet to be adequately explained to me, the developers, and the community by extension, enforce a pretty stringent spoiler rule. And you see it in my review; I've been careful to avoid anything specific/by-name, just to head off any issues in that regard. Not to mention, the information is spread across a multitude of platforms. There's the official Discord--which is of debatable usefulness. There's BGG. There's Reddit. I've found information on something called Trello, which I guess is also where you submit bug reports? But also the Discord? Honestly, it feels like dealing with Secrets of Grindea--not sure if that reference passes with anyone. But I digress, the point is finding information is frequently an exercise in frustration, and rarely enlightening.

Modifier Decks: The game is challenging. ...Kind of. Modifier decks. Yes, yes, I'm aware of the house rules available--and honestly, I wish there were more of them/better custom configurations. The mod scene for this game isn't that robust, and they don't work in multiplayer to my knowledge anyways. But modifier decks, particularly on low level characters, are a significant source of frustration. A misplaced critical or critical failure can absolutely make-or-break a scenario. And that goes for the player and for enemies. As your party levels, and as you go further, enemies become increasingly complex and dangerous. Especially outside of normal difficulty, you can end up in situations through no fault of your own where characters will need to burn cards just to survive near or outright one shots. In the absence of certain specific party combinations, some scenarios can even prove impossible depending on enemy spawn sets (there's some degree of randomness with these) and drawn moves (enemies all have a specific set of limited moves, and certain moves are ""redraws,"" meaning they shuffle back their original full deck of potential moves; these redraws are typically quite powerful, and nothing prevents the enemies from pulling these moves multiple turns in a row). This can lead to frustrating situations where you can find yourself not playing what you want to/the way you want to, or losing through no fault of your own. This game is tagged ""strategy."" Need I explain the issue further?

Enemy/Summon Balance: Some enemies are just busted. Full stop. Again, I'm wary of presenting much in the way of spoilers. But certain enemies have the ability to just outright disable your party and exhaust you if there's a sufficient number of them and you have the wrong party composition. Others have the ability to just outright neuter your party--certain damage either has no range limitation, or has enough innate range coupled with movement such that it doesn't matter anyways. With multiple enemies, this can outright nuke certain party members, forcing them to burn valuable cards to survive and cutting the amount of turns you have available to win by a significant amount, or, alternatively, they can eliminate all summoned/scenario allies. In the case of summoned allies, there's generally no hard counterplay here. Summoned ally HP either can't be scaled at all, or can be scaled up by.... one. (Yes, yes, there's an exception. But you know that doesn't change the point here.) Just generally, this makes certain classes problematic to play, and just makes the experience not fun.

Gold/Leveling: There's a certain power-increasing mechanic that costs gold in the game. The costs for it start off high, and then proceed to become immense. Across a party of up to four, this cost becomes borderline untenable. This mechanic is arguably what ""balances"" the game against the ever increasing difficulty of enemies, not just from numeric scaling, but from baseline enemy complexity and movesets. Unfortunately, it's a perpetual uphill struggle. Essentially, for a long period of time, every time you increase in power, the game finds a new way to bludgeon you down. And this becomes especially apparent when you, invariably, switch to a new character down the line who will, congratulations, be level 1 with a terrible base card deck (it is my understanding that unlocked/new characters in the board game do NOT start at level 1...), no items, and nothing from the above mechanic. Oh, right, and you can't freely move around/switch items. And unless you house rule it, gold isn't shared. ....And harder enemies don't drop larger amounts of gold. And the further you progress, the harder enemies/quests get. And replaying old ones no longer award experience. So leveling new characters feels horrendous. And takes a very long time.

Multiplayer: YMMV. Not from a technical aspect, but from a people aspect. My understanding is per the rules, you don't share what move you're making, initiative, or battle goal. The rules essentially demand you don't communicate. If you ignore that, okay, fine. If you have people that insist on it? Probably drop the ""co-op"" tag. You'll feel like you're fighting against your own party, in my experience. Especially if you have people who are ""inflexible"" with how they play.

Running out of characters. Wish I could say more. Overall, fun to play. Good for the right person/group of people. But if you want a true strategy co-op game, this probably isn't it.",1653402737,1653402737,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

However the game does have some issues with bugs and some missions still completely broken (Windswept Highlands) which is frustrating. With characters with built up, complex abilities, the AI can really slow down and take quite a long time to process the actions. Some characters have alternate costumes but it would be great to see more of these or allow for fan made mods (even just paints) of verious characters and costumes.

I ""failed"" encounters many times with my party at full HP because the game has a constant attrition; for some reason you have to periodically destroy your own actions to casually walk around rooms, and when you run out of actions you die of exhaustion. For some reason you have to interrupt the swingy, punishing combat in order to pick up the gold coins that enemies drop, leading me to often ignore rewards, which turns out to be OK, because the rewards are pathetic.

Gloomhaven demands specific, clutch plays and combinations, leading to a lot of trial and error from the very first quests. Rewards are paltry, side-quests often encourage you to play poorly, and your actions occasionally accomplish nothing due to lack of options or drawing a x0 modifier. Bad luck can easily wreck your plan for a turn or even for a whole encounter, which kind of defeats the potential satisfaction of a crunchy tactical game. 

Without the chunky charm of the 20-ish lb. tabletop game, the design simply doesn't hold up.

Update: After one of my losses, I quit the game but it didn't register the loss.  So now, every time I start the game, it won't let me start anywhere but the start of that battle.  Problem is, it's glitched and doesn't allow me full access to moves, so I can't complete the first turn, meaning I can't abandon the mission.

Seriously.

There is no reason this game could not function with remote play. Its multiplayer. Its turn based with multiple characters. All you would need is the other player to have mouse control. Saw another post where someone asked about hot seat availability and the devs responded.

""While it's not a directly supported mode or anything, you absolutely could just share the turns and play it hotseat if you wanted to.""

They absolutely know this game is designed for multiplayer in this fashion. So why dont they allow it? It is after all a multiplayer board game.

GREED 

Little history:

Monoply was a board game about making money. You bought one copy of the board game and you could play it with your freinds. They did not have to also buy the board game.

YEARS LATER

Monopoly is a video board game on steam. You buy one copy of the game and you can play it with your Friends. This greedhaven game is littlerally more money hungry than monoply.


So... if your going to play this game... dont get sucked into buying multiple copies, find a way to let someone remote use your cursor or you can even get 4 copies of tabletop simulator, and play this same game ( and many others ) for less.


Im sure there is some gameplay too.

If, like me, you came here for a digital conversion of Gloomhaven, you're going to be thrilled. The eye-candy makes the game crisp and easy to follow, all the rules and updates are there and interactively explained. And the game a LOT of the bookkeeping for you. No more lengthy setup and pack down, no fumbling through rulebooks to resolve edge cases, no forgetting a step or losing a piece. This automation takes solo mode from ""technically possible but boring as hell"" to a legitimate way to enjoy the game, and makes multiplayer run super smooth - perfect for groups that can meet up online more often than in person.

Gameplay is varied, original, and most importantly, fun.
Difficulty is, at least early on, quite high. Indeed, I have finally found a turn-based strategy game that knows what the word ""hard"" means, besides arbitrarily durable or cheating enemies. Though I do think that the difficulty may regardless be a tad excessive the first few Missions.

Personal mileage may vary, but I do think this game is better played with a group of 2-4 Players. Playing alone there is a bit much to consider all at once controlling 4 Characters, having one Character to oneself allows one to enjoy more without getting mired on having to consider an absurd amount of possible move-combinations each round.

The game's tutorial just turned me off completely, the ruleset here is absolutely random. I know this is a video game so most of it will be automated so I don't really have to remember it, but good lord, I can't believe this was an actual board game at one point. It's very unattractive, nothing about it makes me even want to pay attention because it's just random and un-immersive.

The style sucks as well. Feels like a game made by pink haired liberal chicks. All your characters are monsters and women with lesbian haircuts. All the enemies are normal humans. Warcraft and Warhammer offer a wide selection of races, none more morally righteous than the other and you can pick your poison. Games like Gloomhaven want to make a political statement while pretending they're totally not making a political statement by making you play as the colorful band of good guy monsters, against the evil caucasian bandit girls with attractive ponytails and long hair and evil caucasian human knight factions.

No tracking of perk points or experience. No keeping track of the Gloomhaven reputation tracker or wealth. It's an overall easy enough game to play that I'd say, try it.

While the idea is great and I was really looking forward to a pc version of the amazing table top game, the execution is pretty garbage. This game feels like an early release/alpha. There are constantly bugs where me or my friend would get disconnected or the game would lock on us and not even allow us to exit. Also we found that some outcomes for our own moves were completely scripted. I could more expect this for enemies but when I was doing a dungeon and restarted it six times over just to see -- I found out I was scripted to crit fail, no matter what I chose as my first attack. That's insanely lazy... and not fun. Why would they even do that? It seems like more work than just randomizing it to me.

If you like Gloomhaven this is 100% Gloomhaven without the time consuming setup and take down. So, I love this game and if you like Strategy and CRPG style games I think you'll find something really special and unique here. 

Single/Multiplayer: I played the board game with and without people extensively and find enjoyment in both. Unfortunately, unless you have friends to play the videogame version with I would caution MP play. It's really easy to find leavers, afkers and people who refuse to work together in all MP online games but this problem is especially apparent in Gloomhaven. Battles are not short and it's easy to screw up your allies plans especially when they refuse to communicate. MP is EXCLUSIVELY for friend groups. Luckily, the game is just as good and in some ways better solo.

Solo is for me the most fun. Using abilities from multiple characters in coordination is insane and leads to very satisfying battles. Unlocking mercs and using them in different teams is also addictive. Solo is always fun.

Well, to wrap this up I will say that gloomhaven isn't for those looking for instant gratification. It takes time to learn and time to play. The videogame version saves a lot of time with the optional rule changes and lack of physical setup but still, Gloomhaven is for the patient and dedicated. If that's not you I would avoid this game. I've put in around 500 hours into the original boardgame and have only just begun my adventure with this digital version yet I know exactly what I'm doing because this translates so well to the videogame medium. FFS really knocked this one out of the park and I can't wait for Jaws of the Lion which has my favorite Mercs in the expansion :) Thanks for reading, I hope this helps.",1651995584,1651995584,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The digital edition just takes away all the question marks. You will still kick yourself a few times while you digest the rules and even afterward when you accidentally skip movements instead of undoing actions, but it all makes sense in a brief period of time and the automation of enemy combat makes everything seamless. I'd say the main difference between physical and digital is that there's no fudging of the rules... but the difficulty setting gives you some leeway to make things more or less punishing.

It's a great game, put together beautifully both visually and mechanically. It's easy to lose yourself in it and play for hours on end. That's partly because scenarios can be very, very long (generally averaging about an hour of play time from start to finish), partly because you won't want to stop, and partly because there's a quality sense of persistence and progression that you typically only find in strategy games like XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics.

I was away from the game for awhile due to RL issues. When I came back, there was a note about needing new Global Settings file. Clicked the button, and waited... and waited... and waited... Finally after about a hour, my computer went to sleep, and when I woke it up, the game had closed down. Tried to launch the game, and crashed to the desk top. Tried to launch again, same. 

Tried to find support for the game, couldn't find a location for support. Contacted Steam, told to contact the developer. Tried the forums, and saw lot's of information on the error, tried using resolutions there, but none fixed the problem. Tried to find an official support channel, searched on an off for 6 months plus. FINALLY managed to find a support channel through Flaming Fowl that responded. 

Now I have been working with them off and on for 6 months, trying to resolve the issue. Found there were some issues that needed to be resolved with GeoForce Experience (another rabbit hole of support, but at least I was able to chat with someone who was able to help me resolve the issue instead of trading a string of e-mails). Support has included gems like:

Most likely causes are:
Faulty RAM
Faulty HDD/SSD
An issue with Windows installation
An issue with Steam installation

Could you please check those?

I finally got from them instructions for a full uninstall/reinstall, and after that (and a full uninstall/reinstall of steam, I am back to the GlobalData error message. So I have sent this to them to see if we can progress from here.

I can't say the game is bad. I can't play it, so how would I know. I know this is likely a limited issue, and environmental to my machine, but on the off chance you do have issues, be aware that Support is going to be a long, slow process, at least in my experience.

Firstly, graphics and artwork are excellent. Let's get that out of the way.

The issues with this game begins with the performance. It's slow as balls. The game pauses and locks up all the time. We have a running joke in my group called ""the bubble sort."" Whenever a fire drake is taking their turn and just doing fucking nothing for 20 seconds while the game's AI figures out what it should do, we all say, ""Looks like the drake is doing a bubble sort.""

The UX is awful, of our rotating six people who all play together, all of us are frustrated by the UI. The first thing that stands out is the placement of the buttons and what gets mapped to them. The way the game forces you to take actions that should be automatic is annoying and frankly makes no sense. You are forced to acknowledge every single thing that happens. We have to constantly remind each other to press the buttons so we can move to the next thing. In the actual quests you could argue it's worse. There's a couple of cards that affect all adjacent allies. When these cards activate, it shows the allies that are adjacent, and you still have to acknowledge what's going to happen. It's completely confounding. I picked the bloody card, I know what it does! This is a perfect opportunity to make something automatic to speed up the game a bit and it's ignored.

At least once per quest, you are guaranteed to lose a turn because you fucked something up and skipped an action when you didn't mean to. Probably more, especially when you're learning how cards work exactly.

I think the worst thing is the summon AI is awful, absolutely borked. My one pal plays a Summoner. One level's design completely negated his summons ability to do anything, because they kept attacking walls instead of enemies. In another level, you have to blow up doors instead of opening them, and the Summoner is a downright liability on this level, makes them almost unplayable. This is wild how this was overlooked during development, because it's not like the Summoner is a one of kind they just forget to balance, lots of classes have summons, and there are items that summon too.

My #1 suggestion is this game needs a re-do command. Once per quest you should be able to start your turn over from the begging, AKA a mulligan (just like in Into the Breach if you've played that). This would be back the board game vibes because if you were playing this in real life with your pals, you would sometimes want to improvise stuff during your turn, i.e. whoops, that doesn't work, let's do this instead...

Again, perfectly fine if you can't play the in-person game, but it seriously needs some help before I would consider it good.",1651467827,1651468185,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
   * One of the best turn based games/ balanced games I've ever come across 
   * Beautiful artwork that brings the board game to new levels 
   * Tons of fun with friends OR solo 
   * Everything has replay value 
   * Unlocking classes is a lot of fun, and gives you a genuine sense of joy when you finally do unlock one
   * Your cards start to feel familiar, almost like you got to know the character themselves. You almost want to think in the way your cards are named, very cool! 

Cons: 
   * Tedious to learn how to use the cards to their full potential 
   * SLOW start 
   * The game takes a little too long on certain animations and really can slow the flow of the game down

A variable campaign-coupled with a novel of a rulebook containing 17 character classes-means you'll always be discovering new mechanics for a different experience each time you play.

The campaign system links every scenario with an overarching narrative and satisfying progression, character unlocks and retirement encourage you to change things up and not just stay glued to a single character, and the combat mechanics are nothing short of inspired. You won't find another game in this genre with the elegance and strategic depth of Gloomhaven. It's as close to a perfect game as you can reasonably get.

This digital port is a bit more of a mixed bag. On one hand, it delivers the complete Gloomhaven experience with solid visuals, and adds narration to most of the game (city and road events are a notable exception). It also brings a handful of updated rules which are pretty much universally positive changes in my opinion (the enhancement rebalancing in particular is excellent). On the other hand, it's janky - my friends and I have run into bugs, huge amounts of lag in certain scenarios, and some clunky UI design choices. However, for the most part it does the job passably well and for a game of Gloomhaven's quality it's worth putting up with some frustration.

If you've never played Gloomhaven before, this is a great way to start: it's cheaper than the physical board game, there's a built in tutorial and the game handles all the rules enforcement for you. If you're already addicted, you can satisfy your craving for more without having to assemble the whole group in person.

Only hiccup is we've had a few people crash mid-mission (maybe like... 4 times out of 30 missions). They've been able to join right back in though after restarting the game.

In the last month or so there was an update that also seemed to make people desync at the end of a mission when someone would buy and equip some new item in town. It was a little annoying because everyone would need to reconnect... but it was also usually happening at the end of a session when everyone was about to log out anyway, which took some of the pain away. If you can't put up with an issue like that, maybe wait to see if they get it patched. That said, it has never resulted in a loss of progress or a failed mission or anything... just a couple minutes of wasted time while people reconnect.

* Zero setup/breakdown. Gloomhaven takes as long as an average boardgame to setup/breakdown. Even with extensive play aids to make this as stream lined as possible, it is really hard to get it faster than 20-30 minutes per game session.
* The digital version doesn't take up a large table. Seriously, this is inconvenient when playing the boardgame.
* Did I mention setup/breakdown? Really, this is a huge deal. And is true for the scenarios as well. A reset to move to another scenario usually takes a minimum of 5 minutes if you have streamlined your game with player aids. Out of the box experience will take 10-20 minutes depending on the breakdown/setup required.
* Not having to keep track of rule enforcement. So many times in playing a scenario, I've realized that my success or failure was determined by a mistake I was making in enforcing one or more rules. It is super-easy to do, even for seasoned players. There is simply a LOT to keep track of, much less concentrating on your play.
* Speed of play: a round can easily take 20-30 minutes in the boardgame, and that is not including downtime to strategize. Take into account strategy, and a round can at its most extreme take up to an hour. In the digital edition a round typically takes 1 minute, add in strategy I find my rounds with two heroes (which is what I play in boardgame as well) takes between 5-15 minutes depending on how much planning I need to do.
* Ease of multiplayer: Both being able to play online which makes it easier to find other players, but also how the digital edition makes it easier for the players to focus on coordination on the scenario rather than having to constantly collectively rule lawyer the game (see my earlier comment). Pro tip: you can play multiplayer perfectly by streaming the game. Simply agree who controls which merc. The only thing that is lost is card selection and battle goal secrecy, but some folks play with that as public knowledge when playing the boardgame already...
* The production values of various assets and overall quality of the aesthetics in the UI is amazing! Some parts of the interface could be improved, but overall it has done a masterful job of handling the complexity of the boardgame very elegantly and presenting it in a comprehendable manner.

My wishlist:
* Better warnings if you are skipping abilities. It is super easy for instance, to miss the opportunity to select multiple targets. It is also unclear at times what you are being asked to specify, a selection grid will be active and the card half shown, but there is no indication which part of the card is active for the selection you are making.
* Options to speed up gameplay by shorteninig/eliminating some animations (like a checkbox list)
* Voice narration for the guildmaster campain (this gamemode is similar to the random dungeon deck from the boardgame).
* The tutorial and the guildmaster campaign should either be better integrated together or completley separate. As it is, the immersion experience is broken. Some of the basic lessons are only in the tutorial and then the later tutorial lessons are duplicated in the guildmaster campaign. Pro tip: hit the ""Skip Mission"" button to avoid having to repeat the tutorial scenarios in the guildmaster campaign if you have already done them in the tutorial.

Overall this game is revolutionary. I have 3 boardgame sets, many quality of life player aids, custom terrain, and have played for hundreds of hours. It saddens me in some ways that I think the next time I put away the boardgame, I may not decide to play it again, unless I want to show the tactile version to friends. However, I am also excited that I will be playing a lot more Gloomhaven because the time in doing so is minimal by comparison. As an example of how slow gameplay can be, and how inconvenient setup/breakdown of the boardgame is, I've been stuck on a scenario for a long time. The scenario takes 2-3 hours to complete and my heroes become exhausted in the final turns each time. Gloomhaven is a lot like a math puzzle, and I just haven't cracked that one yet. I've probably played the scenario six times now. Rather than setup/breakdown repeatedly, I pushed the table into a corner of the room WHERE IT HAS BEEN SITTING FOR OVER A YEAR. I move it out to try again, and push it back into the corner to try again later. 1. We've not been able to use our table. 2. A corner of the room is taken up by the table. 3. The game has been sitting out (aging/weathering in danger of components going missing) the entire time. All of these things bring into question for me as an original backer of Frosthaven, do I open it when it (eventually?) arrives, or do I wait 2 years for the digiital edition... Having seen this adaptation, I will probably wait, and sell my unopened copy when it appreciates in value.

Now that Jaws of the Lion is here, let's have Forgotten Circles please! The things I dislike about FC (more rules? more components?), would be addressed by the game's management of these annoyances.",1650386311,1650386311,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Why you might like this:
- You're a narcissist who likes to think deeply about how clever you are
- You want to burn through 10,000 hours of your life for no return
- To enjoy min-maxing every move, only to be undone by randomness
- You're into self flagellation
- You have no friends

Specific reasons why this game is completely stupid:
- there is no undo button, so if you accidentally play the wrong card, and you're 2 hours into a level, it's basically game over, so have fun repeating the entire level again (not)
- the story is stupid and contrived - literally at one point, the story narrator said ""you find a map with a point of interest, and you decide it may be of interest to you"" UGH 
- there is so much to weigh up in every decision that the game just drags on and on
- card burning mechanic adds meaningless difficulty
- random encounters force you to discard cards before you even get to the dungeon (where the fun should be....but isn't)

If you are interested in the board game version and playing it with a group, I strongly recommend playing a bit of this version first as all the rules and mechanics are the same. Playing this on PC with my friends made them FAR more willing to play the board game version as well.

As for what to expect from the dev team: I have been playing since before multiplayer and Guildmaster mode was even added, so I've been around for most iterations of this game. I can happily say the team has always made improvements, one after another. If there is a game-breaking bug to a small visual one, wait at most a week and it'll be fixed.

The game itself is fully turn-based, so you're free to take all the time you need to make decisions and the AI plays itself out. If you're concerned about turn speed, you can increase it. The gameplay allows for a good amount of party compositions and aside from the paid DLC, nothing in the game is locked behind any sort of paywall. If you love the base 6 characters, you don't *have to* stop playing them, as the unlockable characters aren't inherently better than the base ones. If you unlock the new characters late, the scaling of the game allows you to create a party with the new characters and scale the difficulty down to catch those characters up. The items are all useful, but you have to grind the side-missions to unlock duplicates, good thing you have so many character to level and test party comps with.

If you like tactical RPGs, you NEED to play this game. The top/bottom half of cards will take a bit to get used to, but it's a very unique take on character abilities.",1649713924,1649713924,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And GH certainly requires a lot of sessions to finish its campaign, not to mention try out all the different classes.

As a standalone game, I find it's a great dungeon crawler, not very forgiving to beginners though, which might be a drawback to some. You have to learn its rules, some specific tactics and how to value your cards in order to achieve success.

I haven't played the board game but I'm generally a big fan of turn based rpgs and have played many of them. Gloomhaven has an incredible strategic depth, unfortunately it makes the game more into a puzzle game than an rpg in my opinion.

I have 2 fundamental complaints against this game that, in my opinion make it something very different from other good turn based rpgs.

1. The game is constantly being difficulty balanced against everything you do and it plainly tells you this. You can use 1-4 heroes but the levels are just adjusted to that difficulty. Further, when you level up, your character gets miniscully stronger, it's really quite dissapointing, and then the game informs you the whole game just got harder to make up for your character leveling up. Essentially, the game implies that the entire game will always be the same difficulty and any way you get stronger will immediately be reflected in the game. This means every encounter is level scaled to you. When you get stronger, so do low level dungeons... It defeats the purpose of acquiring power and when I realized this quickly killed my interest in the game.

2. The game is very tactically deep and very difficult. I failed the second mission multiple times. The scenarios are completely determined, meaning as you fail them you learn exactly what's going to happen for the next time through. Unfortunately this led to a feeling of solving a puzzle rather with a single or extremely few solutions. Because of this, I didn't feel like there was any room at all for things like a playstyle. You either are using your hero correctly or not. And since when you level up (which takes a lot of effort) you gain no significant change to your abilities, the game began to feel like a puzzle game, that's always equally hard.

On top of those 2 core issues for me, the narrative seems quite thin, and there appears to be absolutely 0 character personality (your characters never speak or interact with each other in any way).

I respect how balanced and tactical this game, clearly a lot of love has been put into it. I think you will love this game if you like puzzles or puzzle games (which I don't). However, If your main interest in turn based role playing games has to do with story telling, builds, developing your characters strengths, or character personality, this game will not provide that.",1649474383,1649474383,False,3,0,0.476190507411956787,1,True,False,False

When the pandemic hit, I was very excited to get a digital version so I could still play with my friends. But the technical state of this digital version is just awful. During the early acces period that was ok, but it didn't get any better since release. Single player works mostly, but I bought this game mainly for its multiplayer. Here just a small list of problems:
- incredible long loading times
- disconnects due to long loading times
- connection timeouts after disconnects that require restarts of the game (with long loading times again)
- freezes and crashes at least every second scenario (I have over 300 games in my steam library and this game is the only one that manages to take the steam client down with it when it crashes.)

The long loading times are really the worst problem. Sometimes we have to load and reload the game for 30 mins before we can play a scenario.

Someone might say that my hardware is not up to date and he may be right. But one of my friends with a high end gaming pc can't even play this game because it always  shuts down his system completely in the first two turns after loading a scenario.

Gloomhaven is a great game and  the digital version is highly enjoyable when it works. But it rarely does. This piece of software is just a big pile of sh*t.

Edit: The mid March patch solved most of the problems mentioned above.  I have experienced only one small soft lock in multiplayer since and restarting takes a reasonable amount of time now.

There are major upsides and downsides. First of all, since it's a turn-based game, those who have never tried any turn-based games would probably have a hard time learning the mechanisms since turn-based is kind of an old school style, and there are some unique mechanisms implemented in this game as well which needs a lot of practice to be able to let the stream flow smoothly. But the good thing is once you've acclimated to it there will be a huge boost in terms of experience.

Secondly, this game requires luck. For those that don't like arbitrariness they will probably have a bad time with the attack modifiers & enemy actions. When it comes to dicing it's really just different strokes for different folks, but it's necessary to let people be aware of this at the first place.

Thirdly, some mechanisms are still confusing to me like why can't I control my summons, how to decide which attack modifier is worse/better when I drew a -2 and muddle, why is the enhancement so expensive, etc.

The upsides are also clear and straight forward. Firstly, those who favor dungeon/fantasy/rogue-like/legacy games are gonna have a wonderful time immersing themselves into this game. Secondly, turn-based game is also attractive to certain group of people like me. Thirdly, those who love arbitrariness will enjoy drawing attack modifiers.

If you know that game already then I think this is a great way to enjoy the game without all the upkeep of actually running the tabletop version.

The hardest part is the start as in most char building games because you don't have anything but one you get gear and perks it gets much easier.  Also, if you've never played then read up on tips on card use such as don't use card burn effects till the end or unless absolutely needed or great opportunity comes up, use long rest most of the time, don't try to stall and heal up which wastes time/cards, look at your opponents actions and re-evaluate your moves after they all get revealed, try to avoid getting hit but don't be afraid to take hits, and get healing/stamina potions once you have slots for them.

Las mecanicas de juego son excelentes (para un juego de mesa) y todo el contenido que ofrece es super extenso a comparacion del resto (de nuevo, comparado con el resto de los juegos de mesa).

Tener la adaptacion del juego de mesa a juego de computadora es un paso increible, incluyendo todo el contenido del juego de mesa, con la ventaja de jugar a distancia con tus amigos sin tener que reunirse en persona (cosa dificil este ultimo par de años gracias al COVID), con todos los textos de historia narrados en ingles, mas la facilidad de no tener que hacer el extenso setup y todo el trabajo manual que incluye el jugar un juego de mesa, todo esto a una fraccion de lo que vale el juego de mesa fisico es simplemente exquisito.

Por otro lado, viendolo como videojuego, hay muchas cosas en los que pudo haber mejorado al pasar del formato fisico al digital, por ejemplo, la mayoria de los eventos que ocurren duante un escenario son narraciones sin ningun uso de ayuda visual; ademas como es costumbre ultimamente en la industria de los videojuegos, al ser una de las primeras versiones del juego, este todavia cuenta con bugs. Cabe aclarar que los desarrolladores liberan constantemente parches para solucionar una gran cantidad de ellos.

Habiendo dicho todo esto, es un juego muy recomendable para jugar con amigos y tambien se puede disfrutar de un solo jugador haciendo uso de varios personajes. Sobre todo si te gustan los juegos de estrategia y deck building.",1638326501,1647631289,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In terms of looks and overall UI, I think they've done a great job.  Everything looks vibrant and oozes the theme set forth by its source material.  It's also really nice to have the more time-consuming parts of the game automated and not spend most of our play session setting up and tearing down.  Voice acting is above average as well, and there is a good deal being read to you throughout the game.

That being said, however, I've played for close to 80 hrs with my group.  In that time, I would say that about 1/3 or 1/4 of our sessions have been ruined by ambiguous wording, poor visual spacial representation or flat out bugs in which cards objectively do not function the way they are supposed to (confirmed on BGG and other online sources).  Add on to this that there is no ""undo"" button for your turn, and you have a recipe for disaster.  I'm writing this as we are struggling to make it through *yet another* dungeon where we discovered, after 2.5 hrs of playing it through, that the mission objective was poorly-worded and didn't specify that summons couldn't activate pressure plates.  It's getting to the point that it's damaging my morale to continue the campaign.  In the board game, this wouldn't be an issue, as we would simply play it through and say it should have been clarified better.  

As it stands, having the rules enforced for us has been a blessing and a curse.  And the fact that if you misclick as you execute your first card, there is no way to undo the action.  When done correctly, ""undo"" functions allow players to go back as far as the last randomly generated outcome.  Why this isn't an option is really beyond me, and has led to innumerable ""damn it, I clicked the wrong tile/enemy/option"" moments that, at the end of a multi-hour session, are practically unbearable.

Why the rules haven't been ported in in their entirety, and why the scenario specific rules aren't transcribed exactly from the original game is really inexplicable.

EDIT: Two weeks later and just an update that we are still encountering the same issues at about the same rate.

Thus, it definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're looking for a more straightforward turn-based tactical RPG with big maps (Divinity 2, Fire Emblem...), this game might not be for you.

The UI is gorgeous, characters and environments look solid. From what I've gathered, it is also a faithful adaptation to the tabletop game source material (with the ability to tweak difficulty or rules for your convenience).

It will put you in very tricky combat situations that will require a lot of thought, planning and risk assessment.

Every mission has a timer where your characters action pool get gradually smaller and smaller until they are eliminated due to being out of action cards.

It features RNG with baseline 5% chance of any attack missing or dealing double damage (as well as -2 to +2 damage modifiers) that might pleasantly surprise you or infuriate you.

It has a lot of battle mechanics that will require a lot of time to learn and play optimally. Some ability cards are very, very loaded with mechanics.

Each character has his/her own ability set and playstyle, so the game has a lot to offer you in term of content. That being said, game mechanics are mostly frontloaded from the get go.
Additional game mechanics (especially additional ability cards for each character) are unlocked by leveling up or buying items. Progression feels quite slow, so it is very possible many players will lose interest past a dozen hours of play.

My 3 nitpicks:

1) Tutorial missions are unforgiving puzzles with only one valid sequence leading to victory, the game does guide you but it's a bit jaring that there is almost no room for error in the tutorial, thus leading to a potentially bad first impression of the game.

2) It would be nice if there was an option to disable some UI prompts when there is only one possible choice to make, this could speed up the game a bit.
For instance, it happens frequently that you use an ability with no valid target in range. Yet in that situation you still have to click manually to skip the ability.

[h1]🎤Introduction[/h1]
[b]Gloomhaven[/b] was originally a tabletop game that has now been developed into a digital version. This is a faithful representation of the board game with a few balancing differences, quality of life improvements, and a few tweaks. Whilst this version improves on some of the critiques that the original board game had, there are some newfound problems that can’t go overlooked.

[h1]✔️Pros[/h1]
• Heavily strategy focused
• Diverse range of Mercenaries that have their own strengths and weaknesses
• Numerous unique monsters
• Multiple levels of difficulty to suit newcomers and seasoned veterans
• High replay value
• Over 100 hours worth of content

[h1]❌Cons[/h1]
• A big learning curve to overcome
• Scenario 1 is make or break for newcomers
• Playable tutorial doesn’t explain some of the more valuable rules#
• UI can be very crowded
• Bugs and performance issues here and there

[h1][b]📜In-Depth Analysis[/b][/h1]
[h3]Not Your Traditional RPG[/h3]
[b]Gloomhaven[/b] is not for the faint-hearted. Don’t come into this game expecting it to be another RPG you can haphazardly stumble through and win. Admittedly, it’s a steep learning curve to climb, one that may cause players to become frustrated and give up. There’s an intricate set of mechanics that requires a lot of strategic thinking, planning, and improvisation to triumph in [b]Gloomhaven[/b]. Gathering knowledge about how this game works, and figuring out some nuance mechanics is what will give you the edge, which sometimes you need. Are you still here? Great, let's talk about the game.

[h3]Forming A Team[/h3]
At the start of the campaign, you’ll be greeted with six mercenaries that you can choose to form a team. Each of them has their own play styles that they specialise in, but also have downfalls that need to be considered. From a weak but powerful mage to a hard-hitting but slow Inox Warrior, there is a surprisingly diverse group to pick from. Every class has a set number of cards they pick to build their deck. The cards mostly have unique actions on them for each class, but at low levels, there isn’t much to be excited about. For such a small roster to select from, there are various different teams you can build. Part of the fun is finding new combinations and strategies between the original six and how their actions can complement each other. That being said, no Mercenary wants to be diving in dungeons forever, they want to move on with their retirement goal at some point.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776582835

Once a Mercenary has achieved their retirement goal, they will leave the team. You’ll be awarded a new class for your efforts, and can recruit another Mercenary if you wish. Although it's difficult to let go of the characters that you’re used to playing, it's a core element of the game. The new classes are far more powerful than the original six. It takes some time to become accustomed to your new recruit before you realise their full potential. So, what do you say to a bit of good old-fashioned dungeon delving?

[h3]Delving into the Unknown[/h3]
Every scenario you encounter has a goal to achieve in order to win. Most of the time it’s simply ‘kill all enemies’ or kill a specific enemy, which leaves a lot to be desired. However, mowing down enemies is still satisfying nonetheless, almost feeling like a delicate puzzle that could fall apart with a few wrong moves.

At the start of each round you’ll pick two cards from your deck of cards with each Mercenary you control. The actions of cards can vary widely depending on what class you play. Usually, the top action is an attack of some kind, and the bottom is movement. Once the enemy card has revealed itself and your turn rolls over depending on initiative order (number in the middle of the card, the lowest goes first). You then use the top action on one card, and the bottom action on the other. These are then placed in a discard pile and the cycle continues. Once you are unable to play a pair of cards on your turn, you’ll have to rest to get them back. However, upon resting you’ll be forced to [b]burn[/b] a card, which makes it unavailable for the rest of the scenario. The number of cards you have represents your longevity in the scenario before you become exhausted.

You’ll find most cards have average damage or movement, but there are far more compelling actions that might catch your eye. Massively devastating singular attacks or huge AOE attacks that apply a status effect to all targeted enemies. Whilst these are extremely valuable, they do come at a cost. Burning them after use. This forces you into a balancing act, whereby burning powerful cards early on, though might prove useful in the short-term, will jeopardise your longevity in the scenario. Consequently, making you exhaust faster.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776576503

[b]Gloomhaven[/b] really does push you to get the most out of every action that you play. You need to be aggressive, but also mindful of how monsters will act. Every scenario is tight to win and only gives you a small amount of leeway (depending on the difficulty). It will punish you if you attempt to play it at your own pace. Whilst the first scenario is notoriously difficult for new players, it sets you up for how the game is going to play. It’s a steep learning curve that you can’t overcome with pure luck, it requires a lot of tactical movement and strategy.

[h3]Threatening Monsters[/h3]
For such an extensive campaign, you’ll encounter a multitude of different monsters, all with their own attack deck and unique actions. There are only about four to six cards in each deck, so it's possible to memorise each monster deck and attempt to predict what they do next. Some enemies such as cultists can summon the living dead, whilst others such as the demons have a shield value that soaks up damage before you can deplete their health.

[h3]Character Progression[/h3]
Upon completing a scenario, you’re more than likely to be rewarded with experience. As each character levels up, you’ll gain stronger cards to add to your deck, which further diversifies each class. It does feel like a chore however when you have to choose a card to burn when your deck gets more streamlined with better cards. You’ll also gain perks that modify your attack deck (a deck that you draw every time you attack that modifies your attack) by removing negative cards (-1, -2), adding positive cards (+1, +2), or including new cards altogether. This allows you to streamline each modifier deck and, once again, adds even more variety to each class as they’ll have unique perks available to them.

[h3]Digital Version Problems[/h3]
Whilst the digital version handles a lot of the automation that you would usually control in the tabletop version, there are new problems that need to be addressed. There are still bugs and performance issues throughout, the playable tutorial leaves valuable information out. Crowded areas make it difficult to figure out who you’re attacking, occasional soft locks, and so on. These don’t necessarily break the game by any means, but become annoying to deal with.

[h1]💭Closing Thoughts[/h1]
[b]Gloomhaven[/b] isn’t a game for everyone. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but it seems some people are bashing their heads against a wall playing this game. Whilst the digital version makes it more accessible, it doesn't do itself any favours with annoying bugs, performance issues, and an average tutorial. Overall, I’d only recommend [b]Gloomhaven[/b] if you're willing to put in the time and dedication to learn the game.",1646924428,1646924742,True,49,2,0.820009469985961914,6,True,False,False

Of course, boardgame version of gloomhaven is really really good game, and this make rate of this game as ""good"". However, the implementation is terrible.

1. Developer throw away user-friendly for developing convenience.
- Monster AI is too slow to calculate; especially the enemy is too far to attack. Developer should implement optimized AI method, but it seems that the game search ""all"" possible path.
- No undo. The game only provides ""restart round"" and this is slow.
- Time-consuming unnecessary Monster behavior. Some monster behavior could simultaneously perform all same-type monster, but the monster work one by one. Very time-consuming for user to easy implementation.

2. Mod is very limited and nominal.
- Language mode don't support insert font, and it's very hard to apply language mode for non-alphabet languages.
- Most additional contents cannot be added, including class.

3. Lots of bugs exist. I wonder the developer has the will to fix.
When playing gloomhaven, predicting player & monster action is very important after monster ability card is revealed. However, bugs always ruin this prediction and make we lose the scenario.
For example, I play 2 element infusion card for next round, but 1 infusion is omitted due to bug. I play ranged attack, but it works as melee attack so that I cannot play the item for ranged attack. I play loot card for the chest, the objective of game to win, but it only loot coin.

I think the developer should not work for DLC, but fix lots of problem.",1629656094,1646918492,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True
780290,111903061,76561198050231380,0,5,1218,0,1218,1645998517,"Got 20 hours into this. I really love tactical and turn base and I thought that the campaign on a game like this will be awesome. Graphics and animations are great and the world looked great when I got started in the main city.

First mission I failed, then failed again but got xp each time and my team got a bit better. I said to myself, I will finally beat the second room which seemed almost impossible when I started out with my team.

Then, I did it!!! I finally beat everything in the 2nd room, only to discover there was a 2nd door that I did not see. I opened the 2nd door only to discover a ton of additional enemies that would be impossible to beat.......AND THIS WAS THE FIRST MISSION!!!

Here is the problem, you have a set of cards to use for each of your characters in your team.......some cards eventually get ""burned"" and can never be used again.........so you need to somehow try to remember each teammates cards/values/combinations, etc, to get the ""ultimate"" damage and at the same time hope that the random rolls are in your favor for max damage and at the same time if you get hit, for minimum damage or misses.

You need to be 100% perfect throughout the whole mission, waste and burn minimal cards with near perfection in your execution to be able to win the beat the mission.......AND.......THIS IS THE 1ST MISSION!!!!!

I absolutely HATE timers in games and this in a way is a timer and you will need to perfect and retry over and over and over, like me for 20 hours, and I still cannot beat the 1st mission. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE hard games but for me this game had the right idea, graphics look great, but in the end with the exactness and difficulty it poses to finish missions to the end........I don't want to put time into it like this. For me it is not fun, even with all the xp and building my team over the 20 hours to still not be able to get to the end of mission one. 

For people who will dedicate hundreds of hours for a slight micro progression, this game might be for you.

If you've never played the tabletop version you're gonna miss out on the thrill of unlocking new characters a little bit (because in the box, a lot of the space is taken by all these boxes and their respective mini boxes which are all sealed and have the character symbol on them, only clue as to what the character is). You might also miss out on the combat deck at first, until you learn how to see advantage, disadvantage and that the deck is reshuffled every time you get a Null or Bless card.
Also we can't see the back of City Events and Road Events so the learning curve won't be the same. But in the end, the choices are rarely rational so it's no big deal. Just know that there are 2 special events specific to each characters (for example for the Thinkerer it might be an event related to mechanical contraptions.

Here's the problem; only 17.1% of players have beaten the first mission on Normal Difficulty (or higher). As of right now, only 17.1%. It took me 4 hours. It wasn't fun.

Sure, we quickly learnt that the system heavily punishes patience and trying to take battles at your pace. Sure, we were able to adapt to the rules given and overcame what seemed like an incredibly difficult hurdle; a ratio of 19 enemies to 4 heroes, which completely breaks any conceivable notion of an action economy. After those four hours we felt like we had beaten a Dark Souls boss, and looked to see we had 94 more of those if we ever hoped to complete the game.

Gloomhaven, as a turn based system, is very variable-dependent. This is not inherently a bad thing, but the close-knit battle difficulty that the game is trying to pull off (in which every encounter is a nail-biter) means that there are just times where you won't win. Luckily, gold and xp is kept even if you lose the scenario (in which you have to try again), but that just makes the game a grind-fest in which you run your head against a wall.

Divinity OS2, Wildermyth, Baldur's Gate 3. Pit People, and For The King all do what this game wants and do it infinitely better.

I will keep playing this game. I really want to believe that I just suck and that the game has a unique system that takes more than 4 hours to adjust to. But at the end of the day, only 17.1% of players got far enough to truly 'start' this game.

The game has come a long way since early, early access. The content in the game is fantastic! And if you like puzzle-y RGP's, then this is a great one! I am a huge fan of the board game and I do think this digital version does it justice - with one major exception...

A WORD TO THE DEVELOPERS AND A CAVEAT:
Gloomhaven, the board game, is balanced extremely well, and the game has a built in difficulty system - increasing enemy stats and abilities or decreasing them for an added challenge or easier time, respectively. When you shuffle the cards, there is true RNG in the game, which can be accounted for and played around to a point. And overall it has an impact on the game, but not a detrimental one.

Ever since the 1.0 update, however, (over the last 18 hours or so of our playing time at time of posting), we have noticed about a 25-35% increase in negative ""RNG"" draws on normal difficulty. I can track the statistics if need be, but if those draws are being 'weighted' extra for some reason, I would say that it is absolutely not necessary. Please trust Isaac Childres' original balancing and weighting - it works great when played as intended!

[b] TL;DR: So, if you are looking for a puzzle RPG dungeon-crawler, look no further - provided that you can endure a bit of frustration as the developers (hopefully) work out the balancing issues and card weighting. [/b]

If for some reason there is no such tinkering to increase the 'difficulty' in the RNG system, I stand corrected and am [b] astounded [/b] at the last 18 hours of extremely bad luck we've just endured... But the statistics seem to point to a separate issue.

UPDATE: 40+ hours and a couple of 'balance' patches later. I'm convinced that no string of improbable draws this long is statistically viable. Still no noticeable change in the 'weighted negative draw' issue on Normal difficulty. Just in today's session alone - two separate encounters - one with a 1 in 14000+% and the other with a string of cards boasting a 1 in 110000+%; both highly improbable draw combinations came at the end of the scenarios, seemingly to try and 'rubberband' the scenario in favor of the monsters.

The sad thing is I actually like losing scenarios, but only if its due to strategic error or the built-in card RNG intended by Isaac Childres. Over 3 scenarios with a level 7 Spellweaver's stacked attack modifier deck, and my strong negative draws (-2's, x0's and curses) outweighed my strong positive draws (+2's, x2's and blessings) by over 3.5x, when in the deck they are outnumbered by 2.3x! That's a gigantic statistical swing! I don't like having to keep statistics of my draws, but until the issue is fixed, it seems necessary if only to keep my sanity! Please address the extra weight issue on negative draws! We shouldn't have to decrease difficulty or choose the option that changes x0 to -2, in order to see fair draws.

I haven't played this game multiplayer yet at all, I just did the single player which is pretty neat I think. 
You don't just focus on one character, instead you kinda manage a whole band of mercenaries. They all share 1 big pot of money, you can buy and distribute items for them, but there's an equipping cost if you want to take an item from one character and give it to another. 
And ye, you basically pick a mission just like in the original and you pick your team that you will take from your group and you do the mission. 

I'm not sure how retirements work yet, the battle goals and the life goals are both replaced by these achievement progress bars. Like for example Brute must deal 50 melee damage to unlock this item or this much gold or the lightning symbol character, so when you're in a mission you will have enough incentive to put your whole party at risk for your own gains which is always a great time that everyone appreciates xD

The tutorial is hecka slow and I wish I could have skipped it (maybe I could and missed it xD), but I guess it's good for noobies that haven't played the board game.

I bought this game to play with a relative of mine, and for the most part, I've had a decent experience of it. That said, [b]I can't recommend this game, as it stands now, particularly if you're not familiar with Gloomhaven, or at the very least, some other DND-style tabletop RPG rulesets[/b]. This review is just as much a critique of that ruleset, as it is of the game itself.

[h1]What I liked[/h1]
The game has lots of interacting mechanics. Between the different classes (de)buffing, moving, setting up traps, dealing with obstacles and enemies, there are LOTS of ways to deal with challenges.

City Mechanics are quite enjoyable, and do a good job of world building, advancing questlines, as well as giving a chance to do things like buy items, level up, etc.

[h1]What I disliked[/h1]
Card Mechanics: Every card has a move action and attack action. At the beginning of every round, you pick two cards, and whichever you pick first is your initiative, which determines your turn order as well as your aggro level (monsters target the nearest PC, using initiative as a tiebreaker if needed). When your PC's turn comes up, you can perform the move portion of one of the cards you chose, and the attack action of the other card.

As a result, if monsters move around in a way you didn't expect, put up shields, etc, the actions you selected in the beginning of the round are quite possibly useless, or at the very least suboptimal. I can only assume this is why the developers included ""RESTART ROUND"" as a way to ""scum select"" your cards (you pick something, see what the enemies will do, then rewind to the beginning, and pick the cards that would actually work out well, given the enemies' rolls).

For both the move or attack action, you can choose to do a simple Move 2 or Attack 2 action that doesn't perform the action on the card (eg, you don't want to burn the card), but you still discard the cards you chose, which means there's a hard limit on the number of turns you can perform, before becoming exhausted. This is further exaggerated when you take lots of damage and have to start burning cards, further reducing the actions you can take.

When you eventually kill an enemy, the drop gold... [b]ON THEIR TILE[/b] meaning that for you to loot that gold, you'll have to end your character's turn [b]ON THAT TILE[/b], or you'll have to plan your card choices to select a Loot X action, which lets you loot gold from adjacent tiles up to X tiles away. Because of how cards work, choosing a Loot action means you forego a move or attack action for that character's turn, making you have to decide between looting gold and moving/attack and making progress in a dungeon. Given the difficulty in this game, you will almost always choose to move/attack rather than loot. Why do mercenaries not just loot all the gold in a dungeon when they're done? They're mercenaries, right? They fight for gold?

Speaking of difficulty, it seems like the difficulty of the game is WILDLY out of balance. In your campaign, you can have up to 4 mercenaries at a given time, but if you take any more than 2 to a dungeon, be prepared for odds of 4:1 or more. The only thing you get in exchange is more options (since you have more characters), but because of how convoluted the card mechanics are, trying to balance all the options in your mind is pretty much impossible (this is where multiplayer helps a bit, since you can bounce ideas off each other as you spend 10 minutes trying to plan your turns)..

So? Play with just 2 mercenaries right? What's the big deal? Well, your mercenaries have personal quests, and you're encouraged to pursue those goals in order to retire a mercenary, and unlock a new class. This adds an almost rogue-like feel to the game, as it feels almost like a ""meta"". I have yet to retire a character, so I don't know if it alleviates some of the power complaints I have, but I can only assume that you simply roll a new mercenary to join your leveled up merc. Now you have 1 character who is level 1 or 2, and another who is something like 8 or 9. Should I go back and grind the previous scenarios for gold, XP and perks before moving on to the new scenarios? I can't imagine it makes much of a difference, every turn in this game feels like a grind and a chore.

[b]All this adds up to disconnected choices lead to a feeling that you don't have good control over your characters, and what they do.[/b]

As of the date of this review, Gloomhaven is the top rated board game, but I'm left wondering why? It very well could be that playing the board game is more fun, in person, gathered around a table, watching your friends roll dice and get excited, all the while having drinks, but none of that seems to have survived the translation to a video game, where, at best, you're talking to people on voice chat, each in your own home, without any face to face contact.",1645375268,1645375268,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

2. The first mission is insanely long for a starter (hour and a half before we died), and, when combined with the excessive animation frames from everyone, I strongly suspect was designed this way to artificially inflate your starting playtime over the Steam 2 hour refund cap.

It was also a massive twenty-pound box that I had to haul back and forth to my friends' houses, and a constant battle to try to tame the ever-expanding tornado of tiles, cards, and minis. (I bought an $80 custom-made balsa wood organizer because I was completely over trying to keep track of everything.) But, at the end of the day, the setup was the only thing I could fault in Isaac Childres' brilliant magnum opus of a board game.

And now, here it is, on the computer. The game builds the scenarios for me, instead of me spending the better part of an hour making sure I have everything right before I start. And that's proven to be a problem, because now there's nothing stopping me from mainlining this game all day. (Maybe the setup time was there to save me from myself. Maybe Isaac always knew.)

This game is immense, crunchy, slow, and quite challenging. But it also asks constant questions of you as a player that makes that challenge compelling. Can you improvise in the face of rapidly changing tactical scenarios? (You can? Okay, but can you do it with one figurative hand tied behind your back for an extra reward?) What cool things can your character do out of the box, and how will you evolve them to fit your own strategy? How will your city of Gloomhaven change as you play? (Depending on the missions you do, this can go in very different directions). Can your mercenaries manage to work together while also low-key trying to one-up each other the entire time? (Double this if you're playing multiplayer.)

It constantly drip-feeds tantalizing new goals and unique new characters so that you always want to play more and do better, and every new unlock just drives the options that are open to you even deeper. Yes, it's very challenging, but rising to that challenge is very, very rewarding.

But there are a few shortcomings, and just like its progenitor, the digital rendition's flaws mostly have to do with how you interact with it. The UI is passable but takes a good bit of getting used to. Sometimes you do things that you didn't mean to do because the UI wasn't clear on what it was offering you. The animations look nice, but are slow, and they have a lot of lag time where most of the animation is done but the game hasn't moved on. (You can speed them up, but it's more of a ""turbo mode"" than a ""lag cancel"".) On my machine, the framerate dips once the maps get busy, and it's in a way that it probably wouldn't if the game were better optimized. And I've managed to freeze the game a few times so far doing silly stuff with mid-to-late-game Cragheart cards. (Though, as someone who had to adjudicate his friend's Cragheart throwing rocks literally everywhere... I get it.) Hopefully the secret characters don't cause more issues. 

My appreciation for all the work that's gone into this far outweighs my minor gripes. The dev team listened to players in Early Access and gave us what we wanted: the whole boardgame, dutifully rendered, mechanically complete, and with the option of multiplayer. It's incredible to see these plastic minis and square map tiles turned into full animated models and lush scenery by people who clearly have a great appreciation of the atmosphere and setting, and they deserve your support for spending so much time and effort translating this to the PC, and not cutting corners.

If you think you'll like this, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

If you are an RPG'er who has played D&D-style RPGs tabletop or PC-based, you will need to be especially careful in learning this game -- your experience with other games will mislead you. The flavor is similar, but the foundation is different.

Gloomhaven is all about tradeoffs. Everything you do has a downside. You have a limited number of cards and managing those cards is life-and-death. Literally: you are using up cards as you play each turn, restoring most (not all) when you rest. (And you do rest individually, not as a group.) Each turn you are one step closer to dying because you ""exhaust"" -- that is you finally run out of cards and when you do you die, no matter how many HP you have left. This has enormous ramifications!

There is no true downtime in a scenario, there is no running around to scoop up every coin on the floor, there is rarely a ""let's all rest up before entering the next room"" moment. If the scenario doesn't require you to kill every monster, you will probably not be able to kill every monster without exhausting. You learn to move and fight so that you're always closer to the end and pick up loot on the way. You need to be ruthlessly efficient.

Don't get me wrong, I love the game. (And I hate RTS's that force you to be efficient over everything else. You do have to be efficient here, but it's different from an RTS.) Just don't think that if you've played a ton of RPGs and think you've got this. The card system is foundational and different. There are no combat rolls, rather it has attack modifier decks this is NOT just a slight variation on dice rolls.

Tip: play the Guildmaster mode first, and don't be too proud to try it on Easy until you get a better understanding of the mechanics. The tabletop-equivalent Campaign has some early scenarios that are tough (because you're Level 1, under-equipped, and haven't earned Perks that modify your attack modifier deck) and so having a familiarity is good. Also, party roles are not the same as in most RPGs -- even though you have similar classes, you won't have a tank/healer combo that can slog through massive damage.

I'll have a hard time playing other RPGs now. Gloomhaven is amazing.

There's a huge variety of classes -- 17 including the original 6 and the unlockable 11 -- though some of the unlockable classes can be overpowered.",1644798745,1644798745,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

As a tactics game on the PC, it's distinctly below average. Difficulty scaling doesn't work effectively, playing with a 4 character party means you have dozens of enemies to contend with in the tiny, identikit, dull rooms. Play with 2 and it is a tighter game in some ways but you're missing out on the actual meat of the game - i.e. the numerous characters and their respective decks.

I like the deck building aspect to an extent, it's more fun than dice rolls, but the feature of having to burn attacks just to get to the next room really frustrates me. Every equivalent system using action points (there's dozens of examples, Gears of War and Mechanicus are some recent ones I really enjoyed) feel more elegant and less annoying.  

The general harshness of the hand management here feels extremely dated to me, especially with the attack modifiers that can negate all damage. A feature that simply doesn't respect my time. I can imagine this, around a table, with a group of friends cheering or moaning as you turn over a disappointing modifier, kiboshing all your plans. As a solo game on the PC, it just pours damp water on everything. It feels worse than a 99% miss on X-Com because the character's janky attack animation is still carried out, it just arbitrarily denies all damage. Sure you can slowly amend your deck so that this is less likely but this is a kind of crutch for the game to create tension and I find it arbitrary and, again, dull. My worst misses in X-Com were at least memorable. Here, it just extends fights which are already overly long. I mean, put it this way, I'm probably 10% into the game (at most) and I already dread three room missions. They're so long. Everytime you burst into the next room and there's another seven enemies, my heart just drops. All elite enemies are heavily shielded and so become damage sponges. This would be fine for the occasional boss but this is every single level, every single room, all the time, ad nauseum. It's an exercise in sheer endurance. I personally can't be bothered. Even if I tried some of the trickier classes with more fun stuff, it would just a different flavour of tedium.

A similarly boring mechanic is how prescribed looting is. Maybe this works in a tabletop game. It's part of the puzzle, end your turn on the bonus hex. Every single video game RPG I've played for almost 20 years has known this is garbage busywork. This is the main problem, if I bought the tabletop version in a gruellingly massive Kickstarter box it would be unique in my collection. It would stick out. In terms of computer games, there are probably tens of thousands of alternatives. All of them give you Gloomhaven's highs but none of the lows and none of the limitations.  Even if this is intended as an alternative to the tabletop version for people who don't have the storage space, I think it's totally missing the charm. It feels really unsophisticated. 

Mission after mission, you're just grinding through enemies to level up. There's story missions of a sort but the pure action focus of this makes it pretty hard to play a prolonged session. At least in something like Baldur's Gate when you're wandering the wilderness, you'll be suddenly ambushed and thrown into a fight. There's a slightly broader palette of interactions. Here, the map isn't something you really traverse it's just a very dry mission selection menu and every person you meet you just have to whack with a sword until they are dead.

This boils down to a few things:
* It's hard. This has more to do with the overall design of the game and how a bad luck set of draws can win or loose a scenario for you. But after the 5th time failing the same scenario, even on easy, it gets old.
* It has bugs. Sometimes you get an unlock and you never actually get the character. In gameplay, actions will freeze, longer than the normal ""it's thinking"" time and never come back.
* It's not as satisfying as the physical version. No shuffling in new cards. No opening boxes or envelopes. There are lots of little details they could have included here to make it feel more real, but choose not to.

With regards to the digital edition, it is a fantastic adaptation and cuts map-setup time which is tedious on the tabletop. There are a few bug / design issues in the adaptation, though. For example, there was a mission that would move your characters 1 space in a random direction at the end of your turn, and the win condition was an exit. I spent 6-7 turns sitting on the exit only to get moved away from the spot before the ""exit check"" was done. Pretty infuriating as I was 1 turn from running out of cards and losing.

A friend of mine was like, ""Hey, I want to run a campaign of this, you in?""  Now, Grover, he's a great friend of mine, a person I'd do nearly anything for, so I was like, ""Yeah, sure, okay.""  And I waited and waited for a sale and none came up, so I bought this full price.

Now, I was thinking, ""This is gonna be like poker night.  The cards are there as a vehicle for conversation, but they're secondary to just hanging out.  And we'll just hang out and I'll focus on that,"" but we got some friends together and... next thing i know, it's two+ hours later and I actually enjoyed the game.

I guess I should tell you about the game, shouldn't I?

Right.  It's got coop.  Now that instantly makes everything better, science fact.  Add coop, and a good game becomes a great game, it's that easy.

Anyway, instead of calling it a ""deck"" game, it's more like, ""You have a limited series of specialized attacks you need to carefully choose, and be ready to adapt your move for an evolving situation you're in.""

The key gimmick of the game is for each turn, you select two cards.  Each card has two different moves (and a plan B generic move) but in each given turn, you may only use the top move of one and the bottom move of the other.  If other people go before you and fail to achieve their goals, your plan may go awry.  Being able to improvise something useful with the shitty hand you gave yourself becomes part of the fun.

Anyway, in the end, I may try to make myself really sick so all I can do is stay in bed, and then I'll load this on my laptop and make my wife play it with me while we hide under the covers and wish the protesters and disease and general lunacy of the world goes away.

[/h1]
[b]Lacking Quality of Life / The worst tutorials I've seen in my gaming life[/b]
I played through the 10+ tutorials. This game is way too hard starting from just tutorials, brain squeezing and unforgiving yet lacking Quality of Life functions. It's like turn-based Darksouls. 
It would be a lot more friendly if it has some sort of rollback 1 turn like ""fight in tight spaces"". 
Even It's just a tutorial, more often than not I found myself picking wrong card or using the wrong side of the card. 
Usually, I literally don't know what to do which ended up in defeats and restart the tutorials. I never found myself redo game tutorials like more than 5 times each tutorials to get it right. Aren't that unfriendly tutorials ?
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is so relentlessly complex from the basics. You got a pool of cards > Select 2 cards to use this turn, Every cards has an initiative point. The first card ""Initiative point"" will decide whether you or enemy get to move first > Top or bottom (You can only select 1 top and 1 bottom from 2 cards in that turn ex.Card A top (Attack ability) + Card B bottom (Move ability) > If you are out of cards, you must do short rest (Randomize a card from discard pile and exhaust it or you could call it a burn and never usable again in the current scenario; Until you defeat all enemies)
[b]Frustration field[/b]
There are so many ways you could mess up. The undo button only cancel your plan not what already did. 1.Picking too low initiative point cards (Enemy attacking first in that turn) 2. Select useless cards : You lost that turn and possibly lost the game. Can't rollback 3.You played a top of the first card then realize that it's better to use the top of the other card. Can't rollback 4.After do everything right, you burn the wrong card. Can't rollback 5.You burn the right cards every turns, but you select a sub-optimal attack cards ex.Ranged attacks when you're at disadvantage. Ends up in 0 damage dealt to enemies. Stall the game will result in too many short rest which will make you burn too many cards and ran out of cards then it's game over.
The game is a digital version of a board game. I could understand it complexity. But with the game this complex, it's the real unforgiving game I have ever played in my life.

Aside from the godawful performance (even on lowest graphic settings) there are a lot of poor UX choices. The job of the controls in a turn-based game are not to frustrate the player but to get out of the way so that they can execute their plan.

List of UX crimes:
- Too many confirmation steps for simple things like burning or discarding cards and choosing actions. Confirmation should only be for irreversible actions, these things should simply have an undo button.
- Too few hotkeys (and hotkeys not labelled on buttons). Player should be able to select their actions on the keyboard - the only time a mouse should be required is for targeting cells on the board.
- No button to just ""skip second action"" - you have to select the action and then skip it.
- No indication of how enemy AI works, making it difficult to plan - this would obviously be part of the board game since you are in charge of executing enemy turns

Sadly though the underlying game seems like it would be deep, challenging and fun, this adaptation needs some serious attention to performance and UX before much time can be sunk into it.

Unfortunately, the PC game actually just makes me realize how the value of the board game was mostly that it was novel, and attempting to do something few other games had done before.  That never really meant it was actually good.  It just had a lot of things to explore, which were fun as card and minis and stuff.

None of this slow reveal is interesting as a PC game.  It's actually pretty underwhelming.  In the board game, the plot was absolutely impossible to follow, and mostly pointless anyway.  It didn't matter, except for a couple small decisions you might made.  And in the Gloomhaven way of consequences feeling entirely disconnected from the foreshadowing anyway, you might as well toss a coin for most decisions.

On the PC, you can retire a character and you might access a new one, but that's... actually more frustrating.  It destroys the sense that I'm building anything over time.  I'm not.  I'm leveling characters until they reset, to unlock other characters who will reset, so that I can try different characters in a plot that doesn't matter, and in a set of mechanics that's 50% strategy, and 50% luck.  Your best strategy will fall apart 50% of the time, and it's just frustration.

Play a faster-paced PC version of the board game reveals all of the ugly warts of the original design.  Not only is it a terribly frustrating, slow, tedius and boring PC game.  It's also made me hate the board game.  I can't bring myself to play either anymore.

1: Cards have multiple options. I'd prefer if the cards had one option, but there were more of them.
Have to pick one or the other sucks.. a lot.
2: Movement is only on select cards.
3: Burned cards. Some cards have cool abilities that require you to burn them, sounds cool and all but your card deck for each character is their time limit in each level. Run out and they die.
4: Looting. You don't get the gold you earn, unless a character ends their turn where a monster died, or uses a looting card, which often have to be burned. On top of that, you might not even have a looting card. It doesn't end there though, which ever character gets the gold, keeps the gold. The gold isn't shared between the party.
5: Healing/Difficulty. Baddies hit incredibly hard? Here's +2 HP and a wasted turn, take it or leave it. Oh, I almost forgot, burn a card for me too. ;)
6: Failing isn't fun. You can have the best party, a blessing or two, calculate every single turn perfectly, and still get stomped. This game has become try to loot as much gold before I die over and over again to purchase upgrades that might save my party from having to burn cards left and right to prevent taking ridiculous amounts of damage in the first room of many different dungeons. Lower difficulties don't help.
7: Enemies that summon enemies over and over again and again. You're going to run out of cards before you can kill the summoner a lot. It's RNG based, and too common for their turns to choose that option.

I never played, nor knew anything about, the board game.  I typically don't like card battler games, but this one seemed a bit different than those, so gave it a shot.  I'm glad I did, over 250 hours of fun so far!

This game isn't your typical easy mode game most gamers are used to.  You need to play the tutorial.  You need to hit ESC and read the How to Play section.  You then need to understand this isn't an action RPG where you mindlessly click stuff and still win.  This is not a RPG, this is a digital version of the highest ranked board game on boardgamegeek.  There's a bit of a learning curve.  You'll probably want to play a scenario or two then go watch videos of Mandatory Quest or JaugerPlays go through those same scenarios.  That way you understand you just don't sit there and tank mobs.  You understand you don't use all your burn cards in the first room.  You understand you actually *gasp* gotta put some thought into how to play, some thought into what cards to use and when to use them, and put some thought into not only what you're going to do in round 1 but also what you're going to do in round 2 and 3 while in round 1.  Then you have to be able not let your ego get in the way of adjusting your plans depending on what happens instead of trying to brute force your way through the scenario.  You aren't going to play this game like Skyrim and succeed.  Actual thought is required.

Once it all clicks though, man what an experience!  Just when you have it down, you unlock a new class and get to experience really a new way of playing because how each class plays and synergizes...or doesn't...with the others.  It's how the game stayed fresh and fun for me even after 250 hours of playing.  If you want easy mode, stick to Skyrim and the like.

Really happy with this purchase.

The only downside is the considerable delay in multiplayer. I am completely speculating here, but I'm thinking there are no servers; just peer to peer connections which makes for some loooooong delays in between turns and actions. Also, I really think there should be an undo action, especially in Guildmaster. Sometimes it's not altogether clear if an enemy is highlighted or an action is necessary and then you accidentally click ""skip movement"" or ""skip action"" and that's it. Obviously it's user error but in Guildmaster where you're trying to learn the game while playing, it feels a little too heavy of a punishment. In campaign mode, though, for sure. No mulligans.

The beast Tyrants bear will not always run towards the closest enemy and will indeed run into traps even though there is an alternate route.

Enemies take their turns one by one even when there are multiple of the same monsters. Flying enemies take a while to calculate their turn and this gets annoying when there are a lot of them. It should be faster or collectively if all they're doing is buffing themselves or in the case of oozes multiplying.

Playing this reminded me how many house rules we had to make the board game enjoyable and less tedious.

In particular I wish there was a way to undo more actions in case you accidentally select the wrong tile/card or got your character order mixed up. There is a restart round option but if you make some mistake towards the end of a round you get to replay the last 5-20 minutes. Or worse, if it's your last action the next round begins automatically and you have to restart the entire mission (some of which can take multiple hours). Those restarts can add up over the very lengthy campaign. Suffice it to say after just a few missions I realized there was no way I was going to enjoy putting in hundreds of hours to get through the campaign and uninstalled the game.

Also of note is that some features of the board game did not make it over to this digital version, in particular the random missions which are kind of required if you want to get the most out your characters. This should've been included or the campaign mission rewards re-balanced to take it's omission into account.

I never played the board game version so I came into this game due to the description... mostly ""Tactical-RPG and dungeon-crawling."" To find this is more of an odd board game.

I think a large reason I didn't like it is how movement is linked to your ability cards and an encounter never really ends, as you keep playing turns with cards to move to the next room. It just doesn't flow well. I think I would of like this game more if once you cleared a room, you just had some sort of rest + collect loot part, then off to the next battle. And definitely not tie movement with action cards the way its done. 

When I think of ""tabletop"" and ""Tactical-RPG and dungeon-crawling."" I think of D&D, Divinity Original sin, etc. Not some card/boardgame strategy... the two are very different. I mean, even the character creation at the beginning is very light. The ability, race and class are all tied into a single choice. So its not really character creation like I'm used to in real dungeon crawlers.

I don't think this game is bad, in the sense that, if you're into these kinds of board games, you'll love it. But It's really not as advertised.

On the first level of the campaign I was fighting 6 identical soldiers. The way this game works: the enemy does a randomly chosen action each turn with the same enemy types all doing the same move. For multiple turns all 6 soldiers repeatedly used a damage reduction move with no attack. Even though I was taking almost no damage, killing them was slow. After killing them and going through the rest of the stage, I was not clearing the level as fast as the game demands so my full health characters ran out of actions and died.

-I love strategy, fantasy, and D&D-like dungeon crawler games

It is a fraction of the cost of the board game and breathes life into the series with wonderful animation, sound effects, voices (a lovely narrator for scenario text, and fun battle noises for each character's abilities).

[i]However[/i], this recommendation does come with some caveats. In particular,

- The UI for some effects can be quite confusing, and it's really easy to accidentally make mistakes. There are all sorts of situations where you can make a mistake with no way to undo it, whereas in the physical board game you'd just quickly correct it and move on.

- The game doesn't give enough explanation or details for some things, especially in side scenarios with unusual rules. For example, in ""Well of the Unfortunate"", we completely lost track of who was carrying the key item. Many rules are obvious in the physical edition due to the design of the components, but are lost in translation to digital (e.g. the fact that the outcome of city/road events can depend on the composition of your party)

- A major upside of the digital edition is that you don't need to run the monster AI yourselves. However, to plan a turn in a difficult scenario correctly, you still need to know how the monsters are going to behave. The game doesn't give any help with this, so someone still probably needs to learn the AI rules and execute them in their head, in order to figure out how to plan the turn.

None of these are deal breakers, but I'd personally love to see another quality of life update focusing on some of these rules explanation type things.

What an amazing game!  The devs did everything I complained about previously, all the art is much much much much better. This is true the the 300.00 box but an amazing gaming adaptation.  Regarless of if you like tabletop or video games with any strategy RPG elements, this game is now for you!  What a great job! 




Updated Review 8 months later: The devs have deviated from what they promised, theyre making their own crap and coming up with timelines that are shameful, quite frankly, TTS will give you what these devs have failed to. I wish I could give the money these clowns got to the TTS modder instead. SHAME!




Original Review: 
Gloomhaven is a 30 lb Table-Top RPG in a box, which replaced all of my D&D sessions for the foreseeable future, running a four player campaign experience unlike no other. It is deep, well thought out, and incredible fun which exceeded all expectations at the $150.00 price tag. With Gloomhaven, I couldnt be more pleased, but this is not yet that.

An early start for a table top to PC port. If the finish it and do it right, this will serve as a great experience for those playing on PC. Its on its way, I cant wait to explore the world of Gloomhaven with my friends abroad who cant make it to the tabletop sessions!

**To those considering the Table-Top**

The tutorial they put in this PC version of the game truly does a great job of demoing the table top experience and clearly defines some of the rules that my group took a few sessions to really understand. Recently adding my girlfriend to the table top group, this tutorial truly taught her how to play and shortened the bell curve of the standard Table-Top experience. Truly well done! Id recommend it as a companion to the actual game, especially if you have a fluid group and rotate a few people in and out.",1574542386,1642278941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is quite a faithful adaptation. I'd go so far as to say it would be almost (see below) impossible to adapt the game more perfectly into video game format. I've played my fair share of TTG Gloomhaven, and this gives me the same feeling as that - without the overhead. 

The best thing about game version here is the complete lack of set up and take down. 

The worst thing about the game version is the complete lack of set up and take down. 

It's funny, when you remove the board game elements from a board game, you then present the player with nothing but the core mechanics. Luckily, Gloomhaven has always been known as having some of the strongest playing mechanics around. But the stuff outside of the dungeons feels a bit.... lacking. You do the typical betweeen-quest stuff like visit the merchant, experience encounters, etc. But it feels a bit hollow when you're not flipping through cards, jotting things down on paper, marking check boxes off. It's tidier, no doubt, but the lack of that tactile approach loses something.

But the time you gain from having everything automated is priceless. You can actually sit down to a game of Gloomhaven, and from before-quest tasks to after-quest rewards, it might take an hour or two. For the TTG, you're lucky to have everything set up within that time frame. Priceless. 

The game itself works exactly like the board game. I was a bit worried about how information would be presented. But the interface is very well done. There's very few times when I can't access any of the information I need easily and quickly. Choosing cards is exceptionally straightforward and easy. They've really done a wonderful job keeping all the information you need to make proper decisions at your fingertips. 

A few gripes:

- They really need to put in a ""take action back"" button or mechanic. You can start your round over, but that can be a lot when you're near the end of an entire round. There's a lot going on in a game. And sometimes, you simply move to the wrong hex or forget you wanted to use a potion. A simple back button would be nice.

- Providing pre-turn enemy targeting would be nice. Yes, it follows the standard rules. But in the TTG, you always know exactly whom the enemy will target (because you're controlling them). Here, you should know but sometimes they'll surprise you. Having some indicator would help.

- Some (really, some) of the inputs can be a bit wonky and took me a few dozen hours to get used to. That's not good. For example, knowing what exactly I'm skipping when I ""skip ability"". Or knowing that for certain abilities like stun, I have to select the enemy before the ability, and others I have to select the enemy after the ability. Otherwise, you'll simply find yourself attacking and not doing what you wanted to do (queue the 'back button' issue above). 

- They've input some but there's a lack of house rules overall. This is obvious. But if you like your Gloomhaven heavily modified, you might be disappointed this version is really designed to give you that ""vanilla"" experience. 

Lastly, a word needs to be mentioned for the dev team here. The game has had steady improvements since its full launch. Small quality of life fixes, small bug fixes (like missing sounds for some animations when creating a character), inclusion of simple house rules, more intuitive approach (the input complaint above was really bad at launch), etc. It's a game that feels like it gets better every time I boot it up. 

The long and the short of it is that if you like Gloomhaven, you'll love this just as much. There's actually very little different here except that it's far more accessible if time or mental housekeeping of a complex board game is a barrier for you. If you've never played, ask yourself a simple question: Do I like strategy games? If yes, buy it! At this price point, I guarantee you'll get your money's worth.

You'd lose the advantage of a single mind coordinating a strategy, but you gain in how deeply you'd get to learn that one character; their tricks and efficiencies.

And how different are the surprises? Something Gloomhaven does better than I expected; opening a door always comes with trepidation. What is behind that door? I know the possible monsters, already fought some of them, but somehow most quests have that ""OH DEAR LORD NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS!"" moment when the designers show what's possible with such simple monsters scripts.

I can only imagine playing the original board-game with three close friends, before the hype and sky-high ratings. They glance fearfully at each other and one asks ""should we open the door this turn?"" before pausing, no one speaking for many moments. Then they realize the brilliant, calculated experience they've bought into with dozens of secrets left to explore.

Jumping in years later, after the legacy of ""highest rated"" and the indelible influence on the hobby, I'm having a grand time with Gloomhaven.

I do think it's a good game however it (and the tabletop version) still have some serious balancing issues. Since this is already a top-rated game, I will focus on these issues, in hopes of the developers taking notice. It boils down to two aspects of one problem.. Imbalance:

1) The game is too easy. I am not particularly good or experienced in these types of games but any half-senible party composition will blow through (almost) all the missions with ease. 

2) Upgrades (except character leveling) are too slow. This includes late-game items, enchantments, and city level. The problem with this is by the time the game ends, you haven't unlocked almost any of these late-game perks, so you don't get to experience any of them. They should all be attainable *latest* at about 70% of the way through the story, so that you can actually see them and enjoy using them before the game ends.


But what would be the point of complaining without offering constructive suggestions... So I will point to games like divinity original sin (1 and 2). In those games the enemies (on hard) are much more deadly, and characters have access to far more spells and abilities. This combination requires the player to think a lot more, and get creative, to counter the inherent disadvantage. In comparison, while gloomhaven has plenty of characters and abilities, it immediately becomes clear what works and what doesn't, so most scenarios are just the same few moves repeated over and over... Not much thinking or strategy needed to win. 

And yes of course the players themselves can agree to impose arbitrary restrictions on themselves, but making the game challenging is the job of the developers, not players

So how would I improve this game? Rebalance the monster strength, as well as cards (and characters) so that all are useful and a player is required to swap between them to succeed. And then make items, enchantments and town levels much easier to obtain so that we actually get to even see them before the game ends

The digital version also plays a little differently. In person, we all had our heroes and we stuck with the one character. We didn't play anyone else until we retired a merc. Now, much of the gameplay comes from picking the right heroes for a given mission. It's very enjoyable. 

Lastly, the replay value is so high. Now that I've retired a few mercenaries, all I want to do is make a new file and build them completely differently.

Each round is like a changing puzzle eating away at our mercenaries stamina often causing our friends to choose between retreating to avoid confrontation, placing themselves in harms way to protect other allies that are slower and weaker or burning cards to do special moves that reduces our overall deck size each time we rest. 

Stamina, or Endurance, in this game, is determined by your hand size. Which only varies per character, and not by level or perks, etc. Each card in your hand has a TOP action of either; Basic attack - melee range - 2 damage; or whatever flavor text is written in the top box, and a BOTTOM action of either; Basic move 2 hexes; or whatever flavor text is written in the bottom box. The center of the card contains a number, which determines its INITIATIVE (Speed in which it can be played during a round from 1 [the fastest] to 99 [the slowest/latest] in a round. 
You select 2 cards which you would like to use during your turn, remembering to consider that you may OR MAY NOT get to act before your opponents, or allies, and select one of the initiative numbers as your speed within the round. During your turn, you choose 1 top action to do, and 1 bottom action to do, from the two cards you chose for the round.
Some flavor text actions require the card to be LOST after using which will mean it is not in your discard pile when resting.

After 3-5 rounds you will run out of cards and need to determine how to get your cards back into your hand. 
A, Short Rest - Shuffle the discard and pick one at random to LOSE or BURN. If you REALLY don't want to lose said card, you may take 1 physical point of damage to draw a second card that you MUST lose. Or,
B, Long Rest - You take the initiative of 99, going last in the round, and during your turn; you may CHOOSE which card from your discard pile you wish to lose; you may recover up to 2 health points, not to exceed maximum; and you may REFRESH all items that can get refreshed. [All other single use items are only for each scenario. Meaning you get your potions and items back to use after the scenario is over].

Your attack modifier deck starts with 20 cards consisting of 1 miss, 1 critical double damage, 1 -2 damage, 1 +2 damage, 5 -1 damage, 5 +1 damage and 6 0 change damage cards. These cards in your deck change as you receive perks like adding more damage or status effects to removing cards.

Each character gets their very own unique twist too and I haven't met anyone that hasn't managed to find a few favourites. This community is growing fast, and I am so excited that the accessibility AND THE DOWNTIME OF SETUP *Extreeemely long face*, have made this game so much more fun and available for people to enjoy.

Edit:

Ok so after playing to my first retirement I find out that the retirement part is not fully in the digital version making the campaign feel horribly flat.

You CANNOT enchant stuff after retirement, so gathering gold is pointless.
What makes it even worse, enchantments DO NOT carry over between class plays, which makes them even more useless, so spend 400 gold on a really useful upgrade? Nah-ah it's gone the next time you pick up that class.

I was afraid that moving from the tabletop would miss stuff like this. There is a lot of good stuff here but they moved too far away from the open-ended and flexible tabletop feel too much and made bad design decisions. There are also other thing like the confirm/undo situation that can in theory make you fail a run if you click a wrong card at a crucial moment with out being able to revert your decision. Maybe I'll hope Frosthaven gets implemented better? 

Old review:
Ok, so bear with me here. I upvote this for selfish reasons. Upvotes = more hype and I think this game needs a lot more development time and with luck, it'll one day be complete if people keep buying it! Preferably before Frosthaven comes out.

Devs; you do realize you will have to add all the Frosthaven stuff right? Oh and the JotL classes! No pressure! :)

Guildmaster and Campaign is huge.

For beginners: start with Brute and Scoundrel and play Guildmaster with these two, after completing the tutorials. When you have enough maturity in mechanics, you can start thinking about adding more to your party. Remember, game scale with your party size. I am not sure it is well balanced yet.

What it needs:
- Screen Panning
- Fix Target Confirmation numbers (UI only) when using a buff
- Increase the loot per enemy, perhaps +3, not much.

Gloomhaven is in this odd situation where it is so notorious that it sells incredibly well just because of its reputation in spite of some issues. And to be sure it is a good game that is well-designed... for a specific group of people. That group of people being gamers who like very very technical and very gamey games where the rules aren't always intuitive or make sense flavour-wise (mercs cannot share gold, exhaustion mechanics, card burn, etc.). 

Example: Your characters cannot stop to pick up gold lying on the ground unless they end their turn on it or use a skill. All the gold which is not picked up at the end of the mission after you beat all the monsters is lost. It's gamification for the sake of crunch. It's not really an rpg, it's a board game with elements vaguely familiar to RPG gamers.

Folks who'd enjoy this game may have probably have played a lot of eurogames and ameritrash board games. If you're one of those gamers you probably already know you want Gloomhaven. I do, and I intend to keep playing it.

As for everyone else, you may want to reconsider. The game is just too finicky. Technical. Plain difficult. There's a huge number of finicky rules to familiarise yourself with. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for everyone as I know most people would find it just too tedious. The gaming community may scoff at the term ""accessible"" and think of unskilled game journalists, but this is one example where even most seasoned Steam gamers may find it too challenging. But if you know you can handle that level of technical gameplay, you'll likely get the hang of it.",1640865185,1641267929,False,98,10,0.584001362323760986,7,True,False,False

The game does have it's fair share of bugs and crashes how ever it is very easy to get back into the game due to it auto saving at the start of every round.

Overall I highly recommend this game if you have someone to play it with, but maybe not if you're playing alone.",1641076725,1641076725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just played a scenario w/ Brute in which his attack deck has a 14 to 5 split of positive vs negative modifiers. 8 straight disadvantage pulls included a negative modifier of the 2 pulled. I also pull my 0x modifier at least 4x more often than my 2x modifier, of which there is only one each. Even when I bless, I STILL don't see them come out.     

When I was playing the initial beta, I noticed some ""skewed"" deck pulls, but not to this level. Since the official campaign has been released, its been awful and VERY noticeable, which is what the modifier deck should never be. Noticeably shitty pulls for your characters ALL the time.

Pros: 
- This is one of the most difficult games to put on the table (yes, even for a single player session).  The digital version alleviates the complex component setup and triage, as well as skipping the the very high price point of its physical counterpart.
- As elegant as the rules are, it's easy to miss interpret them. The digital version will keep you on the right path.
- At the time of this writing, the game is still raking as the #1 BGG game of all time. While we should take the listing with a grain of salt, it still suggest this is one of the top tier board game experiences you can find.

Cons: 
- I find the game to be punishingly difficult, even on easy setting. You rarely survive a few strokes of bad luck.
- You can make mistakes with the game's interface and end up doing all kinds of missplays. It is not constant and the game relies on you to not screw things up, but a real undo button would have been nice.

And just like the board game, this is basically a turn-based tactical combat game, with a layer of scenario-based RPG on top of it. And the same complexity of combat is present here as well - select one of available classes (more to unlock), buy and equip items (more to unlock), and with a team of 2-4 characters start a scenario (more to unlock) with a hand full of cards unique for selected classes (yep, more to unlock). That means every action is unique and needs to be carefully considered, since it usually won't be available again anytime soon. The tactical aspect it provides is enormous and can't be overstated.

Some more notes about the digital version:
- There are bugs. Personally I'd say not a great deal of them though; most I saw worked in my favor, saving my characters from additional damage, although one nearly caused me to fail a scenario.
- For those coming from the board game: Rules for monsters seem.. wrong at times. I had situations where ranged attackers didn't move, even though they could and they could find a spot to attack from (perhaps this was a bug as well, not intended behavior)
- Also, those ranged monsters... sometimes when there are many monsters on the board, they take really long time to make their move (as in: thinking about what to do, not actually doing it - there's a button to speed up actual animations).
- There are some design differences as compared to the board game - e.g. when retiring there's no option to sell items or use gold; also there are enchantment points, which limit how many cards a class can have enchanted (these can be increased by progressing the story) and there is a limit of consumables a character can equip (this can be increased by levelling up).",1640646632,1640646632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a very good board game that everyone you know is playing for a reason, so this is your big chance to get into it, and even invite up to 3 remote friends if you want the true experience.

If you haven't played it before, it's one of those games that is ""simple to learn, but deceptively complex"".  Your characters (""mercenaries"") are represented by a small deck of cards that you build, each with two actions on them and an initiative order; you'll select two per turn and they will determine when you go and what you do.  You can reshuffle your discarded cards back into the deck by resting, but every time you rest you burn a card.  Burn to less than two and your character is exhausted and out.  This one mechanic is the core of Gloomhaven and makes for some great tactical gameplay.

You'll be familiar with the rest of it if you've played games like HeroQuest and Warhammer Quest.  The dungeons are pre-constructed like HeroQuest, and there is a campaign line with side quests.  The town has services that grow as it gains prosperity via your adventures.  Your characters level up and eventually are forced into retirement by their retirement goals, which further unlocks new character classes and other side quests.  You'll get encounters in the city and on the road, and sometimes you will get encounters that follow up on other encounters you had, or even encounters with heroes that retired.

If you're a cheap bastard like I am, this game also has the advantage of being $35, which even at four copies is way less than the $200 the physical board game will run you.

Let's put this in scope using another games mechanics. D&D. Every action gives you one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion will kill you in 9 points. Great. I have like, 24 actions if I rest and maximize. So in 2 minutes of fighting, every fighter would lay down exhausted. That's what this game implies. Fighting for 2 minutes will kill you.

In just about every other system I've used, in both TTRPG and video games, movement is a discrete resource from combat actions. But here, they're muddled in an extremely counter-intuitive way. Each card has two different actions you can take, roughly divided between combat and movement/support. But not every card has a movement action, so if you don't have the right card available, you literally cannot move. Maybe that's understandable if they're trying to introduce a fatigue mechanic into an RPG, but for me, those systems just don't work together. The genre is called fantasy... it's meant to be unrealistic.

In addition, combat actions are highly constrained, in that each time you refresh your card pool, one is removed entirely. To make matters worse, you MUST choose two cards each round, whether you use them or not. So there's a hard timer on every encounter, where if you do not quickly dispose of enemies and get behind the card curve, you're screwed. Even on lower difficulties, you must absolutely min-max each action to complete the encounter successfully. 

I have no idea what kind of bean-counting, theorycrafting, spreadsheet warrior masochist would enjoy this gameplay, but it definitely isn't for me. Refunded.",1640188328,1640188328,False,1,1,0.45165562629699707,0,True,False,False

But this implementation, particularly the interface, is very disappointing. Everything seems designed to delay, confuse, and frustrate. The pathing your characters take is abominable - it usually puts them on a path through a trap, and what's worse, it's hard to tell sometimes what path the AI is giving you. Sometimes the AI will set a path through a trap, and your attempt to undo this will actually have you just wander around uselesly for a turn. The animations are slow and mediocre. It's really hard to mouse over creatures and get their stats - you'll spend a long time mousing around. The terrain can be unclear, particularly on scenarios with a lot of rubble, leaving you sometimes discover difficult terrain leaving you one hex short of being able to attack. Perhaps worst of all, there is no undo button, so if you move and find yourself out of range, you can't go back, which feels completely and unnecessarily harsh in a way the tabletop game isn't.

After playing the campaign for ~15 scenario, I've decided to change POSITIVE review to NEGATIVE review.

The game suffers from wide range of usability issues that make the game irritating to play.

* Undo-function is lacking. It's needlessly restricted. You can't undo some actions even if they had no effect or gave you any new information. This is especially annoying when you skip activating abilities or activate your cards in wrong order (move, and then realize you used the wrong card to move). While Gloomhaven is a tough game, there's no need for an additional UI puzzle on top of a complex game.
* Confusing campaign. In the original board game, scenarios are numbered. They are also referenced in the story and rules text by their numbers. In the digital version, it is impossible to keep up with the story line since these references no longer are visible. I have no idea which scenario belongs to which story line, and whether I'm making an exclusive choice or not. For an example, I have no idea how to side with/oppose that one particular Necromancer.
* Enhancements are not permanent. When you retire your character, they lose all the enhancements. There is now an option to make them permanent, but it requires you to restart the campaign.
* Line-of-Sight. When planning your ranged attacks, it requires extensive knowledge about how LOS rules work. There is no visual indication, and in conjunction with the lacking undo-features, you can seriously mess up with your ranged attacks.
* Visibility of state. After 15 scenarios, I've been poisoned and immobilized several times. The problem is that their indicators are small and easy to miss. So far, I have not once noticed that my character is immobilized when I've been picking cards. There should be a visible indicator when picking up cards that your character is current immobilized, and can not move. Same issue with poison, although healing happens less often.
* Lack of information. During several different states when player is forced to make a choice, they are not provided with enough information. At times the UI becomes modal, and doesn't allow you to inspect the state of the board/cards before making the choice. In a game as complex as Gloomhaven, you need to be able to inspect all aspects of the game state, at all times.

TL;DR: Digital version of this game does not improve the original game, but instead makes playing it a bit more arduous and error-prone. It does allow you to play remotely with your friends, and is more convenient to set up, but in my case the the game fails to leverage benefits of being digital, and is needlessly restrictive instead.

[h1]RELEASE REVIEW[/h1]

It's Gloomhaven. It seems to be quite good conversion of the boardgame. Some minor usability issues are still present, but if you are a veteran Gloomhaven player, you should be just fine. Be aware that ENHANCEMENTS ARE NOT PERMANENT! When you make a new character, they will have 0 enhancements. This is one major deviation from the board game, and for me it might be a deal-breaker.

For a novice player, this game will be very challenging, and there will be plenty of things to learn through mistakes. If you don't like losing, this is not your game.

Changing from NEGATIVE to POSITIVE since they finally added the Campaign mode.

[h1]Early Access review[/h1]
The game is unfinished and is missing many crucial features. It is riddled with bugs and performance issues. I would recommend it only to most fanatical fans of the board game, and those who wish to support its development. Others, wait out until it's updated.

The game is very light on content, missing the main campaign, perks, most classes (only 4 out of 17 are there!), most items, road/city events, most monsters, personal goals, battle goals... 

The Adventure Mode is bad. It is nothing more than a series of randomly generated scenarios.

Battle Goals and Personal Goals are missing, removing some tension from the combat.

Random Scenarios are the only option, and they quickly become boring.

Usability problems are abundant. You end up failing scenarios due to misclicks. Cards can be hard to read, icons are diminutive and unclear.

This should not be sold for $25, it should have stayed a closed beta that it is.

My high play time is due to hanging out at Discord while reporting bugs and/or trying to figure out how to solve problems.",1564462700,1640101560,False,0,0,0.534575521945953369,5,True,False,False

What I didn't expect was the long loading times and god awful music. Playing out the same fight over and over again to what sounds like a 15 second loop of music is torture. Losing and then waiting and waiting and waiting to restart the level in a game that's based on a board game is unforgivable. It's not like we're loading a cutting edge FPS here.

I get the impression all the developer's effort was put into faithfully simulating the tabletop rules and making cool graphics. No thought seems to be given to the actual experience of playing the resulting product. Nobody was there to take a step back and say, ""Yes, that animation looks very cool. However, it takes 5 seconds, and this level has 5 of those monsters in the same room. When this card is drawn, they'll all perform that animation twice. Players probably won't want to watch that animation over and over for 50 seconds straight.""

The more I play the game, the more I'm convinced nobody is doing quality control.

Played through all the tutorials and understood  the basic mechanics.

First mission a few times was a disaster as the mechanics of the card burning mechanics become REALLY apparent - way less turns to make it through the scenario.  Tried it on the next levels down in difficulty.  Added a third party member and that was a huge mistake.  

Read a bunch of tips online and in the steam page but the movement vs attack just isnt meshing for me.

I can see the appeal of this game to people but i feel like you would need to plan out the dungeon run ahead of time and try to map every card's use in a balance of getting to the enemies before you exhaust all cards - could be a skin of the teeth fun thing for some but not my cup of tea.

3- Punishment for replaying the round! Easiest i can think of, just decrease all initiatives by 10 per round consecutively. Then when u dont replay a round, it sets back to 0.

I had the original Hero Quest, went from that to Dragon Strike, and then got a boxed set of AD&D 2nd Ed.  I was a big tabletop RPG fan up through the 1st edition of Pathfinder, dabbling in 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions of DnD as well.  When I finally got a chance to buy a copy of Gloomhaven, the tabletop version, I was in a position where I had no one to play with, so I played solo.  For hours and hours and hours, with a dedicated room in my apartment for the game, which stayed put up for literally a year.  When I finally found two like-minded souls who also had copious amounts of free time and no life, I bought a second copy of the physical board game, and we must have put over 100 hours into it before life drove us all apart again.  I can confidently say that I have never had more fun gaming in any form.  

I bought this game back in early 2020 when it was still being developed.  I played around on it for a while, but was only really interested in the campaign, so I sat on it and waited.  Last month the campaign was finally released, and I have played almost exclusively Gloomhaven ever since.  While I do not think that the digital version of this game can top the fun I had sitting in a room with two friends, drinking beer and slaying monsters into the wee hours of the morning, the digital version of the game is SO much better than playing the game solo, and I had a blast playing it by myself.

The animation quality is pretty solid.  Would prefer to see specific animations for specific abilities, but it is a small nitpick.  I do like the visuals of the various summons and characters.  Really breathes life into the game.  And the narration is top notch.  I don't think I've ever played a game with such high quality narration, considering that they got one guy to do  everything.  He does a fantastic job with the various accents and voices.  Music quality adds a lot of atmosphere to the game

And this game takes the most frustrating parts of the board game and removes them.  The computer controls the monster AI.  It keeps track of things like XP, hp, status effects, elements, etc.  The developers brought the tiles to life, and set-up is obviously non-existent.  Neither do you have to worry about storage.  It's a freakin' video game.

There have been some issues where a silly mistake on my part, some stupid oversight that at the table we'd all accept wasn't intentional and allow a redo or quick fix, just isn't feasible on a computer.  I also think that a few of the missions are broken for the PC, like the mission with the wind that blows you around not waking up the drakes the way it seems to imply, or the mission where you have to protect the tree where I inadvertently destroyed it as if it were just some normal barrier.  My latest bug I've come across is trying to kill the Prime Demon in his lair and after too many demons are spawned I can't seem to target anything with attacks and the Prime Demon himself seems bugged out and won't move to attack either.

Other issues with the game include a pretty poor UI, where sometimes you are prevented from performing some action, and the game isn't great about telling you why, or you have to make a selection, and you're not sure why.  There have been times when I've not wanted to use an attack, for example, because no enemy is within range, and I'll accidentally click the top part of a card that burns upon use, and I'll lose that card completely to no effect when all I meant to do is pass that action.  The game can also get laggy when there are too many monsters on the board, which can happen in several quests where monsters spawn without end.

Still, I see myself playing this all the way to the end of the campaign, as far as the game will allow me to go.  Since I can't find locals to commit to a year of their life around a table playing the same board game, this is the next best thing.

Fans of the board game will love the digital version. 
Fans of tactics games will love this digital version of the greatest tactical board game of all time.

I haven't played multi-player at all, but I have to assume that the multi-player version of the game is even better than the loser loner version.

EDIT: 
After playing for several weeks, an hour or so a day, I can say that the game still holds up.  I do have several issues that I hope to see fixed.

One of the classes has an ability to mark enemies to generate effects.  Several of the effects are things that trigger when the enemy dies, such as moving adjacent enemies or doing damage to adjacent enemies.  I've noticed in several cases that these effects are not triggering, and I can't figure out why.  When you have scenarios that you can barely win that rely on certain things happening, and then those things don't happen, and you can't understand why they aren't happening, it is a real downer.  I've reloaded the level, I've restarted the round, I've carefully gone over the card and even searched online for rule clarifications, but I am convinced that this is a bug in the game.

And that really  is the most annoying part: that lack of understanding what is happening.  Sometimes abilities will trigger and I'm not sure what is triggering, and so I don't know who I should target with it.  Or, in my haste, I'll click the wrong button and accidentally burn a card when all I wanted was to pass my action.  Or I'll have issues with special scenario rules that I don't understand and aren't clearly explained.  Or I'll have issues targeting.  Or I'll try to hover over a space to get information about it, but there are now so many monsters and gold piles that I can't tell what is what.

The game is still great, but I do expect to see the developers work out these bugs, fix the UI a bit, and streamline things, especially if they're intending to eventually come out with either the prequel or sequel adaptations.  Fix the mess you have now before releasing something else.  If it is fixed, I'll buy future releases, and even additional add-ons to this game.  If it isn't, I'll keep enjoying the game for what it is and then move on.",1637771672,1639760479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI is confusing trash.

Updated review:

Better than Burger King.  It's the proper board game, just online with friends instead of at a table.  The UI takes some getting used to, and the tool-tip system is less than stellar, leaving a lot of information to be desired.

Still awkward that you have to reference your real life manual in a game with tooltips that should easily be able to tell you what's going on.

Worth getting if you like the board game IRL.

Nevertheless I really liked the game mechanics and the idea of very very long campaign which one can progress with varying groups (both in-game and real persons) over the time.

I'm usually quite disappointed with digital adaptations but this time I decided to hop in in early stages of development. One big supporting feature (digital-wise) in Gloomhaven is that you can play it solo or with friends (or soon to be friends) and you don't play against other people. Ok... we are talking about mercenaries but still it is in everyone's interest to beat scenarios together. 

Back in the 2019 there was only partial guild master path with limited array of classes but I decided to look what digital Gloomhaven had to offer anyway. Played maybe 20 hours back then and saw that this game has potential and started the long wait for full campaign release...

Fast forward to autumn 2021, campaign mode is finally released! Been playing with one friend (2 merc and 4 merc parties) since then for ~50 hours and it has been a blast. Many times it has seemed that our mercenaries are again facing defeat but like hanging on a thread, managed to turn table into victory. And we are playing it on ""normal"" difficulty level so there definitely are suitable challenges for everyone. 

Yes, there are still some annoyances and minor bugs in game but in general 1.0 version was really stable and decent release. 

Personally my biggest ""issue"" is with the graphics in general. Why bother with fancy 3D which sets some limits on you hardware. Don't get me wrong... they're not bad, just bit pointless imho. I'd certainly be happy with more board game like graphics which could be run basically on any PC there is out there.

Still I give this title 9/10. It is really good game and really good adaptation.

Overall I strongly recommend digital Gloomhaven to anyone who...

First: This is a great game that will bring you many many hours: Huge campaign mode, a big amount of unlockable classes and, then, you have multiplayer so if you like it, it will make every penny worth. 
The gameplay is SOLID. Every class adds something to the table. Every item counts. Good planning and strategy is greatly rewarded, so if you are a big fan of turn based combat, this is your game.
One warning though: The game is HARD. There are no easy wins. You will loose every mission several times before winning them, and the win will be a close one. You will fight constantly against the limited turns due to exhaustion cards and also running on the board to find the last room and be there in good condition.

This is a fantastic digital board game implementation that other companies should be looking to emulate. 

Let's start with the Pros: 
The animations, art work, and voice acting are top notch and really add to the immersion of the game. The fact that there is so much content to work towards makes the campaigns feel rewarding with your character progression and overall content progression as the hidden character unlocks with your career goals add something new to look forward to. The classes are each unique in their play styles and synergies to the team. Playing multiplayer is easy to bring friends into your campaign and assign control of a character. The decision points you have to make really can put you in the tank and you aren't able to just rush in and steam roll many of the scenarios without a real plan of action. Having battle goals that are hidden for each hero, which can sometimes be contradictory to what other players are working towards, add an element of fun and surprise.

Negatives: 
While there aren't many negatives some would be the lack of an undo after certain actions are selected and a restart the round option in multiplayer if you make a misclick and select your cards in the wrong order.

I've currently put several hours in solo and in multiplayer with friends 2 of them being veterans of the board game and haven't even scratched the surface.

  This is a faithful and 99% complete transferal of the Gloomhaven board game to digital (the only board game piece missing right now is the random dungeon deck.)

I've played a good 200 hours of the board game Gloomhaven and about the same on the digital side, running both a solo party and an online co-op, both have been incredible fun.

As a longtime DnD player, having a quick setup dungeon crawler with simple mechanics that someone could learn without the hours that it can take to teach them how to play DnD would be a godsend. Unfortunately, this is not that game. This is not so much because it is complicated or hard to set up. Rather, the  exhaustion mechanic makes game play very unrealistic and imbues the play with an inauthentic sense of urgency. Let me provide you with an example of this mechanic in a normal DnD game:

The game master says, ""You and your party find yourselves at the entrance to an ancient underground temple. Before you is a long straight pathway that is difficult to see for all of the overgrowth that obscures it. Fortunately, the more perceptive among you notice the path that slowly slopes down below the surface. As you descend the first 50 feet, you light your torches and prepare to enter the darkness. Those of you with low light vision notice that there is a dim light at the end of this tunnel. It appears to be approximately 150 yards away. About fifty yards in you start to feel a bit tired (OOG: as though you've had to turn in cards that were worthless to you while making the excruciatingly long hike--about the length of one and one half football fields). About two-thirds of the way, you are getting so tired, you wonder if you will be able to make it to the end of the tunnel. You look back toward the entrance. It appears that you are much closer to the light than the entrance. You have hope that you will be able to bear the excruciatingly difficult walk down a perfectly smooth path that has been made ever so slightly easier by the barely noticeable downward slope. As you near the light at the end of the tunnel, which you can now tell is a lit torch hung on the wall, you are shaking from all of the walking across easy terrain for more than three minutes straight. It's unbearable. Before any of you can reach the torch, you all die from exhaustion.""

There's a reason that Gloomhaven dungeons are only a few rooms deep. This isn't really a dungeon crawler. It's more like being forced to walk through rooms with floors of quicksand and wasting ability cards just to get to the creatures you would have wanted to use those cards on. Don't get me wrong, the game is playable and winnable. It's not all that difficult to play, either. That said, this game is not for me or, likely, anyone who wants a game that holds up to some reasonable degree of scrutiny. The exhaustion mechanic in this game is meme worthy. Granted, all games (even DnD) have unrealistic mechanics (e.g., the hit point system). However, there's forgivable mechanic fudging that enhances playability and fun, and then there is fudging that does neither of these things. In my estimation, the Gloomhaven mechanics belong to the latter.",1639012853,1639013437,False,2,0,0.512658238410949707,0,True,False,False

I've been busy with the 1st scenario for quite a while until I basically gave up and dropped the difficult to easy for that one just to get past it, after that I continued playing on normal for a while but it was way too easy, now I'm continuing on hard which still seems chill but not tooooo easy, might try insane soon.

Just don't get discouraged if you die every time in the first scenario, I believe it's just not properly balanced. The game allows to change the difficulty of the campaign after every quest, so just do the first on easy and save yourself like 10 hours of a headache trying to figure out what you're doing wrong. That, or do it with just 2 characters (which makes it a walkover as well) and pick up two more chars before you start the 2nd mission.

You will like this if you enjoy:
+The board game but want to play multiple parties/characters, can't leave it set up, or want to play with friends from all over.
+Thinky, highly strategic/tactical turn based combat
+Games that offer a challenge
+Character progression and unique play styles between classes
+A sprinkle of rpg elements (campaign narrative, occasional random events, character items)
+Loads of content to explore (tons of classes, monster types, campaign scenarios)

You may not enjoy this game if you want:
-Simpler gameplay where each character has just a few spell options that you click
-A deep story driven rpg with lots of dialog options and character storylines
-Something to pick up and breeze through

This game is all about a constant stream of delightfully agonizing decisions and you finding tactical efficiency at every turn. It's definitely not too random or hard once you get the gameflow and your character down but that does take investment.

Recommended Changes:

*There is an ""undo round"" button in the menu options which is great. I feel like if no new info is revealed though (like combat modifiers) then you should just be able to undo anything. Maybe I changed my mind on the Move I just played or I played the wrong one. Why not be able to undo that?

* During early plays I sometimes missed what the UI wanted from me for Push and Pull effects. 

*Animations can be sped up with the button bottom left which is awesome. I totally missed this though for a while so you might want to throw it in the pop ups when you first play. The first place I looked was settings.",1638680119,1638926628,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, given its massive scope and ambitions, the only thing that seems unlikely is that you will walk away from your experience with an ambivalent opinion about the game.
I have been playing CRPG's and board games my entire life (I am 59 now).
I was impressed by the accolades Gloomhaven received when it was first published as a board game, bought a copy and tried it out with some old friends.
It was a daunting task, and after playing through the first three or four core scenarios, put it  aside,  impressed by its scope and production values, but feeling the game just required too much effort to really enjoy.
I picked up the video game version with the memory of that earlier board game experience still echoing in my head.
After playing the digital version for about 25 hours, my impressions are:
-I personally prefer the video game for all the reasons people have already mentioned, but most especially:
==>the degree to which the game's core mechanics have been automated and streamlined through the use of a CPU.  Many questions/uncertainties/disagreements we had about things in the board game rules relating to enemy AI, line of sight/movement, initiative, combat resolution, etc. etc. etc. are all rendered effectively moot by making the CPU the de facto rule book judge. For me, this is enormously helpful and removes a lot of the frustrations I had playing the board game.
-While I recognize not every Gloomhaven board game fan agrees with this assertion, [this] digital version remains (for me) amazingly faithful to the board game.  That such a complex and ambitious game could be ported so successfully to a digital format reflects the passion and dedication of many people, and in my view the digital game designers have succeeded spectacularly.
-Considering its size/scale, I regard the price of the digital version as a bargain.
-MAKE NO MISTAKE: As many have alluded, both the board game and digital versions of Gloomhaven can be punishingly difficult, and unless you have some idea of what you are getting into beforehand, there is a good chance  you will find it unfamiliar, overwhelming and stressful when you first play it, *especially* if you start off with the expectation that you will be able to just dive right in and 'figure it out as you go.' RPG's have always been my favorite gaming genre, and I have played hundreds (thousands?) of CRPG's/dungeon crawlers over the course of my life. Even so, I was a bit bewildered by Gloomhaven when I first started playing it. 

TL/DR version: Gloomhaven the digital version is an admirably faithful adaption of its famous board game inspiration.

It has [b] a lot [/b] of pros and cons when compared to the board-game, so lets address them.

[u] Pros: [/u] - You don't have to book keep, nor do you have to set every scenario and monster, saving you lots of time.
- You don't have to manage monsters' or summons' actions, nor do you have to check initiatives constantly, saving you lots of time.
- You have an UI, and I cannot stress enough how often this reminded me of items, active abilities, or rules that I would just completely forgot in physical when I was tracking, basically, everything.
- Guildmaster, a completely new ""game mode"", not particularly my cup of tea, but hey, you might like it.
- Higher difficulty settings, nice for experienced players, or people that hate themselves.
- Did I say that you save [b] lots of time [/b] ?

[u] Cons: [/u] - It is a coded game, so bugs are a thing. Currently I've encountered [i] so many of them. [/i] But devs are aware of them, and constantly patching, so I wouldn't believe this's going to be so for long. (Also join the game's Discord, awesome community and you can get info on what to expect next)
- Being a rule heavy game will make it so you will not love every single rule, and in the board-game version you can bend rules to your liking. Summons not moving when there's no target available, enhancements being [b] SO [/b] expensive and not being carried up between same-class characters (currently being worked on by devs tho), and I could go on.
- There're scenarios that aren't in the game yet, and at the moment aren't planned to, and those are ones of the most fun in my opinion. Solo scenarios were a [i] fantastic [/i] thing in physical.

It is not a dungeon crawl, it is just a puzzle game with a hard pass or fail outcome. What i mean by this, is that it's not about surviving, its just about solving the puzzle before you run out of cards. The hardest encounter is the first one, so there's the challenge right there. Beat the first encounter, which is too hard, and you've beaten the most challenging part of the game. Congratulations, now do that over and over again with less difficulty from here on out. If you don't beat the first encounter, maybe you can find a guide online, to explain why you should use some cards that are essential from and avoid the ones that are pretty much useless for the entire game. I'm sure playing this game with a partner that isn't good, and not having the actions to solve the puzzle on your own must be one of the most insufferable experiences that life can offer.

In case you are confused about what this game is, and still want to play it, but don't understand what your supposed to do, i'll save you the time of trying to find out how to play this game. 

Here is, you are actually just supposed to make it through the scenario before you run out of cards. It might not feel like that at first, but that's it. Losing and improving till you win is possible, but losing scenario's is not the point of the game, just another stupid loop of game play where you gain several gold or exp. 

So you gotta find a way to get to the end before your hand runs out. You don't get that many cards. When it comes to the items, some just suck, and some ever guide will tell you to buy. Not a lot of nuance for player style or different strategies. Focus on attack, not defense, With defense you will just run out of cards. There's also dumb encounters where you make a choice, and gain something or lose something. Maybe the encounter will force both characters to discard a card and the beginning of combat or something starving you of actions and making your attempt foolish and un-doable even before it starts.

Stupid stupid game, buy it, play the first encounter and then request a refund.",1638580387,1638580387,False,2,2,0.387149602174758911,1,True,False,False

Waiting or ending does not fix the issue.

Seems like this is a very buggy and problematic game which is a real shame as it looked great, unfortunately I have had to request a refund as I literally can't even start it.

After also joining the Discord to look into options to resolve I did get a response (have to give credit for a pretty quick response) it seems like it's a known issue.

During early access, I tended to use this version as a sort of ""Training Mode"" to try out different decks/items on various characters and applied that knowledge to a concurrent 'irl' campaign. With the addition of the digital version's 1:1 Campaign Mode though, this is, in my opinion, bar none the most easily accessible version of the game.

If you've delved deep into the world of board games, so be it in actual board games or discovering them through Tabletop Sim, such as I did, you will find that there are many, many imaginative, interesting and strangely complex games out there. Of them all that I tried, Gloomhaven outdoes, outshines, outperforms in every aspect. 

As a tactical, turn-based RPG, it has half the industry to compete with, and yet, it manages to do everything right. From the smallest system of using cards instead of dice, to every unique scenario mechanic, Gloomhaven is never lazy nor boring with its design. It always considers what every other game is doing, and introduces its own thing that defies the norm, so be it in lore, setting and mechanic. 

You would think that by saying this, the game is astoundingly complex and it would have a rule book the size of a barn. No, not quite - the rules are intuitive, predictable, and easy to memorize to the point that you will never forget the basics. Not quite perfect, as there is some fiddling with some unintuitive mechanics that will require to check what manner of event happens where, or at least make you question how do you have line of sight through a solid wall. 

Overall, Gloomhaven is one of the best co-op, campaign-based RPGs I've played in my life, and it might be one of the few games I don't mind paying full price for. I do hope it continues to get updated, as there are still some avenues the game can be improved, in performance, content and graphics.",1638473916,1638473916,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

I love the board game. And this is as seamless a port as I could imagine, with some needed improvements, edits and streamlines. You can power through scenarios at a faster clip than you could with the physical version, and it's easier to not make mistakes that either ruin or unfairly win a scenario.

That said, the game is tough and the UI makes it better but still hard to parse for a new player, even with experience. It's hard to really understand the pathing and actions of the monsters -- somehow that's easier on the board version. And sure, there are occasional bugs, but no more so than bugs you'd make trying to play the game yourself.

I'm glad the devs are listening to feedback and advice and actively making the game in a way that anyone can enjoy it as much as possible.

-- Pre-release review:
I have been playing the board game version for probably 3 years and still have content yet to unlock. It definitely has a high learning curve, but the way you play an otherwise ""typical"" RPG dungeon-crawler is unique. It's a lot of fun and more of a puzzle than anything else.

Very true to the boardgame. You do not have to know the board game to enjoy though.
If you like turn based fantasy play, this is for you. If you have a friend or three to join you
you'll have a great time. The art is easy on the eyes and the maps mostly intuitive when
not deliberately puzzly.

Think turn based strategy solo or with friends (cooperative only).  That will be full of difficult
choices, and laughable mistakes. Along with a few mistakes that make you made at yourself.
But when you one hit and elite drake and three of your friends cheer... It's magical too.

Speaking of magic it's a card based system of play. you have a limited size deck, too many
cards and always a few regrets. You will want a crowbar for one more card. Which is another 
sign this is a good game.  Your spells, stabs, hacks, and heals are all in the cards. How and when
you choose them is the game play.

The campaign story has arcs, sides to pick, quests to fail and then succeed, and decent voice overs for
the story reading. I'd list cons and problems but they are few and if i listed the ones that were
two months ago, they are mostly fixed now. Dev team is still making improvements, and regular updates
as of Q4 2021. With more planned into 2022. 

I could go on but other reviewers have gone into detail better.

EDIT 06/25/21:
Almost a year later, and all mercenaries are in the game, the Battle Goal system has been implemented, and there's plenty of Bosses and scenarios in Guildmaster mode to keep you busy for hours and hours of Gloomhaven tactical combat.

Over the course of development, Flaming Fowl has also made some really great choices that streamline the game, consulting with Isaac Childres on issues like high-level Tinkerer cards, with the end result being--in my opinion--better for the game as a whole.

Absolutely worth your time as the team is in the final stretch, and looks to have the board game campaign delivered by the end of 2021!

I will be doing another run-through with my friend(s). If you want to play on the deadly mode it can be quite unforgiving. You'll have to play specific classes which you might have already played over your head previously and depend on RNG to win. There is also always the option to use restart round if you're feeling that you skipped a part where you could have done better, but it's up to the player.

I do own the board game version of the game as well as the JotL and forgotten circles expansions. Looking forward to frosthaven and a fan project crimson scales which I have already pre-ordered. If you want to play with distant friends, this is an amazing go-to game for that. If you can meet them in real life, it's probably better to go with the board game unless you want to save time. You can customize it with home rules but the learning curve will be much higher. 

The game is a blast. I see no problems apart from - let's say - cancelling your stamina potion because you screwed up and don't need to use it yet.

However there are some changes (in comparison to board game) in currently available Guildmastyer mode:
- gold is shared
- items could be freelly switched between characters
- you can easily reset character card choices and perks, however progression (levels and perks) won't be lost
- there is no personal quests or battle goals. Instead they're replaced by party-wide achievments, some of them tied to specific character which unlock at lv2 of character and provide alternative to levels access to perk points.
- as there's no presonal quests in Guildmaster mode there's no retirement. Once you getcharacter to level 9 in that party it will stay this level. There's no option to create second character of the same type in same party.
- Some AI and targeting logic are a bit different. This maybe a result of vague original rules or underdevelopment or author's vision. However for me those are okay and do not bother me at all.

My main negative points for this are animations speed(but they've improved action resoltion so many action that happen simultaneously are actually simultaneous, which speeds up game drastically) and very weak music. I hope for better and more variative soundtrack in the future (at the moment we play with music deisabled and replaced by youtube).

As for game's stability for my 30 hours it was stable enough. We had only one real bad episode with desyncs(due to one item), which was fixed fast enough.

All in all I higly recommend this digital version of the board game to everyone, no matter have played the board game or not.

======
Update after release and some patches:
everything is well done - events, retiring, city's welath, reputations and all those things in scenarios are working as they should.
Animations could finally be speed up, however delay between actions seems unreasonable long (like 3 to 5 seconds before and after AI turn, no such delay at human turns, so I guess it's not network related).
Right now we're playing a new campaign and despite the fact we've played lot of GM mode and completed full playthrough of about 60-70 boardgame scenarios.

-Many character abilities are bugged, not working as they should or not working at all
-Sometimes when trying to use an item with a character ability, clicking on the item triggers the ability before I am finished modifying it
-Did I mention the random crashes?

I am disappointed because the game underlying these problems is great; the graphics are good, the campaign stays true to the source while removing the bookkeeping and fiddlyness, and the guildmaster mode is a welcome addition. However, this game was in early access for a long damn time, so it's unacceptable that these issues made it to release. Wait a few more months and see if the game has been fixed. If not, skip the digital version and stick to the board game.

Edit: After seeing that a couple of patches were implemented, I played the game some more. It still fucking sucks, there are still too many bugs and crashes.",1636090295,1638033079,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well look no further, because Gloomhaven has got you covered.

Gloomhaven is a turn-based strategy rpg that can be played solo or co-op. You work together as a team of mercenaries adventuring through dungeons and saving the city of Gloomhaven from evil (or maybe not.. depending on your choices hehehe).

It plays like a classic roleplaying game, such as pathfinder, or Dungeons and Dragons. This is a digital adaptation of a board game and offers both the full campaign with 95 quests from the original game as well as a new guildmaster mode with 150+ unique quests and some new bosses. There are 17 playable classes, with 6 starters and 11 that you unlock as you progress through the game.

Gloomhaven has a unique combat system with a deck of cards that determines your mercenaries skills and creates an experience like no other. You can never straight up die from fatal damage, as you can choose to lose a card instead, losing access to that skill for the rest of the mission. Once all of your cards are gone, then your mercenary exhausts, and if all mercenaries on your team exhaust, you fail the mission and return to town. No permanent losses are taken.

Gloomhaven awards strategy, and you will have more success thinking of it as an adventure puzzle game over a traditional dungeon crawler rpg. Your team consists of 2-4 mercenaries and you must work together to succeed. If you play solo you will still have to control at least 2 mercenaries, so I find it to be much better playing through with 1-3 friends. 

There is no in game chat or matchmaking options currently, so you will need to use another voice chat for maximum enjoyment. I spend most evenings joining groups of new players from the Digital Gloomhaven community on discord, and you can easily load into a friends campaign with their multiplayer invite code and take control of any mercenaries they have available.

I love being able to play my favorite game online with no setup and with anybody at any time. It can be tough starting out, as this game is not meant to be easy, but if you take the time to run the tutorials for each character, as well as read through the rulebook available in pdf from the game menu, you will start to win and you may even grow to love playing Gloomhaven as much as I do.",1638010999,1638011155,True,37,1,0.79352104663848877,0,True,False,False

There is cooperative play, but I haven't tried it yet. The auto-save function makes it easy to play a turn and leave. However, this is definitely a ""just one more turn"" adventure game. Somehow I reminded of SWKotOR (turned based party combat) and Civilization (slow progress, branching decisions, and hours of fun) at the same time.

The graphics are nice to look at. They don't crash my mid tier machine made back in 2016, so they aren't that intense. The animations take a long time. Long enough to slow this down to in person tabletop speeds. I would like to be able to turn animations off, or at least speed them up, but I haven't seen the option to.

There is a splendid tutorial. The narration for the campaign mode has an excellent voice actor, and was surprisingly complete, but will cost hours of your life if you choose to listen to it. The guild mode has a kind of story to it that is separate from campaign mode. I am quite enjoying the new experience. It tweaks some of the concepts from the core game in intuitive ways, like your guild earns money not the individual mercenaries.

Speaking of tweaks, any FAQ's and errata from the board game that reduced potency seem to have stuck. Stamina potions return one less discarded card. I also expect to see more subtle, but hard hitting changes as I progress through campaign mode.

There are also some ridiculous exploits for people that would like to rush the events, the sanctuary, or have a perfect finish during every round.

The adaption is pretty much true to the original. But there is no limit to resources like in the boardgame, when monster tokens would run out. But it also makes choices permanent, because the game needs to progress on those, unlike in the real version, where the players can pretty much alter their decisions any time.
All in all, the digital version takes a lot of thinking off the players, because monster turns are AI controlled of course. It is a relaxing game without the need to set up dungeons and the other stuff you need for a session.

When the early access of this game was out, I had to purchase it and encouraged my friends to do so. I could not have been happier. Sure there were some bugs, however as the game progress to what it currently is, the bugs were fixed and the visual got better and better. When the pandemic hits, we couldn't do our usual once a week Gloomhaven session, however the digital version allows us to continue to play this game. The digital game also allows me to play with friends in different geographical location when I couldn't before. We now have a regular session going again and was able to stream it for our other friends to watch.

For example those things are weird:
- if your character is stunned and can't to anything, you still can pick cards and all buttons are active but it tells you ""can't do that, XXX is stunned"" - why don't you grey out all actions?

- if you are required to discard cards at the start of a scenario you can't do this simultaniously in multiplayer - so you if you are a party of 4 you need to wait for 3 guys to do it - for regular card picking you can do it simultaniously - why?


also some things a weird
- be the first in a scenario to kill a monster can be achieved by destroying a wall (which oddly counts as a monster)

the game is ihmo way to difficult for new players - even on ""easy"" you run out of cards very often - this is a bit frustrating

There is a story in this game and you unlock/progress through it slowly by completing the varied scenarios, gradually opening up the overworld map. Also of special note, each character has a limited life span in each scenario that is tied to the number of cards you can play. Generally you will have many turns before your character auto dies, but each time one of their cards is exiled/removed from the game for that particular scenario the number of rounds they have left to live is reduced, despite whatever available hp they may have. In essence, you have a limited amount of rounds/turns to complete the scenario. Aside from that, your characters can gain xp to level up and improve their available actions and increase their probability for successful attacks.

The digital version is a faithful adaptation of the board game. This game is a combination of DnD and turn-based RPGs where you can select pre-made characters, choose your story and see the consequence of your actions.

Pros:
It's quick and easy to set up, just tap, wait for the other players to join and go.
Easier to remember all of the changes and challenges that you do for your characters, reputation etc.
Multiplayer works well and is easy to set up games with people.
You can change the difficulty if you find its too easy or hard

Cons:
When playing with others there's little to prompt them when it's their turn. And addition of a poke button or something to say it's your turn would be nice.

Play sessions are around an hour with friends (down from 2+ hrs including setup and teardown)  
The 3D environments and figures look great.
The actions for each character seem to be very well animated and these small levels of detail, while not needed, do add to the game.
The interface is really nice with only a few minor gripes
The narration for the campaign is simple but well voiced and works better than I initially expected.

My biggest gripes are:
You can't always take back an action even if it was a simple move with not random element to it.
You can't enable multiplayer if on the map between missions (have to be at Gloomhaven or in a mission) So the extra players will miss the intro as well as between mission story if you saved outside of Gloomhaven or a mission.
Some of the board game mechanics are hidden behind the game.  Like knowing if an event is destroyed or shuffled back in.  Also in the board game you will know why an event gave a certain condition (you don't have the correct character).  While these are fine for those who know Gloomhaven they obscure information that would be beneficial on a second run or even help you choose choices as you learn just how much the flavor text on the characters matters.

My minor gripes are:
First run of the game takes forever (upward of 10 minutes on some systems) to load (feels like something that should have been handled by the installer)  
With all the detail put into 3D part of the game I'm disappointed that the event cards ALL have the same graphic (Both City and Travel Events)  In the board game they had different boarders at the least.

It is a fairly complicated game, and fairly difficult early on.  Is about making choices and maximizing each choice and turn.  Perhaps a bit micro-management-wise, but if that is what you are into can be a lot of fun.  

Don't get too attached to your characters.  Once their main goals are accomplished in the campaign, they basically retire...however, you can choose between the goals, and choose ones that are less likely to be accomplished anytime soon, or choose not to do that type of quest.  Hint hint.

This is a great game, and myself and three friends are enjoying every session more and more as we learn our characters and new challenges open up the world.

But, even after 1.0 release there are still a LOT of bugs.
- In our last 2.5 hour session our multiplayer session dropped twice kicking everyone else from the game and required a reload from main menu to allow them to connect successfully again.
- 2 cases where a player ended their turn but the game never progressed to the next person in initiative. This required a return to main menu and reformation of the party.
- Twice after reconnecting the same player couldn't see any details on their cards and had to quit and reconnect to get it working.

On top of this, all player noticed huge amounts of CPU/GPU usage for what shouldn't be a challenging game to run. The game runs but doesn't seem to be optimised.

You could brush these issues under the rug and say ""it's a new release, they'll patch it!""

So from 18 hrs in game, i thought i should write a review:
Before you purchase this game, ask yourself these questions?
Do you like repeating the same missions, over and over?
Do you enjoy failure?
Do you enjoy a low grind to level up characters, with no obvious benefit when you do finally level up?
Do you enjoy completely random attacks, where you could do zero damage more than once a game?
Do you like the idea that random events, before you get to your mission, could and do severely impair you and your team?
Do you want to shake your head in exasperation every 2 minutes?

If you have the inclination or social group to play this, it may be a laugh and a good time. You will more than likely still fail EVERY mission, but you can have a beer and a laugh whilst doing it!

There are a lot of brilliant concepts in the game, don't get me wrong. But even on 'Friendly' mode (which i'm told in game should be a walk in the park) i fail at least 90% of missions. I can accept failure but seriously, how hard should a game be if even on the most easiest setting is near on impossible! Its getting to the point that i cant be bothered to continue, as i see no end goal. I still only have 4 classes to chose from so i cant even mix it up and lose a different way.

If this is a true rendition of the board game, i'm glad i saved some money!

You really have to drudge through an hour or two before it turns into something you can't get enough of. It's my new addiction, with constant twists to keep it interesting. This could be a great new platform of games, if they release updates and extra modules.
Heres some tips.
1. Even if you make mistakes, keep the crew you have.  
2. Your crew will eventually be replaced. Don't hide from it, embrace it. Usually the new crew has better cards.
3. You have probably read somewhere else to not burn your powerful cards quickly to keep your characters alive longer. I have found that this rule has many exceptions. Each quest you should evaluate what you need to accomplish.  If you can burn two cards to kill 3 or more tough monsters in one shot you should think about it.
4. For quests that require you to retrieve something, you should switch to your max movement cards.  The assassin and wizard can accomplish this nicely. However, if you have to retrieve items and get out, the wizard prob wont do it well since she doesnt have enough cards for a round trip.  On the flip side, the beast master has some nice teleport cards that can be critical in battle. (wound a creature, then move him all the way to the back.
5. I didn't think much about the tinkerer at first. But due to his high card count, he seems to be the most durable. Until him and the sunkeeper, I didn't think much about support characters in D and D and other games. This game makes you revisit that.  A tinkerer who allows for a character to get back discarded cards significantly increases that characters life expectancy.
6. Get the crystal that allows you to restore all used items and give it to the tinkerer or whoever has the most items.
7. Don't read ahead of all the potential classes on the internet or ruin your surprises.  However, I will caution you, when you get to the enchantress, don't log of and say Ill go back tomorrow after I've had time to think. Get it done first time.
8. Once your characters hit level 6 or so, you will succeed most missions instead of failing over and over.
9. Let characters who are close to leveling up or completing their side quests be greedy. It will help you out long term.
10. Find a group to play with. All my buds are too old and busy. But this would be a great way to kill an hour a week with your old buddies from high school or college.

BISON YES!

You're thinking about it, and you liked Heroquest or Magic the Gathering? Yes, you should probably take another look. The former are going to find much to love about Gloomhaven's graphic design and expanded game vision. The latter are probably going to love the resource management (turns, hp, items, friends) in a more dynamic setting.

[b]However:[/b]

[b]If you don't plan on playing solo, then be aware:[/b] This is very much a turn-based game with all that is implied. It can be slow, and things can take some time to be resolved. There's a lot of prompts (sometimes for things that should maybe be allowed/left to auto-resolve) and it's easy to forget one, look away and waste ten seconds. :)

[b]If you're the sort that has to win:[/b] This isn't that sort of game. It's not common to 'win' the first scenario (or two) the first time. (Hey, you could get the right cards, it [i]could[/i] happen!) Realize that you're not [i]exactly[/i] playing as a specific 'character' - this isn't D&D. You and your friends are sort of the 'guildmaster' role (metaphorically speaking) and the mercenaries are just the fodder you're flinging from your guild into the streets to feed the wolves - progress is represented more by gold and XP than mission completion, especially at first. This is a [i]progressive[/i] game, and progress is locked in whether you're winning or losing - like many modern rogue-lites.

Is it fun?

Do you like small-group (or solo!) turn based games? Card games? Board games? Strategy or Tactics games? You're going to find a lot of genre-intersectionality in Gloomhaven, and it's going to find things from all these genre that you can or could enjoy.

It can be frustrating (those first two missions or so feel more brutal than they should, IMO) and there's always RNGesus to bend you over the nearest road or city event and have his wicked way with you, your cards, your deck, your hitpoint pool and possibly even your reputation or dignity.

But yes, if you're still interested enough to be reading this, then there's probably a lot to enjoy. Go watch some play video, but don't expect their playthrough to go exactly as yours will - there's a lot of branching and difference to be seen along the road.",1637619760,1637619859,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False
780290,103296348,76561198051229673,0,15,331,0,331,1637614390,"In my review I'll use two categories for my points: design and adaption. Design will refer to all of the inherited board game mechanics and rules which in my opinion can’t be and won’t be changed.

- In the board game you get only 1 from each character which makes sense, because who in their right mind would pay the extra costs to have 4 from each type. But in the video game there isn’t any extra cost to have duplicates in your party. I don’t know if it can break the game, but I would surely experiment with it.

- I understand it’s a game design decision, but it still frustrates most of the people that your characters can’t share gold or items. I think in lower difficulties it sharing should be allowed.

- It doesn’t make sense, that you have to loot everything during the fights. Even if you’ve finished the dungeon early, you’ll be moved to the world map. Again, I think in lower difficulties it’ll be a great help to the players if they only have to focus on the fights.

- Every attack will pull a card from an attack modifier deck, which will increase/decrease the base value. Every character has its own deck of modifiers. Designers could offset the modifier decks based on difficulty. For example: on easy difficulty the player could have more +1 cards in the deck and the enemy will have more -1s.

- I think it’s a bit absurd to have 6 levels of difficulties in a game where the “AI” is already set in stones by the board game rules. Instead you can lower or increase the level of challenges by allowing or removing quality of life improvements like I’ve listed above. Normally you clear a room, pick up as many golds as many cards you have before a long rest, then move to the next room. However there are quests where you have to pace yourselves differently. It would make a huge difference if I know it in advance if I can fool around and pick up stuff or have to move as fast as possible. I don’t have problems with the battles, but the randomness of the map made my life very painful.

Adaption will focus on the missed opportunities when the developers digitalized the board game, but they can be changed in the future.

- When you create your party, you can only see the character's starting deck size, but not its actual hand size. It’s a huge oversight. Hand size is your time limit, the lower number means less action to take in total. Even +1 hand size will make a big difference.

- There should be a party composition suggestion for teams. I think with 2 there are very limited combinations which can actually succeed. You can have hard times if they pick smaller hand size characters (Scoundrel and Spellweaver) or Tinkerer (biggest hand size, but one action will be mostly just move) or characters with low health (Spellweaver and Mindthief). Even with 3 heroes parties you can have really unbalanced mixes.

- I think it’s really annoying that you have to restart the whole campaign if you didn’t get the preferred personal quest at character creation. I would like to have an option to pick it from a list.

- I would really like to have the option like in CRPGs where you can allow/hide to show the outcome of your choices. I think it’ll be welcomed by the players who want to play it once, yet they could still have a full experience and also by seasoned veterans who don’t want to remember each events. There could be something in-between, like only show the outcome if you already had the same encounter and show only the already chosen options.

- When you have an encounter where you have to pay, then you can only split the cost between the characters, but you can’t see the total amount of gold each hero has.

- In the board game you can sneak peek your quest or at least see the starting area before you begin, because you have to set it up. In the video game you have to pick the quest goals before you have any information about the map. Again, make it available on lower levels or if you have already played the campaigns, but it’s basically a memory game at this point to recall what should you expect. It’ll probably also influence your cards and items, but definitely your goals.

- The content of a treasure chest can go from garbage to world altering item. It plays right into my previous points, but I think on easy difficulty it would be really appreciated if you can see what’s inside the chest, before spending 3 turns to get there and in the end you’ll get only 10 gold coins.

- Each enemy has basic value, how many hexes can they move, how many health points they have, how and how strongly can they attack. After you select your cards for the turn, the game will pick a random card from the deck specifically designed for the creature and modify its behavior for the turn. Maybe this is a design choice, maybe it would be considered as cheating, but I can’t understand why can’t you see the enemy’s deck of cards from which the game will pick one randomly. This is the part where the game defines that it shouldn’t be called strategic, because you can’t plan ahead, you’ll merely react to the randomness what comes. You don’t have information about the potential moves of your enemies. The player picks her/his cards first and hopes that RN Jesus is aligned with her/his plans. I had a turn when I hoped that the enemy will have a normal turn, so they will move and attack. I chose my cards to buff my defense and hit hard in melee. The enemy had a shield up turn, they’ve stayed where they were and I couldn’t do anything meaningful with my cards.

- The board game rules define how each enemy should take actions. It’s given which of your character they should target. However in the board game you can do things slightly in your way. For example: the melee creature should move next to you in the shortest way possible, then attack you. Most of the time this means two appliable hexes and the player can decide which one is the destination. In the video game the system will pick it automatically, but in my opinion this takes away some minor advantage from the player.

- If you want to move, you have to select the hex, then confirm it down in the middle with the button. If you double click on the same hex, it’ll select and deselect it. Same with the attacks. There are instances where I think the game should automatically select things for the player. For example: there was a card which let you move, then heal 1 every adjacent ally. I moved to the spot where I wanted and I confirmed everything without reading, because I thought the healing part will be automatic. My injured hero didn’t get better, so in hindsight you have to select even the parties you want to help. Maybe in the future there are some enemy abilities which can inflict negative outcome on a healing action, but it wasn’t the case. It’s more situational, but you have to select even the only enemy standing next to you when you want to use the immobilize and move card. You can easily forget about the built up infusions and the game won’t give you a warning that you could enhance your ability with the element. I feel somethings are over secured with confirmations and some quite vital parts could be missed easily without the game highlighting it to the player.

In summary I’m missing some quality of live improvements which in my opinion should have been already part of the game after such a long early access phase. I feel the difficulty levels don’t tackle the right problems. My biggest complaint is still that the game is really random, you can’t even plan ahead what will happen in the current combat.",1637617215,1637617215,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,5,True,False,False

The core card-combat mechanics work really well in a digital format and are even more addictive than the tabletop version because of the lack of tracking and fussing with components. The interface is a bit clunky (especially when playing solo) and there are a few bugs here and there, but overall the experience is great.

The campaign interface gets the job done, but is probably the weakest part of the game - it's hard to see mission requirements, campaign achievements (which in the boardgame mark permanent progression events e.g. ""we helped the drake boss rather than killing it"") are not visible, and it's apparently impossible to tell which scenarios have had their treasures looted vs which haven't.

For new players I'd recommend going through a few missions in Guild Mode rather than diving right into the campaign, as the guild mode tutorial does a much better job at introducing the game mechanics and overall strategies for each class.

Really hoping that Jaws of the Lion and Frosthaven follow this adaptation.

This doesn't feel like a tactical RPG so much as a series of puzzles loosely strung together by a light narrative. It's very faithful to the board game, so if you are a fan of that, you will like this as well. Full disclosure, I don't like the board game either - and for all the same reasons. I thought it might translate to a better videogame than tabletop, simply by virtue of not having to set it up... but it turns out I just don't like this game's systems or gameplay.

For the uninitiated, Gloomhaven is a character-based deck-builder with tactical positional combat and some light RPG elements. It sounds really great on paper, and again - some people are going to love that combination. There are games like Darkest Dungeon or Slay the Spire that have similar mechanics - and I actually like those... but what sets Gloomhaven apart is it's puzzle-minded approach to encounters. It's less like you have the ability to create your own original solutions and more like you have to figure out what the game's creators intended for you to solve each encounter, by always making the absolute most of the limited resources at your disposal. Again, some people will love this - maybe you will, too - but it's just too tiring and tedious for me.

We just pick player cards and items from the box and turn on TV and sit on the couch. We select the cards for each round physically, then we input them into the game. This feels so great!

Pros:
- setup time is reduced to nearly 0
- you can drink&eat during play without the risk
- you can save at any time and you don't have to clean up the table!
- you can basically play in bed and just grab physical character cards for better tactical decisionmaking
- proper monster movement - we tend to forget about some rules - here the game controls all of that
- playing multiple campaigns with a single physical version was a nightmare, here everything is soo smooth
- no way to cheat on road/town events! :D Ok, we can always peek the physical cards ;)

Cons:
- minor bugs here and there, which are constantly getting fixed!
- the game on SteamLink Samsung TV on LAN network 1Gbps stutters from time to time, so just be patient for 3-4 secs.

I have passing knowledge of Gloomhaven from living next to a shop that sells and runs it.  I came in rather fresh, did the hour long tutorial, and was demolished by the first mission of the campaign on easy.  This has killed any interest I had in Gloomhaven on steam and on the table.

I know the game is hard, but I went through the first mission of the campaign three times on easy and was absolutely wiped out with no feeling of progress. After going through an hour long tutorial to learn the basics and then hitting that kind of brick wall I was not interested in wasting more time on it.

The good: great progression. Character design is fantastic. Good stories. Good ability design. Well balanced. Interesting items. Good art design. On and on. As far as RPG go, it hits all the nails on the head. I didn't care for the music and sound design but that's nitpicky and I know it. Seriously I enjoy playing this. I love turn based strategy and I love board games. Winner winner. 

The bad: There's only one way to speed up the game, and it's not enough. i.e. If there are a bunch of slimes casting the same spell they could totally go simultaneously. Things in rooms with the doors closed could also just skip. There's a pet class in the game and the pet doesn't activate things that can be activated (rage). The tooltips are miserable. I want to know what different arrows mean but I can't mouse over or click anything and some of them aren't covered in ""how to play."" again: the pet class ""command"" isn't covered anywhere after you unlock, so I'm just figuring this out as I go instead of getting a rough explanation. There are quests that say ""quest text...."" but you can't mouse over to see the text beyond the ""..."" This is one of the big ones: Within the same turn you're on, if you play a card, you can't go back and restart that character's turn even if it was just a move. You can restart the entire turn for everyone, but not that particular character. You can't click and unclick things within a turn. Just general user interface usability is very bad, from the clicks to the mouseovers. The game is also pretty choppy on my comp. I play most things on high, and I'm guessing based on the performance that some of my nitpicks are because compromises had to be made to ensure it played smoothly on most settings. My eyes get tired playing this game unlike any other game I've played, including factorio which has a monstrous amount of busy movement at all times. I can't put my finger on it yet, but it's definitely graphics related. 

And lastly, make the treasure chests easier to spot. Dinky little chests can get overlooked, and there's definitely been times where I had to rotate and zoom and bunch when I figured a chest would exist but I couldn't see it.

Remembering where to find the treasure index for each scenario, what each attack element symbol means, what happens when you perform a short rest but want to keep the card rather than burn it; all of this can be overwhelming for more than a couple playthroughs! They might also understand the hesitation to use permanent stickers on their cards and boards to represent global achievements or attack modifiers they've earned from previous campaigns. 

The digitalized Gloomhaven game solves all of these complexities by reducing the learning curve through preprogrammed mechanics and UI context bubbles for symbols while allowing players to track their achievements through isolated separate campaigns and profiles. The board game is challenging enough for experienced board gamers and usually requires an app to help track damages done, affects applied to enemies, campaign trackers and prosperity. This version brings all of these elements of the board game to life with special animations for each player while making it very easy to track the damages applied to each and every monster on the board. Most importantly, the game was designed to preserve the core mechanics and feel behind the original board game; the only difference being bringing the characters and monsters to life with animated movements and attacks, and narrations and graphics to bring the player into the story of Gloomhaven. This is NOT a completely different game with different mechanics and story and ""inspired by"" the board game.

Whether you want to use this game to hone your skills with a particular character or play online with friends near and far, or you simply wish to use it to help you learn how to play the board game through tutorials and the Guildmaster mode, this game is highly worth it.

It has several modes of play, with lots of things to unlock and is a challenging strategy game. I can get easier as you get used to certain levels and class combos, but provides you the tools to keep things challenging without ruining the fun of it. Gloomhaven's campaign mode mostly reflects the tabletop with only a few small changes that overall I think generally benefit the game. Only negative I'd have for it is that you cannot keep enhancements on a class that you're playing after they retire like in the board game version.

Pros; 
1. Good attempt was made at creating a bug free stable game on launch so props.
2. Heros all have unique abilities and fun play styles.
         
Neg; 
1. Areas feel very small and reused over and over...you will fight in the same tiny dungeon room over and over just maybe with slightly different tiles or obstacles/decorations.
2. Items dont feel that impactful and leads you to care less.
3. The exhaust mechanic AKA ""every hero eventually dies after so many turns in combat"" is dumb and might be cool for table top but just comes across as a lame mechanic that forces you to speed up and leave a map before every 1 drops out.
4. Feels incomplete... probably due to the janky combat mechanics and lack of interesting combat zones.
5. Story is lacking/lame/I could care less.

To begin, I highly recommend you actually play Gloomhaven before this (or at least read the rules), unless you absolutely hate board games.  Gloomhaven, the board game, is a very fun, interactive and cleverly unique game that stands out against its competitors.  It also allows you to really understand everything that happens in this video game, both story wise, but also in terms of character strengths, weaknesses, rolling modifiers etc..

That said, the narration, levels, spell animations, and tactical combat system is extremely well put together.  One thing, which I mirror, in some comments is, lack of ability to ""undo"" even the last action, and some of the targetting.  Now, you can rotate AoEs, etc.. with ""R"" for those who think this is wonky, but I refer to more the use of items along with abilities that don't transfer the full effect, or let you choose which enemy to apply the extra effects of the attack on.

That said, those are my only complaints.  I have come across no real game breaking issues, its fun to explore and see this world, the maps, and enemies re-imagined, and with a quicker board setup for each map.  I recommend at least having one friend to play this game with, and always enter dungeons with four heroes.  Flexibility is key in Gloomhaven, and where some heroes lack, other heroes excel.  Don't expect to be godlike, and don't play on hard unless you have previous experience with the board game.  It is punishing, especially at the beginning (as was the board game).

Its a deeply tactical game, and if you are not a fan of those, or single maps taking an hour + to clear, I don't recommend picking this up.  It is a unique genre, and not for everyone.",1636481620,1636481620,True,2,0,0.553272783756256104,0,True,False,False

I have a 178 hours into Gloomhaven, most of which I accumulated during Early Access playing the Guild Master mode. I am currently playing the campaign mode, and I have done the bulk of those hours, outside tutorials, in multiplayer.

I love this game.

So if you're either struggling to work with a 20+lb board game and keeping a steady gaming group going, for me the challenge is my gaming group is almost always 5 people which is one too many. For reference, I do play a lot of board game digitally, Through the Ages, Carcassone and Ticket to Ride, to name a few. I also love Zombicde, Hero Quest (got the new edition this week), Vindication and 7 wonders to name a few physical games. 

Here is what I love about the Gloomhaven on Steam.

Multiplayer works very well. Sometimes there are sync and connection issues, but the person can rejoin the game at the start of the next round, when you pick your cards. It would be better if they could join while a round is in progress, but the disconnects are not frequent.

You can assign any of the four mercenaries to other players. We typically play 2 mercs each, although I would have no issue added a third and either do 3 or one person gets two.

This is a thoughtful game. This means you have to think through each move and choice, not readily throw your turn away because the card system is both your life, your time limit and your abilities. This can make for some surprising interaction and decisions and sometimes luck and some pretty hilarious accusations when your partner does something... really dumb or brilliant. 

Don't like a class... that's fine. You start with a few to choose from but here's the deal, most people will find one more classes that suit their playing style. It's great fun to play in Guild Master mode or the Campaign. You unlock characters in both. They just play so differently though that it's great and rarely feels stale even if you've been playing for a while and are moving onto a new one.

Skill level, well you can learn. Some of the classes are complicated and not easy to really get the hang of, but you really don't have to focus on the characters you really hate playing if you don't want to. If there is more than one of you, well your partners might love what you hate anyway.

This game has the thrill of leveling, some exploration, a lite story now and then and chance encounters. It's a coop board game that allows everyone to play the game and not try go be some game master or something that separates you from the other. You can also do something meaningful in an hour to hour and a half. I mean this isn't Divinity or Neverwinter Nights or a full fledged RPG experience, but it is a great digital version of a board game many people love or... love to hate.

There's a lot of content, unique decks for each class, interesting maps, lots of monsters that behave differently, the maps with traps and obstacles can change your strategy, the campaign has bosses with unique decks and challenges... even decisions to be made. It's a lot of stuff without the 2 hour affair of separating components.

If you like the game but find it a bit of a hassle to break out or play yourself, well this is nice way to jump right in each night.

If you're curious at all, give it a try. You never know, you might just really enjoy it enough to play night after night and still feel the thrill of trying another round, seeing another encounter or trying to remember what the heck those plant looking people are called.

So trying this game in 2021 and it's reached the point where if you were going to play the board game mostly solo or with a casual gaming group then there is absolutely no reason to buy the board game. This is much better value, avoids the main pain with the board game (set-up and tear down) and actually brings what is a pretty lackluster story line from the board game to life with some really great voice overs. Glad I sold my copy of the board game and have Jaws of the Lion that suits my more casual gaming group down to the ground. 

Edited Review: 
So a few months on and there's been some major work to make this game more accessible and the tutorial it offers is now solid. Learning the system isn't the simplest thing in the world but the joys of the Gloomhaven combat system start to shine through fairly quickly. I do have to say that, having brought a copy of the board game between my first and second review of this game that this is still the inferior version. If i have the time I will still break out the physical copy, even with a 30 minute setup (and pack away) time. That being said there's plenty of times in life when you don't have 2 hours free to get one hours worth of gaming in, this game is made for those moments and a great way to scratch that Gloomhaven itch. 

Original Review for Reference:
Unfortunately this isn't really ready yet unless you already know and play Gloomhaven the board game. There's no tutorial yet and the video teach in they offer doesn't give enough information.

It's a good game, but this is not a casual strategy game. You gotta have the patience to play a dungeon many times before finding the right combination of luck and skill the squeeze by.

Not a game I'd recommend, because the difficulty to start is frustrating enough to walk away from the game. It requires strategy guides and forums to really get a good grasp on the game....and I think it's a bit presumptuous of the programmers to assume that people will be infatuated with this title, like it's the 2nd coming of Magic: The Gathering.

Yes you can be beaten in a dungeon but you retain the experience and gold earned during your effort making the next run easier.

I have beaten three dungeons out of the six I have won so far with one or two mercs dead and the others with only a turn or so cards left before they would have collapsed. Masterful balancing and great tension.

To teach you the basics, the tutorial gives you strict objectives you must complete and you don't have a lot of options on how to accomplish this, so I can see why some people would form this option. 

Now, once you finish the tutorial and get to the actual scenarios, you're free to play how you want, with the characters you choose and formulate any strategy you desire. In order to be successful though, you must plan ahead, use strategy and tactical advantage. Like any game of this type, there are optimal moves, sub-optimal moves and wasted moves, but don't be afraid to try new things and learn as you play.

I've yet to try the actual campaign, but I've had more than enough fun completing quests and leveling up my characters in the ""Guild Master"" section. Eventually I may even try multiplayer, who knows.

If any of this sounds appealing, look up some game play videos on the interwebz and see what you think. That's exactly what I did and it sold me on the game.

Digital version was a blast even before version 1.0. But campaing is just awesome.
Almost everything here is great:
 -Core mechanics is interesting with pleathora of options and difficult decisions. Space for fiddling with builds, party compositions, card combos, enhancments, items etc. is just insane. 
 -Amount of content is jaw-dropping (130h in and i still have 30+ quests to do!)
 -Graphics is solid and clear (nothing to write home about though)
- Narration is atmospheric very well done.
The things that are not so great:
-this game is not well optimized (it tends to stutter even on modern machines)
-difficulty is very punishing especially at the beggining. Don't feel bad playing on EASY (i thing there should be Very Easy setting implemented as well).
-changes to enhancments are a bit dissapointing

Anyway, i love this game. I hope they will keep working on it, that modders will fill the gaps left by devs, and we will see content from Jaws of the Lion, Forgotten Circles nad Frosthaven.
Good luck with with you personal goals!

1.  The combat is unbelievably clunky and time-consuming, as you select combinations of cards each round for things to do (like swing your sword) that you will only be able to do once, until you've rested or otherwise retrieved the spent card.  You MUST draw two action pair cards, which means discarding two cards (you don't have that many) every round, even if you don't have any immediate use for the second card.  Beyond that, each card has an upper and lower part, and you have to coordinate that, since the upper part of one must be used (or simply discarded) ONLY along with the lower part of the other, or vice versa.
2.  While in theory there's a big map of the world, you don't get to actually see it.  Destinations are offered, click on them and you're suddenly there and, after a preliminary still picture and one-sided dialog, suddenly there you are, confronting monsters in the dungeon or on the field of battle.  No real exploration, care in approach, etc.  The ""battlefields"" are VERY small, do positional tactics are very limited as well.
Finally, one minor annoyance as well-- in some of the ""tutorials,"" the advice on how to handle some situations only comes immediately AFTER you've failed to do what's expected of you.  That seems to be a simple bug, which they ought to fix.

I tried the game over three weekends (when I have time to play), and maybe one day I'll come back to it... but not real soon.  There are better games to play, far less tedious and boring.",1636245183,1636245183,False,2,0,0.490743130445480347,0,True,False,False

It is also the sum of its parts and unique in that aspect as it is functionally all and none of those things at the same time. It is designed to be a challenge, enforce teamwork, places heavy value on each individual step or mis-step (yes you can fuck up a 40 turn long combat in one round) and has no problem sending you home if you got a bad roll for the curse/event randomizer. It relies on you to refine and iterate based on scenario and baddies. IMHO Teams are truly handicapped by having less than 4 players despite the scale because of the balance of skills, particularly of the starting mercenaries, and a bad team comp creates some serious early game challenge issues. Characters start squishy but once leveled can start to steamroll (even with scaling) until there are some serious mf-ing baddies late game. Bosses are No. Fucking. Joke. Early game is also hampered by the lack of development in the city, lack of mercenary choices and unlocks which are ultimately the long game macro strategy. It does not allow you to play a power fantasy at all and consistently keeps you in the realm of ""this is very challenging, winning is a reward not an assurance"" which, admittedly, is offensive and a high barrier to new players. It can come off as repetitive, as learning a scenario and strategy is performed by replaying a scenario after loss. Doubly so feeling repetitive if that's not what you're into.

The gameplay is solid . it's very Hard game, not overly complex but harsh. The voice acting, music and efx are top notch. everything is great, really. 
There is some minor negative things I have about this game.

1: The stress of rushing through the dungeon.
You have a certain amount of cards in your deck. after they have been used, 1 gets burned after each cycle, and when you have 0/1 cards left in your deck you DIE. so at most you have about 15 rounds to beat a dungeon. No time to dilly dally. I hate that aspect of this game. If that rule where to be removed it would be a much stressfri experience. 

2: everything is bound to a character so if one happens to pick up an item from a chest and it is not suited for that character, you cannot give it to another one in the party. so it's a bad Diablo 2 random sheit loot generator. If it where possible to move such valuble things around, that would have been awesome

3: Some animations don't make much sense. For example, Cragheart has a leap ability, and when landing he does damage to x amout of adjacent enemies. in the game, he woosh/ teleports to the destination and then does a jump animation. I know budget fir this game is tight, but it would be better if the jump animation took him out of the screen and thne land on hte designated space. 

BUT those are 3 small things in a really nice digitized boardgame. WHEN you get this game you will fall in love with it's lore and feel. Cursing the steep learning curve, loosing dungeons to Fattigue. and then coming back for more.

We'd been sniffing around for quite some time (ages!) for a game that we could enjoy both during periods of minimal time allowance and also to collectively rot our brains for hours at a time. Having grown tired by fast-paced, exhausting games and being forced to go back in time to games of old, this baby suits me right down to the ground.

Even here in early access beta v0.2, the gameplay is responsive, reliable, and highly adaptive. Multiplayer is highly functional, and any occasional issues we experience (specifically, the ones that can't be blamed entirely on Texas Internet connectivity) are quickly resolved and we're back in the saddle in a minute or two. In two separate instances of solid gaming of 6+ hours, only two or three connectivity issues occurred, and they hardly slowed us down.

Having perhaps the most amazing tabletop experience of all time so masterfully adapted into online game play is truly remarkable. I've yet to get close to bored with the game having played over 60 hours now, and, as my gaming buddies will concur, there are few things in this world that make time fly more than a Multiplayer session in Gloomhaven.

Update 11-4-21: Second game night on Campaign Mode. We were super excited to get rolling on this, but, in all honesty, it hasn't been nearly as enjoyable as anticipated. While absolutely true to form compared to the tabletop game, this mode is legitimately unforgiving. We started off on Normal Mode on the first map (Cragheart, Spellweaver, and Mindthief) and, after subsequently failing twice, rolled back to Easy Mode (which, for the record, should be called Reasonable Mode, IMO; when I hear the word ""easy,"" I think something that isn't difficult) and succeeded. We made it through a couple more maps but, as of this evening, got a legitimate kick in the collective pills. Three consecutive failures on another map (and not even really close a couple of times) resulted in frustration and unanimous disappointment.

Granted, we are reviewing our selected archetypes, and there is room for improvement as the three chosen classes together are probably not optimal. These things considered, it is a long way from ""easy."" We're talking three guys who have 140+ hours in together and totally wrecked the Guildmaster mode for 10+ months, maxing out over a dozen toons with little difficulty.

This is still one of my favorite games to play online with buddies, but, after the culmination of this evening's events, I honestly believe I'd rather take a fist in the teeth. If ""Easy"" mode is this debilitating, I shudder to think what Insane mode would be like. I'm thinking about that Shaq meme.",1611335567,1636083696,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I can't recommend this to anyone other than players who have previously played the board game.  Despite numerous reviews stating that the game is too easy, I find it to be too difficult and the core mechanics to be pretty unsatisfying.  

I've attempted the first dungeon maybe 4 or 5 times now with various party sizes and items, I can't get past it.  Every single time I run out of cards at some point in the last room.  I've learned how to properly use spellweaver by utilizing her unique restore burned card mechanics.  I've played with infusions to buff up the power or change the mechanics of certain cards.  I've tried various combos of items.  Spent a fair bit of time on Google/Reddit looking for advice.  Nothing I do seems to get me past the first dungeon.  It's obviously possible, people have done it, but as a new player I can't figure it out.  50% of the mobs in each room have 2 shields, reducing incoming damage by 2.  Most of your non-burn card abilities have an attack value of 2 or 3.  HP on each mob of about 8-10.  You can do the math from there.  Oh, and the AI archers vastly outrange you and do 5-6 damage.

If I slam my head against the first dungeon enough times I know my characters will level up, get additional HP and cards and that that will make the game easier but after maybe 4 hours of play time I'm halfway thru 1 level on each.  What about the end game?  Well, should I survive the grind to retiring a character I can look forward to unlocking a new class.  What about the character you just retired?  It's card modifications are gone, the character for all intents and purposes never existed.  That's not a thing in the board game, but hey, it's not a good game unless you punish the player as hard as you possibly can.  Unless the new classes are just that more powerful than the base classes I don't understand how you would progress to the next difficulty level.  

There must be something to the combat system that I don't grasp, but I don't have 10-20 hours to devote to getting past the very first encounter, the gameplay itself isn't that exciting and the way Gloomhaven takes card management to the absolute extreme just isn't very fun.

The game is so inflexible you have to follow the prescribed path to success - one can fail the tutorials, the ""guildmaster"" mode should be called ""campaign"" and the ""campaign"" should be called ""challenge mode"" (and locked behind completion of the real campaign).

""Easy"" must have some new definition of which I have been previously unaware, as attempting the first dungeon in the campaign several times on this difficulty led only to defeat.

What is non-intuitive is gaining xp - this is not done through killing mobs but by the (successful) use of specifically marked abilities.
Even looting requires a turn, or ending a turn standing on the hex with gold.

Some characters are unable to keep up with the group, having to ""move"" cards available, whilst others cannot attack anything.
Even in an empty room each character may have to trash 2 cards just to move, which is infuriating.

The rooms are also more like cluttered corridors, forcing your group into a bottleneck and blocking each others paths or abilities more often than not.

While some games have an exponential difficulty curve (X-COM and Blackguards come to mind), this game starts out brutal in its difficulty and is totally unforgiving.
I see it more of a ""puzzle"" than ""strategy"" game - find the exact method to complete the current map with no missteps or quirks of the RNG, there is (in my opinion) little strategy to employ anywhere - you have little control over the narrative.

i have not played the board game/am not very familiar with it. so i dont know how faithful it is to the source. so that has not influenced by opinion of the game.

my biggest gripe is the level scaling. something that i generally dont enjoy, but on occasion can be done well. this is not one of those exceptions. when the enemies scale to you, there is a tendency for every fight/encounter to start feeling the same, and that is 100% the case with this game. if there are no enemies higher level than you, the only time its a extra challenge is when the enemies get unfair advantages. if no enemies are ever lower level than you, you never feel like you progress matters. what is even the point of having levels if it doesnt change anything. for example, the non summoned enemies always drop 2 gold, no more no less. i admit, the highest level i got a character was level 4, so if things start to change after that i cant say, but i get the feeling they do not. leveling up does also grants a character new cards. the flaw with this, and why i dont think it helps the sameness of level scaling is that a characters maximum number of active cards (also their minimum) never changes. so you always have the same number of cards no matter how many new ones you get. so there came a time when playing where i realized that going out of my way to use the abilities or do the bonus objectives which generate extra xp for your characters was pointless. this was the moment i decided to uninstall the game and write this review.

there are other minor concerns i had with the game, but what ive already discussed is the meat and bones of my issue. if that doesnt bother you, this game may be of interest to you. as i mentioned, i wanted to enjoy it, it has good qualities.

the entrails if you will, are minor nitpicks, but worth including. the ui is not great. it often feels slow pacing-wise during combat. you have to select the cards youre using for character 1, then manually click character 2 from the roster, then select their cards. it doesnt automatically switch to the next character once youve selected cards for the first. a small complaint, but you can have up to four characters, and it gets tedious. also using your abilities is the same way. when its a characters turn, you select either a top card ability or a bottom card ability, which often but not always represent your attack and move abilities respectively. something that also feels like would benefit from some ui changes or hotkeys to speed up. a friend of mine likened this game to a 'sword and sorcery' xcom game, which i think is a great parallel for how the keys for unit action could be improved vastly. i cant say how many times ive moved a character and then clicked to use an attack and had nothing happen... because i had forgot to click the button on the screen that signals im done with my movement phase. im not saying this is necessarily bad, because with the waypoint method of movement and the optional items you can use to affect said movement, having a confirmation is a good thing. it is a double edge sword because it often feels clunky and could use some method of improvement. something as simple as making it so clicking the attack button automatically ends movement. you may have a rare oops i goofed, but the amount of time and hassle saved would imo far outweigh the possible downside. 

i imagine ill return to this game months or years later. hopefully updates/improvements, or maybe even modders will have altered the game to a state i find more enjoyable, but for now i would not recommend it as is.",1635996402,1635996402,False,5,0,0.504332304000854492,0,True,False,False

You could think of Gloomhaven as being somewhere between D&D and a turn-based RPG. Each scenario feels so memorable and interesting, but remain surprisingly replayable. The objective, enemies, traps, and level layout all combine to present challenges that almost feel like puzzles to solve, but in a way that doesn't detract from the tactical RPG combat.

Speaking of combat, Gloomhaven has a deep, complex, and original battle system. Each turn, you are presented with many options, each with benefits and consequences both immediate and far-reaching. The array of abilities available to your characters and the challenging nature of enemies make the game feel very strategic. A little dense yes, but the game manages to create plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments which break up the dry planning.

Unfortunately, for all the praise I can give its unique and strategic aspects, the combat presents a huge barrier to entry. It takes a fair amount of time before you get the hang of things, let alone feel good at the game. With the limited types of actions you can 'undo', there is no shortage of irreversible mistakes that leave you frustrated or confused.

Progression also feels fairly original in Gloomhaven. Rather than sticking with a single character forever, you're improving a town and running a guild of mercenaries, each getting stronger and seeking to accomplish personal quests. Achieving those quests results in a bitter-sweet retirement from the guild. It means losing a character you've developed and grown attached to, but you've seen through enough adventures with them to be okay with saying ""farewell"". There's also the tangible reward for departures: you unlock one of the hidden classes, each with very distinct and fun new ways to play.

The drawback for some here, is that seeing a mercenary all the way through to the end of a personal quest can take hours and does not at all mean completion of the campaign. So there is a lot of work involved with unlocks and progressing your story.

Multiplayer in Gloomhaven is fantastic. While the game holds up single player, it's so fun to figure out the scenarios with a friend and impress each other with what your mercenaries are capable of. I recommend discussing strategy vaguely and not 'meta-gaming' too much. Tabletop RPGs are always more enjoyable if you get into character and surprise each other a little. It's also pretty satisfying when you manage to coordinate a great round without planning it all in advance.

For me, the weakest part of the game are the random encounters. Between scenarios, you're regularly presented with a situation presenting two options (e.g. help the guard catch the thief, or help the thief get away). I'm familiar with similar systems from roguelikes, but here the outcomes of your decision are often utterly arbitrary. Worse still, the frustrating unpredictability is magnified when some of the outcomes can negatively affect long-term progression.

Overall, I have to say I'm extremely impressed with how the developers have innovated in so many areas. Even more impressive is that despite the number of original mechanics, somehow the game is greater than the sum of its parts. The skillset diversity of your characters make the scenarios even more interesting and replayable. And since difficulty scales with your party's average level, there never feels like a pointless level to go back to.

If you like RPGs, strategy, a little narrative and aren't afraid of a learning curve, I really recommend giving Gloomhaven a shot!",1635855570,1635855570,True,18,0,0.685227394104003906,0,True,False,False

The game is so tightly balanced you lose the scenario as a result and have wasted 1/2 an hour. The push function works only some of the time. Again, you thought you were going to push some enemy to his death and set your turn up to do so. It fails to work as it should and there's more time wasted. The UI is absolutely counter intuitive.


Yet another poor experience with the awful UI. I spent an entire turn setting up a group heal  before entering a new room. I tried for 3 minutes to click on the 3 characters I had grouped up. Could not do it. Buttons greyed out and unusable. Finally, being quite exasperated, i clicked on a skip button, Skipped everything. No way to go back and undo. Entire turn wasted and cards wasted. This kind of crap happens all the time. The UI Is simply bad and requires too many clicks and does not work.

Campaign game is a fucking joke. Way way too hard - and there are too many examples of a bad draw and losing the scenario and wasting an hour of your time. game is a piece of shit",1587649380,1635828553,False,2,1,0.444030106067657471,0,True,False,False

A faithful reproduction of the board-game experience, with all of its faults.

First impressions are bad: Needless complex game-play that centres around failure.

This game is a faithful reproduction of the board-game of the same name, but it should have retooled itself to learn something from modern game design. Even though it looks like it's a rogue-like with card playing elements, it's really a puzzle game; There are only a few ""right"" answers for how to play, and offers none of flexibility of modern rogue-likes with card based elements have.

The failure aspect comes in when you have no indication of the difficulty of content. You just have to try different challenges, hope you can get something out of them, fail, retreat and try again. Doing the same thing over and over again looking for success is boring. The Reddit community seems to be aware of this ""fail till you make it"" aspect, and seems to like it? What I want from a game is not failure and repetition, its graded difficulty that leads from one challenge to the next succeeding along the way; Not whatever this is.

Sadly, all the magic, mystery and appeal of the board game is gone. The PC version feels like a somewhat tedious puzzle game, and holds little to no charm for me anymore.

-Enchantments do not persist on ability cards after a mercenary is retired.
-

[h1]There are bugs. Plenty of card ability interactions that should work one way but are either implemented differently than written or are wrong.[/h1]
1. Mana Burn is rolled with disadvantage when an element is consumed for its additional effect
2. Sweeping Strike rolls attacks against all targets but will not apply damage to targets if a miss is rolled for any enemy.
3. Some breakable walls in certain map scenarios do not properly reveal the next room but will allow passage once other walls are broken
4. Camera control will be taken away during enemy actions and can cause the entire action to be ""missed"" (the Combat log is properly updated though)
5. Useable item effects can be selected but will not be applied to attack actions with no clarification. (The item use will not be consumed)
6. Enemies will make attack with advantage at random times. (Their ability cards will not mention strengthen or advantage)

Negatives
-Certain quality of life improvements from the board game like not having to set up and tear down a board game space, shuffle decks, and do simple math don't quite justify the lack of addition that being a computer game brings. 
-There is a lack of ambient sound effects in the dungeons. 
-Music while present, is definitely something for the background and does not dynamically change to fit the situations.
-Monsters animations are taken individually for all actions including non-attack animations adding to dead play time. 
-Constant confirmation of actions and end turn steps when no other actions are possible or available is frustrating. 

Positives
-The narrator is great. (When he is there)
-Animations are nice.
-Models are as detailed as you would hope.

This review will be updated as bugs get corrected. However my recommendation stands as the added features for a being a computer game are not there.",1635654901,1635655153,False,4,1,0.536632537841796875,0,True,False,False

Should be fun to play, but after 4 attempts trying to pass the first campaign mission you start to think that you are stupid. Eventually, after 4-6 tries you are LUCKY enough to pass it. Because this game is also 50% about luck. Its not about your tactics and ability, patience and good planning. There will always be these x0 cards or x2 for the enemies on the right time...
So i repeat, after u pass the first scenario, you try the second, or the third that its called ""Barrow lair"" and you try many times with diferent combinations of mercenaries, 2 of them, 3, even 4. Nothing works because the game is designed to be F....NG HARD for the fun of the designers.
Guys, i played since the beta, was able to beat the game months ago, but then this 1.0 came out and it got worse...
A game should be a game, people pay to have fun, not this frustrating bad time.
Dosen't matter if the board game is exactly like this. Its different fun when u play on a board with friends! Even if you lose you enjoy because you have good fun with your friends. But alone at home? you want to delete this F game forever.
----------------------------------
Edit after more play time.
The game gets more easier after the first 2 missions. Im winning now all the next without frustration. I think that the game should be modified to make the first missions not so hard.",1635168052,1635654033,True,0,0,0.424033463001251221,6,True,False,False
