Do I want to change my review? Yes. This game gave me thousands of emotional moments, and not all of them were positive, but there were unforgettable moments too.
I met friends in Dread Hunger community, we had great moments and Dread Hunger has become part of my daily routine for almost 2 years. I doubt we will ever find any game that is as immersive as Dread Hunger, a great example of a game that unveils your teamwork and leadership skills.
Dread Hunger was not perfect, it had heaps of optimization problems, lots of bugs, and funny flaws, but it was what made the game even more thrilling. Looking forward to the developers fixing the bugs, or just letting us be with them, glitching bears, dying to fall damage while steering the wheel... The game was kind of a sandbox in a way, where you could chill with its imperfections. This was fun indeed.
Now I want to appreciate everyone who played with me. Sorry for being a bad/sweaty/bossy/foolish teammate, I hope that my games with you brought you more fun than disappointment. You helped me to learn about differences in societies and some tolerance as well. Everyone has my respect (except cheaters lol)!
I wish you all a happy new year, and hopefully, we will find each other in private servers of Dread Hunger, or another game.

You are part of a British explorer crew who set sails for a long journey to the Arctic (probably Alaska, Canada or Greenland) - playing during 1845. While the crew of eight people is trying their best to survive by finding coal (to run the ship) and food as well as nitroglycerin to blow up deadly icebergs there are two thralls among them who will use dark magic trying to sabotage the expedition. 

[h2] The game is dead. But why? [/h2]
The official game servers will be shut down on January 1st 2024 so it is not worth buying it anymore. But what exactly is the reason? I'll make two groups of people responsible for this. One of them are the [b] developers who gave up on their quite successful game [/b] with a unique concept out of pure laziness. The game only featured three maps in total. After leaving Early Access they never added anything new to the gameplay. Only paid cosmetics were introduced and embedded with the help of NPCs who kept advertising orbs, rings, masks, carpets, crockery and pelts to bypassing players. At first I welcomed the creative integration of micro transactions to the game but at some point the repetitive voice lines that played three times a minute started to become annoying. 
During the time they added those cosmetic DLCs they also increased the base game price by a lot hoping to fight the loss of money caused by a shrinking player base. However, this was ultimately the reason the game started to die besides various [b] community created problems[/b]. Those were mainly caused by the fact 95 % of all players where Chinese who would either kick you out of their lobby (if you haven't had Chinese letters in your username or your play time embedded in it) or hardly used any English making them intelligible to the rest of the world. And if they did they were usually telling everyone how bad Japan was even though literally NO ONE EVER ASKED. As a newcomer your life would be hell when playing with foreigners who got thousands of hours on their clock always suspecting you of doing something malicious while in reality you are just trying to figure out how to craft, repair, find coal and so on. At some point the whole player base felt more like a gated community than a welcoming place for the unexperienced. 

[h2] My experience as an Achievement Hunter [/h2]
As a Steam achievement hunter who just bought the game a few weeks ago during the final sale (and is suffering chronically from FOMO) this game left me with kind of mixed feelings. While I really loved the concept of the game (and its implementation) playing with foreigners was a true hell ride. During the first sessions I was able to play with other achievement hunters helping each others to get the probably hardest achievements. This, however, never included playing the game as intended and so the learning curve was pretty much flat. 

For the last few achievements (being the captain of a ship for 10 nautical miles was definitely the hardest one) it was unavoidable to play in public lobbies. You really ought to leave the lobby immediately if the Captain role is already taken. People usually wouldn't tolerate other roles driving the ship. You would get a bit of a different experience if you explain the case to them (= you are aiming to unlock a certain achievement) which my unsocial self obviously didn't do right away. But even if you were allowed to do so people wouldn't be exactly amused if you didn't play the game as intended. This fact - along with the immense time pressure - made me stay up for 60 hours straight to get that final achievement before heading off for the holidays. Despite angering a lot of thrall mates as a result of lacking experience I was able to complete the game with a certain group of people. [b] Since I never really had the chance to do it using ingame VC: I want to thank everyone who (kind of) tolerated my presence and supported me on my way to 100 % despite my lack of gameplay experience. It must have been a pain for you but you guys were truly making my life less of a hell. :) [/b]

[h3] What I liked about the game [/h3]
This game is not about [b]aliens[/b].
The EN players are rather [b]unsocial[/b] than impulsive.

If you watch the sky at night you can see the game plays during a [b]syzygy[/b].
I can still hear the [b]echoes[/b] of the screaming cannibals.
The [b]bear[/b] is more aggressive than in real life.
The chef in this game is a true [b]kushcook[/b]. ([b]r[/b])
The color of the animal and human blood in this game is [b]Red9[/b].

So what's my opinion on the game?
Dread Hunger's English community is being completely ignored by the developers, they're constantly stalling saying things are in development, but can't seem to deliver anything interesting, and instead only cater and interact with their Chinese community, which are extremely toxic. The environment for new players isn't great, the tutorial teaches you next to nothing about the game, and if you really want to learn and have fun, you're going to have to join a community willing to help you with that.

This game is in a state of decline, simply because the developers don't care about the people playing their game, so don't buy it, don't spend money on it, give your money to developers that actually care about this game.

From day dot till now I've played and watched this game being updated and sometimes even overhauled. The already small developer team has put so much time, effort and love into creating a one of a kind social deception game. Unlike any other game, I've befriended a TON of amazing people along the way whether it's sharing an emotional experience with someone as we watch the ship leave us behind to reenacting the titanic scene with another.

Unlike literally any other deception game, Dread Hunger allows for SO many different possibilities and allows the user to do whatever they like without being restrained. From being a chaotic devil to being a living armoury, every game creates a new experience. If you are worried about whether you should buy it or not all i'm going to say is I've sinked about 1k hours into this game and keep on finding myself coming back for more.


About a year ago, I decided to create a small scale tournament for 8 of my friends that i met within this game. Fast forward to now i'm still continuously planning and fine-tuning future tournaments for this game now with the assistance of many other Dread Hunger players. Unlike tournaments for other games, creating a social deception tournament is like pulling at strings with so many difficulties with balancing, but atlas I prevail as I've fallen in love with this game & its community! Sure you get toxic people but that's like every other game and luckily a simple mute will mute them every time you get into a lobby with said person so it's easily avoidable!

Please consider getting this game, it's worth every penny!

The devs do not care beyond serving their Chinese audience, and making DLC. NOW MIND YOU, I don't mind them serving their Chinese audience; I was there from EA and the game would have essentially died without it. But their outright refusal to even ATTEMPT to try to maintain their English speaking audience has shown, with very little English speaking lobbies to play in.

What are there is typically full of toxic people who; probably because they're already toxic, or tired of the constant influx of Chinese players, will spout all sorts of slurs at anyone with a Internet Cafe ID. 

The updates that focus more on fancy new powers or just selling DLC packs for $13, doesn't bode well either. 

If you want to play any kind of active Among Us type game. this isn't it; at least not anymore.

EDIT: I forgot to mention. going by the Steam Charts, this game is sadly bleeding players.

NOVEMBER 2023 UPDATE: Holy shit, Why am I not shocked. So instead of fixing ANYTHING in the year since I rewrote this review, they just took whatever money they could get, and told us all to piss off. I was there from watching Tomato and friends play this and have a blast, I was there around 1.0 when there was hope.

But it should have been clear early on that the devs just didn't even attempt to fix any issue swith server setup beyond ""just shove people together even if it means waiting for someone to speak english. And supposedly the gameplay is even MORE toxic now with people enforcing ""house rules"" and making it more difficult and less fun to be traitor.

WHAT a disgrace. I'm sorry I ever gave these people any of any of my money and expected them to deliver upon ANYTHING beyond just the surface fantasy of ""Among Us: Franklin Edition"".",1670197560,1700631966,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Old Fav is Deceit and was something else for me, This game is 10 fold better for me

-I love Variety and Love to play 10-20 games at ONCE and this still is my top played game on steam

18AUG2021: They banned me from the forums for writing 

""It's pretty dead. The game barely gets more than 300 people a day. About as many as Friday the 13th, a game that hasn't been worked on since 2018

The game peaked at 600 players back in April, it's release month lol.""

28JUL2021: I've been banned from this game by the developers for turning coal into gunpowder

Or as they call it ""Griefing"" lol 

[quote=Admiral Cockburn]You received a 24 hour ban for griefing, which was verified before the ban was issued.

If you'd like to see your ""handiwork"" in more detail, here it is :

https://i.imgur.com/ngHhlhF.png

You destroyed 10 of your team's coal, sabotaged the ship, and killed one of your crewmates.

You were not one of the Thralls.

When the ban expires, play nice and there won't be any more issues. Grief your teammates again, and we'll issue a more severe ban.[/quote]

Why am I able to do these things if its a bannable offense?

You mention Destroying 10 coal, why is it an option for humans to do that if you don't want them to do that?

Did I down a crewmate or did I throw down a beartrap that they stepped in? Or was it the guy they suspected being a thrall and I threw him overboard after they downed him?

I'm actually unsure how I damaged a crewmate because I thought I did a pacifist run that time lol.

Also 35 minutes in on the day of the blizzard and they're not even past the first island. I don't think they're gonna make it lol.

I disagree with the charge being griefing because I was fairly chipper & friendly to everyone throughout the match. Even congratulated the thrall for getting 70 gunpowder but apparently that's a bannable offense when I do it lol.

Also, who are you quoting when you say ""handiwork?"" 


Original Review: 

The first thing I did was eat human meat.
The second thing I did was eat a rabbit and puke all over the captain.
The third thing I did was lock everyone outside of the boat and let them freeze to death while I was nice & toasty.

3/10 Game
10/10 Human meat.

Updated review 17Jun2021:
This game has more *recent* positive reviews than people who have played it in the last 24 hours.
This game has more positive reviews than all time peak players. (Look it up, steam charts)
This game isn't even 2 months old.

Updated review 30MAY2021:

I played this game with my friend and they got upset that the crew turned on them so easily twice. (I was the Thrall, they were human.) I had gotten up to the ship deck and began steering the ship into land. Before they caught me I let go of the steering wheel and ran away, they thought whoever was trying to right the ship was the Thrall. The entire crew turned against my friend and killed them. They then were stuck with nothing to do in the prison area and no one would let them go so they quit the game and refunded it. 

This game really needs something for prisoners to do. It's just so boring being locked in a prison. I don't even waste my time giving up, I just disconnect and go find a new game. Which there's only 1 level in this $25 game.

For reference there are multiple levels in First Class Trouble which is $15, however this game will ban you if the developers decide you've been a troll and won't allow you to refund or refute your ban. 

I think this game is really fun but its focus should be on things prisoners can do rather than banning its (really small 500 people) player base. I luckily refunded this game so I don't have to be afraid of any reprisals from the developer.

A huge glaring problem that I'm surprised the game launched with is 8 people are required to play the tutorial. Me and my friend tried playing the tutorial but obviously since most people are playing the game instead of the tutorial, no one joined us. Making the tutorial absolutely useless without bots, which there is no bot option in this game. So your only real tutorial is going into a match blind and doing what you think you should be doing. So if someone says something mean to you when you're a human and you start a fight with them, just hope the developers don't find out and ban you. Or if you have no idea what you're doing and put all the coal in the kitchen or heater instead of the boiler, and remember not to put the nitro inside the ship to make it explode, or else the developers might ban you. This game is a prime example of developers focusing on the wrong things instead of just letting people play the game. 

Another easy thing that should be included in this game is spawn preference. Let's be real, no one wants to be a human in this game. You take forever to mine resources like taking coal off a dead body or cutting meat off a baby seal. Cooking, crafting, and anything else takes far longer than it should. Your job role buff is only 1% faster, like it's not even worth having the buff at that point. They should allow people to choose if they want to spawn as a human or spawn as a Thrall. Since the human gameplay is so boring, everyone would probably choose to be a Thrall but I still think it would be a nice touch to put in while players are waiting for the 2nd & 3rd level of this video game lol.

Update 28JUL2021:
Don't get the game. Terrible moderation. They literally advertise ""Betray Your Friends"" but this is also a bannable offense. How do I know? Well I've been banned. Which raises the question, why would you allow players to commit bannable actions in game because there should be no reason for it on a social level. Last game I played I was Thrall, I won, told everyone GG and then had no access to public lobbies.

31JUL2021:
This game isn't fun to play anymore, knowing that you can be banned for playing the game how you want. This is like buying a tooth brush and having the company stop you from using it because you used it to brush grease off of a machine. 

Imagine if Call of Duty banned players for spawn camping, or if Grand Theft Auto banned players for going above the speed limit. That is what this game is lol

Thrall is pretty underpowered considering most people just stay in a ball of 2-3 players. EVEN IF YOU KILL SOMEONE it doesn't matter because they respawn on the ship and can just tell everyone who killed them. so you lose the element of surprise immediately when you attack anyone. On the other hand if you're the thrall and get killed once you spawn there but can escape 1 time if you have your spell BUT if players have a key they have ~90s to open the door and just kill you. if you die twice you're just fucked and have to stand around watching the game until completion. 

Too many rules made by the players to follow, if you're playing solo and the learning curve is nuts, you're always screwed as a thrall for the most part. unless you blow people up / poison them. but even then if doc is alive they should have cures. 

Just don't buy this game.

Suggestion for devs (if there are still any who care about this game) : Mute the crewmates who respawn on the ship until they're released. (It will make it harder to tell if they're friend or foe.

 I'm Leaving a positive review because I had such a wonderful time playing this game and I got my moneys worth more than 10 times over... However as of right now I would not recommend anyone buy this game unless 

1. You know in your Heart and Mind that you 100% want this game.
2. Know How to be a CREWMATE & A THRALL
3.Ready to be thrown off the depend with no help and will be going up against people who are really good at the game and have a HUGE ego. 
You can go on you tube to watch Plumos channel he teaches all the basics of everything and showcases the diverse ways to win games as a THRALL  

This is an amazing game it is the most versatile social deduction game there is with so many ways to sabotage the Expedition without a doubt. Turning your Crewmates against each other destroying the ship or with just a good ol reliable Saber. However this game is past its prime honestly, the crews you go against  are people that have played with each other since the beginning of launch and when you go into lobbies like that you pick up on there habits. IN turn its not hard to figure out whos the Thrall especially when its someone new to the game or group. An experience crew will always beat a Really good thrall and A new Thrall. 

My next point there is no Thrall tutorial... This is insane to me with how many times I heard, ""I don't know what I'm doing."" ""I suck at Thrall"" ""How do you build bone totems?"" This is fine every once in a while but when it happens to you over and over and over and over again its so frustrating especially when you see other people get decent Thrall partners it begs the question why play the game? I AM SO GOD DAMN TIRED of trying to play my game coordinate what my partner has to do how to win the game its disheartening and frustrating. It begs the question why play the game if my partner is going to be new. This point may be void to a lot of people. But I constantly Deal with this and turns me off to the game for months at a time. 
The devs reworked the newest map in DH ""Expanse"" which in all honesty it didn't need a rework. Summit is so stream lined that its the only map anybody plays and people can get to the halfway point or the the end BY THE FIRST NIGHT. And approach is never played because there is not in between people know how to play the map or no idea at all. 
And after all that people were saying bring back the Old Expanse AND have the other expanse as well because THERE IS ONLY THREE MAPS. This game has a lot of replay ability but IMAGINE if we had two or even three more maps to play around with Approach and Summit ( the two other maps besides expanse) would be playable! 

But It doesn't matter now After gas lighting the discord we  finally get a response after 7 months of radio silence and ""talks"" of obtaining the IP. Its Dead In the water. No more updates and talks of when to shut down the servers. Don't really know when but you know how things go.  

P.S. YOU BUILD BONE TOTEMS WITH 1 BONE AND 3 WOOD PRESS Q TO BRING IT UP BUILD 10 FOR MAXIMUM AFFECT HOW COME I ALWAYS BUILD THEM HUH? 




Old review 
This is an amazing game, so much to learn and do there may not be that much content but the replayability is insane. This game is like First Class Trouble and Among Us but way better and improved. 

I wish they would advertise this game some, I feel like this is a hidden gem that people don't really Know about.

I wish they would improve the melee animations when you slow them down they don't really hit the target at least in First Person and I really hope they don't overlook this or downplay it.  For example I hope they connect more fluidly like in Chivalry 2 Or Warhammer Vermintide 2.
Another Con is the community can be extremely toxic at times. You can have someone single handily ruin a game, and they wont even be a Badguy, Thrall, Sus, etc. But when it comes together this is an amazing game. Also More Cutlasses and melee weapons please?!",1657296331,1692217287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The price tag, I feel is a huge detractor from this game's lasting success, especially since you have to have to spend 5-8x the price to play this game unless you are resigned to playing with all random people.

I highly recommend getting this game when it inevitably goes on sale, buy a couple copies even, and let it sit in your library until the next Among Us reignites public interest in hidden role games.

And boy, does it make a valiant effort! Dread Hunger jumps into the Player-Imposter genre with the determination to make you feel like you're more than just another cog in the survival machine.

From the get-go, it immerses you in a world with a promise of a deep-rooted lore and a meaningful story. You get to test out different roles in the tutorial, and it actually helps you grasp the gameplay mechanics before diving into the real deal. Bravo, game! You're teaching us without being boring.

Now, if you're the Thrall, you're basically the imposter, but with a lot more freedom to deceive. You get your own unique role with specific gear and skills, and the fun begins as you try to blend in and pull off tricks. Picture this: luring the Chaplain out, shooting arrows at him while he's attacked by a wolf, and making the crew think it's his own fault. Hilarious, right? Just be careful not to get caught, or you'll be taking a chilly dip.

There are different roles for everyone on the ship: the Chef cooks, the Chaplain digs up treasures, the Royal Marine... you get it. And these roles encourage players to get creative and roleplay, making the game a lively and fun experience.

But, alas, there are some flaws to this icy adventure. The promised story and lore seem to vanish once you venture past the tutorial, leaving you feeling a bit deceived. Come on, game, where's the Lovecraftian goodness you hinted at?

The character roles, while a great idea, fall short of their intended impact. Sure, the game nudges you to play your role, but it's more like a gentle nudge than a strict requirement. Players go rogue, and there's little to keep them in check. Maybe some role-specific quests could straighten things out, eh?

Lastly, what's the purpose of it all? The lack of a clear goal and meaningful direction can make the gameplay feel like an endless loop. Time management and trust issues can be stressful, but without a bigger purpose, you might find yourself questioning if it's worth your time.

In its current state, Dread Hunger isn't quite ready to set sail at full price. The missing story and player-purpose give it a ""still-in-beta"" vibe, even though it's officially released. It's a shame, really, because the game has its moments of brilliance. But hey, it might still find its sea legs with future updates. Who knows?

I can only really recommend this game for content creators wanting a large collab or with people who can gather up to 8 friends but as is... no. The English community is basically nonexistent and cheaters are rampant.",1690146037,1690146037,False,23,3,0.695444703102111816,0,True,False,False

There should be a mechanic to increase your chance to become thrall / traitor since games are way longer than Amogus and it can be frustrating if you wait 4 hours and than your mate fucks up or someone trolls lobby / has dc.

Edit: As expected this game turned into abandonware after only one year with probably more than a million copys sold. The updates have been mainly cosmetic; which is okay to finance a company and especially a startup, but than I also want to see results which are simply not there. Besides that not much has changed and there wasnt even a roadmap released anymore. The game is fun but it is a massive cashgrab with strongly dwindling player numbers as Slowdrive Studios probably is too overwhelmed with managing the company and the game and/or has not the intention to do so.

I'd buy it for sure, just be weary. It does take around 10-20 hours to decently learn too.

WARNING the game is abandoned, no update in over half a year and the last updates were just mini cosmetic DLC cash grabs. The only English lobbys that might be around are filled with very sweaty players or just text/talk to each other outside of the game, ruining it. Also theres hackers aswell.


TLDR; The English community is dwindling, filled with sweats and drama. Do not get.

Main Problems

Not enough people playing for a game

Lack of meaningful content updates

Serial Cheaters/Griefers



I really liked this game when there were people playing it. 

Seems to be popular in china but theres like 1 maybe 2 english servers at a time. Usually just hosted by trolls or cheaters that are only playing to make everyone else miserable and they are much more dedicated to wasting other peoples time than they are to just playing the game.

For some reason they added microtransactions to a dead game instead of using resources to promote or bring players back or new ones in.

I left the game came back later and left again and came back one more time. The last two times I met the same serial griefers because there is only a few servers and even though they should have been banned or maybe they were they just kept coming back and ruining most lobbies.

If a lobby is full of all non-thrallers 2 will still be randomly selected. I find that many people actually leave and sabotage games whenever they are and aren't the thrall (ex: leaving, taking all coal out of boiler throwing it and sabotaging etc.) for only those reasons and if the game is a more enjoyable experience in their play style it may cut down on that as well. Ultimately there's no logical reason not to add this feature and I pitched it to many lobbies and got their opinions and they seemed happy and hopeful about this addition. Hopefully it is added and this is a solid way to test the developers care for the people and their game.

Genuinely one of, if not the-best social deduction/manipulation game I've ever played. However, it doesn't have enough English-speaking players. My recommendation AGAINST is solely based on premise that you are someone who does not speak Chinese. If you can understand Chinese- then I HIGHLY recommend Dread Hunger to you. As I soon explain, you'll come to understand why I don't recommend this to people who cannot speak Chinese.

Dread Hunger is a social deduction and manipulation game. While you technically CAN win an entire game without speaking a single word; it generally isn't very fun, and will inevitably lead to this game just turning into a boring TDM-fest because no one wants to explain to each other why they're doing what they're doing. In Dread Hunger, you have eight players per match, each player taking one of the eight classes in the game. Classes are largely defined by their starting equipment, and one or two passive abilities that affect what they are competent at, and they all more-or-less make sense. The Captain can make the ship turn faster- which lets it avoid icebergs easier. The Cook, well, cooks food faster, the Doctor heals more efficiently, and so on. Then, two out of those eight players are designated as 'Thralls', which are the people trying to sabotage the ship. They still have their normal class powers- so they don't stand out visually or equipment-wise. While open combat IS an option- a two-vs-six isn't generally viable, especially when everyone is granted TWO lives. Yes. Every single person in Dread Hunger is given TWO lives. This might seem unnecessarily stacked against the Thralls, and to an extent- it can be; but the survival elements that everyone else has to contest with means that fairly often, you'll have someone just die to the cold, or starvation, or what-have-you, and if you're clever, you can sometimes kill someone from stealth through various means such as poison syringes, poisoned food, or by getting a clever long-range shot on them while they're fighting the local wildlife, among other Thrall-specific powers. When someone dies, they are put in the brig. They cannot leave the brig, unless someone comes by with a single-use key that they have scavenged from the map which is also used for other single-use chests that contain rare loot. So killing someone doesn't necessarily mean they can immediately escape and come fuck you up unless there happens to be someone at the brig who can immediately unlock them, and even then- you can always try and convince the rest of the crew that in fact you had killed your victim in self-defense! They can, however, still voice chat with the rest of the crew in proximity of the brig. This ALSO gives Thralls a second chance. If a Thrall's first attack ends with them dying, or they somehow die to the elements, they can potentially convince the crew to release them; or their thrall friend (Each thrall knows who the other thrall is) can also release them.

You might be seeing why having a microphone is important, and why as English-speaking players; going to Chinese servers isn't really an option.

Now, in order for the crew to win, they must get their ship through the map; and then also detonate the massive iceberg located at the end of the map before the timer runs out, while also the crew themselves surviving to the end. All players, including thralls (though Thralls have an easier time with it), must contend with cold temperatures that slow them down and deal damage the colder they get and starvation, while also gathering fuel in the form of coal, wood, and blubber in order to power the ship's engine. When they reach the end of the map, a player also has to carry a box of explosives that are stashed through a small gauntlet to the iceberg and detonate the iceberg. When the timer runs out, there is a map-wide Blizzard that causes huge amounts of freezing that can't be offset by any source of heat, and can only be temporarily slowed; giving players a few final seconds to TRY and pull through if they're cutting it close. The Thrall's job is to ensure that the crew do not survive. Whether that means slowing them enough so that the blizzard ends up killing them, outright killing the crew, or potentially destroying the ship with risky sabotage. All options are perfectly viable, and it gives the Thralls plenty of options to try and figure out how they plan on stopping the other six crew members for succeeding. In order to help them, Thralls get a special Thrall-only chat, along with a few special abilities that they can use at the cost of semi-rare bone knives. Thralls can summon a sudden attack of cannibals on a player, cause a map-wide temporary white-out where everyone's visibility is massively reduced, and the ability to turn invisible and gain a massive speed boost. These abilities can also be upgraded by special buildings Thralls can produce, making the cannibal attacks have more cannibals, while the other two last longer.

All-in-all, this comes together to produce an incredibly fun experience. Unlike other social deduction games, the regular crew players actually do have a means to actively defend themselves beyond simply getting lucky or running away; while the Thralls have a large variety of methods to hinder the players without being involved in direct combat if they don't want to. Whether that's rushing for the best fuel and hiding it or dumping it in the water, using their powers to try and get some kills on lesser-armed players, or just potentially be killing people in outright combat, or by sniping players with rifles if they get lucky enough to find one.

But as I said earlier, there just aren't enough English-speaking players for the game, and since it requires at least 8 players to run a lobby, it can be a bit difficult getting a private game going. If, through some miracle, this game ends up exploding in popularity and regains a substantial English playerbase, then I can wholly recommend it.",1684281789,1684281789,False,8,0,0.566581189632415771,1,True,False,False

The main downfalls of this awesome title are:

The devs have next to abandoned the game and haven't updated the game in many months. That; along with the negative experiences that I have had with a small handful of people in the lobbies. From people spouting tons of racial obscenities, others capitalising constantly on exploits the devs haven't fixed, and not to mention the extremely small amount of hosts that kick you or assault your character based on what you do in the game. Whether that be that you either under-perform or over-perform.

The basic premise is you are a crew stuck in the arctic on an expedition, and there is evil among you. Dread Hunger reminds me a lot of that one AMC show, The Terror. The crew has to stay warm, stay fed, and stay alive from the wildlife and the monsters. The main objective is to scavenge coal to fuel the ship so it can break through the ice. Eventually, you will run into a dead end, with the only option being to blow through the ice with explosives. If the crew succeeds, they escape with their lives. You can't take too long, however, because a snow storm will come and there's nothing you can do to stop it; so time is of the essence. The game will randomly decide if you are a crew-member, or a monster. There are quite a few classes to choose from, like the cook, or the captain. Each class starts with different items and weapons, and can be used to do good, or evil. For example, if you are the cook, you are expected to make food for everyone. If you are a monster, this gives you a prime opportunity to poison the whole crews food if you so desire. Playing as the monster is quite difficult if you don't know what you're doing, or if you struggle with social deception, but it can be fun. The monsters have different powers they can use with bone daggers they can find around the map. They can target a player to be attacked by monsters, go invisible, or call a white out to happen, for example. The general game-play is fun, the sound design is alright, and there really isn't a story. I would recommend this game, but unfortunately there are some major issues. The main issue being, it seems almost impossible to find a game with English speakers, and I only speak English fluently; so that alone is enough to not recommend it. The other glaring issue, is I remember even back when I could find English lobbies, the community seemed to be pretty damn toxic. If you can find a bunch of friends to play this with in a private lobby, hell yeah I absolutely recommend it. Ultimately, I am forced to not recommend this game if English is your main language, or you are looking to play with people online.

Even the crafting as simple as it is; and the survival aspect to the simple combat with a decent health and hunger dynamic make what the game is: A selfish game. Working as a team is ideal but with that being said, being too trusting or friendly can make you look too good or being too much of a loner will make you suspicious of your actions. Or you can play the deepest of mind games with people and unless hell. Poisoning the food or feeding someone human remains is always a surprise argument of ""WHO MADE THIS"" and being the one who poisoned yourself is a huge mind Fvk
Needless to say you can get very creative as a Thrall to turn the other against themselves. or completing ignore them and do your own thing on the land. Either way, this was a very fun game for me.

BUT my biggest problem currently is I no longer have a way to communicate with anyone in the game. 
What I mean by this is my mic no longer is picked up in-game. It says its connected, in the games Audio section, my discord works fine, other games have no issues and I damn near did everything i could think of. I reinstalled the game completely and reset my PC Audio settings. I even wiped my HD (Granted I had an issue with my SSD at the time and just basically factory reset it) hoping it would fix the issue.
I search the few forums on Steam, Reddit, whatever I can find and nothing fixed my problem. Used 3 different types on mics and none registers in the game. 
As this is the core aspect of the game, it practically makes it impossible to play. And if you try, your either kicked from a game before it starts or just killed immediately. No fun.

I currently use a Razer BlackShark V2 with the 7.1 Surround Sound Driver that you can download for its surround sound... which it worked in the past with this game. 

Honestly I really wish to play this game, I'm willing to change my review to a positive one if I ever fix my issue. But its been months since I've been trying to fix this issue. I will continue to look into it and try my best to fix it because I really did enjoy this game.

Dread Hunger was a game I played dozens of hours on weekly without issue in the first two quarters of 2022, and the final quarter of 2021. It was a game that, in my opinion, was unique and exciting. The social deception genre had just erupted and when played in a non-Troll manner, DH could be constantly intense and bring you to the brim of your seat as you fought to kill survivors or bring the ship to the end.

However, this changed completely. The developers took a page from PUBG and allowed Asian/Chinese servers and players to go unchecked. They have completely overrun the game, and if you cannot speak or type Mandarin there is a large chance you won't play this game unless you have a full, private lobby of 8 friends to play with. When you make a NA server for other players to join, you get raided by people who can't speak your language (FYI, it's obviously a social deduction game, so communication through a language everyone understands is kind of a focal point). You attempt to join other NA lobbies only to discover it's just Chinese players spamming public lobbies to try to get a game in motion. This is all very unfortunate and kills the game. Outside of a language barrier, I've been in about 15 games from the middle portion of 2022 where Chinese players fly around the map, invulnerable to damage and killing everyone. The fun of the game was siphoned out, and the developers keeled over to the Asian market as a cash grab with in game ""cute"" purchases. 

It's a damn shame since this game started off so strong. For me to change my review, they *need* to region lock servers if possible to retain what slim population of English speaking NA/EU players they have left and to invest more in a developer team for advertisement and more maps. When I quit playing there was 3 maps available, and the game got very repetitive and boring after a week or so of playing it.",1620110994,1674578137,False,0,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

-Poison the meat, 
-Poison a syringe and stab people,
-Just poison the antidote to the poison. 
-Sabotage the boiler,
-Drive the ship into an iceberg,
-Summon a fog and let the captain crash his own ship into an iceberg,
 -Plant explosives, 
-Call constant cannibals to devour the crew,
-Stall until the blizzard freezes them, and waste their time/resources, 
-Leave people for dead or just fucking kill people with your fellow imposter. Then lie and gaslight your way into slaughtering the entire ship while they place blame each other. You dont just walk up and press F to kill someone and then debate with your friends whodunit. You can make early surprise plays, deceive your friends into trusting you and play the longgame, or a bit of both. There are SO many ways you can fuck over your friends, and so many ways you can catch on to someone being a traitor. Many ways to slip up and get caught. Its a rush on both sides. Because a lot more than the traitors can kill you if you arent careful. If you enjoy the (arguably) shallow gameplay of most social deduction games, but enjoy the core concept and thrill of being a secret traitor in a group, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

The negative reviews are because theres a large Chinese population that plays this game, so depending on the time of day, finding EN servers can be hard. But every time ive clicked 'play' i was able to find and start a full game within 10 minutes or so. And Chinese players playing on their own servers doesnt really effect english speakers.. If they were online theyd be on EN servers anyway. You cant really blame Chinese people for not speaking English. Rather you should blame the low population of English speakers who play this game in comparison.

There are cosmetic microtransactions and the content has slowed to a crawl as i understand. But the game itself is so incredibly entertaining, even more so with friends. I regret leaving this game on my wishlist for so long. i wish i bought this earlier.

1) internet connection is required
2) no single player (there is a tutorial, so why no single player, cause most of the game could be done with AI Bot)
3) headset only (No text chat) 
3) The Multiplayer hosts games are mostly filled with Asian's, nothing wrong with that, yet when the team mates dont speak the language u do, you are very screwed, seeing u can not even send a simple text chat to communicate if you dont use headset. 

so this is my experience so the game
my first try at it, i could not even join a host game (this was 60 to 70min in the game), which caused me to simply exit the game, and move on to some other title. afew hours later i came back to the game, and could join a hosted game, the only issue all the games where being hosted in asia, there are a major language issue, let alone if u dont use a headset for voice u can not send a simple text via chat. not speaking the lang did not help what so ever.
 
what is needed 

a single player 
no internet connection
and decentralised multiplayer,
and an upgrade to unreal 5 engine seeing its using the v4 engine.

dont waste your cash on this, cause your not really going to get any joy out of it. until the above is added and sorted. if it had a single player at least i would not ask for my cash back which i am doing after posting this..

It's not like among us where crewmates are not really fun, here you must get your ship out of the freezing wasteland, harvers resources, mind cold and hunger and ofc trying to uncover the thralls, who are fun to play as well, blend in or aggresive, doesn't matter. 

DH currently offers 3  maps + singleplayer tutorial, which is okay. I would like to see some new map though, it could be smaller and give you a different kind of ship and smaller crew so it could be played with fewer friends (lets be honest, who has 7 ppl, who play dread hunger and is willing to join you.) it would be great even for open lobbies and it may shorten the waiting time.
Some sale would help the game too. Because some of my friends want to play it but dont have the money and I feel like people are hesitant to pay 25 eur for a game that has this ""many"" problems.

There is so much more to playing this game, more to discover, more to do, and more ways to play. Not only is playing crew in this game fun, but winning actually feels like it took skill. On the inverse, thrall has countless ways to play. With just three abilities you can innovate play, changing the experience every game for both you and your friends. On top of that, with eight different characters, everyone character is unique and has a place on the team, and makes the thralls betrayal all the more felt.

[hr][/hr]
The game tutorial, from what I sampled, is actually very good. It provided a broad overview of gameplay mechanics, while actually being engaging; most of the time it felt like just a standard game, quickly building me up.

That being said, the tutorial softlocked itself for me about half way through. The tutorial instructs me to climb an ice wall with an ice axe. However, it became impossible to the top of the wall, as the wall would eject you once you got halfway up. Always at the exact same spot too.

I probably tried to make it work for about 10 minutes before saying ""fuck it"" and going to the lobby browser.

English lobbies have been complained about to death, so I'll spare you any repetition, and just leave this at me saying that this has been an issue for me too. However, this is a very minor issue in my opinion, as non-English speakers can be easily kicked from game lobbies by the host.

for some ppl 25-30€ is way 2 much for this, but i could pay 50€. 

(I mostly play csgo, rust, b4b)
No body was cheating (using wh/aim/something else)
Few ""toxic"" ppl was playing, but its okey. you can mute them. i had 7 matches and not single kid was screaming.  

There would be nice add, if this can grow to 12-16 players in same match. 
Guns are overrated and few maps are just ""rush to victory"" if theres atleast 3 playing together and 1 doing some gathering. 


Update @ nearly 60 hrs.
So far i have had almost 90 games. there has been something like 15-20 games that has been very toxic. 
Mostly ppl from states are the toxic ones. 80% of the time is because of pps accent. ""I HATE YOUR ACCENT, PLS STFU"" and then some rubbish how america is the only language(WTF?? uneducated also).

But the positive side after 50+ hours that you can actually find new tactics in every map while the players are different. Some ppl like to play this very slow and some love to play it very fast. 

Poison is sometimes 2 op. but if theres a player who makes antidote like its the only option, the poison kinda gets useless.  (last game i did poison the food 2 times. but there was guy who had atleast 4 antidotes with him everytime i applied poison). :D

Now after 60 hrs i can still say that this has been the best game exp since 2003~.

i think thralls should have like 6 different skills where you can choose 3 for use. 
Cutting out someones tongue (temporary mute, like 10 mins for other player) would be really interesting)


Will update my review when i have +200 hours.

Update @ 300 hrs:

Still the best game exp. I have had. This game should have more maps. But mby mods did read this post.
There is 2 new spells (5 in total). Where you can mute rest of the players and doubleganger. These are very sweet. 
Almost 1 year ago when i started this. The players were from USA/AUSTRALIA/CHINESE. Some European players (1:5). Now theres so many Russian players that almost every lobby has one. Most of these Russian players are very toxic and they will kill you for no proper reason. Also they will afk/quit the game if someone shuts them down. Hope the Russian players will stay in CS:GO/DOTA/ETC, where they can ruin the games for other ppl.",1643660224,1668957150,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,2,True,False,False

I will split this up into 5 separate categories; Appearance, People, Gameplay, Balance, and Monetization.

Lets first talk about the overall appearance of the game. In the lobby alone you can infer right away without doubt that this game took place in a similar time to when the first expedition to the North Pole took place, mainly in the 1900. The lobby itself has you on a coal fueled ship on the side of the dock with a slew of people who resemble salesmen from back in the day. The sky is grey and you can see dozens of chimneys that are bellowing out smoke. The water is brown from pollution as well as there being random objects and items such as nets and boards floating about. The maps themselves are all amazingly designed and exceptionally balanced for both sides of play. Each map I feel lives up to the name it was given. Those being: The Expanse (NEWLY REWORKED), The Summit, and The Approach. All together I feel like the theme and design as a whole are phenomenal and are an 11/10.

Next, lets talk about the people. This is the only category I may even have a problem with. There are going to be plenty of fun people you are going to find and have fun with but you will have to prepare yourself for if you ever meet a troll. The come into your game and basically make it un-fun for both sides of play through their various methods. But the developers have helped this issue with a mute command on people. Once somebody has been muted they will continue to be muted after they exit a lobby. The next time they decide to join you or your friends lobby you can check if they are on your mute list and ask the host or kick them yourself. There are always going to be bad apples in a community, you must just figure out a way to deal with them in a calm respectable manor sometimes.

Now to talk about the gameplay. It is a mix of survival and social deception with a little bit of pvp. There are 2 teams for each match played, the Crew and the Thrawls. The Crew must get their boat from one end of the map to the other and the Thrawls have to stop the crew from doing this. The Crew must gather coal from containers called coal sleds and bring them back to the ship to fuel the boiler, there are other sources of fuel but none as effective as coal. The Thrawls also have the ability to pick up coal but can also grind it down into gun powder which can be used to blow up the boiler if deposited in. Thrawls also can cast spells to slow the crew down but can be a dead giveaway if caught doing so. There is plenty of counterplay to each side and plenty of ways to strategize and play.

Balance is up next now. At the current moment I feel like the game is in a balanced state. There is a win condition with plenty of counter from both sides and a condition for Thrawls not to out themselves. That condition is called muskets. They are powerful ranged weapons that can change the course of a game, but be careful who you give then to for that person could stab you in the back if they are evil. The conditions are clear and with all the other forms of pvp in the game, the muskets can be game ending, but only if you let them be obtained.

Finally, Monetization. This one is short and sweet. Many people complain about cosmetics being so high priced or being stuck behind a pay wall, but in this case, for this game, I do not mind. I would rather receive free content at a slow and steady pace rather than it being locked behind a DLC pay wall. And to mention the only thing that you can pay for besides the game itself is the cosmetics alone. every content update we have gotten has been free since alpha and they seem to want to keep it that way. I completely agree with this method of updates and I hope they continue to do it this way. If they have to implement other ways to monatize their game then so be it. 

At the end of the day, this is a social deception game. You get on it to lie to others. The developers are passionate and the game has a bright future. As long as the people continue to support this game, it will continue to prosper. This is why I would recommend Dread Hunger to anyone who seems interested in it.",1668099407,1668099716,True,7,1,0.540925264358520508,0,True,False,False

As a social deception game like Among Us or Town of Salem the objective is to stop the crew, or stop the thralls and sail out, taking place in a beautifully crafted world. The game can be intense and isn't one to play idle-minded, this is a game that requires you to adapt your method every round if you want to win.

The community is great; those complaining about trolls and non-english speakers just need to do a mic check and make sure your crewmates are the type of people you want to play with, which I find they overwhelmingly are. Lobbies can be scarce at times, but I find it never takes more than 10 minutes to get a good group.

It's a social deduction game at it's core, in the vein of Town of Salem or Among Us, but is far beyond them in depth.  Dread is very reminiscent to me of Trouble in Terrorist Town, a gamemode I sunk hundreds of hours into.  In the sense that being an innocent doesn't mean you're helpless, stuck to doing meaningless tasks while waiting for the imposters to get caught.  You're involved, and if an imposter does creep up on you in the dark, they'd best be prepared, because in this game you are not helpless. 

I got into Dread Hunger in March of this year, and six hundred hours later, Dread is well on its way to being my most played game, and for damn good reason.  I want to talk about the things I love most about Dread Hunger, but I also want to discuss some of the legitimate criticisms I have with Dread, because as damn well done as the game is, its not perfect, no game is.  I also want to address some of the, well down right overexaggerated and unfair if you ask me, flak this game takes.  For the life of me I can't understand why some these issues are blown out of proportion by so many.  As ridiculous as these issues are, they should be addressed, if for no other reason than the dim hope that perhaps an incoming player will have this review to balance against the flood of negative reviews using such baseless complaints to not recommend such a fantastic game.

Dread's gameplay is phenomenal, no complaint there.  The massive variety in approaches one can take to each game creates an infinite number of possibilities that keep each of game of Dread unique and ever changing.  Dread is also a beautiful game, obviously, no one would dare talk smack about that.  And shoot, I'm a history nerd and this game is based in historical event, but, there is an even greater aspect of Dread Hunger I feel trumps all others.  The people.  Dread is a social game, and unlike any other game I have played, the folks I have come across during my time in Dread Hunger are incredible.  The community is of a size where I've met, played with, and recognize, nearly everyone, hundreds of people.  Through that I've met probably fifty people I play this regularly with, several of which I now play other things outside of Dread Hunger with and would call friends.  In no other game I've ever played have I met such fine folks as in Dread Hunger.

I wouldn't give up the experience I've gotten from Dread Hunger for anything.  So it pains me so see so many people not recommend this game, potentially turning away new folks from the incredible experience that I have received.  

So what are the biggest gripes I've seen people have with Dread?  The biggest factors driving negative reviews here?

""There are too many Chinese players joining my lobby""/""Every lobby open is Chinese""/""Chinese players kill/kick me instantly""
Well, obviously, Dread is a social game, and as I've said many times, you can't social deduct with someone you can't social with. Yes, there are more Chinese players than English speaking ones, when you open the server browser for the first time, you will be greeted with a wall of Chinese speaking games and likely won't be able to pick out the English ones.  The server browser has a filter tool, you can choose to only see English language lobbies, it's simple and painless to use.  Yes, Chinese players will wander into your lobby, sometimes accidentally, sometimes on purpose. Dread is a social game, simply ask someone a few questions, perhaps be polite and ask how their day is going, or maybe ask an abstract question such as their favorite breakfast cereal, or their shoe size. You can tell very quick whether or not you can communicate with the person who has joined your lobby. And guess what?  If you can't, or they're being rude, or if you down right just don't like their vibe, you can easily kick them. You don't have to start a game with anyone you don't want to play with.  As for the last critique I've seen in these reviews, obviously a lobby that does not speak English does not want an English speaking player in their games, we've just gone over why. These players are people just like you are, them speaking English does not make them any different than you, they don't want to play with folks they can't understand either.

""The cosmetic dlc is too expensive""
It's cosmetics. They don't affect the game, and you aren't forced to spend your hard earned monies to pick them up.  Yes, they ain't cheap, but what other business model would you prefer to keep Dread's servers and development up and running? Paid characters? Paid updates? I certainly wouldn't, I'll take hat dlc over that any day. You can also get a few just for playing and some of those cosmetics are the best the team have put out so far.

""There aren't enough English speaking players""/""It takes too long to find a lobby""
Yes.  Dread Hunger has a small English speaking playerbase. This is an issue I give criticism on further down in this review.  How does this affect que times? I don't think its that big of an issue, during peak hours I've never had to wait more than five minutes to find a lobby, and during non peak hours rarely more than fifteen to twenty. Yes, that's a bit of a wait and I know some people can be impatient, I certainly can be, but with that wait time you could always do something on the side.  If you aren't a social butterfly, and can't just chat with folks in the lobby while you wait for it to fill, you can always tab out and work on something else in the mean time. I've always got a project or something I can sink some extra minutes in while I wait. Another alternative is to try and change what time you play, if you find you have trouble with lobbies, maybe play at a different time of the day tomorrow. This obviously isn't practical for everyone, and this issue is Dread Hungers largest actual issue. Which is something ain't it? The only real issue Dread actually has is slightly more annoying than average wait times.

""The game is filled with trolls/cheaters""
It's not. Yes there are hackers and trolls, but what game doesn't have them? Dread doesn't have anymore than any other game and I myself haven't run into more than half a dozen cheaters in 600 hours. Trolls are handled very easy in Dread Hunger. Dread has a feature that allows you to mute a player, and they stay muted until you unmute them. With as small a community as Dread has, most trolls don't last long before there isn't a lobby left for them to join.

The only issue I want to bring up myself is Dread's learning curve. Yes, it ain't easy to learn, but to be fair, most good games aren't. Most of the folks in the game are chill and down to spend a game just helping out someone new if you let them know its your first time, but I also recommend looking at videos on youtube. You could always watch mine >:D, but for the best learning opportunity, obviously Plumoe blows it out of the park. If you wanted to watch a video to learn how to play Dread, watch his.

What's my critique with Dread?  What would I do if little ol me was on the dev team? Try and get the game out more.  I know that ain't as easy as it sounds, but trying to get more people into the game, maybe reaching out to content creators to get them to give it a try could be a way to go. I got into Dread from watching a youtube video from early access, made over a year prior to when I saw it and bought the game that day. They haven't picked up the game since and its become so much more in the nearly two years since then.

So should you pick up Dread Hunger? Well yes, duh, why else would I be writing this review? Dread Hunger has given me an experience beyond any other game I have ever played, one I wouldn't give up for anything. Dread Hunger could end up being the best game you've ever played, as it is for me. Maybe not, but, I think at least, you should give it a shot.

Trolls are not a huge problem in this game every now and then you will get one and it is annoying but you kick him after the game and start again it does not happen very often.

BUT
Developers are doing a great job. If you submit a bug with a clip or a match ID it will be fixed. Updates are quite regular(yes, 3-4, maybe even 5 months is regular, just look at the other games). Updates are good and balanced and well tested beforehand not by just company testers and devs themselves, but by experienced players aswell. Developers have completed 2 freaking roadmaps this year(hey valheim, catch up mf).
Community is mostly great, respectful and easy to have a chat and laugh with. Players that have given you bad experience can be easily muted and ignored later, so you don't have to play with them again. There are plenty of streamers and a few great educational youtube channels that will help you understand the game better(one of them actually got me into the game in the first place).

Great game, good community, decent developers and a nice experience. One that I rarely have with games these days.
Ofc there are ups and downs like with every game that players might let you know about in their reviews. But let's face the reality. All the games have ups and downs, especially social deception games, but developers and community are trying together to keep as many ups in the game and to get rid of as many downs as possible.

If you love social deduction games like Town of Salem or Among Us...you'll thoroughly enjoy Dread Hunger. It's got the nuance and smarts required for Town of Salem with the moving around in an open space of Among Us. 

Except unlike those games your tasks are more ambiguous. You have a role, but you also have the freedom to do whatever you want in a semi-open world. To win the game the crew should work together, but the Thralls have tricks to create chaos onboard.

The biggest negative reviews seem to be about the lack of English speaking lobbies. While this is true, there are more non-English speaking lobbies...it really doesn't take more than 5 minutes during peak times...and 20 minutes during off times to find a full lobby. The more you play the more you'll befriend regular gamers and the shorter those wait times will be. 

As for trolls, I challenge you to find a game who doesn't have them. Where there are humans...there will be idiots. The one positive of DH having a smaller community of English players? We sus out the trolls pretty quick. We're like our own community watch. Seriously...we get to know each other and we mute the trolls so we can identify them later.

Most people I have spoken to who are heavily involved in the community have been extremely polite, friendly and have a laugh with one-another at the end of the day. The people amongst the dev team that I have spoken to have also been extremely polite and friendly. 

The gameplay itself feels extremely good, even on my terrible PC. I've rarely encountered bugs, and even more rarely encountered anything game-breaking except for one unfortunate incident. (more on this below)

Obviously, there are those people who are rude and troll but that happens in literally every single multiplayer game. Understanding who problematic people are and simply avoiding them isn't too difficult. 
People always seem to complain about the wait time but I don't personally see any issues. People not playing? I'm sure you have 300 other games in your steam library to play or you can just do something unrelated until more people get on.

One experience, when Doppleganger was first introduced, using the spell would trigger the game to think I was cheating and apply poison to me permanently. Since this would happen anytime I cased it, it became obvious that I was both a Thrall and also very handicapped. When I brought it to the devs, they simply thanked me for the report and fixed it up not even a few days later. This experience 100% pushed my favour onto this game and it's what eventually led to me streaming the game.

It has some flaws aswell, but it's still in alpha, and from what I can tell there are no game breaking bugs, no exploits or hackers. (I've met a few cheaters since)

To me, one of the downsides is that you have two lives, you spawn in a prison after you die, so you can easily snitch on whoever killed you. Most of the killing is done by summoning cannibal attacks, but it's possible to finish the rest off with weapons.

This rewards a rather cowardly playstyle, where the traitors (thralls in this game) hide and call cannibal attacks on cooldown. In 50% of the games, everyone knows who the evil guys are, but they can just make themselves invisible and run away.

Concept: 
Great concept, poor execution. Like many games out there that hype you up, this one gives you the typical let down. The game attempts to cram in every little quirk and feature with only the blessing of cheap duck tape to keep it all together. The maps are large and extensive and the different roles only have very little to differentiate between themselves. 

If you are/going to be a new player in Dread Hunger:
This game is not new player friendly, and i doubt it ever will be, there's very little that's taught to you, and in regards to the community i doubt anyone would be willing to give you a good, detailed tutorial on how things are done in dread hunger. 

If you are an existing player:
For god sakes, if you guys want more players then please get your act together and improve your behaviour, we are here to have fun and to help new players, not to push people away from playing the game. 

Note for developers: 
'Go big or go home' is not what should be the focus for the game, if the map needs to be made smaller then make the ship class smaller as well, may it be a sloop or corvette, but not a frigate. Cold weather vs crew should be something that can be mitigated to some degree, it is not fun having to full on combat cold weather let alone not have the common sense to hunt a wolf for its fur to keep you warm (with or without durability in regards to the fur coat/poncho). As for finding out who the thralls are, i feel that additional clues should be necessary as the commitment for the crew members to help out one another is low due to the poor community behaviour ( for this i recommend and strong reporting system to weed out any undesirables, and an official message in the official discord in regards to community behaviour). 

I know this review is not putting the game in a good light, however i just had a match with some really nasty people and i think this had to be said. I'm not going to allow comments for this review as there are some nasty, toxic pieces of work out there who think cowering behind a screen while harassing someone is ""fun"" or awarding a comment with a clown face is so called ""amusing"". Grow up.

Only to be greeted with every lobby being Chinese and they will kick you if your name is not written in Mandarin. 

Anyways considering the whole point of this game is about social deduction and it's main selling point requires communication. It's safe to say unless your have several friends to play with in a private lobby, you will be hard pressed to actually enjoy this game as a solo player.

I'm glad they reworked a previous map to fix it up, but development lately seems to focus on cosmetics purchased with real money. This is still an awesome game, but I'd like to see them build a new map, add a new spell, or add cosmetics that can be unlocked in-game.
__________________________________________

EDIT (As of game completion, 128 hours)

I still love this game. I do not have difficulty finding English servers. Player toxicity is way down from what it was previously. I 100% recommend this game, I keep coming back to it. I make YouTube videos for this game and no other, because that's how much I love it!

My main suggestion to the devs is, build a thrall tutorial to help new players. Currently, they have to rely on Pedguin's awesome YouTube tutorial. 

------------------------

EDIT (as of UPDATE 1, 75 game hours later): Dread Hunger emphasizes cunning and wisdom over reflexes, which I greatly appreciate. The pacing is good and there are small details that contribute to the atmosphere. The game is tense. When someone does something odd, you have only a moment to decide if it's an accident or treason and act on it. The choice you make could jeopardize the expedition. 

I've seen some comments in reviews about the Brig. When a player dies for the first time, they spawn in a locked Brig and can't take any action except voice chat until another player releases them. This provides an opportunity for them to reveal their murderer - ***which is an intentional design feature***. There are many ways to sabotage the expedition. If you're going to do it by murdering crew, you better have a good plan in place because your victims will call you out!

The game is still seeing active development and devs pay attention to user feedback. I like the Brig, but I do believe it can be improved by providing additional activities to do while you're in there. There are a few quality of life upgrades I'd like to see, and I am salivating at the idea of new content like more maps.

------------------------------

Original review, about 10 hours in: 
""This is a tool of Satan!"" I screamed as I revealed the bone dagger I found. ""Used by demon-spawn to cast blood magic! I will destroy this to keep our souls pure.""

""The priest spawned with a bone dagger - that means he's a Thrall!"" another player, new to the game, cried.

""No, that's not how it works, I'm destroying to show I'm NOT a thrall,"" I explained.

""He's a thrall, get him!"" added a more experienced player who was definitely a thrall.

""No, please!"" I squealed as I jumped off the ship and fled their axes and swords.

Cons Once every now and again you get a greifer or a troll this happens with any game 
but the devs have a great ticketing system which you can use with a simple click of a button and send a report of the match straight to the devs which they will either ban that troll from all public matches or voice chat mute them if they are racist 

Since i have been reporting i have not seen a single troll i have reported back in any matches so the devs must really wipe out the trolls quick
{{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}

Trolls only get wiped for short periods they are starting to come back now

Game has gotten stale maxed all of the characters at 275 hours 

using the same metas over and over to complete the game faster has gotten boring 

Thrall inconsistency when i was new i got thrall often now ive gone 30+ matches without thrall 
currently on a streak of 15 matches i have decided to give up on playing for a while to see if i can get back into it later  THIS REVIEW ABOVE WAS AT 180 HOURS EARLY ACCESS 

Back again at 363 hours last placed back in early access 

Ran into the same problems as back 180 hours ago 

Greifers still ruin games there is still no ban list or kick feature to prevent rejoining

Thrall inconsistancy is still there i have played another 10 matches and still no thrall 

Game now has many hackers inside and very little English speaking lobbies 

Games still not ready and still needs to work out this No Thrall bug

New major updates since july, the last 3 major updates main focal point was to sell overpriced dlc skins, A promise to update Expanse was never full filled and The Approach map is an awful mess.

Nitro Rushing is abused and the complete opposite of team play which is the most vital part of the game. If the devs truly want to fix there game, here is my suggestion.


1. lower the drop rate of gun parts and get rid of muskets.

2. fix Approach, revamp Expanse (particularly make the polar bears more relevant) and make ice glaciers spawn in random locations to make White Out more relevant against veteran players. have crows nest see more clearly during white outs.

3. Prevent nitro rushing by powering low tier cannibal attacks against solo players (have a range of 75-100 meters or something, and less than 4 totems)

if you do those three things at minimum it will make your game playable, but as it is, it's a trash game. The Devs need to put their ass on overhaul for updates to regain their popularity.

To make matters worse, Asian players are completely intolerable to English speaking players, meaning should you even try and interact with their lobbies, you will be kicked. 

Devs are almost certainly aware of the severity of this issue, but due to the fact their population numbers skyrocketed from an average of 300-400 players to upwards of 13000+ players after the Asian launch, it's unlikely they'll ever do anything about it, leaving this game effectively dead in the water in the West. 

If you've got enough friends to get a lobby going, you could give it a go but currently there isn't really any point for anyone who doesn't speak Japanese or Chinese to even go near it.

This game has a few fun bits of gameplay, but getting to them can be tough, and they're overshadowed by the balance issues. 

Newer players will die a lot, and you can have newer players dead for 20+ minutes in some games. It takes a while to get used to the controls, and to learn to manage heat and hunger. Newer players over-prioritise their inventory, the game design doesn't lead you to focus on the objectives which increases the amount of time it takes to learn. Lots of newer players think they're doing well and then suddenly will die (to cannibals, during PvP, to hunger, cold) and so end up frustrated or feeling like they're just not good enough. For new thralls there's no tutorial, and without a nice lobby you're just not going to have any fun. 

The game is not balanced. I have seen a lot of people get upset or angry at their ability at the game, when really it's just that the game is not balanced. 

The way the game enables newer players is that the crew can still win based on three or four crewmates doing all the work. It doesn't require six solid crewmembers, which is fine but causes issues. Once a crew gets to grips with everything, the survival elements become inconsequential. The maps have too many resources and there's no real opportunity for social deduction. It becomes a very poorly put together PvP game, as the only viable Thrall strategy is to kill the crew. 

My high level takeaway is that the game can be fun game for a handful of play-throughs, but often that's because newer players are relying on more experienced players to take them through the map, and the thralls are actively avoiding targeting weaker players. Beyond that, the game is expensive, and the barrier to enjoying it is high. Once everyone knows what they're doing, it gets pretty stale. 
 
On Maps

Approach is effectively unplayable. A crew who knows what they're doing will always get the ship to the end on day 1, or will be most of the way there, fully stocked on repair supplies, multiple stews, and with plenty of weapons. The nitro camp doesn't work, as the marine can kill all the wolves without aggroing them, half the time the bear's pathing means you can just sneak past it, and you don't need everyone to leave the ship to do the nitro. As a thrall, if you aren't immediately slowing the crew down on day 1, your only option is to somehow kill everyone on day 2/3.

Expanse has too many resources. As a thrall you don't have any options other than PvP. You can throw away every single piece of coal on the map, and the crew will still make it to the end. There's so much wood, there's too many corpses spawn coal, there's coal on the left, right, and the middle, so even working together the thralls can't get to all of it first. There's so much food, and the crew gets things done so fast you barely need more than a couple stews. Even just feeding yourself, you never struggle on food or hunger. Spirit walk on this map is not long enough, you can't get far ahead of the crew, and if the ship ever gets ahead of you, you're barely catching up to it every time. It's so easy to just randomly lose as thrall because you're in a cave and suddenly the ship is at the end. The crew doesn't need to kill the bear, and when heading up to the lighthouse the crew can see whether there's anyone waiting for them. They can easily see if the cannibals are still alive, so know whether to expect a trap or not. The only potentially limiting factor on this map is scrap, but the thralls can't do enough damage to the ship for that to ever come into play. If you don't have cannibals (and really, dual cannibals) then someone can leave the ship on day 1 and solo the nitro without ever coming back to the ship. This isn't hard, and means you're very limited on what spells to pick as a thrall. 

Of the three maps, only Summit is even close to being balanced, and even then you're very limited on what you can do. Most people who play this game do it with house rules, intentionally limiting the crew, as otherwise it's no fun. If you don't have a strong play on day 1, you can very easily end up at the end of this map having done nothing as a thrall. You get a little more time at the end to try something, but that's about it.

Thrall strategies

Of the different options available to the thrall, most don't slow the crew down enough to have an impact. You require access to the ship, which you can't do via spells, so you will always be reliant on PvP. If you have to gear up for PvP to access the ship, then you may as well just focus on PvP and ignore anything else. Why bother making explosive barrels if you can just kill everyone? 

Poison is effectively completely useless. There are too many characters who find laudanum, and the time from being poisoned to dying is so long that you can easily go and make an antidote. Boosting the ship to blow it up is so useless it may as well not be a mechanic. You barely damage the ship, and as a thrall you've just helped the crew move the ship more forward with the boost than any lost coal could've been worth. Being slow on food can be helpful, but it only works for so long before you're found out, and not everyone will rely on the chef to make food. 

The biggest issue with any of these strategies is that you can slow the crew down more by killing a character than by attempting to sandbag them. If you kill the chef on day one and take all of their meat, that slows down the stew making process by more than you could've done as a blending chef. If you kill the engineer you can throw away more coal than you ever could via sabotaging, throttling, or overheating. If you kill the doctor and take their healing items, you've effectively done more than poisoning everyone would have.

Being Crew

From the point of view of the crew, this isn't a social deduction game, it's a logic game. If the crew is paying attention to where people are on the map, or on the ship, it's too easy to narrow down sabotages/poisons/lack of coal/lack of food to specific people. If the ship isn't moving enough then you know it's either the Captain, Engineer, or Navigator. If the Doctor doesn't have antidotes then you know it's them. If the Chef doesn't have lots of stew, it's probably them. 

As a crewmate, once you figure out who the thralls are your only option is to PvP, scare them off, and then keep on with the objectives. Once you've deducted who the bad people are, the game just... continues. It's not a social deduction game! It's just boring. Half the time it's not even worth trying to convince people who the Thralls are, as that can slow you down more than just ignoring it until the thrall eventually reveals themselves. 

PvP Isn't Fun

The main problem this game has is the reliance on PvP. Basically all games will eventually devolve into PvP, it's the design of the game and it's not fun. The survival elements are not punishing enough, so thralls can't accidentally get people killed with deniable plausibility. There's too many resources, so trying to slow the ship down does basically nothing. There's too much time, even with messing around and playing badly, most crews finish before the day of blizzard, or on the morning of the day of blizzard. 

I only play this game because I have friends who play it, but it's still frustrating, and even with custom rules we struggle to balance it. 

The current focus of the devs seems out of line with the current issues with the game. The new spells are too situational, the balance changes don't lower the importance of PvP, it just makes PvP harder, and unless the inclusion of cosmetics and ship cosmetics also means a reduction in the retail price of the base game, people will continue to struggle to find public lobbies.

I would not recommend this game until the devs either: enable thrall strategies that are not PvP focused, or create new maps that are more balanced.",1662896849,1662896849,False,35,1,0.714122235774993896,0,True,False,False

It's a fun game for sure, don't get me wrong but with only three maps, one of which is balanced enough to play (Summit), the game gets boring and stale. The Approach and The Expanse maps aren't too balanced I feel. The Approach map is too quick to get to the end, and the Expanse map is pretty heavy on coal, or at least it feels like the crew can get to the end of the map within a day. If the devs added workshop support or some sort of level editor and then focused on cosmetics for sale, I would not complain. With the next update, they are adding an update to the Expanse map which might hopefully make it more balanced, I would like to see more maps, at least two more within the next 2-3 quarters. Even if they are thrown together pretty quickly like The Expanse.

I feel like the thralls need more things to sabotage to slow down the ship, like sabotaging the wheel, or rudder. Maybe a new blizzard spell. The new spells that were recently released (doppelganger, hush) are very lackluster, they aren't viable for thralls with how blend meta is right now. The thralls need more things to do to slow down the crew other than just sabotaging the boiler. Once both thralls are outed to the crew, it becomes much more difficult to slow down the crew, forcing you to PVP to slow down the crew with deaths. It is very risky to do however since you're outnumbered and Cannibal call spell isn't as strong as it used to be.

I love to PVP but I can't blend at all, it just feels like you can easily get outed if you're not pushing the ship or doing your role. If you're doing your role the ship is just going to get to the end faster. It's just too easy to find out who the thrall is if you're half paying attention to the ship.

Not only that, the same people have devepolers' recognition (as some of them were given community roles in the official discord).
[noparse]`  [/noparse] Their deputy community manager brags about his role in public games, promotes his friend that has no real interest in playing the game (like 150h in a year), derails serious conversations by making complete mockery out of any criticism.

[noparse]`  [/noparse] The best highlight for your delusion is the armory.

When you can get a lobby of people who are chill and don’t take things too seriously then the game is brilliant  With plenty of laughs. 

The social deception is great and as a thrall there’s different abilities you can use to help blend in amongst the crew. You have a total of 5 skills but can only pick 3. This adds different play styles and mixes up the game  

Game play as a survivor  is fun and there’s always something to do throughout the game. Whether it’s collecting coal, meat, building weapons or just trying to survive the elements and wildlife. 

Unfortunately though there are some aspects of the game that do ruin it and it’s normally due to the toxic side of the community. 
Toxic and racist behaviour isn’t uncommon and there needs to be a better reporting/ban function added.
There is also the “sweat lords” who take the game far too seriously and if you don’t play the game how they think it should be played or you stick to your role you may be killed instantly. Spending a game in the brig is pretty boring. 

Hopefully the community will grow and we’ll weed out the people that ruin it

This game takes social deduction to video games in the best way possible. Among Us is fun, but this is much more deep, interesting, and challenging. And results in far more exciting betrayal moments. Lots of opportunities to betray and lots of coordination required for the explorers to win. The learning curve can be tough, but I have found players to be forgiving of new players. 

Fair Warning, most of the time I am able to play with 7 other friends. A lot of the issues folks have is reflective of the player base. If this game can grow more in English speaking areas I think this game will skyrocket in popularity.

The game itself is a jewel. It is Among Us on steroids: a social deception game with much more elaborate survival mechanics. It is as immersive as it is engaging; it would be fun even without the bad guys. I’ve dreamed of a game like this for years and it has finally been made! 

The negative reviews mainly denounce how the fanbase was overwhelmed by the Chinese and how the remaining players are toxic. Indeed, 19 games out of 20 are Chinese, so there is something undeniably true about the Chinese overtake of this game. Nevertheless, there remains a steady flow of games in English; I have seldom waited more than 10 minutes for a game to start. Playing in English requires a bit of patience but the game is far from being unplayable. As for the toxic players, my experience is the complete opposite. Sure, players are always tough and often aggressive in-game – which is expected from an engaging social deception game – but they are smart, honest and funny as we discuss the game afterwards. I guess you just have not to take the in-game play too personal. Also, as a new player, all veterans I’ve met were patient and welcoming. The most unpleasant encounters were a few immature teenagers, and yet more teenagers I've met were witty and deadly at this game!

After entering the ship, you see a group of people surrounding the cook girl, so you start the game with a nervous heart. On the first day, you were a good man. After handing over the coal and getting off the ship, you came to Youyi. You ran into the female cook. After a burst of greetings, the cook finished the meat and touched your material bag. Doctor's bag, ammunition depot, and workbench. You stopped the cook and began to question her identity. After her fierce sophistry, you decided to kill her. In the evening, you carry a bucket of coal, a group of iron, a group of wood, and various materials on board. When the cook got on the ship, he began to say that you, a ship of people, all chose to believe the one-sided words of the cook and didn't cook, rather than believe the pile of materials you brought, which ruined your life.

So, you move the coal to the evening. When you come back at night, you find that the cook doesn't cook, the project doesn't move so many pieces of coal, the hunter doesn't hit the bear, and doesn't go up the mountain. The whole journey revolves around the female cook. At this time, you find, If you don't stop this behavior, you will cool the baby bus. So you said to your teammates, don't revolve around that woman anymore, and feel relieved to push the progress. At this time, the cook couldn't sit still and began to say you with her clamped third level mouth, which moved everyone on the ship. As a result, your second life is gone.

Will you run into a lot of Chinese speaking players? - Just filter by English lobbies, it's that easy. 

The scope of this game in very appealing. I think the balancing is done well and overall it's a very beautiful game. This game has provided me some of the most rewarding team based experienced I've ever had in a video game, while at the same time providing some aggravating waste-of-my-time moments.

I've met many players that I've added as friends, simply because the community is - for the most part - positive. Once in a while you run into a toxic player, but again (for the most part), lobbies don't tolerate trolls or toxic players. 

This game is great alone, but can be hard to find a lobby sometimes (expect wait times of 3 - 10 minutes), but games last 30+ minutes on average, so it's not too bad. 

Dread Hunger has a special place in my library as it's allowed me to connect with players from across the world. So in short:

I lost count how many times I had situations where we let people in with either Asian names or rougly 'English' names only to have them start to openly flood the voice chat with Chinese, ignoring those that can't understand it. To make it clear, this happens on ENGLISH lobbies, after they are asked if they speak English and after they are asked to speak English so everyone can understand what they are saying or talking about between one another.

So yeah, if you are from China, this game is for you...if you are from everywhere else and you mainly speak English?

I don’t think it’s a good idea but i have seen tendency through recent updates especially in update 1.12. I mean, players have to teamwork right? It’s obvious we can not win this game or move the ship forward by simply talking/chatting/speaking offhand on the ship just to figure out who is the traitor instead of go out to select materials and fuels. In addition to damage caused by traitors, players then always waste their time just to make themselves confused. And if we are doomed to lose, why would we even start running this game? For fun? In order to meet some annoying players and unfriendly groups? I’m so disappointed and confusing now. It’s a game players need to focus on both words and behaviors, if we don’t act, we are doomed to lose. And we all have to admit we cannot avoid face-to-face confrontation and fps part in this game. We have to realize the difference between this game and werewolf kill, and this kind of difference is the reason why i want to play this game for the very first time. ‘cause i am not a good ‘liar’ and i am more action oriented than words. This update forced and encouraged player to hide and lurk among the crew, but doppelganger is really not friendly to female players because it’s so easy for them to be recognized. And to several friends who wants to play together, this doppelganger is not efficient too. I mean,we can not always play this game alone,right? Then it’s the CD problem. Did the game developer really calculate and consider it? To increase the cool down of one skill by one minute and reduce another by one minute too. Sounds like a arbitrary decision, how could we call it balance fix?

Unfortunately, the community is probably the biggest negative.

Even then some trolls will occasionally slip through and it only takes one griefer/thrower to make a match unplayable.

It’s worth the time investment I would say. It’s satisfying spending all match with the crew only to turn around and blow them all up when they least suspect it.

Addictive 
Great unique art style 
Polished mechanics despite being in early access 
Immersive level design 
Kind and caring community (great for making new friends)
Developers listen to the community 
Every match is different from the last 

CONS: 
Deception tools are very easy to counter when with an experienced crew making it a choir to play as a thrall encouraging a PvP style of play 

My favourite game and the most played game this year 9/10.

Update 1.1.0: New update has came out making it easier for thralls to blend especially in experienced games with new spells and spell casts no longer leaving blood behind. However with the update has come some nerfs to early PvP but this option still seems strong but I am told there will be another early PvP nerf.

I can see very clearly that the devs continue to listen to the community even though the suggestions channel has been removed the suggestions are still being implemented big props to the devs for incorporating these suggestions even after early access!",1637934069,1656693874,True,12,0,0.604206681251525879,0,True,False,True

So I played this game since the very beginning and have to admit that I started to gain trust issues with everyone I talk to.
And another side effect is that I learned to speak Chinese in coherent sentences, since these pro players took over most of the servers.

leaving a trail of water marks.
Yellow-green aurora above the mast,
Through the storm, through the winter,
Slit the night sky above the North Pole in September.
Dismantle the broken body of the companion,
hide your anger in your chest,
All that remains is deception and concealment,
war and betrayal,
and that sharpened bone.

We want to escape,
We want to resist,
We want to live.
Back in the bustling city, brag with colleagues in the bar.
Back to the warm hometown, memories to find great exploration.
The icy water can't beat a group of navigators!

Lord, our road ahead is bright with your blessing!
Lord, forgive the slaughter we cause in self-preservation.
Oh God……
Have you forgotten the believers on the edge of the world?
Prayer won't save me,
Your former believers will help us!

Glory cannot cover up the wounds of adversity,
Medals cannot hide the terrible frostbite,
Fighting cannot save the abandoned gay of the Empire.
The way to explore is right under your feet,
Put down your gun,
In desperation you can no longer show off.

Sharp arrows break through the shackles of the air,
fly freely,
hit hard
The heart of the beast, and the unbreakable glacier.
You are never bound,
Nor will you be bound.

The interweaving of lights and civilization,
Exploration and broadening of horizons.
A seasoned explorer never encounters a desperate situation,
Even if everything is desperate.
Bullets from nowhere,
Howling, furious, through your arrogant and antiquated chest.

You brought back the corpses of one companion after another,
You saved them again and again,
Succeed, or fail.
Opium tincture shields pain,
The hand saw cut off their frostbite,
It also cut off their will to fight.

Your destiny is doomed,
Numb, funny.
tired, tired,
A solid chest can no longer hold that
proud, high-spirited
The heart of exploration.

The hungry mouth will devour you,
Empty hell unleashed demons,
Every long echo is the torment of the soul.
You will no longer be troubled,
Even if the sea is no longer attached,
The icy snowflakes will also be your end.

search again and again
It is always difficult to pass through the frozen water,
Can't penetrate the blinded heart.
Looking back on the past,
Could it be that it was just the will of God in the shadows.",1656188589,1656190738,True,3,0,0.502504825592041016,0,True,False,False

then lets talk about HURTFUL words to those people who wanna buy this game

first. The server is sooooo easy to be attacked by hackers. so you may lose connection ANY TIME

second. the players in china are not friendly
(y? if u dont speak chinese, then dont join the chinese lobbies, or u will be kicked out soon)

third. bugs everywhere.

Humanity is wide and large and filled with different and beautiful cultures and people, but the fact remains that language is one of the largest barrier between different people. If one can't understand the other in a social game like this, how are you two able to play well? It works for other titles that don't require or uses minimum verbal communication but for this game, a separation between US servers and HK servers is not a question about racism, it's simply about playing the damn game like it was meant to be.

you can build totems at the end of the map, where people can destroy the totems, like 15 totems before the 2nd day, = you are cheating. (ok i spent a whole day to grab 15 bones and 45 woods and dropped everything else before first night)
20 arrows with lantern to grab all the human meat before 2nd day to make thralls suffer starving = you are cheating. (this is why i never go back to the ship, cuz first day there are at most 12 cannibals attack me together at the same time, i can handle that with 20 arrows and my axe)

And after 25 totems made, they asked me why there are like 2 cannibal calls and then another white out within 30 seconds? man its just the game machinic even my teammate can prove that the power charged that fast = we are both cheating.
On the approach map, i grabbed 4 nitros before 2nd night, and wait for the ship, nitroed the ship 4 times = you are cheating you cannot carry 4 within 1 route. but you can grab one drop one,
I made 5 poisoned syringes , all i need to do is to poison 1 stacks of  5 Laudanums by using 3 herbs, and grab 5 scraps. then everyone is died = you are cheating you cant make 5 poisons before the first night.
""how can you see me in the dark""= you are cheating, man, my gamma is 3.
""how did you kill 2 waves of T3 cannibals at the same time"" = you are aimbotting, bro i nitroed half of them. and I spent 100 hours on practicing that.

You guys need to learn something from chinese lobbys instead of being racist like "" you learn from chinese lobby but they all cheaters"". Like WTF it is very useful and you dont wanna me use it then i will tell everyone what i learned to against you!

I'll start off by saying that I was permanently banned with 200 hours played, with no ban reason provided and no reason that I can think of. Any attempts to contact the devs/staff have been met with silence via their ticketing system on the official site. I was also permanently banned from the Discord server with reason ""N/A"". There is no official appeal process so it's very difficult to get an answer to your issue, as I've seen in discussions/reviews here already.

Don't let the steam charts fool you - the game is currently 9th in concurrent players at the time of writing, but I would estimate that 99% of these players are Chinese, potentially more. This isn't an issue in itself, but if you play outside of the peak NA East hours, you WILL struggle to find an English speaking lobby, often waiting 20+ minutes and giving up. During this time, countless Chinese will join your lobby, requiring you to kick them every time as they rarely leave on their own accord. As you can imagine, this gets tiresome. But if you mention this to the devs or in the Discord, you will receive the response ""ROFL just kick them lol?"" and the conversation instantly killed with you receiving a timeout. The devs make no effort to give lobby hosts more moderation control, outside of kicking (such as optional region/language lock). 

The game itself is a hidden gem. It's a brilliant experience and I can't really draw comparisons to any other game as it is very unique, some call it a blend of Sea of Thieves + Among Us. There are endless ways to play the game and strategies to come up with, every game is truly different. It's worth noting that you MUST have a microphone if you want to play this game with any kind of decent experience. There is no text based communication system, which I think heavily benefits a game of this genre. If you manage to get into a game without a mic, chances are you will be killed relatively quickly due to your lack of communication. Again, this is not a bad thing - I actually think it's good, however it has to be acknowledged.

I've noticed some other reviews mentioning the abundance of trolls, I'd say it's not really an issue. You get the occasional lobby where there's a troll or 2, but lobby hosts tend to cotton on. Since the English speaking  base is so small, these players are often logged and get insta kicked from any lobby in future.

It really is a shame that such a great game is ruined by the devs' moderation style. They truly treat it like their own personal project rather than a public product that people are paying a significant amount to play. When I first got the game I saw reviews of other people saying the same thing, and thought they must be exaggerating. And for a while it seemed that way, until it happened to me. I can't bring myself to recommend the game for this reason, if the devs/admins were more transparent and professional, this would be an entirely different story.

I've left comments open if you have any questions you need answered.

EDIT: The staff have now decided to unban me, however the review will remain unchanged. It is ridiculous that the only reason I have been unbanned is because this review gained so much traction and started affecting their income.

EDIT 2: Hahahaha what? The ""temporary comms ban"" is for 10 games, not a specified time. So it's essentially impossible to play this game?

EDIT 3 (15/06/2022): Hi friends and readers, it's been a long time since I wrote this review and nothing has really changed. I did manage to get rid of the 10 game comm ban by changing my name to Chinese and hiding in their lobbies!

There are less English speaking players than ever, more trolls and cheaters than ever. There hasn't been a single major update since I wrote this review, but they did patch a glitch that lets you run around on the docks before the match starts, so silver lining and all that. At least we have more cosmetics coming out!

Same story as the main review, gameplay is great, concept is great, staff not so great, lack of players not so great, lack of updates not so great.

To the devs: If you are reading this, please take note of this and all of the other reviews. Recent reviews are now mostly negative and overall reviews are now mixed. You have to stop pretending like there is no issue, and divert your attention away from creating an echo chamber for yourselves where everything is just fine. This game will die if there aren't major changes very soon, and despite my criticisms I do not want this game to die as it's my favourite game currently.

More hardcore survival mechanics and depth to strategy for experienced players makes for quite an enjoyable time with friends, it's just a shame for OCE that it only has Asian and NA East servers despite the fact that the developers are from New Zealand (player demographics consist primarily of people from china. It blew up there similar to how among us blew up in the western world). It's not the kind of game that requires low ping really, other than for the occasional shot with a gun on a moving target, so it's not a dealbreaker. 

I feel like the learning curve is pretty steep and requires a group that is fully willing to work as a team when crew. Without that, you're going to struggle to see why the game can be so great. Expect initially to lose a lot as crew - especially on the two harder maps - merely from the environment with minimal effort from the thralls. I feel like this could be balanced better so that you can still win as crew more often while you're learning the ropes.

The amount of times we've played as crew up until a certain point and realized there's no way to redeem ourselves, yet feeling like we still have to spend the last 10 minutes [i]trying[/i] to succeed feels too frequent. Thralls can fully die mid-game and still cause a snowball effect that leads to a crewmate loss (at low skill levels atleast). It feels like a waste of time to have a clear win stripped from you simply because you don't quite have the meta strategies nailed yet. I'd personally prefer that thralls are the more direct cause of a loss, rather than a lack of knowledge. The win/loss ratio as crew relative to skill level should imo remain moderately consistent as your group becomes more experienced, rather than being heavily thrall-sided initially. Especially since as thrall with a new group there isn't much of a necessity to do anything, as the crew will gimp themselves just fine. To be fair, there are modifiers for varying mechanics such as hunger rate and days before blizzard, but you miss out on gaining exp when using those, so I don't know if it's a good idea to intend for new players to use game modifiers when they first start playing. I think default settings should be balanced so that noobs don't have to do that.

I can't speak about public lobby experiences but I imagine they're dogshit lol. Aesthetic is on point. Has some unique mechanics thrown in there also. Overall, it's a well-made game, and my group enjoys the game a lot, so if you actually have enough people to fuel a decent-sized lobby, I think it's safe to ignore the negative reviews.",1655034658,1655103433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One thing to note is that for new players learning Thrall is very hard. Some people will get frusrated about teaching others how to play since there isn't a good tutorial. But the basics are; it currently takes 3 wood and 1 bone to make totems. Use the same command to build campfires pressing ""q"" to make totems. Press ""c"" to activate bone dagger to cast spells. Crew has a decent tutorial build in the game and it's simple and fun to learn.

most people in reviews complain about how the majority of the players speak only chinese(and a little about no region lock), but there is a language lock and usually these games actually speak english and if you make sure the server is nae and the ship name(the person who made the lobby) has an english name

One of the positives of this game are the many different ways to play it(mostly for the thrall but crew has some different ways to play also), as a thrall you could blend in the whole game, doing small things to sabotage the crew and then blow up the crew when you are about to blow up the iceberg, or you could poison the crew(including just legit leaving posioned tea and people WILL drink it, poisoning the stew or just using poisoned syringes), there are alot of other ways to play it but there are alot so im going to move on

Another positive if the gameplay when playing as the crew, unlike other social deduction games(project winter not included) as the good guys you are usually just doing tasks and keeping track of people to see if they do a kill, in dread hunger you need to worry about food, cold, cannibals(some monsters the thralls summon), poison, nitroglycerin(i cant spell it), wild life, thralls sabotaging the boat, thralls framing the crew(for example killing someone for being suspicous and planting a thrall only item on them).

Well, how disappointed was I. This game was shilled out to the chinese, and it's like the only thing in this game. I haven't found a single english speaking match and I have been targeted by chinese speaking players either being booted, or trolled.

Oh, and these 'cosmetics' are payed for, at a stupidly high price. 12 DOLLARS FOR A ANIMAL MASK!?!?!, 6 FOR A FEW NAUTICAL HATS? Oh, my god I was going to be hyped if maybe SOME of these we're free, but no all of them are paid for.

A much bigger issue is that there is no way to tell who is talking.

I loved the idea.  And the game is very functional, no crashes or bugs or anything...   it's the learning curve that did it in for me!

First match I was murdered right away because I didn't know the social rule that you put coal in the burner.  Next match I died trying to keep up with the ship and freezing in water.  When I explained how I died, nobody believed me because apparently I was also supposed to make it back to the ship that first night.  I kept telling people that I was new, but that was getting old.  There were helpful players and YouTube videos, but that only helps so much.  Then, even if I eventually got the hang of it, I'd need to convince several friends to pay and encounter that same steep learning curve for it to be fun.  Too much...  

In my opinion, the developers really should have included a 4-player starter map that only appeals to beginners and has no Thralls so you can practice survival and an AI map for learning to be a Thrall.  The tutorial was helpful but it wasn't enough.  The small inventory and questions of ""what am I *supposed* to be doing"" were a constant problem.  Even just knowing who was speaking could get confusing.

The concerns about too many non-English speaker players turned out to not be much of a problem for me.  There's an option to filter games by language, and although there weren't a lot of English-speaking lobbies, only later at night did it start to mean a big delay in getting into a game.

There's an issue with the matchmaking though. There are a lot of Chinese lobbies and no way to filter them out other than just not joining them. It's also pretty difficult for new players to learn the game because experienced players will often kick when they realize the new players don't know what they're doing, this makes it difficult but not impossible to play against randoms.

It is so insanely easy to win as a thrall. And you don't even have to be smart about it. 

I've just had a match in which we made it to the iceberg the very first night. Only to then get completely smashed by whiteouts and hordes of cannibals as the two thralls had been building totems at the beginning of the map and calling in spells while coordinating so there cooldowns overlapped leaving us in an almost endless whiteout with cannibals called every 2 min.

I do the same if i want to win with  certainty. It is  quite easy to totem spam and win while not talking to or seeing the survivors at all.

If you hold off on playing this because of those issues, recognize that the only way to fix it is to come play! Can usually find a game within 15 mins even when a new lobby starts and you wait for it to fill up. As for the game itself, it's pretty great. There will obviously be continued tweaks for balance and mechanics, but the framework is fantastic. The social deduction aspect really takes a backseat to the fact that the world is trying to kill you all the time already and it's not easy to just work together and get the ship through the passage. Don't try to play this like streamers play Among Us. Instead, play it like it's a survival game because 95% of the time, the thralls will reveal themselves without you making accusations. They have s**t to do too and it usually becomes very obvious who isn't helping.  Community for NA has been wonderful lately and very supportive of new players. Incidents of people straight up giving a thrall a second chance when they screw up as a new player are not uncommon (not throwing the game, but letting people learn is very important). People stick around to play multiple games very often so you can just chain games together. I might only have a few hours played, but I have hundreds of hours watched. I don't know about these complaints about cheaters and exploiters as I've not really seen it happen, but I know gamers cry about those everytime they don't understand lag, desync, and skill diff so make your own decision.

Playing as one of two thralls (imposters) and killing the 6 innocent crewmembers gets both intense and exciting.

You constantly have access to thrall vision which allows you to locate anyone on the map and plan your next move.

You can sink the ship by using powderkegs or steering it into icebergs and dry land.

You can poison the crew by sticking them with a syringe filled with poison or applying said poison to an ingredient they're planning on using for a meat stew.

There's a bunch of weapons aswell for both ranged and melee combat.

The main weapons for the thralls are their special powers which are really satisfying to use. These powers are fueled by building totems in areas where you think the crew won't find them. They speed your regen for the charges you can use for abilities. There's 3 charges max and each charge will make your powers stronger.

Spiritwalk makes you become invisible and invincible and allow you to zoom across the map at high speed while being unable to interact with anything or using your weapons. 

Whiteout rolls in a thick fog which makes it really hard for the crew to navigate through the ice without hitting icebergs or land and distort orientation for crew looting for coal and other supplies.

Cannibal attack sends a horde of cannibals after a crewmember selected through thrall vision.

Doppelgänger is a new spell soon to be added which will allow you to shapeshift into a crewmember and cause maximum confusion and mayhem. Really excited for this one.

When playing as crewmembers your main objective is to fuel the ship's boiler, navigate it through the ice out to the open seas which is blocked by an immense iceberg at the end. The crew has to find nitroglycerin to blow this badboy to smithereens.

There's alot more to the game and problably some things I forgot but these are the things that came to mind.

Haven't had a single moment where I couldn't find a full english lobby.

Most of the community is great and fun to play with, as I can recognize some people and they also recognize me with time. 

In my experience playing, most of these negative reviews blow mostly everything out of proportion or are outdated. Is the game mostly chinese players? Yes. Is it impossible to find a lobby if your not chinese? Absolutely not. Worst case scenario is a few minute wait for a lobby to fill up. In my experience, there is always an open lobby that will speak english (if you have your filters on, which im sure is a massive reason people claim about having to wait so long) and 99% of lobbys WILL mic check you to see if you speak english or not. If the player doesn't, they will be removed for an english speaking person to join. This also means that yes, a mic is basically a requirement if you are going to get this game as there is basically no way to communicate without a mic, which makes it extremely hard for everyone on your team, even if you're a thrall. 

In my 20 hours of playing so far, I've only encountered a single troll and 0 hackers. The troll made it very clear in the first minute that they were trolling. When that happened, the lobby was quickly restarted and the troll was removed. You will rarely see people just killing other people for no reason. If they are found out to be doing that, they will be quickly removed. There have been absolutely no obvious cheats or huge game breaking exploits in any of the games I've played, like most of these negative reviews claim. 

The game definitely has extreme potential, with replay value already being decently high for the content in the game already and a roadmap telling us all the new things coming. The only thing major complaint I have is the pricing on the cosmetics, in which their costs are extremely questionable to say the least. I would highly recommend you to get the game really if you have the spare funds, and then definitely get it if it were to go on sale. I'd also highly recommend watching some starter guides to know the basics before you start playing, as there is a somewhat steep curve when starting.",1650518618,1650518618,True,16,1,0.626280784606933594,0,True,False,False

In the current state, I do not recommend this game. The player counts are on average 16K when i right this, but nearly no English servers are open, with you often waiting to find a lobby for 10-15 minutes. That itself isn't bad, its the Griefers that really make this a terrible experience to make work. I'll give you a hint, anyone with Asian characters or non-sense names, ask them for a non-soundboard-able answer. If they don't respond or can't, kick them. If you don't expect to play this 6 V 2 game as a 2 v 6 regardless of your team. 

This game has become wildly popular overseas and normally I'm happy for that, but this has lead to games where you have 4 stacks of people killing everyone before the first day is over (There are 5 days).

If they do in future find a way to stop this immense griefing, It really is very much fun. a lot of possible routes for deception, or even just full blown villainy if you want. the maps provide large variety of play styles their own locations of value. The time mechanics mean that the Thralls benefit from delaying whenever possible, as any slowdown to how quickly a crew travels the map means more and more likely-hood of crewmates winning, while also allowing for one large play to turn the tide of play from either side. Despite that its also very much possible for 1 Thrall or 2-3 Crewmates to nearly single handily win a game so one or two bad players rarely results in an un-fun game.

However, again the things outside the game-play itself make it just not fun. I do love this game when it works, but I'm not gonna spend 15 minutes looking for a game, just to die to 4 people who kill and toy with everyone.",1650492206,1650492206,False,4,0,0.504661977291107178,0,True,False,False

Perfect combo of Among Us/Mafia-like gameplay and Survival. Both fun as an imposter and crew member. Fun to play, fun to watch on twitch. The only problem is to fight your fear of using voice with randoms.

Update on April 2022:

Haven't played for pretty long time since EA, then read new reviews and I'm pretty dessapointed now. It seems like bans, community management and matchmaking system is out of control and not fair to players. Here's some of my thoughts:

- You shouldn't be banned for being mean and cunning in the game where you supposed to be mean and cunning.
- Devs should put more effort into matchmaking system and clean UI when you pick server with certain language instead of just ban people for no real reason (in the game and Discord).
- Greefing should be handled by players in the game, not by banning people (if you attack someone for no reason – it's up to players what to do with you, they can just put you in jail for bad behaviour. Maybe you are imposter and it's your tactics to sabotage the team and make a disctraction.
- Kicking player that don't speak English from English lobby is not racism. It's a game about communicating in voice chat, so having even 1 non-english player ruins the game for the rest 7 English-speaking people (or any other language that is on the server). Devs probably don't understand that half of players don't bother seeing what lobby language is, they just come to lobby and just wants to play. No quickmatch option? Make clean UI and warnings that lobby is for that language, and if you don't know that language, you should pick another lobby or create your own.
- You shouldn't be banned in the game for posting a bad review on Steam (is that even legal?).
- Cosmetic DLCs (rings and hat skins) looks like a money grab at the moment since devs should put effort in fixing Mixed reviews. I understand that it's different things, but it shows what is more important for developers at the moment.

Hope, devs will remember why they made this game in the first place, will stop ban nonsense, revamp matchmaking and UI so English players play with English players, Russians with Russians, Spanish with Spanish, Chinese with Chinese etc., unban vaterans who played 60-200 hours and get deserved positive reviews. So far all that looks sad to me.

I still recommend to play this game, because it's fun and interesting, but do it with your own squad of 8 friends for best experience. Being banned for playing the game as intended (distracting, lying, sabotaging etc.) on public servers is not worth it.",1620611839,1650309343,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is a game that benefits greatly from the ability to make private lobbies. The people I have met while playing this game has changed my overall outlook on online gaming and has provided proof that video games bring people together. My day to day interactions with people IRL have improved greatly from playing in these lobbies. 

It has a rising cult following in the EU and NA. Public lobbies have been evident of this as plenty of people flock to the NAE servers. The people in these lobbies are usually great to play with, with the odd exception. In recent months I have never struggled to find a lobby. It is amazing to see how this game is gaining velocity among Chinese players, despite the influx of confused players into English speaking NAE lobbies. 

A current issue is the occurrence of DDOS attacks, which have been aptly dealt with, being reduced to only a mild inconvenience for players. 

The roles are designed well and I can honestly say I've had fun playing each different one. At the time of writing this review there are 3 maps, each of which provide players with a unique experience with the opportunity to act out many different strategies. Every game played always feels fresh. 
The Tutorial - is a great way to introduce new players to the mechanics. It has some bugs but overall provides everything it needs to. I enjoyed playing it despite having already played a lot of the game beforehand
The Approach - works as a great map for beginners and experienced alike, it is often seen as a map weighted towards crew victory however in my experience it is balanced that thralls can also have an enjoyable time.
The Summit - the first map to introduce bears as a mob. It is generally considered the most popular map among players, this could be explained by how balanced the map is, the games on this map never feel one sided and are often decided in it's final minutes. 
The Expanse - the latest of the maps, has quickly become a personal favourite of mine, it was the first map to introduce random cannibals spread around the map and is the map that gives every role its own time to shine.  

It has been great to see communities forming around this game and people coming together to discover new strategies and creating their own speedrunning category. 

The developers have made a solid game and the rising player count shows. It is obvious that there is a lot of passion behind this as frequent updates are able to keep the game both fresh and balanced.

The game can be played. an infinite amount of times. as long as the player base exist. Its rather counter productive and unprofessional to be banned over such petty situations.

literally make big brain plays, troll  your friends and family, challenge your intellect as you try to outwit the enemies, and maybe even your own friends with Dread Hunger.

Bringing Psychological Horror, deductive reasoning, to a entirely different level. 

The game is always being worked on, updated, the DEVS are a real good bunch of people.

Don't let other people get in your head when you play the game.  If you are thrall (imposter) and people give you crap for playing your role (kill, betray, sabotage the game to win) because that is how you play the game.

Some players like to troll for fun, there are different degree's of trolling, some minor and friendly for laughs, others are ruining the game round from sabotage.  DON'T WORRY, game ques are fast, matchmaking isn't too bad.  Make friends and expand your network for even faster games.

The community has a ton of guides to help you learn the game, at an accelerated rate. So don't be shy to head over and check them out.

Pros: If you have a 'good' game its a fun game. (no gamebreaking bugs, players all speak your language and communicate, no cheaters / afk players no lobby crashes etc)  

Cons
-English speaking lobbies are endangered in this game. 
-Cheaters everywhere, can literally download cheat engine and turn on the speed hack np. Only way you'll get banned is if you get spam reported and devs notice it on recording. 
-frequent bugs, From 'flying' polar bears,  clipping and then drowning under the ship.
- lots of 'invisible walls' that will stop your projectiles
-After 100+ hours you will probably struggle to tell which players are genuinely bad and which are trolling. 
-the price, if it was a $10-15 game with $3-5 dlc that would be fine but the current price isn't worth it.

Game replayability. As a thrall, you can almost ALWAYS win a game... 
I have played now, 13+ hours into this game, I have never won a single game as an ""explorer"". The game balance is far too difficult for the players who arent trying to be sabotaged to win.... You need to basically have an invincible health mod to win. If you dont die by the cold, lack of eating food... you die by thralls, the relentless zombie attacks, the relentless onslaught of bears that guard the item that normal players need to finish the map. It is NEXT TO NEAR impossible to beat this game as an explorer, the cards are WAY TOO stacked in the favor of the saboteur. I would ask, beg, plead, with devs, to make the base game without any modifications, more balanced to give players a chance to actually finish the game...............................................

Original review on September 15, 2021: Community is as toxic as Rust. I have a lisp and cannot play a game without some immature guy mocking me the entire game, or dedicating his whole game to killing me even if we are on the same side. I have a friend who's a female gamer. Every game we played in a night (around 5) she got hit with rampant sexism. It was the same with another female player I played with - two players being blatantly sexist as soon as they heard a female voice. The amount of bigotry in the game is REALLY disappointing and disheartening.

Reporting does nothing. This is a small game where you play with the same people over and over again. And they are always toxic. You can maybe make one friend but you guys can't even talk because the chat is filled with harassment.

And when the solution is to mute players in a social game -- that's not a real solution. We need to be able to communicate for this game to be fun. The meta-game of managing toxic players ruins this game. I love this game. I love what it can be with a good lobby.

Clean up your player base. It's terrible. The game is great, but a night can totally be derailed by a few dedicated, persistent trolls.

Edit: To the devs - I understand that it's easier to take action if I record and send in videos, but that same process put me off of Hell Let Loose. It's exhausting to go back through this frustrating game footage and spend more time on what was a wasted game (because trolls ruined the fun). I want to help - but it's really exhausting on my psyche. I've resorted to making a blacklist of people I know will sabotage games or be generally toxic.

It may be easier to add in Private Lobbies, since many of us who enjoy games together are adding eachother as Steam friends. Or even an ability to lock/unlock a game - so you can start with friends and open the last couple of slots to randoms.


*Update on October 3, 2021: Playerbase is still incredibly toxic. Whether it's the blatant toxicity, or someone giving a ""historical"" lecture for 15 straight minutes on how Finland is terrible, because we had a Finnish player in the lobby. There's also the toxic veterans you find in all games - who think the game would work perfectly if everybody else would shut up and listen to them.

This was actually encouraged by a recent major update that overhauled loot. Before, a loot container could often surprise you - it could have some items you wouldn't expect to find in it, like a gun part or poison, etc. The recent update made loot much more predictable, so it's easier for veterans to say things like ""I saw you took these two things so I know you have X in your inventory."" It completely ruins the deceptive nature of this game when players can focus so hard on the knowledge of game systems. It also makes the game much harder for new players, and much easier for veterans. And it removes the need to sometimes trust or be suspicious of someone.

Basically, the game made a lot of aspects less ambiguous, and as a result the gameplay is much more strict. The social deception part of the game is really weakened, because experienced players know how to ""rush nitro"" aka speedrun the game and ruin the parts that make the game actually fun. And they like to yell at anyone who doesn't immediately agree with them. This sort of toxic dominance in the game is going to spoil the game's culture (which is already pretty bad). Instead, the devs should looks to create more moments of cooperation and trust, and therefore opportunities for betrayal. The nitro rush is really killing the game.",1631739021,1648182111,False,33,22,0.554686784744262695,1,True,False,False

Game 1- ran in a random direction where a camp of old slaughtered sailor, not sure what i was looking for i found the doctor the marine and the captain which the captain start screaming at us that the marine was actually one of the thralls, I'm thinking wow this is a bit hasty and before my eyes i see the marine slaughtered in front of my eyes. A little shaken up i see the doctor carry the marine off to the bed where the captain follows them and finishes him off, accidentally picking up the head of the marine i begin to run. i find a storage boat and search it which i see my health bar magically going down which i find there is sabre in my back, again i find myself saying wow this is a very aggressive captain. He finishes me off and i'm hulled off to prison in the ship (this is like 8 minutes into the game) so for the rest of the 25 minutes that the game goes on for i become quite close friends with the marine as we talk and he gives me tips on the game mostly on how not to die in the first 8 minutes. the thrall win which turns out to be the doctor and the captain. Surprise 

Game 2- Same lobby i'm the engineer again so i load my coal in the burner and then the marine and i stick together and he asks me if i'm the thrall, I tell him i'm not the thrall and he begins to coach me in game we go a bit of a coal run, come back to the ship a few time. We're out exploring out the back of the map which we see the hunter run the complete other way he doesn't say much and runs off. We then see two totems, after some brief discussion come to the conclusion that the hunter is definitely sus, we begin the run back to the ship. We hear a horn the marine bring to my awareness that we're about to be attacked by cannibals. Armed with only my wood axe we go back to back and start fighting the cannibals, After a brief but ferocious fight there is only one left it downs me. The marine begins to scream ""you're not dying on me today"" he starts sprinting back to ship where the doctor and the hunter route us and kill him.

1. Finding English speaking servers is not difficult at all. When on the expeditions tab, click the button in the top right which will open the language settings, and set it to only English. If you do this, you will see almost only the English games you can join. (Just make sure to check that the server is hosted in NAE, and the name of the person creating the lobby is English, as I have seen Chinese servers in the English queue a few times.

2. Randoms are typically very nice. The first game I played, someone dedicated their whole game to helping me learn the ropes, sine the tutorial is not all that great. I've encountered only two trolls in my ten hours, with one of them being salty and immediately trying to kill me because I won as thrall, and the other just threw away 8 coal as a explorer.

3. For what they plan to release in the future, the price will be worth it, but right now I do agree it maybe should be lowered.

4. I have only encountered one minor glitch where items simply don't appear for you sometimes, and someone else has to pick them up and put it back down.

5. Lobbies in no way take 20 minutes to fill. It's more like five at maximum.

Pros: Typically an extremely good community, although some can get annoyed when you are doing nothing, so watching some videos on the game might be helpful. The gameplay is incredibly good, and either the crew or the thralls could win any match. The upcoming content looks absolutely great.

Cons: The game is mainly Chinese, although it is easy to find English servers with the language settings on the expeditions menu. The tutorial doesn't prepare you to play as thrall, and isn't that good teaching you to be an explorer either. The price is pretty high, but the content coming in the future will make it worth it, and the price drives off trolls who don't want to spend $30 just to annoy people.

As an non-Asian language-speaking player, you will have to spend upwards of 45+ minutes per lobby session routinely kicking hundreds of Chinese players who do not speak English while you wait for those who do. This would not be an issue if the English-speaking players were not such a fringe minority.

Most of the game is overrun by people who do not speak English. This game is primarily about talking so it is difficult to communicate sometimes. The host has to constantly sit there and kick non-english speakers. Several mins later (about 10-20 minutes or more) you are ready to start. It says I have 200 hours of gameplay, probably almost 50 of them are waiting in lobbies for a game to start. 

I also got permabanned for literally no reason. I asked the devs and made a support ticket. I asked for proof of what I did and they said nothing. I think they are permabanning people with zero evidence. This is because this game has zero anticheat and no real moderating system. Lots of toxic people. Hackers that can go really fast and outrun you by running like 10x as fast as you etc. So basically they resort to blindly banning anyone that gets reported. Their customer service department is also outsourced to France. So good luck getting any solid communication back. Lets talk about the report system. You can click on a player in the game and report them from the lobby screen like in many games. You just click on their profile and click report. I was originally told it literally went to a self populating google doc, so essentially it did nothing. Now I think if you reach a max level of reports (presumably 20 I have been told) it bans you forever. This is just plain stupid. If you play the game a lot people might get salty that you betrayed them as  a thrall which is the class that betrays people. Newer players will literally report you if you take them out as thrall. That is not a very nice system. Since there are many many toxic people in this game you will run into this problem a lot. I have reported many people but now I regret it. It didn't do anything except let the game cash grab some people. They clearly like to do that seeing as they charge people money for a single type of accessory item for your character. 

Basically the game got way too big way too fast without them having any idea how to host lobbies or moderate their community. The tutorial for the game is abysmal and does not even tell you how to do the other team so when you actually get that role you just have to learn.  Newer players are like sitting ducks. If you have one or two newer players the crew will normally lose. 

The DLC is a total cash grab. $10 for a set of three hats? They also have no plans on continuing the game after full release until they received significant community backlash. 

My review would have been negative even if I was not permabanned on the game for no reason with no real appeal process. It is a fun and addicting game, however my life has gotten significantly better now that I do not have to play lobby simulator or waste 20 minutes in a game just for it to be ruined by a troll or players who are not equipped at all for the actual game.",1647572639,1647573277,False,35,1,0.647909164428710938,0,True,False,False

They will ban you for many more reasons if you don’t play the game the way they want you to play it, and they have done exactly that.
As per their Code of Conduct ; “We reserve the right to enforce this Code of Conduct and take disciplinary action [u]AT OUR OWN DISCRETION[/u]. Ban evasion is not tolerated.” This normally means bans are handed out selectively based on if the person you slighted has connections to the dev team.
Ultimately this game is like Gmod TTT, except when you inevitably get banned for some reason you can’t join a different server. You're banned from all public servers.
You pretty much need voice to play this game. However, 90% of the people playing this game only speak Chinese, making this game impossible to play because they will just kick you out of the lobby if you don't speak their language.

You are driving a steam engine sailboat and five other good brothers to escape the Arctic with two anti bone cubs,

You only have a rusty command knife and a cup of tea that has seen all the cold and warm in the world,

Your crew are suspicious of each other,

Your royal engineer accidentally threw a coal bucket in when he was burning a boiler,

Your royal navigator doesn't seem to understand the use of telescopes,

Your royal chef will never get together 10 pieces of meat to make a home stew you haven't eaten for a long time,

The ship doctor asked everywhere who moved his doctor's bag,

The Royal Marines begged for gunpowder,

The hunter has been missing for two days to blow up the iceberg,

And reverend, you haven't seen this young man with a shovel since the day you played Texas poker,



Two days before the storm,

You meet the priest on the way to dig coal and start asking about his whereabouts

Suddenly, in the dark, a bow and arrow flew straight into your skull,

Fortunately, the priest didn't dig a flint gun,

You escaped back to the ship with your sensitive walking position and coquettish posture,

You tell everyone on board that the priest and hunter are insiders,

The cook asked for your meal, but,

No one heard your warning,



One day before the snowstorm,

The priest is back,

Your priest told the others that hunters and captains are the insiders,

Others believe it,

Asking why you didn't sail,

How can a young steam engine drive a huge sailboat without coal,

Your crew agreed,

A prisoner woke up,



It's a snowstorm tonight,

No accident, the ship blew up,

The priest disappeared, but no one found out,

You heard that the good brothers on the sailboat are still questioning each other because the code of the armory is incorrect,

At that moment, you were tired, so tired,

As if you were the only one in the Arctic who wanted to return to London,

And between you and London,

Separated by an iceberg,

Two bears,

And five ""good brothers"" you can trust,

You start to wonder whether the cold water of the Arctic is pouring into the ship at this time,

Or into your crew's mind,

At that moment, you were confused,

What on earth do people live for,

Is it to go back to London?

I don't think so,

Your crew told you by action,

I told myself I'd never eat human flesh... but you don't know what it's like!! Out there... in the arctic weather. The cold... The hunger... I never knew one could get so DREADFULLY HUNGRY.

Incredible game of survival and betrayal. No two games are the same. As thrall (traitor) there are so many different strategies, beyond straight up attacking when the time is right (which is always fun if timed correctly)- blending in with the crew and poisoning them, sabotaging the ship, getting them to trust you and falsely accusing innocent crew members, dispatching them one by one. Or hiding from the crew and calling in attacks from a distance, picking off stragglers you catch alone. As crew you've got to be on top of things and chugachug your way through the ice fields quickly before the storm/ blizzard comes and you die of cold, or the thralls find some other way to stop you and send you to a freezing/ watery grave.

I've had hours of fun on this, the only issue I've had is getting people's schedules to line up/ getting enough people to own the game (cause the price point is an initial barrier) because it is an absolute blast with friends, I've had full 8 player lobbies with friends a few times and it's been amazing, though it's still doable with 6 or 7 (with adjusted settings). That said, although public lobbies can be very hit or miss I've met some cool people in random lobbies. The player base seems to be increasing and I've had some great games there too so I wouldn't discount that if you have a hard time getting a big group together.

Personally am quite the critic of social deduction games. In saying that, I think Dread Hunger has really brought back the genre. Since everyone loves comparing the game to among us, I'll do that for simplicity's sake. Unlike among us, where the crew either knows or doesn't know who the ""imposter"" is, in Dread Hunger, suspicion is a real factor. You really have to social engineer your way around the crew as it is extremely easy to lose if they figure out who you are early on. 

Many have complained about the lack of enforcement of character roles. Personally, I don't think the game would be good if you were forced to do your role. After all, two of your eight crew are evil, you'd be stuffed if you couldn't therefore make any food or steer the ship etc. 

People also complain about the prevalence of Chinese players. First of all, get over yourself, other people are allowed to play the game. Second of all, it isn't hard AT ALL to find English lobbies. If there aren't any open, make one and it usually fills up in a couple minutes.

tl;dr buy the game, heaps of fun, best social deduction game I've played in a long time.",1645526618,1645526618,True,15,0,0.61945033073425293,3,True,False,False

The main goal is for the crew members to escape the map via blowing up an iceberg and collecting coal to fuel the ship. However, unbeknownst to the crew, there are two ""imposters"", called Thrawls, that are actively trying to kill the crew and sabotage the ship. The Thrawls have special abilities and there is a survival aspect to the game as you require warmth and food to remain alive. Collect materials and craft items/consumables that will help you along the way. Overall, the game has a solid base and a pretty unique taste to it. The game only gets more fun with friends. The devs seem to care and are adding improvements, updates, and new maps somewhat often. The price is pretty high for the game in its current state, but I see this game improving to that $30 price tag in the near future.

Dread Hunger at its core could be a fantastic game. As it stands it is a complete dumpster fire. 

The ""social deduction"" tag is a lie, as the only real way to play as thrall is either the distance game massing totems and spamming whiteouts and cannibals, or just kill people asap and steal their stuff. The second one is compounded in stupidity by the fact that you can throw a bear trap ""under"" someones feet and they are trapped for 5 seconds. No one survives this. 

Blending in with the crew is practically useless and the points/win ratio reflect this. Sabo'ing the boiler rarely works as people will just slow feed coal. Sinking the ship is damn near impossible with how slow it sinks now, regardless of how many bombs you use. You can use ten but there's a maximum amount of holes allowed so the sinking has a max. This has led all crews to just going up the hill as a pack for nitro as there is no fear the ship will sink before they casually walk up and down the mountain. 

There are a ton of bugs that never seem to get fixed. Bear AI is a joke, people regularly just aggro it and then get it stuck on a wall removing the threat from the game entirely. Even when working as intended one player can solo the bear quite easily with the bow. Players can glitch into walls becoming invincible and shooting out at players. Players can glitch into the end game iceberg stealing any nitro placed near it and throwing it into the water. Me and the people I regularly play with have reported these things constantly for cheating and the players who do it are never banned. One of their discord admins even said to the cheater ""its not cool but its not against the code of conduct."" essentially giving them free reign to cheat.  

There are an endless supply of griefers who will ruin any random lobby you join. We have asked since day one for a ""permanently ban from lobby"" feature but the devs wont add it. So griefers can just constantly change their steam name and rejoin to ruin games. 

If yourself and 7 friends want to play this game go ahead and get it, but realize any random allowed into your lobby (which take forever to fill, nearly an hour on occasion) will most likely be ruined by someone who has no fear of ever getting banned.

UPDATE EDIT: People keep finding more exploits, if you bring this to the devs attention on the discord they will ban you from the discord. 

This game is dead for English players. If you make a lobby you will spend 45 minutes kicking out players who do not speak the same language as you. If you complain about THAT in the discord they will call you racist.

It's a deception game with survival elements and sometimes you can be the hero of the game, and other times you are the evil villain. You must figure out who the bad guys are (thralls) out of the crew and exterminate them before they exterminate you. To have a good game, you must have a crew that actually communicates and works together to get coal back to the ship to move it closer to the exit, while fighting the elements of cold and hunger you must survive and be productive under pressure.

There are instances of the community being... more toxic than any other games I have ever played but that isn't the games fault, the responsibility of being a good player relies on the individuals playing the game.

 I have given this game a positive review because most of the time I am having fun more than I am not~ I am sure other peoples experiences have varied.

At this point, at least for me in pub lobbies, everything has gone to absolute shit.

The crew mates who wondered off the night before are presumed dead or thralls. Any crew that remains are in bad shape, and are ready to gamble their last life on a desperate plan to salvage the mission.

They head up the lighthouse to rush Nitro, you wish them luck knowing it will be the last time you hear their voices until the end.

You salvage every last piece of coal you can and secure it on the ship while frantically searching for any signs of the thrall - knowing that any successful sabotage at this point in the game is guaranteed game over.

You would have gone with the nitro team but there is no time. The mission is all but doomed, albeit still technically possible if all crew pulls their roles off flawlessly.

You sit in the captains quarters, slowly adding wood to the fire to preserve your heat for the final moments of the game and just listen for any signs of life.

It’s quiet now except for blizzard which is deadening not just your hearing but all of your senses. The silence is eerie and weirdly peaceful. It signals that your death is imminent, and at the same time your just thankful you don’t hear the thrall.

You hear gunshots in the distance, and then silence.

For all you know you’re the last survivor, warm but starving, when suddenly you hear the explosion. The ice berg disappears off the compass and you rush to the boiler to fire it up.

Escape feels more possible then ever now, but far from certain.

You man the wheel, studying the path ahead of you in case of a white out, and nervously glancing at the coal meter hoping you have enough to get out.

Your heat is draining fast now, even faster than the coal, but thankfully you thought ahead to bring tea.

The path to escape is straight ahead, and you mash the W key as hard as you can while shifting your eyes between the coal, heat and health bars to see which is draining the fastest.

You are for sure the last remaining survivor at this point, and just when you think it’s all over new text appears on the screen. You have survived. The mission was a success.

Lastly, unless they continue to update the game, which they should as it is really well made and enjoyable, I can see this getting very monotonous. Right now there are 4 - 5 maps, all very similar.

I've read multiple reviews on how this game isn't worth it unless you have 8 friends to play with. I've been playing this now for almost a year and I will say this, you do not need to have friends to play. As a matter of fact, my friends list has grown since playing this game from people I met playing this game. I really haven't encountered many toxic people playing this game and the very few I did, I simply just didn't play with them anymore. Most people want to play the game.

Now for the Pro's and Con's

Pro's
-Visually beautiful
-Great community (in my experience)
-Fun being either crew or thrall
-Balanced classes 
-This game is just really fun to play, if you are fan of among us then you'll love this game
-Game I can play when drunk. 

Con's 
-No filter when looking for a game. If you guys played this game pre-release then you'll understand what I am talking about. Prior to full release finding a server for American players was fairly simple. Now you look for a server and almost, if not all servers are from Asian countries. Tip until this is implemented: Just start your own game, usually when I do I can get a full lobby in just a few minutes
-Only 3 maps: hopefully developers will come out with a DLC in the future
-Pay to customer characters. Not really a con, it's just something I'm not a big fan of. 

Final thoughts:
-Fun to play with or without friends. If you play to play the game and not be some jack@$$, you'll meet friends quick.

The game does have several toxic/racist players that ruin some lobbies. If you find yourself in a loby like this just leave there are other lobbies that are amazing. I have seen lobbies full of role players actually role playing their roles on the ship and some going beyond that to role playing Montey Python skits. I have been loving the game when i get into a good lobby. Tons of laughs and a truly great time. The games tutorial doesnt cover any of the Thrall stuff so when my first 3 actual matches I was thrall and had no idea what to do but luckily the other thrall was experienced.  I have not experienced many bugs only twice 1 was I couldnt pull out the powder keg to place it, and the other was dragging the poison onto food. each only happened once or twice otherwise the game runs great the in game voice works really well, the balance between the roles seems really good and the difficulty of winning wether thrall or crew seems to be balanced too.",1644787621,1644787621,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

some of the best gaming experiences I've had with my brother and my best friend.
However, that comes with the classic caveat.
Sometimes online sucks.
And when you wrongly, yet unknowingly, accuse others of being the bad guys (the thrall) they freak out, and most times its extremely toxic.
However, when you get those gems, where everyone is just chill, just there for a good time, and they are just as bad as you are (something i hope they figure out how to make those people who've played no better than newbies) it is HILARIOUS. and so fun.
Don't expect to win, it ruins the experience, expect to have a good time, and you'll find yourselves working together more, trying to survive and move together towards a seemingly impossible goal by the inches at a time.

I really enjoy Dread Hunger, and think that the generally friendly community (in the public lobbies) is its greatest asset.

Since full-release there is a proper tutorial, which is a big help to new players, but, as of writing, there is still no guide for the thralls, apart from the newly added compendium. But even this doesn't cover strategy, which is quite tough for new folk, especially if they end up as a thrall. Pedguin did a decent unofficial thrall guide, in my opinion, which makes up a bit for this shortfall: https://youtu.be/9rKbcZetvdU .

So I feel that the learning curve is kind of steep for Dread Hunger, and you may just end up in unwinnable games, depending on the relative experience of the crew and thralls. It feels very different to play games with new players and experienced ones, and the comment I always hear from new ones is, ""I didn't have any idea what I was doing."" I think to become more accessible, the devs ought to try to breach this gap somehow so new players have more of an idea of what the point of the game is and what they can do to win.

Having said all that though, I still do immensely enjoy this game and wholeheartedly recommend it. It just has some teething problems, is all. :)",1644493428,1644493428,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The game features some overtly anti christian sentiments, you are given incentive to eat human flesh, destroy crosses, gamble, and dig up corpses as a Christian chaplain. It is an exercise in relativism, incentivized relativistic thinking to play these games, a microcosm of the decadent society you live in. Most people or more importantly, Children are not going to engage with such material in a compartmentalized fashion, as they lack the mental faculties to think in such abstract, analytical, philosophical terms and the historical knowledge. Nor will they likely have ulterior inquiring or analytical purposes, they will get desensitized, be conflicted and at some level perverted, traumatized, in ways they probably won't fully notice, this includes not just from certain incentivized acts performed by the game itself, but by the kinds of people within the game's community, and ""leadership"".

The small crowd playing are mostly indifferent or enthusiastic about this degeneracy and immoral subversion, it spills over into discord where you will find hypocrisy and power tripping from same kind of confused leftist npcs who construct an echo chamber by sharing lists of steam accounts; players who should be ""canceled"" for wrong think. Anything true, and non pc, as in the game lobbies, will get you kicked/banned and put on a list.

As one dev puts it in his profile, ""the game is about lying"" or ""backstabbing your friends"". I have heard people getting genuinely upset at their friends because they did not expect that that kind of behavior from them. But rarely are people conscious enough to notice these things nor have any integrity or foundational values. Other than that mostly people share complaints about the game and the devs.

1. Letting us do games around the starting screen boat / adding more in in general for role playing? Maybe a dart board in the cooking hallway, different card games to play, ect.
2. There should REALLY be some kind of region check for finding games. As fun as it is to play with people from across the pond, we can't....communicate with eachother so seeing an entire list of overseas language rooms vs where I'm at is almost pointless. Maybe a simple language filter to sort them so like ENG goes to top, RUS, ect.
3. More a question / solution. Is there an internal check of the game to see how lon it's been since youve been a thrall? I'm sure the devs can see my stats but in my personal case, being thrall 13% of all my games is painful and eventually became boring that I fell off for months becasue I was tired of being good 20-30 times in a row. I think there needs to be some behind the scenes check and then not 100% give it to that person whos been good so many times, but weigh it higher on their side to be thrall next time. Example: if being thrall is 2/8 (1/4) and youve been good the last 5-10 games, maybe change the odds to 1/3 and then eventually 1/2. Most of us play with randoms so even if others arent aware or many people are at the 1/3 or 1/2 odds, changing rooms and whatnot will get it to you without people meta gaming your stats

It definitely has potential, because if you happen to get a magical group of people who:
* don't scream in the the mic
* aren't constantly trolling
* have any clue how to do the most simple / basic task
* communicate / ask good questions
...then it can be fun.  The problem is after ~30 hours, I've had that... 3 times?  And even then the game is so so.  
The biggest issue is sorting through the server list.  

SERVER LIST - SERVER LIST - SERVER LIST - SERVER LIST - SERVER LIST - SERVER LIST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems like dozens of Honk Kong / Chinese servers, with no way to filter / search / sort for NAE or non-Chinese language.  And then some of the NAE/English are full of non-English speakers anyhow for some reason.  
I want this game to be good so badly because it really does seem possible, but I would strongly advise AGAINST getting this game unless you have a core group of 4+ people to play with you.

If you enjoy waiting for games to start for 45 minutes, and then 12 year olds ruining the game once it starts, have they got a game for you!  In this game, you'll find a server list full of parties that don't speak your language with no way to filter or sort by anything whatsoever.  Only want games in NA? Keep scrolling!  Only want English language?   Keep scrolling.  This game really only feels viable if you have 7 friends who play it already.  I tried to refund this game but was over the time limit for trying it, but to test the tutorial and get even a sense of multiplayer took 3+ hours.  Has possible promise but just isn't great.  2 people with no clue what they are doing ruin a 45 minute match.",1643439621,1643733070,False,6,1,0.558995962142944336,0,True,False,False

The long answer: A very fine game, even though it is still under development. A reasonable respect is paid to the time period, and survival is not as simple as 'Make fire, kill bad guy'. This game actually makes you work for what you want, and to just charge out onto the ice with your bare hands will leave you dead in under ten minutes under most circumstances.

The game is well-suited as a reasonably quick time-killer, as the rounds are mechanically designed not to last more than thirty-five minutes at the maximum.

For anyone at all interested in the Franklin Expedition, this game appears to be loosely based on the ill-fated journey into the arctic (Minus the lead poisoning and scurvy).

You may want to avoid this game if you are easily frustrated by team-killing, as it is bound to happen quite a bit, due to the very nature of the plot. It's a game mechanic, here, not unlike 'Among Us'.

You will also absolutely NEED a microphone, as there is no text-based chat system implemented.

I would fully suggest buying this game if you are interested. This is a VERY basic review, as part of the joy is experiencing the terror of it all first-hand!

EDIT: While I am quite happy to see the game fully released, I am quite disappointed that any customization of the characters requires the purchase of separate DLCs.

Be warned though, use of a microphone to communicate is necessary and some players are unfortunately very toxic, even though the majority just want to play the game. There are also a few performance issues present, such as random disconnects and failures to load into a game, which can be devastating with only 8 players present, although have become more infrequent over successive patches.",1643543662,1643543662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The priest was the Thrall, and spawned a Totem behind a tent, and he yelled in his discord, that i attacked him, which i didnt, so he attacked me and i killed him, but his friend came to his aid.
Ofc.
In the end i must say, the idea behind it is nice, but the game itself is again just playable if you have friends, like the guy yelling in his discord and ofc people jump on me.

The other issue we face is the HongKong servers, there are more Chinese servers, than American (Yes there is no EUROPE) 
The game should be region blocked, and not be sold in the EU.

First off, if not playing with friends, you will need to talk to other random people. By microphone. If that is a deal breaker I feel like I should mention it.

To start with, this game is, in principle, amazing. In every way it diverges from the similar games it flourishes, becoming one of the best cooperative deception games I think I may have every seen (although I haven't seen many). For example the jail allows for dead players to still contribute by giving information back to the crew and eventually rearm themselves, creating a limit on the deceptive abilities of the thralls, whilst also allowing for slain thralls to deceive the crew further, essentially functioning as a catch up mechanic for whichever team gets slew. The combination need for crewmates to simultaneously collect coal to fuel the boat and dynamite to blow up the iceberg, means that, in principle, you can neither play in one big group, nor split up and all go after your own games, requiring some team cohesion, but not enough to make the thralls job easy.

In combination with this playing both the thralls and crew can be incredibly stressful, although the thralls are so much worse. The crew need to be constantly aware and are never quite sure who the thralls might be whilst also trying to contribute as much as they can, in order to not look suspicious, however the thralls need to be incredibly careful to not rouse suspicion, whilst simultaneously secretly sabotaging the crew. To make a long point short the devs did a great job of making both roles both equally adrenaline filled, but when matches can last more than 30 minutes, maintaining that much adrenaline for that long may not be for everyone.

This ideal form of gameplay often falls flat as long games can frequently be very one sided. This is mainly due to the victory of the thralls coming entirely down to how much the crew sticks together. If they do so it can become near impossible for the thralls to do anything. Also the thralls take a lot more skill than the crewmate, and this is a problem as you will play thrall less, and so can be quite unprepared for it when it arrives.

However, as I first played the game the biggest thing to ruin it for me was the other players. The majority of the time the other players where, quite intense and could leave me feeling somewhat uncomfortable, however other times they where just plain throwing. The best example is one player, who remained entirely out of voice chat for entire game and, as a crewmate, proceeded to snipe every single other crewmate. This really disheartens people. However given I have only played about 20 games of this (for reasons that will become apparent soon) and had at least 3 of them have throwers in I feel like a proper moderation system is direly in need...

Although that may not strictly fix the problem. A recent update added achievements and with this I found that, after coming back to the game, every lobby on the summit involved everyone collectively agreeing to let the thralls win by reversing the ship back to London. (I discluded these from the list of games before). This made the game unplayable.

Additionally, this game has monumentally long queue times. This is entirely down to the game having no queueing system so the best way of getting into a match is to pick a map, host or join a lobby on it and then wait for there to be 7 other players. This has lead to increasingly long queue times as this game has aged, which is a shame as I hoped that when the queues used to be about 20 minutes long that they may actually speed up.

However the biggest problem with this game is the price, at >$20 I cannot easily see a reason with the game as is now to buy it. The only way to enjoy the game now is to host a game with 3 friends, however that requires you finding 3 other people with this game, and if they need to buy it then it is quite a significant investment. To take a moment to place suggestions to the devs. If the price was reduced to a lower amount and poker emotes where sold as microtransactions to make up the difference, it may encourage more players to begin playing the game and hence reduce all the above problems.

It is worth noting that there are discord servers, for arranging playing games, however I do not use them and so cannot comment on there effectiveness. If this could influence your purchase of the game I would recommend looking into it and potentially joining some of them. I have heard some are quite nice.

In conclusions I do not feel like I can recommend this game as is. It has very well designed, if not somewhat intense gameplay, however with the dwindling, frustrating playerbase and inadequate queuing system, without the guarantee of other players to play with I cannot, in good faith recommend this game especially if its price is to increase.

Instead of actively working on an extremely unfinished game by updating the player models or finishing the other maps the dev team is working on moderation tools to control the social aspects of the game and limit discourse to aspects focused only around the gameplay. 

It would not surprise me in the slightest if i receive a perma ban after writing this review. Do not buy this game, it is way overpriced for the current development level and the possibility of a perma-ban with no appeal process is not worth it.

A fun and cool social survival game that incorporates pve and pvp, but the complexity of the game makes it very unfriendly to newer players and it is still too early access (not enough content, and too many bugs). 

The game desperately needs:
a wiki for new people to read up things, 
a SINGLE player tutorial (the current one is multiplayer only and sucks/teaches you nothing, if you can even find other people to play it),
text chat options, 
a chat function for ghosts since as a ghost it is awful and there is nothing to do
more maps
BUG FIXES
CRASH FIXES (I crash 2/5 times in the beginning or middle of the game, and 9/10 times after the game ends but before you return to the lobby). 


For now, do not buy it.

If not then enter at you're own risk of some pretty toxic people. Meta gaming. ect. Not all the time but a good majority. You may say well just kick them but they can keep joining back. there is no ban option and the few good group of people out here had to make a list of griefers and toxic people to avoid and kick because the devs have not given us the tools to do so in lobby and all. I say once you get kick it should be you can not join back that lobby. There is not much good communication between the community and the devs since they mainly care about the few streamers who play there game. Which I see from a company money making point of view can be good. Keep the streamers happy and into the game to keep streaming there game and possibly get more buyers. But it sucks for the rest of us who have to put up with all the glitches still in the game and getting bad responses from the devs. They balance the game around potential griefers instead of outright dealing with the griefers/ giving hosts the tools to deal with them. Wile focusing on other thing's instead of this big issue the game is currently having. Anyone will hate having thrall and to have some Meta gaming people ruin that by giving info from the game through discord instead of through the game like it should be.

Updates came out extremely slow. There were so many ""COMING SOON"" teasers and such on twitter/discord yet we would have to wait almost 3-4 weeks before seeing anything come about. There have also been so many suggestions since day 1 that have been added to the game to improve quality of life and game play have never been implemented. The devs also DRASTICALLY changed the game and levels completely so close to full launch, this change has been terrible for the game and as a result killed lots of the player base as my streaming/youtube friends all quit the game as well. Why would you completely change the maps and game plays so soon before the actual launch? It is clear that they will never listen to the palyerbase and only make changes that they want to make you play the way that they want you to play.

OG REVIEW BELOW
===========================================================
Wish there was a neutral option for the review. The concept of the game and the theming is great and I love the survival elements. The roles add some distinction which is nice too. The core of the game is very enjoyable. 
My biggest gripe with the game is I just *really* hate that dead people return back to life in the jail cells. To me, it ruins a lot of potential deception chances or mindgames and overall makes the game a lot less fun. Honestly it's a core feature that should either be an option, reworked, or removed entirely. Pretty much turns into yelling who killed you as a lot of the game.
Interactions with players and combat both as a crewmate and thrall are fun though.
The game also has a pretty steep learning curve, especially when the tutorial is pretty much unplayable due to no lobbies.

Also the Code of Conduct seems like it could be pretty easily abused. It's in such vague terms where people may report you due to you not conforming to their exact style of play. Not defending griefers, of course they shouldn't be allowed, but I feel like false bans could easily happen w/ the current system + wording. There's been maaaaany multiplayer games that died due to developers making mistakes or abusing their own system.

I'll take another look as the game gets updated, as I'm sure it will be. I just hope the devs listen to feedback.

Someone lagged out of my game and for two or three hours I just had a permanent notification on the right side of my screen, even after restarting the game from the menu.

would advise waiting for more content to come out however as it can get pretty stale on the 2 maps, that being said if youre looking for a game to play with some homies this is a pretty good one.

dread hunger follows a crew of 8 on an expedition through a frozen wasteland littered with broken ships and camps of people who came before that didnt make it, the maps are always the same except for the loot which i believe is handled with RNG. This game brings a focus on your cold and hunger, which you need to make fire and hunt for food to satisfy (or eat tasty human meat if youre a thrall). 2 of your crew will be thralls and you wont know which ones, keep in mind it isnt your job to find the thralls (though it does make it easier) your job is to make sure the ship gets to open waters before the blizzard comes in and kills you. this involves fighting wolves/ bears, fending off canibals the thralls summon, getting the nitro and exploding an iceberg. you need to get coal and other fuel to power your ship and sail it out, you can lose by having your ship sink. You can repair it using wood which is plentiful.

a few things they could do is make thralls a bit less powerful as all you really have to do is wait by nitro, build like 6 totems and summon hordes of cannibals when the crew fight the wolves/ bears.

A typical match takes around 30 minutes and there is a leveling system, though there are no rewards for leveling that ive seen so far, though its not unlikely to be added in the future. 

there are a couple ways to cheese the game including grabbing all the coal from the boiler at the very start and dumping it, which can be fixed by having the ship start closer and the iceberg further.

There are some things I'd hope to see changed: I'd love to have more customizable game options, better level-up perks, more spell diversity for the thralls (imposters), different types of tasks for the crew, and maybe a purpose for 'ghosts'.

This game is fun. Take the mechanics of survival games from last decade and add social deduction, the unforgiving Arctic, and cannibals to the mix. You will experience tense moments, and hilarious ones. Matches can vary a lot and many go down to the wire. If you like survival games, social deduction, or asymmetrical horror multiplayer games, do yourself a favor and try this game out. 

If you are still on the fence, watch someone else play. There are lots of streams and videos out there.

Pros:
-Excellent blend of social deduction, survival, and multiplayer
-Well polished and completely playable in early access
-Most matches are genuinely fun. Expect lots of banter, roleplaying, and general asshatery, but it adds to the character of the game.
-Most players are cool and welcoming to new players. 

Neutral: 
-The game has a bit of a learning curve. Nothing crazy, but it will take several games playing as both crew and thralls to get the hang of it. My advice is watch other people play the game and ask lots of questions while in game. Most players, especially the veteran players, will be happy help you out even if you are on the other team.

Cons:
-For a small playerbase, this game has a lot of trolls and griefers. So much, that I've run into at least one every three games or so. You may be wondering why someone would spend money on a game, and then spend countless hours annoying people and not even playing the game. Don't they have a life? I don't know. It's kinda sad, really.
-Considering the amount of trolls and griefers, there is no way to deal with them. Even if you kick them out of the lobby, they can immediately join back in. Reporting doesn't seem to do much, either.
-Due to no decent options for dealing with griefers, some players have resorted to keeping personal lists of undesirable players. If you end up on one of these lists by mistake or for some petty reason, you're shit out of luck.
-Some lobby hosts abuse the kick button to make room for their friends or to grief.
-Some winning strategies are cheap and game breaking (Like stealing all the coal from the boiler at the start). And though most players have agreed not to use these strategies, you can't fully blame the players that do try them when the devs have allowed for these strategies to exist.",1631317144,1631317314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Well, to put simply it doesn't penalize crewmates enough for randomly killing each other based off of whims. ""What do you mean?"", Players will kill each other for incredibly shallow reasons such as, gathering materials to build weapons, not rushing coal, looting to make food, butchering corpses for keys, or even something as stupid as rushing ahead of the ship. In fact this is such a problem that most players end up disconnecting due to the fact that once you're killed and locked up for half the match the game becomes a colossal waste of time. ""Why does it matter?"" The idea of being able to be killed without consequence and forced half way into the game to rebuild is incredibly toxic (This is why most crewmates that are lynched early disconnect). This problem only gets worse if you're actually a thrall because an early thrall death is almost impossible to recover from (for a multitude of reasons besides having to rebuild). I suggest you only buy this game if you intend on playing with friends because if you're in a game with another group, well, I hope you have a backlog of videos to watch after being locked up for the better half of a match because you farted.",1630495110,1630495235,False,2,0,0.495140373706817627,0,True,False,True

You are constantly trying to survive by building fires to keep warm , crafting weapons and ammunition and killing and hunting down wolves , seals and rabbits all while they are two killers out there trying to sabotage the crew. this is what makes the game really fun. the ""i dont know who to trust"" phase of the game to me is the most fun part. As an impostor you have two choices of how you want to play . The first choice is just playing it straight aggressive , the aggressive thralls dont care if the crew mates find out that they are thralls or not, they just build themselves up from the very start of the game trying to get really good weapons and even just build alot of totems . playing it aggressive requires you to be away from the ship alot of the time so 9 times out of 10 everyone's gonna know that you are the killer but it dosent really matter because if you have alot of ammunation and guns then you can just go all out war with the crewmates. The other option is to play the social game as the impostor, the ""social game"" players are thje players that like to manipulate the crew and try turning them against eachother which does work really well sometimes, you can poison food or plant a bomb on the ship then blame it on someone else , what you want to try do is gain everyones trust by bringing coal back to the ship, once you have the crews trust you have them in your pocket. turning them against eachother is easy tho i pefer to play the more aggressive play style but its completely upto you. rate this game a solid 10/10 and it is still ONLY IN BETA!

We luckily both got Thrall, and immediately we took all but one of the coal, and as captain I sent the ship into the icy bank out the gate, yelling at everyone for not helping me navigate, relinquishing blame.  The crew brought me so much coal, because we were not utilizing the bone daggers, and as captain I made sure to sputter the throttle of the boat every time we crunched through ice.  Directing the ship towards the edges of icebergs, and going full throttle everytime we thrall clouded the skies.  Anyone who asked why I was hitting so many shores and bergs, was responded to by swearing under my breath, saying I was trying to correct what other people had done. 

The first night though the real fatal wound was sitting on the cook stove, so no one could access it and anytime someone did, I'd take whatever they added.  Sailors started to die immediately from starvation, and lack of wood.  My friend, the cook, started leaving human meat around.

There was a point when we all became poisoned by consuming human meat, and the blame started hovering around me as my friend dropped dead right next to me.  After many attempts to run away and question how it could be me, they killed me, but then immediately changed their mind as they found bone daggers on my friend's corpse.  Letting me out of jail I then scooped up said bone knives, and then began their hunt for who had the knives, to which I was not blamed for they just let me out of jail due to innocence. 

At this point we were halfway down the trail, out of food, no fuel, five dead, but at least they blew up the final iceberg. To which I then used a found pistol to kill the one of two survivors who had a rifle, right as he turned away from the crafting table, to then immediately throw him off deck.  I then made a run for it but was shot down by a bow.  To which the final person found themselves in a blizzard, shivering to death in their bunk.  

This is a great game, it gives you opportunity to exercise that monster within which does not have plenty of chance to express itself outside of games.  On the other note, it also allows for great communication skill development with strangers, working on your gut instinct, and fine tuning your verbal cue capacity.

I'm only on my 6th game, and can say it's well worth the $30. This is not a game I could play consecutively, as I feel I need to digest each experience as it comes, and overall don't want exhaust the replayability, though many say it does last, stays interesting.

The dynamite location needs to be randomised. And I would suggest a rethink to the level design. 

- It would be nice if there were multiple destinations for the ship instead of multiple routes. Perhaps a combination of both. 

- Dynamite needs to be in a random location every game. If possible maybe the maps could be somewhat modular, so different locations or cave systems could move around every game. Maybe the broken ships could spawn in different places also. I don't know, shower thoughts.

- The classes I think would benefit from being a bit more distinct, promoting co-operative gameplay. 1% isn't quite enough in speed modifier or whatever. 

- I think the dead players should also be able to talk to each other. I mean we do it over discord but I think It'd be nice if that was in the game to begin with.

It's the social manipulation and deception game I wished Among Us was. More like Trouble in Terrorist Town, but with common objectives while trying to survive the dangerous environment. 

The Thrall's main goal is to kill others indirectly and sabotage their efforts in secrecy, not to kill on sight.

There are 8 classes, but there aren't any designated class activities. You often won't see the Captain sailing the ship or the Cook in the kitchen most of the time. I wish the class related perks were stronger to encourage more logical role play. 

Average match length is about 30 minutes. Personally I wish it was closer to 40 minutes on average. Three ingame days pass surprisingly quickly. Adding a day before the blizzard would greatly relax the pace of the game.

There are only two maps as of this review, both playable and fun. However, I hope in the future they add maps that are bigger and give the ship more room to maneuver and add at least three different paths it can take. The actual ship sailing part of the game is very limited as of now.

Overall, the game is fun and I hope they continue to improve the game for the better in the future!

Anyway, very fun game. At the time of writing this review the game is still in its alpha stage receiving fairly regular updates, keeping the gameplay fresh and fun.

I have some changes that I would personally like to see. 

As the game is currently, the Thralls have a massive advantage which only grows larger with each update as the developers continue to buff the Thralls. I believe this removes a lot of the skill and finesse required from the Thrall, making them easier to appease newer players instead of implementing a tutorial for how to play the Thrall.[spoiler] Thrall OP. Add Tutorial[/spoiler]

The combat is lacking. Melee combat is dependant on how much health you have because you trade damage with whatever is attacking you. This essentially makes your health bar another recourse you have to manage, making the combat unsatisfying.[spoiler] Melee combat bit redundant[/spoiler]

The only real form of griefing I have ran across are players deciding to become a thrall. Nothing much the developers can do about a ""toxic"" player base but I thought I wold mention it as it does occur fairly often.[spoiler] 3rd Thrall annoying[/spoiler]

nice setting,
interesting take on the ""among us concept"",
pleasant graphics style,

-----------------------------

The bad

lacking tutorial,

the cannibal spell is way too strong, 

balancing issues between classes (eg. cook and doctor are terrible in comparison to the hunter, everyone always wants to play the hunter, the only way to play that class is to host the lobby yourself and wait 20 minutes for people to join),

the whole social deduction idea gets thrown in the water because of a few problems:
every character has a ton of HP, takes like ~4 shots with the pistol to kill someone, so no sneaky fast kills by thralls are possible, no headshots with pistols.

when you die, you respawn in the ships jail cell and can get out if someone has a key, you have 2 lives which means if a Thrall would kill you, you will still be able to call them out, this kind of screws the entire concept,

the goal of the game as a Thrall (enemy to the crew) is to pop up as many totems as possible (improves cannibal attack spell) and spam cannibal attacks as it is now, the goal is not to use psychology to skillfully deceive the crew, its to upgrade and spam those cannibals and maybe use one of the other tools Thralls have, like traps, sabotaging the engine, poisoning the crew, barrel bombs, spirit walk, whiteout. 

the cannibal attack spell is the cornerstone of most Thrall plays.

your passive crew skills get better the more you play, which I am not a fan of,

only 3 fucking maps?

the game have few players, so difficult to find lobbies eg. late in the night.

the game is probably too expensive keeping the player population from growing.

-----------------------------

what I would change: 

1 life only, no respawns,

make it easier to kill someone with eg. single headshot with pistol thats louder so everyone hears it.

nerf the cannibals, completely remove or nerf totems.

the other tools Thralls have are fine and are just that, tools, now it feels like I die to cannibals 9/10 games.
give more power to the players and less power to the bots (cannibals). 

lower price to 10-15€ range.

The graphics are great.  Much more than I expected.  The controls are fluid.  The only things missing being a crouch button for moments where stealth may be wanted, and perhaps basic sign language style emotes so as to not give yourself away by shouting to a partner across the frigid ice.

Each character or ""class"" brings different things to the table.  All are balanced, and other than the chaplain who will in most lobbies be accused of being overly ""friendly"" with children and thereby attacked for no other reason, no class has any significant drawbacks.

The survival mechanics themselves are solid.

The thrall mechanics are easy to pick up but hard to master.  With deceit and mind games being more advantageous than merely bashing people over the head with a club or a cleaver.

Right now honestly the game progressing as it is now, as long as it sticks to it's current formula will be incredible when complete.  The only things I would potentially suggest for changes (other than some of the control options I listed above) would be more randomisation with map layouts in terms of camps and key items, and lastly...

Now this would be a long shot but if the devs were to implement such a thing, I think it would be great.

A more long form mode as an option alongside the current campaign maps.  Think like a couple large scale maps with multiple big objectives to complete along the way, and the blizzard coming in after maybe 30 days or so.  There wouldn't need to be many such maps like this.  Maybe only 1 or 2 with some slight randomisation of objectives.

Highly recommended to play with friends or try and find a regular group to play with. Even if it’s just one or two people. 
This game is very skill based. Having good map knowledge and experienced players will likely decide the outcome of the match. It’s extremely frustrating to carry the team the whole match, only to die at the end and spectate to find your team has done nothing to progress the group at all. You’ll have a good game, however a troll or a team with too many noobs will destroy your experience. 
The purpose of the game is to reach the end of the map, clear the iceberg and escape. Too many people in the game lose sight of the core objectives, carrying coal (to fuel the ship) and destroying the iceberg. Matches go for around 30 minutes, and there is a set time frame before the blizzard comes and kills the team. You have three days and the first two should focus on gathering coal and supplies, with the third dedicated to getting nitroglycerin (the bomb to blow up the iceberg).
If the team is competent, I’m sure 9 times out of ten they will win. I have played games as thrall (traitor) where on day one the crew has virtually cleared the map in just the first day, and it is near impossible for me to hinder the group enough to win the match. 
I have had some really fun, razor close games screaming into the mic to win in the last few seconds. And I have also had some games where I want to smash my head against the wall, because the team was wildly incompetent. At the end of the match you are given a score based on the actions you do. I received my first S rank just today. However, despite this fact we lost because I was carrying the whole game and my team did literally nothing, I scored more than my entire team combined to give you perspective.
I think what separates this from other social deduction games is that the environment is very deadly, having to manage wild animals, cold and hunger. If all the traitors are killed the players do NOT win, they must still complete the objective.",1628079427,1628079427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its in a very unique setting, Game play wise its like a cross between among us and the ship, Instead of outright murder the game is usually sabotoge and takes some detective work to usually figure people out unless they are being careless, and all around has a really good base.

Now onto the reasons i honestly dont like the game, but hopefully will be adjusted in the future.
Combat is *wonky* Most easy to see when fighting other players. 
You starve WAY too fast, You can adjust this setting in private matches but not public
I dont know if its a glitch or not but sometimes when falling into the water you cannot resurface and are stuck in the water, thus will die
Nitroglycern will sometimes just explode (Yes i know wtf) 
And there are currently only two locations.

of course playing this game with randoms is not at all advised, but thats nothing really new in a game that requires teamwork but lemme tell you ive lost more games due to people having attitudes, getting mad and attacking/sabotaging the ship, and oh my god the children.

The thralls sabotage is mostly on the ship which is bad... it means if you hang around the ship too much you are pretty much killed without mention by others.. there should be means to sabotage out in the open by making/setting traps that make the environment more dangerous!

I also do not like the fact that the dead can speak or that there is a lack of voip volume control, many people I found many players had clipping mics and with little open sessions to choose from its just a little bit too annoying.

The downside of mechanics is the prison system. On one end, you can spend 30 minutes in a cell waiting for someone to maybe let you out. On the other hand, it makes killing people as thralls pretty dumb.

The reason this game gets a negative review is because of the horrendous toxicity. More often than not, I've joined lobbies shouting the hard R like its nothing and the throwing homophobic slurs about. Pretty disgusting community of players.

It is really hard to win, as you need all the team to cooperate and find the thralls before the blizzard hits.
Every role in the game has it's own charm, but it is way easier to win as a thrall than as a survivor.

The blizzard is really tough, and there is no way to survive it (which is kinda the point, you need to escape before the blizzard), but my experience is that sometimes thralls don't do to much and still end up winning.
I am not sure if that is the case because the other survivors fuck the game up by not being efficient and cooperative enough, or if the game is to unforgiving...

- Project Winter, the game's competitor is overall a better game in every way.
- Voyages are locked behind progression which segments the playerbase.
- The game just feels like a mess, it's like a bunch of jumbled ideas that don't flow together.
- Ugly graphics.
- The most useless tutorial I've ever seen which you're forced to go through.
- Overpriced when compared to its competitors.
- Players have a second life where once they die they spawn at the ship in a jail cell, can speak, and can be broken out of.
- Thralls can revive on their own.
- Zombies randomly spawn and attack you.
- Everything drains so fast that you're often stuck by a fire.

[i]The tutorial was dreadful, I had to walk all the way across the map to collect coal and bring it back to the ship. Then I set sail and won. It was the most boring experience I ever had and nothing was taught from it. It felt like a time sink and we're forced to do it before moving onto the next voyage. I then try to browse the lobby for the next voyage and find that all the lobbies are full. Eventually one opened up and I joined, only to be kicked from it. I didn't have fun, not even the slightest.

So I gave the game another chance and I finally played with a group of players. All I can say is that the game is random, makes no sense, and nothing flows naturally.

The survival/crafting gameplay is not overbearing, and generally revolves around scavenging food to eat, wood to burn for warmth, and coal to fuel the ship. It never feels like a painful grind given the length of a game, and also does not have a significant importance on crafting or leveling up your gear.

The premise of the game is that a crew of 8 people (2 of which are thralls) must pilot a mid-nineteenth century warship through an arctic pass into open waters in order to complete the expedition. There are a few things standing in the way of this (hunger, cold, wild animals, the thralls, and an iceberg that needs to be blown up in order to pass).

This game doesn't really feel like a social deduction game off the hop. It feels like a co-op survival game for about 85% of the time. But when the thralls strike? Oh boy, things can get tense when the crew tries to find out who could be messing with them.

Thralls have the simple objective of sabotaging the voyage. A lot of newer thralls resort to killing crew members in order to do this, but this is arguably the worst way to go about it because the thralls are severely outnumbered, and often times the crew are carrying fairly good weapons starting in the mid-game. Other options thralls have open to them are sabotaging the boiler by putting gunpowder in it while its on, throwing away coal to slow down the crew members, poisoning food and leaving it lying around, or by blowing up the ship with gunpowder barrels/nitroglycerine. They can also call in blizzards when the boiler has a lot of coal in it to waste it if the crew does not feel like trudging on through treacherous passages (these are mostly found in The Summit expedition).

Matches can last upwards of 40 minutes, but usually they average around 35 minutes. The enjoyability of them heavily depends on the crew, because trolls are not exactly uncommon. The game is pretty new, so the servers are filled with a lot of new players like me (at the time of writing this review I have about 7 hours) which can sometimes slow things down if a few crew members don't fully know what they're doing yet. Servers can sometimes take a while to fill up depending on how many people are active, so be prepared to wait a few minutes at times.

The movement feels responsive, as does the UI. The balancing for the classes is surprisingly well done, and there is even a levelling system that lets you upgrade each character. There is a 2-life system that works very well. If you die, you can be respawned in the ship's brig by your crew mates if they clear you of suspicion. if you die again, you are dead. There is a little bit of salt among thralls who say that the 2 life system is awful because the crew can out the thrall who killed them, but seeing how the game is structured (killing crew members is not a great option to begin with) this point can be largely dismissed. If the game had permadeath, it wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable. 

All that being said, there are some things that, in my opinion, could use tweaking. Some of the collisions are weird, allowing you to straight up look through walls in certain areas, and there is an area in one of the igloos in the tutorial where you get stuck in the wall if you sleep on a bed. The rate at which you freeze to death seems just a touch too fast, as does the rate at which you burn calories. This adds a healthy challenge, but gets a little annoying when both thralls are dead and the crew freezes to death in the late game.

Generally speaking, the game is really well put together and is in a very stable state as of the moment. The devs have a solid roadmap with the promise of new content and updates coming soon. There is a bit of jank to Dread Hunger, but if you look past it you will see that the game has a lot of potential and can easily become the next big social deduction game.

Ok execution

One big problem is when you kill someone as the thrall they can be respond so no matter how stealthy you are when they full die they are just back in the big and freed by a key or not they can just be like ya I was killed by this guy meaning that you can't do any stealth killing or real planning because your first  kill will always out you. At best you can do two kills stealthy. The only way for thralls to kill unnoticed is to convince the crew to do a mob killing. Otherwise your just get outed by whoever you kill even if the crew dosen't have the resources to respawn them.

That one concept really takes away from what the game is trying to do. If a thrall kills a player respawning shouldn't be an option anyone that should be what the thralls do.

The role system is great since that gives more depth to the crew, thus giving the roleplaying aspects a bit of a kick.

If i'd give my two cents however, i would ask that the developers impliment an opt out button for those who'd rather not play traitor.

Hold great promise

pretty fun gameplay

relatively nice community

the content that is in the game is entertaining and fun

Cons- 

Not enough to do (not enough items and other things that would add to game depth arent in it)

Gets repetitive (as stated above its missing aspects that would make it complete and its a bit empty)

When you die you get sent to prison and can speak as well as be released (you cant head on the crew as the traitor when they die they will just rat you to the rest of the crew, as well as the fact that with a key they can be released and revived tearing all your progress and kills to shreds. This doesnt mean you cant win just that you cant win as a player new to the game).

All in all its a great game im neutral on it considering the fact its early access all the cons make sense and I expect them to be solved/changed. The only issue is the death to jail system it pisses me and many others off, I dont see the devs changing it.

So as with any multiplayer game thats better with friends I would suggest to the Devs that they sell a 4 pack at a super discounted price or have a lot of sales/drop the price closer to $15-20 and add dlc or something... because right now the game could blow up or the player base will die out.",1626039915,1626039915,True,70,1,0.863239645957946777,4,True,False,True

Though...

Just wish there was more sabotaging the thralls could do so they didn't have to rely on bones knives and totems 24/7. Which the game heavily relies on. Stressful on my PC as well even on the lowest settings as well as glitchy ragdolls from corpses.

Also personally I don't like the respawn mechanic. Thralls coming back to life and then instantly getting out of dodge is kinda cheap to me while crewmates have to get keys. Also I wish you could speak to fellow dead players instead of just standing there.

Maybe if they made the environments more forgiving/more materials too survive and then made it so 1 death = game over then I would enjoy it, but personally I don't like it.",1623031578,1625810428,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It feels like more than just an adult version of Among Us, as the NPCs such as wolves can really mess your day up. Battling the elements is also a unique twist on the genre that should only continue to get better with future maps and content updates.

Thus far in my few hours I have only encountered one or two trolls, so nearly every game has had people doing their roles and contributing to the game. Despite the VOIP issues, most players communicate and are helpful and respectful. With all social deception games there are people who take it too seriously, but overall the player base is solid. Even when they cut my head off while I'm slaving away over a hot stove to feed the crew.

The game is also highly educational, as I never knew baby seals had so much blood.

So far I've enjoyed this game more than I thought. I also believe it has great potential. It is still early access so expect some bugs. Definitely worth the money. Do you have griefers yes.. but get with some good lobbies and you'll have a blast. If you have any questions I can answer them as best I can. Have fun

Fun for those looking for a new challenge in social deduction. Player base you don't have to wait to grow, devs are making good updates.

More social deduction games should be like this.
----
Although the goal behind win conditions are simple, the effort needed to make the ""social deduction"" in this game is nuanced and complex when compared to the similar Project Winter - a game I also enjoy and recommend. The first map allows for multiple playstyles as crew and the evil thrall - and the developers seem motivated to push significant content at least monthly.

Pros: the survival stats (hunger, warmth) are impactful and make meta games significantly less common than other social deduction games - I am still experiencing new strategies and deceptions even 40+ hours in.  After a couple of games, you will know all you need to enjoy the game but will continue to discover things you can improve on for your role (crew or thrall, randomly rolled each game).  

The spawn system and rate for most items are diverse enough to keep everyone pushing for their needs.  

Violence is the ultimate answer, once you learn how to fight and kill your enemies you can properly enforce your judgement and save your team. It is a learning curve,  but satisfying to take care of business before trouble occurs.

Once you die, you come back imprisoned with a last chance until someone releases you with a key that can be found multiple times through the game. This improves on a flaw I find in Among Us, a game built solely on hitting ""kill"" at the right time.  As thrall - make a direct kill? The crew will find out who did it and you must play the game in the wild and pick your re-appearances - while your 1 thrall teammate does the same or continues to blend in.  died from hunger or cold? accuse a crew member who hasn't been seen all game of killing you - talk your way into getting released or feed misinformation to confuse the crew during stressful moments in the game (there is no visual notification as to who is speaking).

Cons: there are few helpful guides to help those getting started - you will need to explore their  subreddit to learn how to improve your play. 

At this moment, no meaningful reporting or moderating tools are in place, even using there Discord to report can be disfunctional due to their ""bot"" that handles those communications.  Fortunately, most players who troll will do so at the beginning of a match - but there are repeat offenders who the game should automatically detect and ban (negative scores for sabotaging teammates in first several minutes over multiple games).

The VOIP needs fixing, I'd say you have a 5% chance of experiencing issues that will make the rest of a game unplayable - just restart the game and you'll likely see it fixed.",1625614697,1625615367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

PvP is an option, but often leads to the bad people (Thralls) revealing themselves. This is due to the unique brig mechanic acting as a chance to argue for a second life. Upon your first death, you are placed in the brig on the ship and are able to talk freely. From there you can argue your chance to be let out with a rarely found skeleton key.

-Written in Early Access-

Dread Hunger will never purport to be the perfect game, nor will I mislead you in telling you that it is. As of writing this in early access it is plagued by VOIP bugs, terrible AI pathfinding, and much more. However, it more than makes up for this with it's style, charm, and the ease at which it fills it's niche so well. 'Social deception meets Victorian England's most fabled frontier' was not a synopsis i had thought I would be rolling out the red carpet for my first Steam review on, but here we are. Endless replayability, and soul-suckingly fun, with well thought out and designed roles, and a Dev Team that I personally cannot speak more highly of, Dread Hunger deserves the accolades it's community gives it. With a growing community and support base, Dread Hungers development strides get larger by the day. 

I can't guarantee you a smooth experience in an early access game, so if you don't take the leap of faith in buying it now, or during the next sale, Come back in three, four, or six months time, Because I can guarantee you will have changed your mind for the better.

See you on the pack ice, sailor.

Just don't let prisoners talk while they're in the jail cells! Pretty fucking simple. Call me a pussy, but every game I end up being thrall, I don't do anything. This is because I know that even if I got a kill in, I know my victim is going to just yell my name in the cells and ruin the whole run. I would say wait for some updates to hit this one, then check it out later. I imagine that if we get enough people to yell this from the rooftops that prisoners need to be muted, then maybe they will mute prisoners and rework the jail revive system.

And don't tell me to just ""summon cannibals"". Yes, cannibals are a good distraction, but they are not good for getting kills in. They're useless for killing. A buff to them would be nice, but the jail system needs to be addressed first.

Instead of the people that die just spawning in the brig of the ship, they should get up where they died as an undead person or ghoul. either they would have to watch as their body goes on out of their control and tries to kill the remaining players, or they would get up again from where they died and have control, but maybe limited mobility until they start eating the human flesh. Maybe they could come up with something else.

As it is, if the crew does their roles and isn't totally bested by the thralls, then they will be able to complete the map in a relatively short amount of time. that doesn't make for a long game. And I found that the really sweet part of the game aside from the human interaction is, this game as a survival game. I kind of don't like how the blizzard makes it suddenly so cold that you likely can't survive it, but I understand you want to get the ship out of there before the blizzard happens. so it's kind of like a hunger games force field closing in.

The game really shines when you see strange personalities among people clashing, but there are some of the most horrible and toxic people who will try to insult you and bring up things from outside of the game that have nothing to do with the game. Usually because you had a disagreement that the felt was reason enough to try to attack you until dead, and if you defend yourself they will have a grudge even though they were the one who attacked you first. There are some legitimately mentally ill people that you will encounter playing this game. The racist role-players aren't even the worst ones. The worst ones are the ones that try to bring up things from outside of the game all the time. and next to that the worst ones are the ones who act like they did everything and are over-confident and have a bad attitude. A good player will improve new players and maybe make a steam friend and play multiple games with them and maybe make allies or build some trust etc. But a bad player will just be an asshole to people and try to make them feel as bad as they feel, which is a sign of mental illness or personality disorder. This game involves a lot of talking to people and having to deal with various behaviors and people with behavioral disorders. You'll find there's a lot of freedom, but you don't level up if you don't get points. So you need to play your role as either a regular crew member or as a thrall when auto selected to be one.

You can block and report people inside the game, but it's hard to see who it is you're talking to sometimes. at least they made the hud mostly minimal and it's pretty immersive even though not everything is interactive like a voxel based game would be. So far there is no random gen map which would really be great for a game mode. imagine the tundra or some big flat place you have to survive on and it's random where everything starts and there is a mist or a thick fog so you have to carefully walk forward and see what you find and you never know what's gonna happen. I have imagined a game like this anyway. The 1800s is a good time period for it IMO.

That's entirely reliant on who joins your lobby.

Had one game where the thralls instantly made themselves known by hatcheting everyone and promptly were killed and jailed and then it turned into a free for all where everyone died. 

Had one game where I was a thrall and worked with another competent thrall to slowly pick people off and win the game whilst the crew almost made it out. Great fun.

Firstly, the game works already, it's pretty well balanced and darnably entertaining, the map's got a pretty cool flow to it and doesn't get tedious due to the dynamic of each game. There's only one map at present but more are clearly in the pipe-line.

The player base is,  in my estimations, what makes or breaks a game like this. My experience in this community, thus far, has generally been a sound one.

I'm playing from the UK, independently, joining public servers. Match making is relatively swift over the afternoon/evening. Players are generally on the more mature side, by my reckoning, generally level of sentience in game world fair to high, by contemporary standards.

There's currently a pretty low troll count, all in all, though it must be said, if one is designated as one of the conspirators ('thrawls'), your mission is, essentially, to troll - which may actually have served to eradicate the troll phenomenon all together in this game, come to think of it.

A great deal of mirth may be had in those trolling endeavours, and skill it requires too, no shoddy plot will do, you must be a cunning devil. Cackling with glee you will be, in the icy shadows, as you weave your misery.

I particularly recommend this game to them as enjoys a bit of role play. It's not obligatory but if you happen to get in a crew with 2 or 3 people willing to get into character, it does intensify the experience no end. There is also scope in developing tactics within each role, as you get a handle on the game, either for amusement's sake or to build/corrupt the team dynamics... depending on your preference. Playing as the Captain, for example, can make for a most intriguing challenge if you actually attempt to exert authority over the situation - holding the crew together despite the conspirators or fooling them into serving their worst enemy, muhah!

Shelf-life wise, I would say this game is a fair bet, if the community doesn't stagnate. It could be said to be a touch pricey at 20 bart but, well, there's no free lunches here, buddy boy.
 
Aye, have a pop at it now, while it's got some excitement in the community. Many an amusing episode I have had already in there and return I shall, toot sweet.

Playing as the Thrall is really fun, i spend most of my time playing a thrall that runs straight to the large camp at the end of the map where i get to prepare for a fight with the survivors, this gameplay is really fun but you can also use social deception as the thrall and win that way, the thrall are able to win in so many ways. Playing as the survivors is also really fun and in this game you don't feel vulnerable. I spend a lot of time as the Hunter getting all my gear and resources ready to make sure that me and the other survivors win the game. The combat is really rewarding, shooting your gun knowing that if you miss all could be lost is really enjoyable and it makes everything intense, the melee weapons do seem to be the stronger item right now but guns do play nicely as a secondary. The interaction with other players is also a great experience, watching everyone loot and work making sure that these “friends” of yours are not thralls. Getting into crazy arguments where guns and blades are being pointed is also great, seeing all the chaos just to walk out alive alone is awesome.  

The content in the game right now is quite thin for the asking price but so far I've been very happy with my time. There are 2 maps, one is the tutorial map which isn't really played much by many and then there is “the approach” which is the main map. I now know the map pretty well but the fun still stays. The game has 8 characters (Roles) to play, things like a Capitan, Chef, Navigator, Doctor and hunter. Each role starts with a set of items and they also have a unique buff, making their role quicker/ more efficient, you can also level up this role to boost this buff. This leveling is really fun and rewarding, your next game always feels even better as you can now do your task even quicker with your improved buff. Overall while the content is low right now, it does look promising to see that the new content will be similar to what we have now. As for performance, the game runs really well, I'm holding 120-130 fps in most areas of the game with high settings, once in a while the game does seem to dip to 50fps or in some occasions where a VFX happens it can cause a major drop in frames.

This is a good start for the game, i'm excited to see where it goes. Definitely worth buying if you like what the game has to offer.

There's no voting like Among Us, which I actually like. I've only got a few hours in but it seems very easy to steal coal at the start of the round and fuck over the entire lobby. It also seems like this game is generally a lot more vulnerable to griefers and people going 3rd impostor. My only other complaint is that there is nothing to do in jail. You have two lives and after losing your first you get respawned in the ship's brig. You want to stay and help your teammates, but I just alt+tab and watch twitch/youtube until someone unlocks my cell with a randomly dropped key. I'm guessing most new players just give up and disconnect. I don't think it's an objectively bad design, but just give us something to do in the cell. All-in-all I'm recommending it because its a very underdeveloped genre and I think that the first person perspective of Dread Hunter is a step forward. Just don't expect a super polished or balanced game.

Update: I just had the sickest match ever. We barely won with one survivor.

As people get used to the game, I am noticing a 'Meta' going on with players who have higher hours. This is legit ruining the game and I will no longer be playing until it changes. People are taking the game too seriously and killing any suspected 'Thralls' close to the start of the game, even if they are not a thrall.

I've noticed a lot of reviews/discussions complaining about public servers and that they only get trolls.

As with most Early Access titles, you'll experience the occasional bug, but these have always been addressed as fast as possible.

The rumours of people being banned for griefing are true, but these are not people RPing or playing their character, the griefing is people being sexist, racist and homophobic, which we can all agree is not ok.

I have had a load of fun playing this game, it has tense moments and laugh out loud moments, the rag doll effects are particularly funny. Otherwise, the playstyle and alternate ways of succeeding for a Thrall create some interesting scenarios.

Social Deduction: Some of the best deceit gameplay I've ever seen implemented in a game. Sabotage seems so simple yet can be used in such diverse and complex ways in the right hands. It's an easy game to learn, but there's so much to master.

Survival: The mechanics used to survive aren't annoying and are rewarding.

Early access: Yes, it's an early access game so you aren't getting an entirely complete product. This latest update  brought bugs, but the baseline for the game is amazing. You get an experience from the game on it's own accompanied with meeting new people and potentially making new friends along the way. 

Community: The community right now has been amazing. People new to the game willing to learn and meet others are really a gem to the game. The interactions and dynamics upon different crews makes the game fresh and different each time. Considering that there's only one map, it's easy to put 100 hours in and still have not seen everything. There are nooks of details hidden within the game, tips that other players might give you that just didn't get uncovered before on your own. 

Game summary: Playing this game you can feel a love for the game by those who made it. There's issues with griefers and that's literally the main concern for cause that really stands out. The recent update brought a bug where a key gameplay mechanic can't be carried out, but after minutes on the official Dread Hunger discord, you can report the bug and have comfort knowing it will actually get fixed.

Negatives: People. Just like anything with public lobbies, open interaction online can be nasty. There is a report system though, and griefing is getting reasonable punishments if it is a user going out their way to ruin games; WITH STRONG EVIDENCE, the user will be dealt with in some way or form. There's also some recent concerns with how the progression works in the latest update, one being a movement speed increase exclusive to a character that scales up as you level. There IS only one map, which is being resolved of course, but it's definitely worth mentioning as a negative if you would like to wait on the game. 

PSA: The discord they have is a great place to figure out what the game is about. Just be friendly and get to know how they're communicating with players to already improve the game, and you'll understand how special it is to be able to interact with makers of a game that care about making it enjoyable for their players and continue their vision.",1621612887,1621612887,True,2,0,0.52686232328414917,0,True,False,True

In terms of gameplay the game doesn't lean towards the traitors simply attacking straight away and just trying to overwhelm the crew because each crew can come back once from the brig, which allows for snitching if someone axes you to death (on the first life at least) which makes the traitors have to actually try to sabotage and use cunning to kill or slow the crew while also armed with the games unique blood sacrifice abilities for the thralls which allows things such as cannibal attacks that allow you to send minions to do your bidding, to keep your hands clean and unseen.
This makes the game more interesting in my opinion since their can be plenty of armed conflict towards the second half of the game while actually making the traitors play a little more two faced than just being outright aggressive try hards that can win in the first five minutes.

The game also has plenty of survival elements. Similar to ""Project Winter"" the game has food and warmth needs with a series of items that can give different amounts of food or for example tea that warms and gives a small amount of food. Of course there are fires that can warm you, and not only are they not singularly located on the main base that is the ship (and discoverable around many structures and camps in the maps) you can also make a fire to cook and warm yourself, especially at night when the temperature drops even lower, because yes, the game advertises a day and night cycle.

Then there comes the living hazards, currently only pertaining to wolves, which offer food like the other none hazardous animals (seals and rabbits), but also call others in the area to attack with them and can cause serious damage or even death to the crew if you get caught alone or unprepared, which means that the game is perilous in itself and the traitors are definitely not the only thing you will be worrying about.

lastly there is one of my favourite mechanics. The downing. It's nothing to special, like in many other games you drop to hands and knees only to crawl about slowly and somewhat helplessly. The features that I really enjoy however are these two:

1. Other players can scoop up downed players (requiring an empty slot in their hotbar to carry the downed crew)
2. To revive a player there are two options. Firstly you can find a ground level bed in a cave (somewhat rare) a hammock which spawn in many of the camps and other abandoned structures or the ship. This is great because traitors can carry their teammate away into the wilderness and save them rather than placing the main tool for revives solely in the crews hand, it also makes it easier for crew to revive since downed people are on a bleed out timer. Secondly there are medical syringes. These can be obtained through the games crafting system, or by being the doctor who starts with a single syringe. These will take a small amount of time to revive someone thus making it not overpowered but can get someone back into a fight late game or save them if beds aren't close enough. (These medical syringes also give health if used on someone not downed and can be used on yourself by holding right click before left clicking to use)
3. While downed players do not lose their ability to be targetted by wolves or cannibals, which means that players wont be able to just cheese cannibal attacks or wolf attacks and crawl away but will instead be ravaged in a matter of moments unless a valiant hero leaps to their aid.",1621426334,1621426334,True,14,0,0.681761622428894043,0,True,False,True

-Variety of Classes
 Captain for example can drive the ship faster, a Hunter can skin animals quicker or a Doctor starts with a syringe to revive your teammates, while a Royal Marine starts with a gun and can kill anyone early.

-Crafting
 Lots of Items to craft, for example you can craft ice picks to climb walls to access hidden camps for more loot or you can craft yourself some guns to defend yourself or poison to place in the food.

-Survival Mechanics
 The environment is unforgiving, fall in to the freezing water then lose all your warmth and your health goes down quickly. Anyone ,even the traitors, who don't tread carefully can lose the game. Can hunt wolves or seals for meat or even humans.
During the night, the temperature goes down quick and if you can't craft a campfire or find shelter, you will freeze to death.

-Role-play
 Be the Captain and order everyone around or the youngest one in the crew - the chaplain, who always gets harassed with the dirty jokes. Some players use their pirate voice while some just plain talk trash.

-Challenging Goals
 Game is quite simple, You gotta fuel the ship to reach the end. But in order to fuel it, you need coal. So the team has to scavenge around the map, while managing  their hunger and warmth and looking out for the traitors/thralls. Driving the ship also needs teamwork, you gotta steer it carefully and if it hits a big block of ice, you gotta repair it or it will sink. Even if you manage to drive the boat at the end, you have to look for nitroglycerin to blast the ice blocking the way. Also it has a huge blast area that if a thrall manages to shoot it during transport then you will have a hard time.

-Sweet Betrayal
 As a thrall or the traitor, you have a lot of ways to sabotage the crew. Poison the food and blame the cook, Blow up the ship, Kill everyone, Make them paranoid so they can kill each other, Summon some cannibals to attack them, Summon fog to block their view while they drive the ship to waste their fuel if they stop or make them hit icebergs and damage the ship. There's a lot of ways and you can be creative with it, that is why its really fun. We had a traitor on one game and we were wondering why the boat ain't moving, its because it was the captain. He dumped all the coal without us knowing and he was being an ass about it complaining. Then suddenly dropped an explosive on the kitchen when everyone's warming up.

First off the game is extremely fun both with friends as well as public lobby’s. A lot coop deductive games fall into the issue that it only really works when you have a group of friends, however this game doesn’t suffer from it at all. From the games I’ve played so far the community on public servers are great to play with. 
I saw some other reviews saying that the game NEEDS 8 players to work properly but this also wasn’t the case. The game works well with 5 or more people. 4 is pushing it, but a full lobby isn’t needed for the game to still work. So if you only got 5 or 6 mates, it’s still a great time. 
 
The survival part of the game is very well done and feels like a constant struggle to pull through to the next day. Juggling who focuses on what task ties in really well with the coop aspect and forces player in public lobby’s to work together. 
The constant struggle for survival really adds to the immersion. As time goes on, even on the first day, people will begin to go missing, or not return to the ship only for a group to find them 3 days later in a ditch. Again really adds to the immersion of the game. 

On my first game, four of us got separated from the rest and we had to camp out in an abandoned tent for the night only for one of them to go unconscious in the morning. I took him and ran back to the ship, the other two stayed behind to find more resources and hall them back. I got back to the ship and stayed there for the night. When I went back out the next morning the two had disappeared completely. Really creepy shit. 

 Lastly the game is well polished and looks nice. Again for an early access game it’s nice to see. 

All in all, I’d say this is one of the best early access titles to come out of 2021 and with the devoted development team with new updates lined up, I hope to see a lot more of this game in the coming future. So buy this game, seriously.

You need to survive the harsh conditions of the Artic, you either as a crewmate need to go out and explore after coal to fuel your ship or as a Thrawl sabotage the crew from reaching the goal by either killing, sinking or slowing them down until the blizzard gets them.

A lot of social deduction games struggle with the players who die first, in Dread Hunger they fix this issue by putting you in a jailcell if you die. This makes for good dynamics that makes direct killing of the crew undesirable, as you either have to lie your way out of killing them, or killing them by other means.

I asked them on their discord about it and I was banned immediately because they were in a bad mood, lol. And I wasn't even the one who was banned in game.

Meanwhile you get groups of at least 6 or 7 people all in the same discord call together so they instantly know when one of their buddies is being attacked a million miles across the map the second it happens, and then all tell each other your location and team up to kill you instantly. But they don't get banned. I've had people openly admit during the game to working in discord calls together to have an unfair advantage over people, admit to stream sniping, coming to the stream then telling everyone who the thrall is to ruin the match, etc. The dev refuses to look at evidence of this or ban the people that do it, but will apparently perma-ban you if you dare criticize them for not doing anything about it.

Also the developer is stalking a streamer I watch who plays the game during their stream and bans them from the game over and over.

actually really good

Players have to gather coal from the map to power the boat through a icy passage in a few days, all while surviving freezing nights, the hunt for food, and supplies to fix the boat. Loot is scattered all over the map, with crafting tables, stoves, places to heal, so on. The 2 evil players do whatever they can to delay them, kill them, poison them, break the boat, and generally wreck havoc. Every aspect of this game feels well designed. The randomized loot makes each run as a good or evil player different. MOST of the randoms online are hilarious and good natured, but there are a few toxic people.

I honestly can't see going back to games like Among Us or Deceit after playing this. More maps, classes, and content to come.

-Immersive atmosphere. Most of the sounds, lighting, and visual design are quite good. Only a couple sounds need tweaking.
-combat is straightforward and simple. You look, you swing or click, you do damage. No attack directions or faux-realistic blocking with parrying or anything. Each class has a different weapon. Most people have axes, the captain has a sword, and the Marine has a pistol and maybe a melee weapon, not sure.
-Recipes and other game mechanics are self explanatory. Crafting requires the ingredients be present. In your inventory or in the box both work, as long as they're present.
-Resources are simple. Burnable items (including tools) can burn as fuel. You can sacrifice that coal you were saving for the boiler to emergency light a campfire or stove, or even break it down into gunpowder for your gun.
-Rocks and stick can be thrown. Hilarity ensues as the other guy whips out a gun.

Cons
-Some resources are too plentiful. Nitroglycerin has 100 uses that the traitors would have to stop somehow, which is effectively impossible. 
-There is technically a finite amount of coal, but with the traitors being outnumbered 4-1, the crew is pretty much guaranteed to get more than enough coal to get the ship going with very little effort.
-Muskets are ballsdeep hard to get.  They require iron ingots that I have not even seen once in 3 hours of playing, and the musket reloads slower and doesn't do noticeably more damage than the pistol. 
-Keys are a weird resource. Frankly the only class who can get them is generally the priest, as the priest will pretty much never run out of Skeleton keys. In fact if the priest is a thrall or dies, the rest of the crew is basically screwed. You need them for opening lockboxes with rarer loot, or to respawn people (once per person). If the thrall controls that, everyone else has a much harder time.
-You have to find a new server after every match. Not sure if this is intentional, a glithc, or just hosts not restarting. But all 5 matches I was in required me to leave and find a new one at the end.",1620550998,1620550998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

for example, you require food to keep the hunger away, insulation & generally anything that would warm you up to starve off the cold. traitors main strength comes from the anonymity of being one, since you can gather fuel, but deposit it in the sea or use it for nefarious means, like creating gunpowder to starve the boiler (adding gunpowder to the boiler takes away enough fuel equal to how much 1 coal gives you.) the brig system i was sceptical at first since its a respawn mechanic, but it promotes indirect murder more than direct murder, making the gameplay more about deductive reasoning (unless you're one of those that just make snap judgements to build trust, just the way it is) rather than blindly assuming someone of dying. because assuming wrongly can cost the explorers an extra hand that could've been used to gather coal, gather food, repair the ship or... simply help against the thralls.

so id say in short, its a pretty decent game that plays more onto social aspects, however by no means is it really meant to represent a game that i really cant be arsed naming, as its practically a social infection at this point (sus). to me, its a mix of Long Dark, and elements of The Ship in a way, which complements the nature of t he game quite well. It definitely does have potential, however I feel like the game would be better priced at around 15 pounds (or whatever currency that would convert to) since the product, although graphically nice and the gameplay concept unique and refreshing, is still in development.

I strongly recommend this game. This is a survival/craft/Social Deduction game where there are typically 2/8  crew members attempting to sabotage the crew from driving the boat to safety. If you enjoyed Among Us, you will most likely enjoy this as it does have some similarities. This game is vastly different at the same time. The map is pretty big and there is only proximity voice chat to communicate. So sometimes people die and you were never there to hear/see it. 

I'll break down the pros and cons.

Pros:

1) Immersive gameplay
2) Very fun with friends or joining random people
3) Community so far is not toxic
4) Creates atmosphere for very funny role playing (everyone is a certain crew mate like cook, captain, hunter etc.
5) When you are a thrall there are so many ways to be creative with sabotaging the crew

Cons:
1) Players can still talk after they are dead (However, killing people directly is not really the meta anyway) so  they can rattle on you if you kill them.
2) Low player count, takes a few minutes to fill lobbies 
3) Random disconnects from time to time when in/joining games

I wish I could recommend this game but the strongest draw back is the lack of players.  Without players it's a little hard to judge the game.  Cause even with a full lobby I would judge it harshly on the fact that a lot of players are using discord to communicate instead of using the in game VOIP.  This leads to feelings of being cheated because you don't know who joined the game in a party and with EVERY other person using discord the game doesn't feel right. 

What is here is a reasonably good game.  However it doesn't feel long enough.  The ship doesn't have to travel very far maybe what is the distance of a mile or less.  For a coal fired ship with sails this distance really make little sense.  So the trip is underwhelming when you think about it.  Food is maybe too abundant.  It's almost impossible to kill anyone on the ship because the distance you can see is extreme and there are no real divides.  Voices carry way too far.  So if you're the thalls it is actually very hard.  The strange thing is as easy as it is to identify thralls in the open it's much harder to tell when they're close due to the lack of animations.  The animations are not thorough enough to provide context to the characters actions and what they are doing when in close proximity.  Unless it's something obvious like holding a bone shard.

Over all the game is good and fun but the lack of content, lack of distance, lack of people mean the game is pretty hard to even play.",1620061151,1620061151,False,2,0,0.466385960578918457,0,True,False,True

Dread Hunger is currently a small game with a lot of potential to be a big contender in the Social Deduction genre. Currently at $25, the game is expensive, and unless you want to be a part of the community and influence the development of an early access title or if you just really want the game, I'd wait until the full release/sale to buy the game.


Introduction:
Dread Hunger is another installment of the Social Deduction genre, a genre which has received quite a lot of love lately with games like Among Us and Project Winter. Dread Hunger has opted for a more serious, psychological horror atmosphere, drawing heavy inspiration from The Thing and The Terror. Keep in mind this is an Early Access title, and while there are remarkably few bugs that impact gameplay, there are certainly a few quality of life features that have yet to be implemented. The devs are active though, pushing out a new major update roughly every month or so, and there is a road map looking to implement new features until the full release and probably beyond.

Gameplay:
You and 7 other crew mates must navigate your coal-devouring ship through the arctic and navigate through the ice blocking your way before a blizzard freezes you in 3 days time. You must scavenge supplies from previous failed expeditions to stave off hunger, cold, and wildlife while you keep your boiler stocked with coal to keep the ship moving. You can also use your supplies to craft weapons and tools to aid you in survival. Destroy the iceberg blocking your path with the incredibly volatile nitroglycerin and sail into open waters to survive. But be warned, 2 of your crewmates are thralls, cannibals who will use whatever methods they can to ensure your expedition's failure, including the dark arts.

Unlike most Social Deduction games, Dread Hunger has a one time respawn system. Each player essentially has 2 lives. When a player dies, they will respawn in the brig of the ship where a key is needed to release them. While they are locked up, they are fully capable of communicating with the rest of the crew and can tell everyone how they died, or who killed them. This, along with a surprisingly large proximity voice chat, means it's incredibly hard for a thrall to pick off a lone crewmate directly (Granted, the dead have to be convincing enough to the crew. Though in my experience, the crew usually side with the dead). It's much safer to sabotage the crew indirectly, either by throwing supplies into the ocean, setting traps, damaging the ship when no one is looking, or stealthily using your magic to pick off a crew member. There are currently 3 spells available to the thralls; a ""phase"" like ability that turns you intangible and greatly increases your speed, a ""white out"" ability that summons a heavy fog, and a ""summon"" ability that creates a small horde of cannibals who attack a target player. You can also create totems that increase the strength of your spells. The phase is incredible for map traversal and to sneakily set up an ambush, while a combination of white out and summon can be deadly to unsuspecting crew. Overall, I would say the most deadly killer in the game to new players is the arctic. It requires genuine game knowledge and cooperation to just survive the elements, for both crew and thrall alike. Don't be surprised if it takes a couple of games to stop losing health (or even dying) to cold or hunger.

Community:
Let's talk about the player count. There are a few reviews complaining about the low player count, with somewhere between 50-150 players at any given time. From what I hear, this is actually intended by the devs for now, as they want a small but loyal player base while they work on completing the game. This way they can give the best first impression to the most people with a more complete game. That being said, even during the ""dead"" periods it generally doesn't take longer than 5 min for a lobby to fill up, and that's on the long end of waiting times. You'll just often play with the same people for multiple games in a row, which is arguably a good thing as it's a great way to make friends. Even better if you already have a group of friends you want to play with as private lobbies also have the ability to change gameplay slightly, such as length of days, number of thralls, etc.

Overview:
As I said in the tl;dr I genuinely believe Dread Hunger has the potential to be big. It's a pretty game with fun gameplay as is, and it's only going to get better. Personally, I'm satisfied with the price I paid for the game, but I also know I'm a huge fan of social deduction games in general so I'm probably willing to pay more than the average person. If the game really calls to you and you want to experience the game in its infant state and help it grow, I can't recommend it enough. If you have any reservations still, I'd wait until the game is either more fleshed out or goes on sale. Even then, I would keep Dread Hunger on your wishlist as I wouldn't be surprised if it blows up in the coming months/year.",1620028629,1620028629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First i would like to address some of the comments about not being able to find a game. This game released within the last 2 weeks so there the community hasn't had time to grow yet. That being said, i have not had any problems finding a match. The game offers a handy random match and server browse option so if your random match isn't finding a match for you, you can just browse the servers and join one that's in need of people. The game is very fun no matter what side you get, which is cool because a lot of asymmetrical games are more fun for the killers rather than the survivors. 

This game has set up a structure where there is so much things to manage / do that the matches can end in so many different ways and outcomes. The thralls (impostors) have many ways of disposing of the survivors, both inconspicuously and brutally blatantly. With the thralls, you absolutely need to have a strategy if you want to win though, because a well coordinated team can cut your plans short if you make the slightest mistake. 

As survivors, you need to complete a main objective which takes a few in game days (some matches last longer than others), and what makes this game unique is that aside from the main objective, there is also the objective of staying alive. Food, Heat, Wolves, Cannibles, are all things you NEED to worry about, and they are things that will dictate what actions you take next. Get caught out in the middle of nowhere at night time during a blizzard that is Chunking away at your health? There is no saying ""ill worry about it later"" you are all of a sudden on a desperate search for a cave, tent, hut, or any place of shelter in order to preserve your own life.

The devs have already put up a mini roadmap as well, which details what will be added in the future. Alot of early access games fail to do this which can make it kind of scary to think about purchasing. 

What this game needs is more content. There is currently one map, and though each round is so different from the last, its still the same gameplan until something happens that forces you to change your priorities (which may not happen if the thralls are not good at being thralls). I would love to see more abilities from the thralls, more items which can be used to change the games outcome, cosmetics / customization (which is mentioned alot in the roadmap). They have such a good foundation already, all they need to do now is build and expand on it. 

As for bugs, in 8 hours i have only encountered a few crashes that happen when the game ends. Haven't crashed mid game or anything like that. Also, some people mention an proximity chat glitch that happens sometimes, i haven't experienced it, but that doesn't mean its not there.

Game feels really good, especially for early access. 

I recommend this game if you like among us type games. this game takes the concept so much further by adding a survival element (food and weather conditions), as well as proximity chat in order to spice up every encounter with other players. Te respawn system is very unique in the way that as a survivor, your life lies in the hands of any other player with a key who trusts your not a thrall, and as a thrall, if you did your job good and nobody suspects you, then youll be freed. if they do suspect you, youll need to pray your thrall partner has a key and is able to sneak into the cells and release you. 

20+ dollars is alot for an early access game. I was on the fence about getting the game until i read all the reviews and learned more about the gameplay. The game is very fun and i think its worth a shot. If you have money to spend, get it, it will not only grow the community, but provide you with ample entertainment. If you like your games to be full of content before you drop 20, then i would suggest waiting until more of the content rolls out. i dont mind living alongside a games development so long as its a good game and has promise to grow.

Dread Hunger is a great blend of The Long Dark, Among Us, and crew-based games like Pulsar and Sea of Thieves. The survival mechanics are BRUTAL, but if you have a competent crew, it isn't impossible. Therefore, the Thralls have a bit of an advantage -- they can even win if both Thralls have been locked in the brig, so long as the rest of the crew doesn't survive. I can imagine it's even better with friends, but I really enjoy the atmospheric survival elements.

My feedback for the devs: I would like to see the pacing slowed down a bit. I imagine if you just have longer maps with perhaps a slower day/night cycle that would be the perfect solution; you can leave the ones as they are for people in search of a faster match. The VOIP can be a little grating at times, idk if that can be adjusted but that's just a personal request. Otherwise, I absolutely love it. This is quite actually the first game I've ever bought just because it looked great, and not because I had seen someone play it before or had it recommended.

Feedback for the player: Go ahead and get it if you really like TTT/Among Us/First Class Trouble AND you like HARDCORE survival mechanics. We're talking ""Makes DayZ's survival look forgiving"" levels here. If you're a fan of both, this game does it better than any I can think of.

Very few technical issues (only one crash in 12 hours) and the visuals and sound design are fantastic; nothing beats the chunky BONK of a rock meeting a rabbit at high speed.

My only suggestions:
- Weapons should deal more damage overall, allowing for more sneaky melee kills.
- Give players in the brig something to do, it can be quite boring just waiting around hoping to be let out. 
- Ghost spectator mode when you are dead is a great concept, though it would be greater if you could interact with items and players in small ways while a ghost, adding to the spookiness for living players.

A bonus feature of this game is that if you have a crew of <5 it can be quite difficult actually surviving through the level, even without the deception aspect.

Pros:
- Interesting design & concept (Among Us + Sea Of Thieves)
- Engaging gameplay 
- Easy to connect up with your friends and create your own public lobby!
- All roles fun to play! (Being a thrall is tricky but exciting if you can trick your crew mates into trusting you!
- Lots of good stuff coming in the roadmap!
Cons:
- After initially dying you are locked in the brig until someone lets you out. This can be boring as you spend about 20-30 mins practically begging to be let out. Could be improved with a mini game like the card game to pass the time?
- Minor in-game chat issues, just make sure you set up your input & output initially, restart the game and you should be good
- Hunger & Heat levels need to be tweaked a little more in my opinion. Especially with larger crews.

Hopefully see you out there sailors!

Great, now that we have your attention, you are probably consumed with this concept and already bought the game, see you in the lobby!

This game is amazingly fun.  Bought it planning on just trying a few matches and ended up playing literally all night, with no regrets!  Every game plays out so differently because of the many elements at play.  Can't wait for even more maps and whatever else is in store for this incredibly unique one of a kind gem! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

In all my time playing we only encountered one little bug, sometimes the player audio (voice chat) in game will stop working after a match, a simple relog fixed this for us every time, but I had one match where I was playing ""deaf and mute"" and people just assumed I was the traitor, similarly if you don't have a microphone / headset I wouldn't bother playing until you obtain one.  Voice chat is an absolute must for this title.

The devs are very devoted to the game, they even showed up to play a few games with us periodically. I have no doubt that they will knock this one out of the park.  It is very polished for it's current state and well worth the price of admission.",1619450363,1619452053,True,9,0,0.602981209754943848,0,True,False,True

It's a ton of fun, with strangers or friends. There's Matchmaking, refresh every 2-4min to find a game (it's in early release so it takes a couple of minutes) or make a new Public lobby to find people. Most of the people playing are nice. Games run around 30min with 8 players. 

Info for a quick start; everyone should stay Warm and have Food to survive. If you're Innocent, put coal in the furnace and drive the ship before it's stolen. If you're an Imposter, throw the coal in the ocean. There's a ton of detail to learn in the game after that, stuff I haven't figured out yet after hours of playing.
