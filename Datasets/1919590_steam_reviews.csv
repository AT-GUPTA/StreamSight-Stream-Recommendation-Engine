Consider yourself as a person who don't really expect much, just to catch a glimpse of  being an NBA superstar. Getting drafted, getting to the league, playing alongside your favorite superstars, breaking records, etc etc (not fucking Instagram super models tho). The game is decent, if these are your requirements in finding happiness while playing your favorite sports, digitally.

But if you're into the competitive PvP modes and not missing out important features, this aint it. Being ""Current Gen"" really messes up the overall experience. Not to mention online PvP modes come with delayed shot timing due to the server problems they will never rectify. Oh and, if you're not willing to put in some grindz, the micro-transactions are your choice, but they made it in such a way that really fucks up the game. 

For me, I find this game enjoyable. Because I don't play PvP, just for the pure MyCareer experience. No in-game transactions, nothing. But one thing is for sure tho, I really hoped that they made MyCareer offline, so I could really play it for a really long time. But the developers wouldn't listen anyways, and the minimal effort is proven of incredible amount of things that can be improved that can be determined by a dude without any creativity, just like me.",1708672180,1708672180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MyCareer is a joke and a cash grab as usual, no significant improvement or changes from the last 2k I played which was 2k21 and loads of technical issues that make the game less than fun to play. If you have a 144hz 4k monitor you may as well just not get this game because it's going to be laggy and unplayable without loads of workarounds and practically forces you to go to 60hz and even then the game still doesn't run perfect. The story in MyCareer was nothing special and the game play is just like every other 2k with minute differences. One of the positives I'd say is you can actually get posterizing dunks which felt impossible in 2k21. Besides that the only difference I noticed was that you can brick green shots somehow. Oh yeah and did I forget to mention like everyone else that 2k still hasn't implemented Next Gen? This game is not worth the money and neither are any of the recent renditions unless you get it dirt cheap. I hope we see the day that these sports game companies stop slapping a new label on an old product and selling the same game yearly with worse or no changes but as long as people continue buying these games it won't stop. I myself will never buy another 2k unless I actually see improvement, these companies could just provide roster updates yearly instead of re-releasing a game yearly but the corporate pricks who sit at the top of the company would never be willing unless they can somehow squeeze even more profits out of people doing so.

Even if your three point rating is 99 you rarely make it if you dont green it and occasionaly you might airball it even if you are open. I have even missed a couple of green releases. The opposing CPU on defense is too good and your team's CPU on defense is ridiculously bad almost like you have to play defense on your own. Teams will hit you with 10 open threes in every game whilst all your threes are contested, because the off-ball defense on your team is just slow and brainless. I find it unplayable on very high difficulties unless 90% of your points are in the paint. The game keeps randomly crashing and i lose all the progress i've done in the game or in myLeague.

This franchise MUST be boycotted. The convolution of 2k is Hideous and disgusting now. A lovecraftian nightmare. The fucking ads and programs on loading screens has people PRETENDING TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH A GREEN SCREEN. Like the guy host is afraid to be around women irl. and it's easy to recognize how uncanny it seems. 

This is NOT a basketball game. That's all I want. A basketball sim, give us our old school teams with old school rules and presentation. Give us realistic stat logic like 2k16 and 2k11, and 2k12. Give us great ball physics and AI that adjusts accordingly. Where each team plays like an actual ball club. Where it simulates a team from the 80's playing like that era against a team from the 2000's or such. Myleague in 2k16 is heaven, everything is fine, you had your good thing and I had mine.

The Jordan challenge is the ONLY feature in this game that feels like they tried. But the fact that you can only play with those incredible filters and the game functions like an actual basketball game in ONE MODE is another turn off. WHY?? How much longer can we settle for this mediocrity? How much longer will we be forced to reminisce on older titles?

This game has turned into a propaganda machine. The hip-hop centric tone and HORRID soundtrack makes it feel like some corporation is pandering to a specific demographic that wants to impose a rigid flavor of culture into the general ethos of basketball and the league. I'm over it. As far as I'm concerned this franchise fell off after 2k16. After Kobe retired, after a good enough finals series, before the age of the super team and journeyman superstars. The league is dead to me with their platforming of Stephen A pandering to racism, ESPN is a joke now. This isn't about sports anymore. It's about the industrial revolution and it's consequences being a disaster for the human race.",1676769502,1706835377,True,0,0,0.863638818264007568,13,True,False,False

First and foremost, the shooting mechanics feel like a step backward rather than an improvement. The developers claim to have introduced a more realistic approach, but what we got is a convoluted mess. Timing is everything, they say, but in practice, it's more like a guessing game. The inconsistency in shot success is baffling, with seemingly identical releases yielding drastically different results. This unpredictability undermines the skill-based aspect of the game, leaving players feeling helpless and robbed of agency.

The players' basketball IQ, or lack thereof, is another glaring issue. It's disheartening to witness AI-controlled teammates making baffling decisions that defy the fundamentals of the sport. Whether it's a lack of spatial awareness, questionable shot selection, or failing to recognize open teammates, the overall basketball IQ of the players is abysmal. This not only ruins the immersion but also makes it nearly impossible to execute strategic plays or enjoy a cohesive team experience.

Moreover, the supposed improvements in player animations and realism are overshadowed by the glaring flaws in the game's core mechanics. Clunky movements, awkward transitions, and unrealistic player reactions further contribute to the overall disappointment. It's as if the developers sacrificed fundamental gameplay for the sake of flashy graphics, leaving players with a visually appealing but fundamentally flawed gaming experience.

In conclusion, NBA 2K23 is a regrettable step backward for the franchise. The shooting system's unpredictability and the abysmal basketball IQ of players make for a frustrating and unrewarding gaming experience. Until these issues are addressed and the core gameplay is refined, it's hard to recommend this installment to anyone who values a true-to-life and enjoyable basketball simulation. Save your money and stick to earlier, more polished entries in the NBA 2K series.

Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and fill a 12 cupcake tray with cases.

STEP 2
Using an electric whisk beat 110g softened butter and 110g golden caster sugar together until pale and fluffy then whisk in 2 large eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.

STEP 3
Add ½ tsp vanilla extract, 110g self-raising flour and a pinch of salt, whisk until just combined then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases.

STEP 4
Bake for 15 mins until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.

STEP 5
To make the buttercream, whisk 150g softened butter until super soft then add 300g icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.

STEP 6
Whisk together until smooth (start off slowly to avoid an icing sugar cloud) then beat in 3 tbsp milk.

If I want to jump I'll jump but to often I go for a steal and jump right past the play when I didn't want to leave the ground to begin with giving the opponent a wide open look.

- From a My Career standpoint Team Takeover is absolute Trash and causes nothing but problems. I don't wanna play as every jackoff on my team. I'm one player and don't like the game screwing my shot timing up! Why not just let it be individual hot streak? Like a boost to scoring or boards or even blocks or whatever the player has been stellar at in the moment. Is it because you think hivemind is cool?

- Absolutely love the ""5 extra steps"" feature that keeps me from being able to stop beyond the arc 80% or so of the time when I'm running my 3&D PG

- You build yourself a bully big and all of a sudden he'd rather do layups which are rated about 60 than dunks that are 85 standing and 90 driving? Totally makes sense

-Love how my player will stop mid run while wide open for no apparent reason other than to let a defender get to me. Again makes total sense. And yes I still have half or better stamina.

-Also love how my player will automatically turn 180° towards a defender while down low so there is layup when it should have been a dunk and coverage and forcing a possible miss/block when he could easily put it up as a lay or dunk with his outside hand without turning around. All that while sprinting to the tin on the baseline. That was one of my most used moves back in the day playing pick up games. To have an NBA player unable to hit that sounds pretty sad.

- The stealing is subpar I wanna swipe at the ball not grope the ball handler. Yes I know if you hold the steal button you grope but a tap ain't a hold Chief.

- I don't want forced to run into every player I run pass that's within 5 feet of me as I play defense. No I'm not talking screens.

- Love the SJW conversations by the announce crew and the attempt to praise the players to do more than shut up and dribble. Gotta shine a light on the Hypocrites? I'm surer the players love being exposed like that. It makes it really weird playing the game only hearing the on court sounds and crowd. I don't play games to be preached to... especially when what is being spoken is venom and easily debunkable.


Single WORST game I've ever played


***Also when did someone stepping out of bounds with the ball mean the defender covering them gets a blocking foul?


***This will be the Last 2K game I'll ever own!










12/25/23 Update: 
Still absolute Garbage of a game. Still looking for a game that I would call worse than this atrocious dumpster fire. I mean how fun is it when you hit a button and your player randomly does a different command or just says nah I'm good.

Game is fun enough but the controls are way too complected to do advanced moves, you have to hold a button to modify and stuff to do a crossover and you cant even do a pro hop/euro step using a single button like you could years ago.

Not touching online as I know it's plagued with cheaters. That's a no-go for me.

MyCareer boots up... I get ready for the last match before the post season starts... 164 to 64. I'm winning the game. 63 points, 19 rebounds, 26 assists... 12 minutes per quarter, it's taken 45 minutes to get to the final quarter to seal in the win... 8.5 seconds left on the clock... AND THE GAME CRASHES?!?!?!? I lost all that progress and i have to play the match all over AGAIN because the game doesn't have save points between quarters.

The sad thing is this is a common problem. The game gets to the final quarter and everything goes to shit and crashes. I haven't found a fix and nothing seems to be triggering the error. 

My settings: 
- Highest Graphics settings - Borderless Fullscreen (I alt-tab to get around the bench timing)
Controller (of course)
- 12 minute Quarters

However, I can't recommend a title in this price range that's as buggy as it is. My system isn't top shelf, but it's no slouch either. I know how to tweak my settings appropriately. Still, this game is going to crash. Unfortunately, such a crash happened roughly 14hrs prior to this review. In the playoffs, just after finishing a 2nd match-up against The Raptors.  Won the first, lost the 2nd by 3. After the game, a message from Gatorade directed me to the purser's desk to collect my payment for an event. While I was loading into the neighborhood, the game crashes. Now, I can't load into MyCareer. I have a pretty extensive troubleshooting background. I didn't just give up. I dug deep. Tried all the cloud manipulating tricks I know short of deleting everything and starting over. Deleted and reloaded local files. Un/reinstalled the game. Nothing. Just borked. Even trying to load a game in MyTeam malfunctions now. The only hope I have at this point is that an upcoming season brings a patch to untie whatever garbage tech knot has been tied. Every other title I own is operating just fine. I fear that even if a patch does correct the issue, I will have to surrender whatever career progress I made and start again. I'm confident that my character build is still intact. So at least there is that. I really wish that bigger titles like this did more to release a functioning product they can maintain versus meeting some weak, predetermined release date. If you're gonna buy the game, wait for a good sale. Keep your backups up to date. And, simply understand, even though it has been tightened up mechanically.

It is cut-throat, out for your money, with little to no reward or customer consultation.  It is impossible to advance in the game without paying extra money...they make you buy extra ""passes"" for more money for really lame bonuses.  I had to stop myself from falling into the bad pattern I dd with this game and luckily 2K made it easy by making 2K24 not very much fun.  The reason I am adding to my review is to let everyone know that I ended up spending 100$ a week on VC on this game and just realized that if i kept this up(i did it for about 4-5 months) for the whole year I would of spent close to 10% of my total income on VC alone.....that's not even including the price i pay for bonus passes and the game itself.  In short,  find the 2k game you like and invest in that and don't fall into the 2K pattern of robbing the poor to pay lazy ass developers who can't even make better versions consistently.
Thanks for offering me something 2K.  I have spent so much money on your games.
Funk you badly, sadly, not gladly--with saran wrap around my johnson, not even!!!


Was loving the game until I dropped almost 40$ to buy some Season 4 cards.  I had bought a couple previously and got a 98 Kyrie....so, I thought.....if I buy 10 packs I should get a few more high 90s cards, right?
WRONG!!!!!  The best card out of 16 cards was a 96 Serge Ibaka.  The next best was a 94 Buddy Hield, a 93 Jamaal Wilkes and then 13 cards all mostly 91s of players that barely played in the NBA or barely play.  I didn't receive ONE CARD out of 10 packs that was at all a boost to my team.  It cost me like 75$ to get enough credits to even get the 10 pack of cards.  So, I am quite upset.  And I have every right to be.  Life has become twice as expensive almost overnight and when I spend exorbitant amounts of money on games to have some fun in this ever more depressing world I expect the developers to NOT RIP ME OFF!!!
I realize now that someone has to come up with a better sim basketball game.  2K will ALWAYS place profit before customer satisfaction. For example, I have been asking for help on why I keep on getting error messages on the exhibition feature on My Team.......over 6 people i have talked to and they ask for a screenshot, i give them what they ask for and then some new person says their taking over the request and just keep on asking the same questions. 
I am sure that they know that this feature is glitched beyond any sort of fix, and instead of simply admitting it they would rather waste their user's time.  It''s disgusting.  I have tried to remain loyal to 2K because, well, I am loyal....but they are not ....so, don't buy this game. Is NBA Live still a thing?  prolly not, I assume 2K is also in the monopoly biz too.
April 28
THIS GAME IS LIKE AN OPIOID----ADDICTIVE, EXPENSIVE, TOXIC.
I have spent somewhere close to a grand searching, praying, hoping for that 99 Dark Matter draw.  Nope.....repeats of Jae Crowder, Christian Wood and just disappointment after disappointment.   And guess what, a couple of days ago i pulled a ""grand prize"" card and got the 99 dark matter Isaiah Thomas!!!!  Woohoo, right......wrong.  he sucks, and I am personally pissed off for Mr. Thomas and the poor representation of his game in this sim.  Also, it turns out that everyone who reaches the level I have thus far pulls the grand prize card inevitably to keep you hooked.  LOL. 
 Plus, half of the new challenges they come up with are stupid.  Like, score 35 points with Jimmy Butler in 3 min quarters?!?!?  Oh, that's fun.  Feed the ball non-stop to one player for 12 minutes straight?  oh ya, so much thought was put into that.  For all the money you're making off this BS VC side hustle you have going, as well as charging 80$ for the base game you should be able to hire some people with an average IQ and some imagination/innovation.  Start earning your paychecks and stop wasting our time and money.  Idiots!!!!!

Gameplay is good but everything else is dogshit specially with the resetting of myplayers every fucking year. 

For new players that are maybe thinking of getting into 2k i wont encourage you to. This game will milk the shit out of you til the last drop, it is absolutely utterly ridiculous.  2k doesn't deserve your hard earned money, The system goes as follows. 

You make a build (MyPlayer, MyCareer) and you grind it up! Meaning playing games to earn VC to spend on your attribute upgrades and desired player animations cause you aint doing jack shit with a 60 overall character. You would need 400k+ VC to max out a character and guess what? you'll only earn about 800 to a 1500 vc every game via NBA season games and those games are a fucking disguise to make you feel that you are still playing the same 2k MyCareer of old (Offline MyCareer) but guess what honey its all about that fucking VC. 

And when 2k finally decides that you should not be playing this game anymore then they'll shutdown the servers. Meaning thats it for you baby! No more MyPlayer games whatsoever. All that grind for fucking nothing. All those accomplishments you made during your NBA season games and the records you broke along the way aint worth shit because they wanna force you into buying their fucking game for the following year. 

Yes this is a RANT! 2k dont deserve your money and specially your time. I only bought this game to see whats up! I was excited to play MyCareer only to find that its long dead and gone. (Last 2k i played was 2k14 on PC) and 2k you guessed it right baby! I aint buying this dogshit game no more.",1673157376,1694564835,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NBA 2K23 has been widely criticized as a terrible game for several reasons. First and foremost, its relentless focus on microtransactions has created a pay-to-win environment that undermines the competitive balance of the game. Players are constantly bombarded with opportunities to spend real money on virtual currency, which not only hinders the sense of accomplishment in earning in-game rewards but also alienates those who can't afford to invest heavily in the game. Additionally, the game's artificial intelligence often results in frustratingly unrealistic gameplay, with questionable player behavior and inconsistent physics. Furthermore, the recurrent technical issues, including server crashes and graphical glitches, have plagued the gaming experience. The lack of meaningful innovation in gameplay and modes from previous iterations also makes it feel like a mere roster update rather than a true evolution of the franchise. All these factors combined have contributed to the widespread disappointment and frustration among NBA 2K fans, making NBA 2K23 a terrible addition to the series",1694029313,1694029313,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I still wish they were that company. Like many others they have gone the way of big name developers and lost the art of making a good game for the sake of pay to win. You can buy your Myplayer or you can grind forever during a season to try to get somewhere. You will play every game and improve your player to a certain point each season. attribute points get to ridiculous levels and will take multiple games for 1 point. Influencing you to buy your way to the top. That is what they ultimately want is your money, the price for the game is not enough. 2K has gotten so greedy that you play every game in a season, you dominate the playoffs, and secure a championship for you and your team.  You win absolutely nothing. no bonus xp points no extra anything. WINNING A TITLE GET YOU NOTHING IN THE GAME!!!! Even after that you still will not have a maxed out character its about 1/3 the way. 2 more full seasons of grinding for a total of 3/4 of the way there or you can pay money and max them out. its not cheap about 100 dollars. Or you can play the same game they have been making for 20 years and grind it out with no glory even with title after worthless title. It looks nice though. Clunky is a word that describes the collision in this game. it is like madden 03 there is plenty of room to get by by you bump into magical bubbles that you cant penetrate. you see room between players, plenty of room to...ohh their hands are touching makes sense why i cant get by, man now im touching 2 players im frozen and i cant seem to get out of.... 3 second violation of course it is. This is a very scripted experience that is not fun. People dont talk like that and its just plain annoying. Instead of a rock solid myplayer experience they opted for a high school drama between 2 rivals. there is Shep who is amazing with his starting attributes and then there is you who is the worst draft pick of the NBA but are somehow on the same level. you will have twitter battles and trash talk on social media. Amazing basketball experience its why i bought the game is to worry about my social media. Because i didnt buy Myplayer and chose to progress naturally I never got to play online. it is full of play to win people that you will stand no chance playing against at a low level like a 80 overall. I miss a sports experience about the sport. EA had to buy the rights to the NFL because 2K sports destroyed them one year on a better overall football experience. i want that 2K experience back not a netflix melodrama.

This game gets a 2/10 for the PC version.

To start with the obvious issues and downsides based on the actual game itself: 

- The game is capped at 60 FPS in multiplayer 
- The game has the absolute worst input lag of any multiplayer game you will ever touch; it feels like at least 100 MS lag.
- The game is stuck in old gen, so PC players with even decent PC builds aren't allowed to play the best version of 2K
- The Game is pay to-win; either you grind for 300+ hours for VC or pay $100 and build your player or MyTeam
- The Game will randomly crash every so often or lose connection because it's not made for PC
- Game is filled with cheaters, and I mean FILLED
- MyTeam is nothing but money-hungry overpriced packs filled with 99 overall players.

Now here are some upsides and the reason I Played/Play it:

- Offline mode My League is solid; you can run your own league run simulations (for the nerds) and customize a lot
- The game receives player overall updates every 2 weeks up until playoffs and will continue to in 2K24
- The game-play itself can be fun in offline mode but is pretty mid online
- If playing online, don't expect anything close to realism with how the basketball is played. It's just constant dribble spam.
- Fun to bring friends over and play offline 1 on 1 or 5 on 5.

TO SUM IT UP:
- Offline mode 6/10
- Online mode 3/10

This game would be an 8+/10 if:
- PC got treated like NEW GEN, as we should
- Remove Input lag
- Remove the FPS cap online 
- Remove pay to win
- Game-play less cheesy (more realistic)",1692402185,1692402185,False,56,1,0.82365715503692627,3,True,False,False

got the game on a sale so it was only $20, even thats to much money

games nothing but lag and inconsistency, the entire game lags since its required to always be connected to servers so even single player games will have lag, input lag is crazy and sometime is there some and sometimes is massive, theres also GUI lag or interface lag where your shot meter just might not appear on screen till youve already passed the release point

the reason the game stays online is cause its pay to win, everything in the game including your characters stats can be increased with paid currency and the games filled with so many bugs to glitch that currency that they keep it online to stop it as much as possible, basically their lazy as hell and dont feel like fixing the game or stopping cheaters so they put a small hurdle in their way and moved on

the game on standard pro difficulty is annoying and not fun at all, then turning it down 1 difficulty to semi pro its ridiculously to easy except a few teams, so the games difficulty is broken as well and pro is really just a defense simulator that sucks the fun out of the game entirely, your team will only be winning if you focus on nothing at all but defense and as soon as your pulled out youll be put back in with your team down like 10 and their all to stupid to help you bring it back, and im not joking ive had players just throw balls out of bounds, just hand balls to opponents, perform entire layups while completely out of bounds and somehow the game didnt realize it either

the story of the game actually handicaps your player which is the dumbest thing they could have ever done, im assuming everyone who made this game is brain dead, the first game you play the summer classic is apparently set to rookie difficulty regardless of what your setting is but your rewarded like its set to the highest difficulty which gives you a terrible false sense of how your character will play, then after that everytime your compared or gonna face your supposed rival your player clearly plays way worse, im talking going from 33 points a game setting a new 3 point per game record to the game against your rival youll be like 2/20 on 3 point attempts, then youll just be good again all the sudden after that game

theres no tutorial like at all for any of the controls or if it is theyve hidden it so well that even after looking i didnt find it, even team practice drills in the game treat you like you are a master of the games controls, which its never shown you, i actually played thru my entire first character without knowing that right thumbstick was dribble cause all the game ever shows you is how to shoot with it

in next gen they take this a step further by adding dozens and dozens of non basketball related thing you MUST do in order to progress like become a music icon, a fasion icon, have your corporate and free will style reputations maxed, become a skater, absolutely none of this stuff effects or has anything todo with basketball but since it part of the story its all required for you to play basketball

different game modes on nextgen suck as well, street ball and nba ball use the same meter for shots but they dont work the same at all, the meter moves atleast 2x faster in streetball, and i get what they were going for, its faster paced, but they failed miserably and all it really does is confuse, frustrate and make it hard to get good at one or the other since it keeps making you jump back and forth, streetball also has the worst camera angle ever, you can only see 3/4 of the court at a time from the side on a strange angle and theres no way ive found to change it, camera angle makes judging depth a nightmare

some side quests on nextgen have been broken literally since the game launch and they never did anything about it, you can find lists of them online but the one i run into most is a skateboard time trial with the wrong time so its impossible to complete, only thing todd is wait till tomorrow since their dailies and hope it doesnt pick the same broken one


in all honesty this game makes me really sad lol, they clearly tried to directly copy a good sports game like The Show except they failed at every single aspect of it while doing nothing but making the games take way longer and filling your screen with nonsense and replays out the ass",1691937670,1691937670,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Good graphics and animations.
-Fun online play with friends.
-Lots of customization options for your MyPlayer.
-A pretty solid story line for the MyCareer.
-MyGM and MyLeague are still incredibly fun, especially with the retro rosters. 

Cons:
-Monotony sets in fast in the game play loop.
-The good animations sometimes bug out and look stoppy and awkward.
-Keyboard smashing Hall of Fame difficulty.
-The crowds are still cardboard and the announcers usually aren't even talking about whats actually happening.
-Random performance dips that happen without any rhyme or reason.
-Can you even make 3 pointers without a 99 3pt shot?

**Lots of TL/DR below.**

The last 2K game that I played was 2k18 and I'd played almost all of them since 2k13, with a pause between when the originals were first coming out. Immediately, I was impressed by this game and that's probably just because it was the first one I'd picked up in years. For people who play this game every year, it makes sense how they'd be frustrated with only small changes but if you're gonna pick this game up on sale (which I did and recommend) then it is absolutely night and day. Graphics, animations, features, and the feel of the game on both keyboard and controller has absolutely evolved. 

There are some big problems though with 2k23 and most of it stems from progression in this game. Having your progression constantly stall out while you grind points till your next overall is a feature I'm pretty sure isn't new, but it really does add to the monotony of playing an 82 game season especially when you play it on Hall of Fame where every single game is a DRAG to complete with how insane the cheese from the CPU and computer is. Missing wide open layups with a 95 overall slashing forward is INSANITY. This creates a really frustrating and daunting game play loop of watching your bars and badges progress climb barely a millimetre and as someone who didn't immediately grind this game in 2022, I'm unfortunately going to have to restart this entire process over for 2k24 which I will be purchasing on launch because I'm excited to see if they'll repair some of the shortcomings of this franchise.",1691788628,1691788628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically you can play 1 full season and have enough VC to do anything with your character you want.  Or you can of course ""pay to win"", but it's not stopping you from doing anything other than helping you make your player decked out on day 1 as opposed to progressing through the game for a month or so.  
There is nothing in this game you can strictly buy to be better than other players that you can not earn through natural progression in about 30 - 60 days of just playing your rookie year for your MyPlayer.

The complaining aside about VC cash transactions, this game is great.  As always, it plays very well and is an awesome representation of the NBA game.  The My Career is rather unchanged from years prior save a few tweeks, which IMO is good as it's fun and the *cough* more you play, the easier it becomes to get free VC (at about the allstar break, pending how good you are at the game, you can earn VC hand over fist to the point buying it would be pointless anyway).   

So for those worried about all the moaning about ""needing to"" buy VC, this is coming from players who want their character to be Prime Michael Jordan on day one, probably too lazy to just play the game and earn it, which does not take all that long. Playing 1 full rookie season will give you about the same, if not more VC, than the $50 package. 

Save your extra money, play the game, get better at it and progress over time, and just have fun working your way up the ranks.  You can't win them all anyway, why try to pay extra for that?",1691254230,1691254230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Negatives: I play MyTeam for the realism of having your chosen players compete but the endgame in this game always brings players that are tall and can shoot 3s unrealisticly well.
This is how enemies end up with a lineup of PG:Jokic, SG:Durant, SF:VWembanyama, PF:TakoFall, C:ManuteBol and they all stepback and shoot 3s like they are better than Steph Curry.
EVERY YEAR IS SAME GARBAGE in late game. It's not competitive and its not fun.
I won't be playing this shit any longer!

After 6 years, the same exploit exists, where someone can just disconnect at the end of an online game and you won't receive your win.
""a problem has been detected that prevents matchmaking from continuing""
Lol no, more like: ""An exploit has occured, which means you didn't receive your win for beating your opponend and instead lost 50 minutes of your life for nothing.""

If 2k hasn't fixed this by now, they never will.
I own the last consecutive 6 2KNBA games on Steam, but this will be my last, since instead of fixing the game, they just release the same exploitable garbage every year and charge you money for basegame and lootboxes......Omega Lol, i can't believe i have been supporting a game that has the same frustrating issues year after year like they just don't care......",1662750201,1690821945,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I don't mind being bested by other players, happens all the time. I do mind being bested by a player with a 12 foot wingspan and shoot 3's from half court with no attribute points and no badges. If you don't know,  you earn attribute points and badges to improve your players skill level making it easier to perform. 

The cheaters on the PC platform was so obvious I began to record videos, edit them and send to 2K via their support system. I opened (4) support tickets and included a description and the video. The videos included text and arrows pointing to and describing the obvious cheating. With each support ticket I received an automated response asking for information which I provided with the original request. After (7) days, each ticket was automatically closed. I didn't receive a single written word for a human. Yes, I was naive to think I would receive an actual response. 

Unfortunately, I am done with the series until I hear 2K has done something about the cheating on the PC platform. I spent hundreds of hours building up my player only to be beaten down by a punk with 3rd party software. I just couldn't do it any more. Again, I am an awful player and take my lumps like a big boy, but taking it from an obvious cheater is just different. 

You might be better off playing it on another platform.

The only reason that I'm not mad about it is because I only bought it recently for just $7 discounted price instead of it's absurd amount of full price for a rehash game.

So my advice to fellow new/casual players who just randomly got the urge/itch to play this:
If you just really want to experience the MyPlayer and/or any of the other online modes, only buy this when it's already discounted for about $7; about a year after its release, and play it as much as you can as long as it's still available (they disable those modes 2 years after the game's release so players would have no choice but to buy their most recently released game for about $50-$60).
BUT don't buy this if there's only a few months left before it get disabled (check forums/communities before buying) or you'll be limited to playing the basic offline modes.",1690344638,1690344638,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- you MUST keep frame rate capped @ 60 fps, and vsync ON. Failure to comply just breaks the game completely.

-now, this part is opinion, but oh how this franchise has fallen. gonna go blow the dust off my ps4 and play 2k15 instead because holy cow, this s#$% is garbage. Shots now apparently just do not go in if you don't hit the bar in the green area, like ever. at all. no slightly late's or slightly early's land. You have to hit the green area to even roll the dice on a landed shot.
-the pc version is ~ no joke ~ the old gen (ps4/xboxOne) port. you heard me right, its literally made for tech from almost 10 years ago. this doesn't just mean the graphics engine is toned back, but the ENTIRE game is changed, and vast amounts of content are missing. Most gameplay systems are entirely reworked and stripped back, this is likely the most heinous of the crimes. Their excuse?

Half of everyone is cheating. Good luck escaping them.
VC needs to upgrade a character are very high. But to lessen the slap in the face, grind quests.

What needs to happen for 2k24:
-Anticheat. You can ban people for half-cheating in VC but not ban people for having a 99 overall as a 60 overall? I'd rather play the person who half-cheated in VC.
-Keyboard Controls. Can you fix the inputs? Some buttons just don't work.
-Graphics improvements. We need something comparable to other games. It doesn't feel very close to that.
-Next Generation Version. I know you think an older version works better because your poor graphics optimization forces some bad PCs to not play.

NBA 2k is not a inherently terrible product. There is reason why so many people, myself included, log long hours in these games. It is miles better than say a Madden but I cannot recommend NBA 2K23 for five major reasons:

1) PC Version of 2K is on an outdated engine compared to PS5 and Xbox versions. PS5 version include options like bounce pass alley oops as well as a new Mycareer area.

2) Mycareer is one of the longest and most useless grinds in all of gaming. To play 2K without spending VC is borderline impossible. I am not doing it since I normally play end of year but if you seriously wanted to try out 4-5 different myplayer builds then you probably are going to spend hundred of hours and dollars on this cashcow. On top of this, the servers exist for only 2 years after each title's release.
  
3) MyCareer AI is really awful. Star players for your roster will repeatedly miss wide open three pointers and mid range shots. Opponent AI is surprisingly easy compared to year's past to a fault. There are three solutions for better teammate AI but they all have their faults. The first is to increase your player's Dimer and Floor General Badges. This will eventually make your team function normally but can take some time and your player may not even have these badges. The second is to simply run more plays. This will create more ball movement as well as allow your player to go offball but the AI simply cannot function on their own without the previously mentioned Floor General Badge. The third option is to decrease difficulty which turns your opponents into helpless children and your entire team into nuclear Klay Thompson shooters which is also non-simulation like. I tend to run a fair bit of AI vs AI games to watch how player tendencies work and such and the AI moves the ball too slowly. I cannot explain it well but there just needs to be more in general driving/kicking/shooting rather than everyone standing around for half of the possession.

4) FIX THE ONLINE SERVERS. Good grief, my player is finally freaking good enough for the rec center and I am battling the 2K servers more than the opponents. Rec Center log in issues have been existent for almost a decade at this point. 

5) Haven't played much of it but the Gm and Franchise modes seem lackluster and repetitive of year's past as well.

My rant is over. 2K is deep and immersive when it is working but often stumbles over itself. I haven't even really discussed the inherent VC greed that exists. I would love for this game to really focus on fixing their grind and servers. I normally buy this game during the 10 dollar sale which makes me more open to buying VC than I ever would but with how poorly the servers are I ain't spending another cent on 2k. The only time this game is justifiable to buy is when it is 10 dollars.",1679262771,1690214960,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm thankful that it has infinitely more options than Madden in terms of settings, changing progression rates, draft quality, etc. It truly is better in that regard, but oh my god is this game BUGGY.

1. There's less input lag in every single game I've ever played. And that's including PS1 games. 
2. It crashed 3 times in about 2 hours of actual game play (not menu time and creating a league). 
3. The audio will revert back to 100% randomly and always at the end of a quarter and at the end of the game and blow out your ear drums.

It's just simply not a good game. Infuriating to play, horrible feeling, and I didn't even get into how playing a franchise mode with a friend is miles better in madden and worthless in this, and I didn't even start with how pay to win this game is and how awful the multiplayer is. Imagine missing 75% of your wide open shots because you have to be a 95+ overall to actually hit any shots. How do you do that do you ask? Hate your life for months of missing all of your wide open shots to grind your way up, or pay an astronomical amount of money.

I would recommend others to play this as well, though there are some things that I wish would be changed/improved. There are some bugs that present themselves regularly. While playing MyPlayer, sometimes the in-game time/speed slows without accepting input from my computer. I unaware if others experience this, but I have.

I also wish the MyPlayer experience would change. Creating your own player in 2k's version of role playing sounds fun and it is. The largest problem with MyPlayer is the off-court storyline and narrative. In a roleplaying gamemode, the players are constantly channeled into voice options with only 2 outcomes. If 2k is wanting to create a game with impact outside of the basketball community, Creating a game where you can be your own player on and off the court would be wonderful. The storyline of the game is seriously awful, it only wastes time.

When it comes to game mechanics, the game is smooth and fun to play. If you're looking for a smooth basketball simulation you can find it here. Just ignore the MyPlayer story.",1689961941,1689961941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Horrible servers and latency while playing online
- Crashes occur more often than I shit my pants (very often)
- Scummy microtransactions (nothing new but still a joke that they can get away with it every year)
- Repetitive and boring MyCareer 
- MyTeam is completely Pay to Win
- PC Port is full of hackers because they are to lazy to incorporate a half decent AntiCheat
- They released the Xbox One/PS4 version of the game on PC due to what I can only assume is laziness (And they will once again for 2K24)
- No in game voice chat while playing online, even though it is on Console
- Almost no playerbase due to reasons listed above

So stick with 2k23, or by another 2k in, like, 2 years or so. Another thing that 2k needs to fix is the game randomly crashing. This happens to me all the time, and now, in my career, I can't even enter the promenade. The game crashes every single time. Most dependable event I know. However, take away all the bugs, 2k is pretty fun to play. myTEAM is what I spend weekends on, myCAREER isn't bad, and everything else is a pretty good way to kill time.

This game is nothing more than a soulless cash grab. Everything in it is geared towards trying to get you to spend money on their virtual currency. My player is no longer My Player, it's now 2K's Player. Gone are the days of you being able to create any player you want and play in the league replaced by a thinly veiled, gussied up, cash shop where you have to pay for everything. It has gotten to the point where you can't even play My Player offline. Whoever made this decision may they burn in the lake of fire. 

Why is it, in the year of Our Lord 2023 I am not able to play a career mode as a WNBA player on the PC? Why can I not play a dynasty mode as a WNBA franchise? Can it really be that hard to create custom female players? Why do the players not understand the basic fundamentals of basketball? Why are there still invisible force fields around the players in 2023?

Hall of Fame difficulty is a joke. In order to give the illusion of difficulty, players on your team will constantly play out of position, teammates will routinely place themselves in your path in order to impede you, your teammates will also leave your opponents open for easy shots and if you should gain the advantage the CPU will begin to rain down threes. At this point it's actually kind of pathetic just how bad or lazy the developers are at 2K.

This game is like a friend that you've known for years that has changed so much to the point that they're unrecognizable to you. You used to hang out, have fun, and laugh for hours but now all they want to talk about is different ways they can get money out of you, which wouldn't even be a problem if they would give you something tangible in exchange for the money but they just want you to give the money just because.",1689520915,1689520915,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played for 122 hours, mostly single player against CPU in my first career (pro difficulty, 8 min quarters, and I average 40pts/1reb/13ast/4stl per game), and I'm only 96 overall because I've only spent $5 on VC. I played every single game of the first season, and have played all of the televised games in second season, and just reached 2nd playoffs. Grinding my way to 99 will certainly take a long time, possibly close to 150 hours.

Also teaming up in the Rec is always a nightmare on PC, so many shot chuckers and the lag is unbearable. Although NBA2K21 and NBA2K23 are my most played games on Steam, I can't recommend this game unless you plan to drop a significant amount of money on buying VC; which you shouldn't need to do in order to reach max level on ONE player.

I used to play them all the time and buy new ones regularly. This is probably somehow worse than a number of basketball games over a decade ago. The graphics are borderline the same as far as in game character rendering while playing. Shooting is horrific. The smallest possible sliver of green for somebody who hits over 40% of their 3s and is one of the best players in the history of the game? Wut? Is the distribution of timing difficulty plotted on the timing bar equivalent to above 40% with that tiny sliver? I shouldnt have to have olympic subsecond timing to make a 3 or even shots within the arch for players that have any amount of skill. I can hit shots more easily in real life and I'm by no means a pro not to mention among the best to ever play at the moment. Trying to swipe/steal a ball even when the computer is oblivious and dribbling high and away from their body like 6 yr old that has never played routinely doesnt even try to steal correctly and will also foul. I checked the controls and I should be doing it correctly. That doesn't make any sense. Thats a gimme. Basic dribbling techniques when you have the ball also dont seem to work or be included and passes routinely go in ways that dont make any sense even when you use the correct pass inputs. Further the ""AI"" is garbage. The ""AI"" even for some of the best teams make basic ""fundamental"" mistakes. Open lane on a drive? Non contested shots when theyre just sitting there? Not following shots for rebounds? etc. Ridiculous. I dont have 1000s of hours to ""get gud"" at a specific year of a specific version of a video game of basketball on a specific gaming device which per some reports isnt even that possible. GMAFB. I have stuff I actually have to do. I just want to be able to at least learn how to play this quickly in a fast bootcamp sort of thing and do some play nows against the computer or friends when I have a few minutes for fun. I used to wipe people in 2k and all of the NBA streets I played. Very unfortunate that this is how the game is now apparently.

All the reviews you see online (not on steam) are for console, or ""next-gen"". Current-gen suffers from the same issues from year to year. Go read the same reviews from 2k20, 21, 22 and they'll be poignant for this one. Over monetization, bugs, dumb AI, clunky controls, and bad animations. 

The various multi-player options are dead at this point and its hard to find matchmaking. When you do, the players are suspiciously good (I've heard hacking claims) to the point its not fun. The single player mycareer is built for a scoring PG. If you like other positions, you're wasting your time as the AI is incredibly dumb on your team at higher difficulties. Classic example of what playing MyCarrer as a non-pg is like, you create a lane with pick, your starting 1 runs down the lane and shoots 8 ft from the basket, they miss and now your slow ass (use your credit card poor ass)  is trying to run back, well your 2 decides your playing zone (its straight man in everything else) runs to the middle of the floor to cover an empty hoop leaving their opposing SG open for a 3. Git good. Hopefully you don't also foul.

Not to mention it takes about 50,000 VC to have decent attributes where you only gain about 1.2k a game. But if you act now for an additional $10 you can get a jump start! (Brought to you by Mobil One, Papa Johns, and Mountain Dew.)

Not worth the time, even if you get this game for free. If you love the NBA, and need to play a basketball game, go play this on a console or buy the cheapest version on steam.

From the moment I launched the game, a heavy cloud of melancholy enveloped my soul. Each pixelated basketball player seemed to taunt me, their flawless digital forms amplifying my own inadequacies as a human being. I spent endless hours chasing victory, seeking solace in a realm where success was nothing more than a cruel illusion.

But the game's malevolence extended far beyond its deceptive allure. The glitches and bugs, like sharp knives, lacerated my fragile hopes and dreams. Every step on the virtual court was met with frustration and disappointment as the game twisted and contorted itself into an unplayable mess. How could I find solace in such a broken world?

And then there were the microtransactions, those insatiable monsters lurking in the shadows. With every transaction, a piece of my soul was sold to the highest bidder. I watched helplessly as my hard-earned money vanished into a void of emptiness, leaving me destitute and hollow.

Suffocating in the toxic fumes of the online community, I found no refuge from the relentless torment. Harsh words and relentless vitriol were hurled at me, piercing my heart with each cruel insult. Loneliness consumed me as I realized that even in this virtual realm, human connection was an elusive mirage.

NBA 2K23 became the catalyst for my undoing, a relentless force that stole my dreams, crushed my spirit, and left me a mere husk of a person. Its grip on my soul tightened with every passing day until hope was extinguished, leaving only a desolate wasteland of despair.

Beware, dear reader, for NBA 2K23 is not a game—it's a descent into an abyss from which there is no escape. Approach it at your own peril, for its embrace will bind you to a lifetime of sorrow. May you find solace where I could not.",1688963258,1688963620,False,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

The franchise as a whole, in specifically NBA 2k, has really targeted an niche audience of whom I only assume are either kids mooching off their parent's credit card OR the percent of adults who are able to sit at home all day, every-day and are doomed/convinced to spend every last penny to find a way to enjoy this game any longer.

It's no secret that there are modders/hackers who are flooding the Park with their squad to ruin everyone else's day, but I personally don't feel the need to comment on that as you can all read below. MyTeam is a pay-to-win fantasy mode where you'll ""build"" a team of shit-tier today players against people with super-teams consisting of cards you haven't even seen before. 

Ninety percent of my playtime was spent in the MyCareer game mode. This mode has been underwhelming for years, but the development team has thrown all their effort out of the window as far as a basis career story-line. Personally, I am not even passed the All-Star break, and I don't get a lick of post-game interview options or scenes anymore? They were already short-written and horribly voiced anyway, but I don't even get that anymore? The endorsements, the player interaction, the character development..- all of it just written while sitting on a toiler the morning after Taco Bell. 

There's no reward for trying to stick through the grind and actually play this game. I'm a 95 overall with more common build you'd find on your first search on the internet. I've grinded out all my badge upgrades to the point where I am literally playing every season game for a grand reward of MAYBE 1500 VC on Superstar difficulty? An upgrade costs 3-5000 VC per upgrade?! The difficulty scaling can be dumbed down this: get minuscule amounts of ""more"" VC for the FEWER shots made due to the bots OR score more for enjoyment and get paid sh** tier.

This morning's few hour session really put a damper on my gaming today, so I'm just giving up on the franchise as a whole. I don't care about 2K24, so stop trying to shove that down my throat if you can find a way to do that. I shouldn't have bought the game when I found out the developers port their PC version as ""old-generation"".

The only bright spot in this game may be the Jordan Challenge, which shows that 2K studio has put in a lot of effort to make CG more realistic.

However, the flaws cannot be hidden, and I still do not recommend non-true fans to get 2K23.

Visually and aesthetically, it is a noticeable downgrade as everything just looks more plastic-y and flat, and the only upside is some animations look better and more fluid. Gameplay-wise, the AI is a bit dumber and can forget what it's doing sometimes, but is otherwise pretty smooth. Difficulty and tutorials are also streamlined more for newcomers so that's nice to have. 

The online modes are just a mtx-fueled hellscape, but you can skip making an account (which also disables online play) by declining the privacy policy when prompted.

Pros
~ Somewhat scratches the bball sim itch
~ $10 on sale, still not worth that much.

Cons
~ Regular crashes that make grinding credits infuriating
~ pay-to-win mechanics at every turn
~ regular lack of care in design elements (the one that cracks me up the most is having 6-card packs and 5-card opening displays in MyTeam). 
~ The commentators are soooo repetitive. A maximum of 2 anecdotes about any player, making turning off the announcers  when playing with a regular team mandatory, 
~ Player ratings in MyTeam are a joke. A 99 overall Lance Stephenson? A Dwight Howard card with a Kareem hookshot and an A+ 3-pointer?  So ridiculous it breaks any sense of realism. 
~ Online competitive usually amounts to who can more consistently hit the 3-point shot meter of Steph.",1688753779,1688753779,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The only way I'd buy this is if I have next-gen, way less cheaters, more features, etc. but 2K won't release next-gen on PC, even if you have a fuckin 4090 and a threadripper with 256gb of RAM. The game in itself is fun, like in terms of the ability to play basketball, and I do honestly feel like they've stepped down on the microtransactions a bit, you can get a fair amount of VC through NBA games in MyCareer, but it's still not good by any means. The hackers in the neighborhood on PC are everywhere, I don't play it, I'm ass at neighborhood anyways, but 3 out of 4 games will have a hacker since there isn't any anti-cheat software. The bugs in this game are horrendous, every time I want to sim to my next appearance in a game, I either have to swap the display mode, or I have to alt-tab 5 times. The neighborhood every now and then sends me to like 2 FPS for some reason. It's not a terrible game, it's a bad game, but it's not a terrible game. What's terrible is that 2K pretty much releases the same game every year, with maybe a few new features. I feel like the graphics haven't changed since 2k18 or anything. I honestly have no hope for this to be a good game, like one I could play with my friends and actually have fun, I play it by myself, but it's not good.

My main ideas for the game are honestly just use a new engine, I don't know much about the development of any 2K games, but I have experience in game development, and I'm almost certain they haven't changed game engines since 2k17 or 18. Even using unreal engine would be better. More character detail with the Metahuman feature, ray-tracing, etc. The crowds in the stands don't even react to anything, and have no quality whatsoever, just an upgrade to that would be nice, in next-gen they look better, but every single spectator is rigged to the same animation model, they all do the same motion. The best thing in my opinion they could add, is skill-based matchmaking, I know they'd do it wrong, but being matched up with people at the same level as me in the neighborhood would actually make me play it more, I don't wanna face an Elite 3 when I'm stuck on fuckin rookie 2. They have the same story as 2k22 in this game. You still have to wait 5 seconds to skip timeouts. I'm mostly hoping 2k22 and 23 sucked because of Covid and low funding, 2k24 is my last hope, even if they revive the game and make it amazing, and only let next-gen players have it, I'd still see that as a win. I just don't want to play this game, if they can make me want to, then they've succeeded, but right now, I just don't see it.",1688668896,1688668896,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why are there so many garbage cutscenes in my player? 

Why is it so hard to understand what the different play modes are?

Why is there a plot at all?

Why does increasing the difficulty vary shot timing from shot to shot instead of just shrinking the forgivable margin of error? The exact same shot should require the exact same timing?

Why would the my career front office trade a top 3 pg in the league for a no name, straight up?

Why does jokic not pass up the court during fast breaks?

Why does a failed passing lane steal attempt have an animation so long that I go past half court?

Why is an on ball defender call for a switch with no pick coming, abandon their assignment, the assignment becomes mine as the shooter is in the air and my grade drops a whole letter for abandoning my assignment and a defensive breakdown?

Why is the ""next lebron James"" not allowed to call plays even with the ball in his hands?

Why did PC get a crappier version of the game than consoles way elss powerful than my PC?

My team is entirely unapproachable.

Why do the Lakers beat the nuggets by 60 in simmed games?

Why would I want to customize a Gatorade bottle?

Why do no name ""rivals"" become more godlike than anyone in the NBA the second I lead by more than 4, on any difficulty?

Why is myplayer coming off the bench in college flashback games if he's the next phenom?

The fact that take two has exclusive NBA rights for the next 3 years to continue dumping this garbage on bball fans and gamers alike is both depressing and a textbook case for consumer protection action by an org powerful enough to take on take two.

I log back in to a message saying ""You are banned from 2k servers"". Just to clarify, I have never ONCE played online vs. players, done myTeam, bought coins, etc. I have ONLY played against the computer.

How this was ever sold at £49.99 is beyond me - I've got almost 13 hours in the game, and bugs I've encountered (almost a year after its release in 2022) is horrendous.

I've played early access indie titles with less bugs.

My Career is alright, and realistically, that's what most of us buy it for - it's okay, nothing earth shattering, but having played about 14 games in MyCareer, and 3 of them have had to be restarted due to a game crash.
There is a bug that puts the game into slow-motion when you skip to next apperance, and have to alt+tab unless you choose to play on 60hz.

It scratches in NBA 2k itch, but just don't waste your money if you're not getting at least an 80% discount. You'll regret the purchase.",1688431389,1688431389,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Console's like Ps5 and Series x can have a choice of which version of the game they want to play like if next gen isn't fun for awhile they could move to current and still play next  gen whenever they want. If 2k allowed a next gen and current gen for pc 2k would be a bigger game.

It is absolutely astonishing to me how often I am flabbergasted at how bad this game is. The consistent horrible experiences I have in park with the games 3.5 second delay and average of .8 blatant hackers per park lobby that you join. I personally play a large variety of competitive games but nothing as bad as 2k23. No matter how good of a day I am having IRL, I can always count on this game to bring me down and genuinely make me want to sell my computer and do something better with my time. It is sad that the most fun I have in this game is opening my daily treasure chest just to get postered by a team of 99 overall super virgins. The developers lack of care for the game and it's players is astonishing and the overall experience puts me in excruciating pain.

Ladies and gentlemen, I stand in awe of the technological marvels that grace this world, and among them is NBA 2K23 on PC. This basketball simulation opus has taken a considerable leap forward in its latest installment. As a seasoned player and observer of the sport, I present my review of this virtual spectacle.

NBA 2K23 on PC presents a visual feast, unrivaled in its realism and attention to detail. The meticulously rendered player models, with their fluid animations and lifelike expressions, transport one onto the virtual hardwood. The lighting effects and faithfully recreated arenas create an immersive atmosphere that rivals the grandest of real-life arenas.

The game's enhanced AI and strategic depth provide players with an experience akin to coaching a real-life team. The improved player intelligence allows for more realistic decision-making, both on and off the ball. Whether executing precise pick-and-rolls or devising complex defensive strategies, NBA 2K23 captures the essence of basketball's tactical nuances.

The beloved MyCareer mode continues to shine, offering an engrossing narrative-driven experience. The depth of character customization, the journey from humble beginnings to stardom, and the sense of camaraderie with virtual teammates make for a compelling and memorable career. This mode truly allows players to live out their hoop dreams.

Alas, NBA 2K23 suffers from the bane of modern gaming: microtransactions. While understanding the need for developers to generate revenue, the overwhelming prominence of these microtransactions can hinder the overall enjoyment of the game. Some aspects, such as player upgrades or cosmetics, become locked behind paywalls, disrupting the balance between skill and monetary investment.

As with any game heavily reliant on online connectivity, NBA 2K23 struggles to maintain a consistent online experience at times. Server issues, latency, and occasional disconnections can mar an otherwise enjoyable gameplay session. It is my fervent hope that the developers address these concerns swiftly to provide a more reliable online experience for all.

In the realm of virtual basketball, NBA 2K23 on PC stands as a monumental achievement, offering a breathtaking visual experience and unparalleled tactical depth. The MyCareer mode captivates players, providing a narrative-rich journey of basketball stardom. Nevertheless, the presence of pervasive microtransactions and occasional online stability issues warrant consideration. Despite these imperfections, NBA 2K23 remains a game of choice for those seeking an immersive basketball simulation, deserving of praise and further refinement.

First mycareer, overall i give it a 4/10 because about 50% of players are hackers even though i have a pc that plays games at over 100 fps, the game will lag like crazy for no reason making it almost unplayable and to get your build to 99 overall will cost you upwards of 200$. Next up myteam, this was much better than mycareer with no lag, not many hackers, and overall pretty fun to play, but the boxes are so overpriced that you can spend 500k mt to get 10 cards worth 50k mt all together. And they will ban you for buying anything over 100k mt. Also its been ruined because if you dont have victor, ben simmons and yao you will be beat by 100 points every game. 6/10 overall for myteam 5/10 for the entire game.",1674254638,1688146611,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only two problems are; in MyCareer it was so upsetting because after 20 games, I don't have the cutscenes anymore (a glitch that is unfixable). So for me, it became repetitive though it is still challenging because I need to do upgrades. Second problem is that there are a lot of cheaters using 2k Infinity. It's so rare in this game to encounter people who don't cheat. I really think 2k should solve this problem especially in the next NBA2k. I don't plan on buying the next game until the cheating issues are resolved.

The game does not run properly when set to above 60 fps, and the gameplay is unresponsive and unenjoyable at 60 fps. If you are running at above 60 fps in MyPlayer, it does not let you sim to your next appearance unless you tab out and back in several times, which eventually causes the game to crash. You can kind of get around this by using windowed or windowed fullscreen, but eventually it'll lower your framerate to the point of being unplayable. The game seemingly works at 60 fps, but looks awful and feels much less responsive.

For context, I have an NVIDIA 3080 TI so it is definitely not a hardware issue, the game even tells you that it doesn't perform well unless set to 60 fps, which is absolutely ridiculous. I knew about all of the other obnoxious aspects of the game and figured I might as well get it on sale just because I enjoy having a basketball game to play occasionally, but this was absolutely not worth it, and I requested a refund after a few hours of trying to get it to perform even semi-reasonably.",1688111804,1688111874,False,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Wanted to get a new game for a while.. finally a good moment came up and the game was down to 9€.
So i bought it..

Now:
I don't care about online gamemodes but they don't seem to be that good from what I hear.
I care about MyPlayer, MyLeague and MyGM.

MyPlayer:
I heard a lot of negative criticism about the story but from my experience usually it's bs. Usually the story isn't as bad as people say it is - atleast imo. But this story was - by faaaar - the worst story I have ever played in any video game ever. This was actually crazy horrible and I wish i hadn't had to go through this shit.
Except of this.. I went for 1 season and it was meh.. my teammate AIs are horrible.
I will never get a pass unless I actively ask for it, no matter how obvious a pass to me seems to be.
That's bad design.
When the 2nd season started and I could for some reason just decide what team to play on, I quickly realized that there is nothing new.. the storyline ended 5 games into season 1.
So I stopped playing MyPlayer there.

MyLeague:
Not bad but it's a less interesting version of MyGM. Won the NBA first season with the Raptors. Ended my save there.

MyGM:
This one I was hyped for the most. And it does have some fun aspects but you could generally call it a chit chat simulator. 80% of my tasks are 'chit chat with that player' or 'chit chat with that staff' where you just spam-press A/X for 5 seconds and that's it. 
The other tasks are kinda fun but there are soooo many bugs or design errors.
For example: People can ask you for something and you have 3 options: (1) Promise to do it; (2) Basically Deny it/Disagree with it; (3) Stay Neutral.
But whatever option you click it does become a tasks and when it doesn't happen the staff loses trust in you because you broke your promise. No matter what you click.
Something that happens very often is that as soon as the team wins 3 games in a row, the governor asks you to keep up the winning streak (as if I could influence that directly). I tell him that I disagree - it says something like 'you can always have a bad day.. it's harsh to demand it'.
Your team then either wins another 5 games in a row to make it an 8-win-streak or the governor loses trust in you.
That happens like 5 times per season.
I played 3 seasons of MyGM. In my 3rd season I won the NBA with the Hornets.

So here I am.. 67h played and I am happy to leave this game behind me.

In hindsight.. I somewhat regret paying 8€ for it but atleast now I know that NBA 2k aint worth my money.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

As an avid fan of the NBA 2K series, it pains me to say that NBA 2K23 falls short of expectations. The game promises to offer an immersive basketball experience, but it ultimately fails to deliver on multiple fronts.

Let's start with the MyCAREER mode, which has always been a highlight of the series. Unfortunately, in NBA 2K23, the storyline feels uninspired and lacks the engaging narrative we've come to expect. The character development is shallow, and the interactions with other players and coaches feel repetitive and devoid of depth. It's disheartening to see such a lackluster effort in a mode that should be the game's centerpiece.

Moving on to MyTEAM, which boasts the exciting concept of pairing All-Stars with legendary players. While the idea sounds great in theory, the execution falls flat. The gameplay balance is severely skewed, with overpowered cards dominating the competition. This not only diminishes the sense of strategy and skill but also creates a pay-to-win environment where those who invest more money have a significant advantage. It's a disappointment for those who were hoping for fair competition and a level playing field.

The MyGM and MyLEAGUE modes, which are usually rich in customization and managerial depth, feel remarkably neglected in NBA 2K23. The lack of meaningful updates and improvements leaves players with a stale and repetitive experience. The potential for creating a captivating dynasty or steering the NBA in a new direction feels squandered, leaving players with a sense of wasted potential.

While the promise of true-to-life gameplay is mentioned in the game's description, it fails to live up to its claim. The AI frequently exhibits questionable decision-making, resulting in frustrating moments during matches. The animations lack fluidity, and the player movement feels clunky and unresponsive at times. These issues significantly hinder the overall immersion and enjoyment of the game.

In conclusion, NBA 2K23 is a disappointing installment in the series. It fails to live up to its predecessors and struggles to offer a compelling basketball experience. Lackluster storytelling, unbalanced gameplay, and neglected game modes all contribute to an overall sense of mediocrity. While the visuals and presentation are commendable, they alone cannot salvage the game. It's a regrettable misstep that leaves fans yearning for the excellence that the series was once known for.",1687890625,1687890625,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And if I could play this with my friends on Ps5 and Xbox it would be quite fun fr.

But this game has so many bitches with cheats and mods, even famous youtubers using it online as just content which is bullshit.

Bugs me how they can find more and more ways to make my career more grindy and annoying. Cant even choose my own jumpshot style because my players rating isn't good enough. Not to mention, shot animations actually affect how effective your shots are.
So great job yet again, 2K. Not sure what I expected, it is 2k afterall.

undoubtedly the worse fucking game ive ever played. 2k used to be good for its time now its just complete trash and a greedy fucking money grab. Curse everyone at 2k responsibly for any decision making. Last 2k game I ever buy. Im going back to 2k15 where there is offline mycareer and no stupid archetypes.
Edit: 10hrs in and I realized its much worse.

You play Pro difficulty in Mycareer. you play great, its fun, except your team shoots 80% from the field while the opponent shoots %20 and you blow them out by 50 points. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Okay, fine Ill play in All-star mode. Now my player suddenly cant pass, cant hold onto the ball, cant get a single steal, just fouls every single time. Not to mention now the roles are completely backwards. I play good, shoot around 60%, but my team shoots %20 and the opponent makes everything. My team doesnt play defense, they cant do anything on offense and we get blown out. EVERY SINGLE TIME. What in the actual FUCK is this.

If i were too list my complaints I would sit here forever typing, so instead I will just accept the fact that this game and 2K itself is trash. They manage to make a greedy. money sucking game, that also happens to have bad gameplay, bugs, and all kinds of terrible development decisions that literally you laugh out loud at the stupidity of this 'video game'. If you could even call it that... because speaking of 'video games' mycareer feels like a really cliche bollywood movie.

Please don't waste your money like I did. No matter how bad you would like to play a basketball video game, it is not worth your time and money to benefit this lazy, greedy company. Im serious, take my word for it.",1677400834,1687256993,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I play a lot of local play with my brother because that is just what we enjoy doing and we only play on the Hall of Fame difficulty so its more realistic.

You have to constantly be manually switching back and forth between your defenders so you can force them to do something with their lives instead of watch the ball like a five year old. Also anyone over 95 is usually broken for some reason, like Michael Jordan on hall of fame difficulty will just green shots from the logo and curry range if you are semi decent at timing.

But this game right here is just plain trash. Frequent crashes even with the lowest graphics settings. Unwanted and long cutscenes very often. Not at all playable. Once cutscenes are over and game play starts the game just crashes.

A pathetic application developed by 2k here. I bought this product during a sale at a low price but still a big waste of money. My suggestion, unless you get it for free dont buy it (would suggest not to buy even if its free). If yuu have older versions of 2k like 2k14, 15, 16 etc they are the best. 

This is just trash. BTW, i raised support tickets for my game crashing issues, but even the support is not able to resolve this apart from suggesting some general troubleshooting steps, which even the basic gamers would already do.",1686845380,1686845380,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

some animations are also annoying as hell. like, why does my character need to automatically go towards the basket after my AI teammate passes me the ball during a fast break? this leads to the opposing team stealing the ball cause the ball goes in their direction due to the animation automatically driving you to the basket.

oh and don't get me started on the online play. playing any online multiplayer game renders my shot meter useless. it appears late so your shot timing will be messed up. even after turning off the shot meter and relying on the animation doesn't help. it's delayed as fck. i'm already using ethernet instead of wifi and have a fast bandwidth but all those things don't matter if the server itself is crap.

technically, this game is a good past time. but i can't recommend this game to anyone specially since it seems the online lag has been going on even from the prior NBA 2k releases.",1686756693,1686756693,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I only bought it so I could do myleague and only then so I could create a team of all stars, cheat the system and force trades, turn off the salary cap and form an elite franchise and dynasty and run the NBA for 15+years with back to back championships and awards. Even then I don't even play the games. I let the cpu do everything and sit back and watch my team (The Cavs) embarrass the Warriors/Lakers, etc.  by 50+ points each game. 

It is not worth the price it's at currently (I have the Michael Jordan edition) and I even hesitated to buy it when it was $24.99, but I've gotten a lot of joy out of watching my created players destroy the competition.  

The online portion is a joke and I'm not even going to bother with it, but if you're looking for an amazing product and want to use the game for it's intended purposes, you're probably not going to like it.

- When switching audio output, the audio stops working.
- The defense UI banner on top right sometimes don't get destroyed, so it blocks everything else for the whole game.
- The subtitle options get reset when restarting the game.
- There was a time where my cut scenes camera wasn't focus on characters, so the whole things were blurry.

Other bad things:
- It's so far away to reach the elevator, and as a player who just starts the game, I have no idea where to go.
- I hope to have option to change camera angle in the training center.
- What's happened to Austin Reaves' face?

Let me just say this one stands out BY FAR to me as the worst one I've experienced. The lag seems worse than others (and my internet is fiber 1 Gig). the movement is clunkier than ever. The passing is somehow worse, why does every pass lean towards the defender even when they are running in the opposite direction. Crazy unrealistic. Free throws are garbage now. Basically need to hit greens to not brick it which i just don't get. Even with high stats. Lastly, they have gotten even more lazy with the neighborhood as it's the same as last year and the production of the MyCareer Story is laughable. For a game they copy and paste they somehow manage to make things worse.

BTW its not pay 2 win but rather pay 2 play. Actually you HAVE to spend money in game after purchasing to even stand a chance in any multiplayer mode. Good luck. I got this on sale and regret it :/",1685981907,1685981907,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is infested with microtransactions which has become the norm for NBA 2k the past decade but its even worse this year. You pay 60 dollars for the game if you dont wait for a sale (you should) then go into mycareer mode as a 60 overall which is really a 25 overall thats been inflated. You cant do anything at all and normally you might be able to grind out vc playing games smart knowing your role not trying to be a star but this year they have made vc gaining unbearably slow. Even on HOF 12 min quarters you barely gain 1000 vc which isnt even enough to upgrade more than 3-4 levels per category. If you want to pay for vc you almost have to pay for the 100 dollar plus amount just to reach an 80-85 overall and you better pray they dont nerf your build the next season because all that money you spent doesnt roll over to a new build. There is also an issue where you will load the game one day and 2k decided it wants to corrupt/delete ur save data which is very cool very swag.
