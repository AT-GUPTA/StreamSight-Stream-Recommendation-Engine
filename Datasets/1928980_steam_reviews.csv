I also found it super frustrating trying to get out of first person mode (F5) which was added feature but not listed in the keybinds at the time of this review.

Base Building after the tutorial is when it opened up more which flipped my negative ""do not recommend"" this game to neutral. and later exploration other realms with a friend moved the needle to ""more positive than negative"".  That's my experience coming from someone who likes survival types.  The beginning is very poor and slow in my opinion but if you can get past the tutorial, get your starter base up, and get your initial gear score up to 20 things start to flip around and get more interesting.  (I see many casuals dropping off in this phase of the game because its slow and not very exciting)

Progression is basically gearing up yourself to get a better gear score in your equipment, left and right hand items.  As you meet certain threshold requirements you unlock and enter a mini dungeon encounter in your home base Abeyance Zone and defeat it to craft the next tier difficulty card for your dimension gates.

Yes, many things are Not explained very well in this game yet so I've found myself looking up many things with internet searches, so be warned.  For example, as you unlock more recipes to craft guns for example you also need to make an augment item that opens up the crafting table to make that item.  

Despite my complaints and the terribly slow beginning of the game, very slow loading times even with a solid state drive for finding and traveling to new realms (Game Network Issue), and poorly optimized menus setup for crafting - I'm enjoying the progression and enjoying exploring and playing it with others.  Just form a party with the person's in game name and number after forming a party and either of you can invite you to the realm they are at.  So yes the game has grown on me and flipped me from a Negative to More Positive as I've progressed and played it more.  Yes, It has potential but this will not be the game for everyone.  I have not gotten to end game yet (I'm around 70 Power Level at time of this review) but I'm looking forward to getting to that social endgame hub as explained in the video.

current Cons:
a lot of grinding to do, which combined with the refining your materials actually becomes a pro if you got the patience for it. 
Simple enemy mechanics, which one could also think as a pro one isn't that savvy with fighting! 
So far I am finding the estate building and snapping a bit lacking but im sure it will be improved. 

Followers - the AI  needs work done!! 
Make sure you don't have your follower carrying anything important that you don't want it to use in various Aid missions as you will have no control what so ever which materials they will use from their backpacks. 

Pro's:
very in-dept crafting system featuring ways of boosting your recipes and refining your materials upwards once you get your head around it.
LOT's of realms to visits with pretty much unlimited possibilities with minor cards to determine what kind of realm it will be, and you can swap at anytime

The opening tutorial quests give you the basics, then its on you to figure out progression. Anyone who played 90s MMOs will not feel threatened by any of this. There's already online resources for this game, which I inevitably end up using in most survival games anyway. So far I haven't found anything that I couldn't figure out or find info on. Even the puzzles can make you actually have to think sometimes, which is cool. I can see where people used to hand holding will find frustration with this game. It's not your little brothers survival game. The other biggest issues people complain about are the servers, which everyone should expect to be rough on week 1 of EA. And what do the devs do? Release news of offline mode in the same week lol. All these negative reviews are now obsolete, but linger on in the game's rating, which is a shame. Oh well. Love the game so far. My biggest complaint is the enemies arent varied a lot in the starting tiers of leveling and their ai could use some work.

Unfortunately the game is lacking in the department of excitement. There needs to be scarier mobs, possibly flying creatures. I see others calling it a chill game, but this game is far slower than that opinion. The tutorial encompasses over 2 or 3 fae realms, this should be merged into 1 realm to limit boredom. The realms are mostly empty except for deer, boars, and wolves(forest realm). The other realms are very similar to the forest realm. It is very much a cut and paste of the forest realms with ruins scattered about. There is not enough fae creatures about, the game needs more enemy npc mobs, more wildlife, and even better combat system. The fae realms feel all to familiar to earth, there needs to be more magical creatures about the world. The game does show promise, if the developers correct the current game.

game start as any game with exploring and it is alot of fun, but after going in few realms, i just dont feal the game.... rison behind that is crafting system and storage to be honest....
Game does not take materials from your chest, wich mean you have to take all u need and then craft, witch wuld not be an problem if you wuld not need ALOT!!! ALOT!!! of diferente type of material, i feal at this point that game is just big loop behind, gather material, craft X mats to get Y mats to get XY mats to craft somthing, and then all of that there is few tiers of those same materials, it is just time consuming and boring... i love idea about making your own realms and stuff, but fealing locked behind crafting and constant upgrading just to get that gear score to get to new realm just to get again yet on the same loop... in my opinion there is no need for having 100´s diferente  materials with diferente tiers of that same material.... lets take ingot for example, you have like 10 kind of same ingot, and then you have few kind of ingots, and smelting all that is just to much for me... in my opinion shuld do like other survivor game, copper for low tier somthing like iron or steel of higher tier and maybe titanium or smthing for endgame... i LOVE idea of realm walking and making your own uniqe realms, maybe grind for cards etc... i just dont feal like getting locked for hours behind crafting and searching in my boxes.... game have big potentional but for this pricetag at the moment is not worth it, i have the game, and ill give it another shot in future because i really do like alot of aspects of the game, but as it is right now, i wuld not reccomend it",1708867498,1708867536,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- Crafting is fun and challenging, takes some actual effort to figure out which ressources to use for specific stats.
- Combat overall is simple, but each weapon also has a different affect on different kind of enemies, which makes mob fights interesting.
- Realm traveling and minor cards which actually change an already existing world however you like is an amazing concept, implemented well. It is fun to play with your realms and change them however you like.
- Graphics are beautiful in their own style, characters can look good if you take some effort when creating them. 

Neutral:
- UI is okay-ish, you can get used to it and after a few hours in it doesn't bother anymore.
- Performance is well for high-end PCs, some areas do have some heavier impact and therefor higher frame drops.

Cons:
- Boss fights feel too simple and not really rewarding in the end, at least the bosses I have come across so far.

They put a lot of effort into building a compelling fantasy world here, and the writing, sound stage, art direction and design aesthetic all culminate into a beautiful but somewhat flawed experience. Nightingale has so much potential, but I feel like seeing it in this unfinished state ruins the spell it might otherwise have cast on its players. Hence the mixed reception. 

Do I recommend this game in its current state? That's difficult. It depends on how much you value your money. If you have bills to pay and can barely afford a game at the moment, I'd wait. But if you have an extra thirty bucks to toss at chancing being disappointed, give it a shot. There's plenty to like here, but past the surface level stuff, there's a lot to be improved upon as well. 

The good news is, the devs seem to be making said improvements and taking player feedback seriously, so that gives me a lot of hope for the future of this game. 

The game will improve with time, but being released right now to these kinds of reviews, it's gonna be a rocky road for the studio. It's tough for games to recover from reviews like this, and the one's that have seem to be the exception. 

I won't get into details about what's good or bad about the game, because those things are subjective at best. But I will say that the more time I spend with the game, the more I find myself enjoying it. I just hope that the devs eventually add more reason to venture out and explore over what's already here. 

In all reality, Nightingale needs more time to iron out a multitude of underdeveloped content. There's a lot here that's really good, but there's also a lot here that feels awfully undercooked. 

This is a game is set in an era when exploration of the world around us was a novelty. People of that time were obsessed with it. In the Victorian era great explorers went out into wilderness untouched by the modern world, and people at home the world over were obsessed with ancient Egypt, Mayan temples and the like. So with that in mind, the lack of much of a reason to explore in a game centered around that time, that era, that sense of discovery, is a travesty of game design. 

As is common with procedural generated games, the exploration is extremely repetitive. You see the same cookie cutter structures over and over again, with the same chests full of the same stuff. I find it difficult to want to explore and unlock these new areas simply because I already know from the very first building in the very first tutorial biome exactly what I'll find in every single biome and structure after it. And there's exactly nothing exciting or fun about that. Which is a shame. 

It turns exploration into a chore that I'd rather not bother with. Why bother? Why go into that building when I already know exactly where the chests are and what's going to be in them because I've already been in the same building in other biomes? And even if it is a different building, it doesn't matter simply because I already know what's in it. Chests full of potions, and if you're lucky, maybe a card or an infusion. Fun.

But most importantly, this game needs more compelling combat and far, far better enemy variety, animation sets and AI (both enemy and NPC). The combat and enemies are just downright poorly implemented. They just run wild all over the place bouncing off the walls. It's chaos, and not the good kind. The combat, especially melee, is just bad. It can best be described as ""clunky"" and uninspired. Plain and simple. And the bosses are the exact opposite of the light enemies─they just stand in place and barely do anything at all.

When you level up in a game and move on to new areas, you expect that when you go out and explore, that you'll find new and exciting content, items, gear and weapons. Things of rarity that you couldn't find before. You know, rewards. That doesn't really exist in this game in its current state. And it's a shame. I hope the devs can be creative and come up with some compelling and unique ideas for exploration.

There's very little sense of discovery or triumph here. And you'll never reach a point in the game where you've leveled up enough to see something new or exciting, to be surprised or challenged suddenly. Because it all feels like more of the same. The points of interest feel empty and ultimately, well, pointless. There needs to be more reason to explore these places. The puzzles need to do a better job at challenging the player. The loot needs to be worthwhile. There needs to be rare artifacts to find and uncover. 

The only thing new you'll have is the NPC vendor in each newly unlocked area. If this game has any hope of surviving, the developers have got to get on the ball making exploration worthwhile. 

So, I know this review makes it sound like the game is bad. It's not. It needs a lot of work, yes, but it's still worth picking up if you enjoy survival crafting games and don't mind early access jank. The game has good bones and really nice storytelling and atmosphere. 

But in my opinion, the entire combat system needs to be overhauled. Enemy AI and animation needs to be drastically improved. Exploration needs to be looked at and worked on. This game deserves to have some truly creative design elements in these areas. I just hope the devs don't settle. 

I feel like too many studios come to the conclusion that just because it's a ""survival crafting game"" that it's okay to release it with janky, unpolished gameplay elements across the board. Does that always have to be the case? Can we please get a survival game that doesn't feel like the movement, combat, AI, animation sets, etc. were made by high school students for a class project? I'm still waiting to this day for a studio to make a truly polished AAA survival game that actually has some effort put into it in these areas. Something with fun and compelling combat, awesome storytelling and production value, and fleshed out, worthwhile exploration. 

Nightingale gets some of this right, or has the potential to if they continue improving, but it still falls into that category of feeling ultimately half-assed. I recommend it to anyone who's used to survival game jank and just wants yet another early access title to blow through. But I can't recommend it if you're looking for a solid, truly worthwhile experience. It all depends on how easily impressed you are. 

Devs, don't give up. This game is worth improving on. But you have to recognize what needs improvement and work towards that collectively. Don't settle. Please. It needs a lot of QoL fixes, but you know that. But if you want people to come back, or stay in the first place, you gotta do something quick about the pointless POIs and lackluster exploration and reward systems.",1708472921,1708865873,False,0,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True

If you are into survival builders, this one is excellent. I've only played six hours, but swear i have played much longer. And i know a couple hours were when i got distracted by house work and walked away for ""a minute"" and it turned out to be more like an hour..

Your character models a bit weird, but it fits fine in the game. everything else? FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. This is one of the most impressive looking games i have seen in ages, just the look and feel as im wandering around my little starter island scrabbling for junk to survive. You can see a good range into the distance and spot points of interest from a good high point. Lore items you find through the area are interesting and well written. The game is just fun and i am greatly enjoying myself in it.

On top of that, Devs Listen!!!! BE AMAZED!!!! As the game was set as ""always online"" which is kinda.. Meh..? in a single player game, a couple times i had horrible issues with lag that ended up with me dying, but only realizing so after i had reconnected. Offline will save some time for those weird reclusive solo players. Like myself. But online option is great as i have several friends interested in playing and this will make a great group game as well.

Companions are a bit.. eh? You cant really order them as far as i can tell. they just follow you around and stare blankly into the distance, join fights against enemies a bit late (but still nice having extra hand to help fight, or at least draw attacks while i heal), and occasionally do collection stuff like smashing rocks and all if you give them the tools. Sadly you cant really direct them to do things, and they get a wild hare up their ass on occasion, like when my companion carrying all my lumber, wood, and other things of the like decided to feed them all right into my furnace.. I... Was sorely tempted to see how ""friendly"" fire worked there.

So after already having somewhat 58 hours in I must say this game is repetitive af and I have to change my review from positive to negative, if you expect a game with variety and things to see in endgame youre definetly wrong here, if you like games like League of Legends and love doing and seeing the same thing over and over again you definetly good here except that this game needs zero skill.
After initially liking the game I started to see the repetition and a lackign future for this game..
I mean who ever also unlocked the mystic set umbrella which is the same as the Twitch drops umbrella just with inverted colours does see how lazy those guys are and that they dont simply care.
The giant monsters from The Hunt areas are the same as the ""special raid bosses"" and then again repeat themselves in the ascended 100+ Hunt realms.
From hour 1 you basically saw 95% of what the game has to offer.
Rarely saw such a level in lazynes and repetition in assets, this game is pure advertisement and nothing else and i doubt it got a future since as already said it is purely based on advertisement and nothing else.
Nonetheless I had fun with the game until I realized the complete superflous of the ""endgame"" which again repeats assets you saw at hour 1.


Here is the old review:

Now how should i start, this game is neither over the top good nor is it bad.

most people negetivelly review because they can´t play a game they bought online in an online store downloading a digital version of it online.. well yeah..

it´s pretty fun once you get more hours in, finding new stuff and exploring is awersome, hunting for blueprints is fun but sometimes repetitive, you never know what you get out of chests because loot is randomly generated ( a part I personally like)
didnt encounter any bugs except the game crashing once for me
you actually have a sense of getting stronger

now to the not so fun part, it has shitload of micro management especially in higher levels i guess since you have to build tons of chests which wouldnt be that bad but since you cant access chests from crafting benches and gotta carry everything with you  you better should start sorting your chests from the beginning to find your stuff easier

not so many other bad parts i encountered yet, yes combat feels boring at start but who am i to judge this with just a club to battle some trash boars and wolves in the starting area, guess it gets better but also maybe not, who knows

all in all its pretty fun so far, it just needs some more time and you need some more time playing it before judging

Starting out with all the stuff I love first

The GOOD part of their always online model they have atm (they are developing an offline mode). Makes it very easy to play with friends either completely together or just occasionally. There's a card you can get to make a portal to your friends base, and since it's always online you don't have to always be on at the same time to keep playing. It also opens doors to engage with friends who may start playing a bit later.

Crafting. My god this is my favorite part of the game. There are so many different types of materials you can craft with and they all give different bonuses and can affect your gear score in different ways. I can see this being a negative for some because it's a LOT to keep track of but if you love min maxing theres a lot to love here. 

The Realm system. I mean this is the entire gimmick of the game but it is sooooo good while still being in such a fundamental state. There are only 3 biomes right now but with the way their card system works for the realms it can make going to the same 3 types of places feel so refreshing and different often times. They all provide their different level of challenge and uses which is really neat

The minor cards. This kinda goes with the realm system but i did not expect this to be as fun as it is. Minor cards are basically like world buffs you can apply to whatever realm you're in. There are SOOOO many different minor cards ranging from things like getting more ingots when you smelt to doing more damage with a rifle to food buffs lasting like 3x as long. Some of them have drawbacks so they're not always ideal but theres a lot to explore with that.

**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT FOR END GAME**
[spoiler] The end game city hub with real players was such a pleasant surprise and made me fall in love with this game even more. Basically there's a bunch of traders that give different recipes and stuff. But the coolest part by far is there are like ""dungeons"" almost like in an mmo that when you go in the portal youre put with 5 other players and you do the different challenges and fight the boss at the end. The only downside of this for me is that the bosses are reskins of bosses you fight earlier, but they do drop better stuff. I think if they add more raid/dungeon style content for people who want to keep playing after doing the basic survival stuff it could be a game with a lot of longevity and a lot of hours sunk for those who enjoy that. [/spoiler]
----------------------------------------------
Now the stuff I don't like (pretty minor issues to me and all of these i see only getting better as the game gets more polished through early access)

Combat is pretty boring it gets a bit more fun later when when you can clump stuff up and stun and aoe but nothing entirely engaging. the bosses need some more interesting things going on and more weak points i think. The game makes a big deal about ""heartshots"" being a thing but i think it could be interesting with more weak points.

The time it takes between loading realms. I don't think the always online aspect of this game is bad. In fact it's one of my favorite things about this game. The only reason it is negative is because of how long it can take to go to the different realms and it seems to take much longer to go back to your home realm (i'm assuming its the assets but idk much about that stuff) It's taken me like up to 5 minutes before to travel to a realm which is a bit absurd.

Building. This is probably the most annoying to me cuz i like to take breaks from the story sometimes to build cool things. The limit is too small. it's starting to make me feel like I almost need a 2nd home realm. Also the creativity you can get with the building system is limited, pretty much all presets BUT there are some pretty cool ones down the line. You also need SO MANY MATS to build things. And the mats you need are VERY heavy (I recommend getting a recruit very early cuz you can store stuff on them and they dont get any weight restriction at least at the time of my review)

General early access/alpha feel. It's early access yea but it does feel like it. This is probably what i care about the least of the negatives but when you are exploring the world it just really gives off the feeling that you're in an alpha build of the game. Just feels kinda empty sometimes and the creatures don't exactly feel ""natural"". Nothing too extreme though

-----------------

Final thoughts

If youre a fan of the victorian era, survival crafters, or hell even MMOs, this could be a very fun game for you to pick up even in it's early access state. 
If you can't bear some long load screens and occasional fps drops(occasionally ill be hard capped at like 35fps and it goes away after a few minutes) you might wanna wait a bit longer. 
This game has a really strong foundation and the way they developed it makes it very easy to see the potential for them to add more and expand and I can't wait for that.",1708577113,1708863146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For any survival or fantasy fan, this title is a must have, even at this stage. For my almost 30h playthrough I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs, so it's really not bad. That said, servers still need some work to speed up the loadings between realms.

So on to the game review.

You have survival aspects like hunger, sleep, weather conditions that actually have a meaning, temperature and building small cities. You have magic, you have guns and a whole lot of melee weapons from small knifes to katanas, spears or huge axes. Is it all? Of course not ... this game features something I didn't see anywhere else - a realm mechanic, or you could say parallel dimension system that is generated randomly. Your first realm, when you start up is your home realm, after that you will traverse through various worlds, looking for a way home, to Earth. All this, while gathering resources, fighting for survival and meeting new people.

I could even name this game Skyrim 2024, because the combat mechanics and the whole fantasy world are very similar (just the combination of those aspects, the universe is of course totally different). So, do I recommend it? Yes, but only if you have a modern, medium class PC ... the optimization still needs a lot of work and on my 4k screen with 3080, 64GB of ram and a bit older CPU it can hiccup here and there. It's not bad, but it's not perfect either.

It's an early access game, yes, it still needs a lot of work like optimization, combat rebalancing (maybe total overhaul of combat mechanics). But for this kind of money, it's a steal. Plus side of this is the fact that the dev team consists of people who made Bioshock and it's really showing, the backround is very similar AND I LOVE IT!

Now, while I wholeheartedly agree everyone is entitled to their opinion and that everyone enjoys different types of games, I feel some of the negative reviews on this game are a bit unfair. 

Firstly, I have put a lot of hours into this game with friends, so far we have 6 on our realm and have all had a lot of fun on it. Sure, there are a few bugs here or there, and yes, the loading screens are at least 1 minute (crazy I know), however none of this makes the game unplayable or unenjoyable. I don't know, maybe it's because I am from a generation that is used to loading screens lol. 

Secondly, the thing people seem to always forget, it's still in early access!!! The devs for this game are already working on offline mode for those who want it, and so so much more. They taken on feedback from players, and are working on implementing a lot more. 

In all honesty, if you enjoy crafting, beautiful scenery, can look past the small niggling bits that are being worked on, and just want to have a bit of chilled out fun. I would highly recommend this game. I love it, and I have barely scratched the surface of this. Knowing some of the things to come later just makes it even more exciting for me.",1708860545,1708860545,True,2,0,0.539906084537506104,0,True,False,True

There have been some minor ones, nothing compared to what Bugthesda has had us put up with in the past though however.

 Ok:  You can switch between 1st & 3rd person, but 3rd person has some issue as its in experimental stage atm; switching is done in the game menu. 
 You can have companions, no commands tree as yet, but they work, can equip them. Some npc are text dialogue too, whether permanently or not I don't know.
 Over all, thus far, this is the most polished early access I've played. It's beautiful to look at & explore, and the detailing too. 
 As it's server based play atm there can be up to a minute queuing before being dropped into a 'World'. But again, it's early access.. & I'm sure there's high demand. And the Devs have announce a Solo/Offline version will be updated to the game at some point in the near future.
 The build mechanic is quite good, somewhat familiar. The delete and move placeables took a heck of a lot of figuring out however.. should really learn to read the manual ;)

 Be aware it's a survival game. Some balances obviously need to be made. Saying that it's a fun game, good bit of Law scattered around. It achieves the Steam Punk quasi Tec/Fantasy feel very well imo.

Now, especially for the price, I think this game is very worth it. There's a lot going on, and a lot more potential to look forward to. Although I'm nowhere near end game yet of course, so my positive opinion could change. But as for now, well worth the under 25£, and I've not even touched the co-op play options as yet.

I want to give this a positive review but I just cant in it's current state. The game is fairly grindy the npc's are very boring and the game is ok but not great. The devs learned very little from other survival games or they knew they just chose to ignore the quality of life features other games in the genre have. They launched without crafting from storage and an auto sort(palworld has both of these and their dev team is like 7 people) I never realized  how spoiled I was in palworld by these basic features but they save you literal hours of organization and slow walks with an overloaded inventory to the area up to your roof where you want to dump them. The progression is also gated by item level so you need to craft things at the highest item level not just at the highest material level to progress. It's like destiny but you carry rocks to box instead of shoot aliens. The combat is bare bones but it does have blocking and shoving so it's about one step below conan and one above ARK:SE. 

The Art of the world is nice and the animals is great and the environments are kinda fun to explore but Item level kinda kills it and the A.I are kinda dumb and have obvious animation gaps for free damage. NPC's are meh and when you can recruit them they're almost totally useless other then to take a hit or two and they sometimes don't even do that. When you move around a dungeon your companion will teleport to your location in the most jarring way imaginable(Think creepy watson from that sherlock holms game) The best use case of npcs is just use them as human pack mules and they don't even do that right. You cant assign them to do anything at base and you can't customize their looks or name. Then on top of all that  they are all ugly as sin. The game has an arachnophobia mode but I wish it had Anthropophobia mode because everyone in nightingale looks like they are product of a cruel joke at best or incest at work. If these faces are because they wanted certain people to ""Feel seen"" lets hope they meant through a rifle scope. These faces are also used for character creation which has a bunch of useless features like choosing your ancestors but that only serves to make you have to undo a bunch of things in the later menus. It's like oblivion but every button is the ugly button and not just the randomize one. ESG score +100

The game can be fun but I don't feel the pull to comeback and keep playing like I did for V rising and palworld. If anything this game exists to remind you how damn good those other games are.  This shit needs some time to cook and un fuck itself before it's ready for prime time

Other annoying shit includes but not limited to
-no locks for your boxes for multiplayer(how do you launch without pin codes??)
-npc's if given access to a box will try to load expensive mats like shaped wood into a campfire to burn it because thats fun
-Npc's won't do anything useful
-Game has a Vram leak that gets really bad after about 3 hours or so
-Crafting stations take ages for simple items
-No private server to up rates for materials or the crafting speed
-Game feels like a stealth live service
-I don't see myself having access to a firearm for another 10ish hours or more.
-Tools are more effective weapons then actual weapons are(I can sprint up and kill wolves with the skinning knife faster then anything I currently have access to)
-Realm gimmick gets annoying when you need like 4 of something and have to run to the portal then play the cards then teleport for like 4 of a single item to Finnish a craft. (You can plan around this but it's still a pain in the ass)
-You can fast travel to your base but not to the portal so it's best to build near the portal which limits base location unless you want to walk 5 min to the portal
-The menus are awful console ones with a lot of wasted space and they don't always save your filters which makes building a pain to navigate It feels like they hired one of those ""I'm a professional UX/UI designer"" guys to do the G.U.I since it reeks of modern design U.I stink and that's after they fixed the beta U.I.  You cant even tell what most of the blueprint cards are supposed to be because they have no color and all look the same. They need to color those in or just use text.

Things that are actually good
-Essence system
-The art for all of the building types is great
-Finding minor cards and using them to speed things like gathering up or do crazy stuff to your home realm and they kinda work like halo skulls but with more positive effects then negative ones
-Ranged weapons work well and it's easy enough to make rocks for the sling bow
-The card art is very very good
-The world looks and feels great to just exist in and the sound design is pretty good
-The fishing is fun and not an invasive mini game
-You can blueprint your entire base layout design to get a feel for what you want then actually fill it in to finalize it.


I'm going to keep playing and will update this if I can but this review is for day 1 early access.
UPDATE: The game is just kind really really boring. Every realm is just the same 3 areas with different colored trees and plants for higher tier materials and maybe 1 more enemy type. The A.I is awful and I lost my npc companion and all of the loot on her because of a bug where it deletes them if you remove a map marker which is insane that is even a thing and it took ages to make that gear. The quests are more shallow then mmo's from the early 2000's and every major card boss is just the same Wish dot comie version of the skyrim dwemer teapots and ridiculously easy to cheese if they even fight back in the first place. DO NOT buy this game and do not trust anyone who puts a train wreck like this out as a first pass early access. They would have to redo the entire game to fix this boring mess.

The Game Play is unique with how amazingly complex the crafting system is and the portal system. Dungeons are ALWAYS FUN! Everything feels different each time you step through the portal!

Story is okay so far and fully pulls you in.

Style of clothing is on point and the building is fun and easy. Making even decorations useful to you in some way.

It is online! So any map you are on is hosted FOR FREE by the game! Meaning your friends can join your world even if you are offline! You can even connect your worlds together with tech you get early on.

Cons? Ya the AI isn't perfect yet. It is okay, but could be better. 

Climbing is janky sometimes.

They need new snap points for items. 

that is all... it honestly is way better then 99% of the complaints on here are saying. The team is listening and looking forward to adding things we want.

They make this sound like a game rife with problems, and yes while it has got some improving to do, hence early access, it is not a bad game by any stretch. 

Online only - seems to be a major gripe, indont know what it is about people and online games recently, there seems to be a core group of people that come along to multiplayer/online games and thunk they can whine and get it changed to solo offline for them. Yes the load screens can take a minute, and that could do eith improving. But having the realms online is great for playing eith others and opens up loads of multiplayer possibilities. I have not been disconnected or crashed out of the game once since starting. I'd say the complaints about this are not server side issues. 

The game does feel ma little clunky in terms of menus etc in this first iteration, and my hope is all that will be streamlined with help from our constructive criticism. But 25 hours in and I feel I'm still just scratching the surface of what the game has to offer, and I always have something to work on and look forward to logging back in to do. To me it feels a bit like minecraft, with better graphics, a cool setting (Fae) and story quests to work on. 

Puck is great i love him, yes he uses big Shakespearian words, I just think his above some people's intelligence level so that's why his disliked. But I think he fits into the world just fine. I think that just because this is a survival game and you like survival games, doesn't mean that this one is up your street, It's not just another zombie survival, it has nuance. 

So to conclude, yes there are things that need ironing out and improvements to be made, but is it fun enough for me to overlook these and keep wanting to come back for more, yes. Would I recommend it, yes (just not to my 14 year old fortnite playing son, but to adults who I feel would understand the nuance and appreciate the game).",1708856606,1708856606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The gameplay loop is boring at best, grind in games is fine, can even be good, but here it is unrewarding and just dull. Repeated poi's, enemies, huge material grinds ending in a waste of time as u craft stuff 'blind', theres no indication of what the item u are crafting will be aside choosing loosely some stats on the mats u use. bought a new recipe? will it be better or worse than your current gear? who knows! wasting time is fun apparently.
The game is just a slog, expect to feel like u are at work in a mind numbing job that you hate and u just paid for the priviledge to do so. Zero reward.

Building: 6/10 
Crafting: 7/10
Combat: 1/10
Exploring: 3/10

Building mechanics are nice and lets you put down a blueprint before actually committing your crafting materials into them. This is helpful when you plan the layout of your buildings. Doesn't give you too much creative freedom very early on in the game. 

There are 10,000 crafting tables to make. I am a survivalcraft player and I like this. The Augment system is really nice and makes you think about how you will arrange your furniture/crafting tables inside your base. 

Combat is fked up in 3rd person, your crosshairs doesn't seem to aim where it is supposed to. Your ranged weapons(GUNS) aren't significantly stronger than your stupid pocket knife. Combat in 1st person is horrible bec. melee fighting means i will be up close and personal with the enemies' ugly disgusting faces. Moreover, I hate first person perspective. I like being able to see the back of my characters when playing games like these. They did add the 3rd person feature but it is not playable in that state, my damn person would be looking down on the floor 90% of the time when in 3rd person. 

The procedurally generated worlds seem nice at first but, having gone thru all 3 flavors (forest, desert and swamp) of each item level, its basically the same worlds with the same enemies and resources.

The tutorial in this game is not great, just bombards you with a wall of text. The journal/quest list doesn't explain things very well. 

TLDR: Not a great time to buy this.

PS. The fishing mechanic is different and I appreciate that but it is boring. I alt tabbed while reeling in a fish and it is still there on my line. If i didn't get kicked out of the server, it might still be on my hook as I type this review.

[h3]The bad[/h3]
At this part of the development, I cannot recommend it, as for me it's in a state which is borderline unplayable. The game is plagued by poor optimization (for reference, i can run CP2077 on ultra, RT=OFF) and get 60-70 fps. Here with a settings averaged at medium, i get fluctiating fps between 30 and 45. However, the most glaring issue is the constant crashes. I've asked in the discord, not everyone suffers from it, some do however. It crashes a lot for me, especially (but not limited to) when interacting with an object which has a menu pop-up. It's literally every (less than) 1 minute at times. Even if that is while in the main menu and clicking on the settings button. It's terrible. Until this gets fixed I shan't play no more. 
Then the other systems. A thing nowadays, especially for survival crafting games, is ""this game respects my time"". In this case, it doens't either. The base building is good, simple and straightforward (similar to The Forest). The crafting system however, isnt. You have to wait seconds to make a roasted meat. Make a stack, and you'll be waiting a minute. These kind of waiting times for crafting... I dont understand why so many games make the mistake of adding these. It adds nothing to the gameplay, only makes it more annoying and tedious. It's not like it needs a cooldown during combat for balancing reasons or something. To make matters worse, you cannot make multiple different things (lets say, 10 roasted meat, 10 roasted berries). You have to wait for the meat to be done before you can start making the berries. The simple solution would be, make more cooking spots. Oh boy... does the poor optimization break you fps if you dare make more fires next to eachother. So you get blocked there by the poor optimization.
This game also doens't have ""cloud-stashes"", or whatever the specific term is. Basically, you gotta run around from chest to chest to grab what you need to craft. A big QoL would simply be that the crafting station would just use any stash inventory within a certain radius. An even better version would be if the crafting system would take precursors into account as well (if I need 3 lumber for a plank, and 3 wood chunks for a lumber, just let me make a plank for 9 wood chunks).

[h3]The good[/h3]
There are good things to mention though. The game, when it works, does look good. Short glimpse I've had does show that there is a fantastical world out there to be explored. Sadly, I cannot comment on it on how much things there are to do. The first person melee combat felt better than I expected, but it's not yet quite at the level of a Darktide or, king of all melee combats: M&M Dark Messiah.

[h3]The summary[/h3]
As it stands, the poor performance and the constant crashing, makes this game a definite avoid. Crafting and UI really needs a polish, smoothening up. The devs already announced offline mode will be a thing, so i'm not going to comment on that. There is potential here, it does look great and has a real unique style and ideas. But sadly it feels like there are too many ideas put in, without a question asked at some point: ""does this make it more fun or more tedious?""",1708848015,1708848368,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have played Conan exiles, Palworld enshrouded and to be honest I have really enjoyed the building system.  I like being able to place ghost form then fill it in.

I know some people have complained about crashes, but as I have been doing IT for over 20 years and when I see the majority of people haveing no issues and only the few it leads me to a few things. 1 your drivers are out of date, you have not updated or reinstalled windows in years. (as if you have a lot of corrupted files it will cause crashes) It could also be hardware or your firmware it out of date. Yes it suck when this happen and you don't know what going on or how to fix it, but don't blame the game.

One of the reasons people play survival-craft games is for the freedom of movement and exploration. One of the cornerstones of a great game is that it allows players to play at their own pace, allowing the freedom to move faster as you gain a deeper understanding of the game mechanics. But for some games, like Nightingale, the player is boxed in and unable to progress until some arbitrary challenge is completed. For each map the player winds up on, they can only move onto the next map (and therefore the next resource/crafting chain) by reaching a 'gear score'. This means that you can skip over no content -- you must craft everything on that map, whether you need it or not. 

The above might not be as glaring an issue, if not for the fact that resource collection is especially grindy and only gets worse as you progress through the game. Not only will you need an abundance of resources unique to the map you're currently on, but also will continue to need resources from all previous maps as well. 
Instead of an interesting end-game goal, the entire purpose is to tier up your crafting benches, to tier up your weapons and armor. Not for any particular reason, but just so you can pass through the portal to the next realm and do it again. That's not fun game design, that's just tedium for its own sake. 

This is a very linear experience, and because of that comes with no challenge. There's never a question about whether you've underestimated the content you're facing, because you're always right where you're supposed to be. Right where the developers want you to be. Like the fantasy-illusion theme of the storyline, the open-world is also a thinly veiled illusion.

Combat is pretty satisfying, so is mining/collecting/chopping wood.

The inventory system is kinda clunky, could use some QOL updates, like for example esc usually closes a menu, but some times it just doesn't in certain screens. Stack splitting could be simplified, like having key combos for half stack, instead of always having to go to a slider. 

I've had some connection issues when loading between realms or trying to join the game initially, but it usually works on the second try.

-Character creator, if you put in the effort its really good compared other similar games.

-Basic combat seems fine, i was surprised by the extra damage done by back attacks not something you always see. 

-A lot of little things that make the game more fun then tedious are really nice that it has going for it. Examples such as raw meat and other food items don't spoil, no stam drain from jumping, you can lay down a build for structures completely and then build it all in one go and it'll show you all the mats you need.  

-Graphics wise the game looks nice compared to what other developers have put out recently.

-Points of interest are limited but thats intentional as the whole point is you're a ""realmwalker"" and you're meant to go from map to map exploring and finding new challenges.



TLDR: For what i've experienced in 5 hours the gameplay is okay, if you're like me and hadn't play a survival game in a while i would say this would be an interesting one to take up. If you take games too serious ofc you're going to hate it.


[spoiler] Edit after 36 hours. After taking my sweet time playing the game i finally made it to the watch and now i understand the
reason behind the worlds being on servers, the watch is a hub where you see other players and can enter 
what seems like boss run portals where you take part with many other players, didn't really count seemed like
there were at least 6 other players in the one i did. I've only done that once so far but upon reaching the
watch there is so much more. does getting to this point make the game, i can't answer that, comes down
to each person i would say. can you get to this point much much faster, of course you can, i simply just

TLDR: 
I have been following this game for over 2 years and I'm going to tell you now that i am very well pleased with it and its just EA. It is like so many others but not like others in the genre and its refreshing. 

Good:

Graphics: I'm playing on Ultra and they look amazing to me. 
Combat: its smooth and fluid, haven't tried the ranged yet but the Knives are amazing and i love knives. 
Gathering: like any other
Crafting: Very in-depth
Building: Very in-depth

You also get a companion to follow you = more carry capacity, and you get them in the first realm. 

Bad:
Crafting: not very intuitive and its locked behind the tutorial and beginning area. 
Building: same as a above

Right now its online only - however i hear the dev team is currently working on an offline mode so YAY to everyone that wants to solo. 

Things i haven't tried yet are the Multiplayer aspect. I do intend on trying it once i can find some like minded people who play. 

DO NOT believe all the negative reviews. i would say 65% of those are people who didn't follow the game and had NO idea what they were getting themselves into. I NEVER write reviews. But i am SOOOOOO happy with the game so far. Just try it out. worst case you refund. Best case you get a game in your library you can come back to from time to time to enjoy the views/landscape and overall well put together game so far, that will hopefully only get better with time.",1708845659,1708845659,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
Variety of enemy's
Interesting new mechanics onto the classic survival genre
Variety of easy access biomes and choice as well as a ""Home"" realm
Cons: 
Clunky animations
Lack of draw into the entertainment of the game

Base building: You don't have to make a new base every where you go. You can if you want, but the first world you're in is safer and you can build there, and as you do the first few story missions it will unlock a portal you can build at your base to go to other realms quick and easy from your base. So think of the first world as a hub you can always return to.

Holding the gather button will draw all loose material near by to you. You don't have to click on each piece. 

Abuse the teleport to respite option on your map. Load up, get encumbered and just warp back to your building. Makes early building before you get good backpacks so much easier. 

Mission wise if you get confused, check your journal it can say more than the HUD info does. The first mission is basically go to the Trader, get a sewing table, and make better gear, then it opens up a certain ruin on the map. You get a new card, go to the new realm, meet a new NPC that gives you a quest to further the story. 

Building was fun to me. You can lay out the items you want to build into one big build and then throw mats at it to just make it all at once, like the Forest. I had a blast making my base look nice, it was a fun cozy experience, but that's subjective. 

The survival aspects aren't obtrusive. If you starve or don't rest you can die, but food items and animals are everywhere, and you can make a campfire and bedroll from the easiest and most abundant materials you can pick by hand. You really have to ignore them to die by them. 

The realms are gorgeous and my friends and I were just constantly wandering off to see what that thing in the distance was. Lot of the puzzles I've seen so far are stupid easy, so I agree that area could use some polish and variety.

I really look forward to the game expanding and getting more and more pieces in place, but even as it is it feels pretty deep and I'm excited to play more with my friends and get further into it.",1708842823,1708842823,True,4,0,0.52731090784072876,0,True,False,True

Grounded and Sons of the Forest are examples of two densely packed Survival Crafting games that came in early access and offered just so much more polish, that for a game in development for 6 years, as excited as I was, the reality of this one really killed the hype.

- First, even if it is an early access, the whole state of the game is clunky (at best) or not working at all (getting 3 crashes in a row, need to restart the computer until it crashes again). Game is constantly stuttering, AIs are playing as if they do not see you and the game is visually far from the rendering you see in the trailers (and I am playing at the highest quality level).
Ok it is an early access, but I have seen a lot of them being way more stable and optimize.
- Second is the game itself. Another blunt survival game that sells you wonderful world to explore. What are these world? Simple round maps with random uninteresting buildings and... that's it. It is so much procedurally generated that you can feel the boredom from it quite quickly.
- Last is a bug: the last quest of the ""tutorial"" (after 5-6h of a very long intro...) is not validated at all, making you just wait there.

The AI on enemies is not great. They sort of just run straight at you in a line and then do their particular attack move which each enemy type only seems to have one. I hope the combat gets a little more engaging as time goes on.

There's a lot of other things people have brought up. Devs have already stated they are working on an offline mode so I won't pick on them for that.

Yes, its Early Access, and will likely improve, but i'm not reviewing a future potential release, i'm reviewing the play-ability and worthiness of purchasing THIS EA game.

TLDR:
This game VERY unfinished. There are many broken mechanics and huge amount of unfinished items/elements that destroy immersion and fun. Some intended mechanics just ruin the game and likely won't be changed. The extreme reliance on Inflexion run/hosted servers in order to play the game is a VERY high risk to being able to even play the game. Lots of issues kept coming up that kept making me frustrated and walking away.


Some issues I've struggled with:

- Due to being online required, loading realms leaves you waiting 1-2 mins every time to change realms, which is very often. You'll be switching realms dozens of times every time you play. I literally get up and go do house work, or watch a movie, while i wait for the realm to load... 

- Overly complex crafting system and endless amounts of variation of crafting materials means you spend more time crafting and sorting through storages than actually playing the game.

- Complex unhelpful Crafting UI with lots of info that is irrelevant or useless. With a heap of placeholder buttons/icons that are not used in every crafting, making the UI full of greyed out unneeded clutter. 

- To make overly complex crafting and resource worse, half the icons for materials are missing, they are all a generic red stamp. So identifying materials requires mousing over every individual stack of >100 materials to find the one you know you have somewhere. There is no search feature for items in storage, there is no craft-from-container feature.

- The Guidebook is meant to help with figuring out what bench you need or material, or where to get it, etc. But the information is missing half the materials that exist in the game, and contains info on items not yet in the game. And is restricted to recipes/technology you have unlocked, so useless to find out what next you need to unlock to craft something you have unlocked.

- T1-T4 essences all have weight, and cannot be put into a storage. Meaning, if you happen to collect a few 1000 essences while playing the game normally, you  are permanantly encumbered by a large amount of weight in essence. You are forced to consume that essence and turn it into useless T0 essence to get rid of the weight. 

- Disconnected for inactivity when NOT inactive. While moving around, crafting, sorting inventory, or reading information, listening to NPC dialogue. Game keeps disconnecting due to inactivity. Given how long it takes to load into a realm and other things, this is a huge inconvenience, and very stupid. Wouldn't be an issue if we could offline play or run own servers...

- Right from the start, I've found the game itself difficult to follow. There is a tonne of unique mechanics to Nightengale, and they explain absolutely nothing, so you're left to struggle around figuring out what keys do what, what crafts what, how combat/travel works, etc. The complex realm system has had more than >50% of players extremely confused from the start and still are (again, the game doesn't explain at all how realms work, if they are saved, etc). Even after 60 hours, I still find myself explaining the same mechanic to friends a they remain very confused on how things work. This is an intended development decision, and it's needless and annoying.

- You're given 10 quick slots, but can only use 5 for your tools and weapons, which you will have more than 10 of all required by the game for different tasks and specialisations. Which means constant opening inventory, moving tool/item to quickslot, so you can use it, then switching back to something else.  The other 5 quickslots just fit torches, umbrella and food, most of which is useless and never used. So you have at least 4 unused quickslots sitting there unable to take a tool/weapon. This is a deliberate development decision, and unsure why they penalize players like that, it's needless/pointless.


In Summary:
Everything about this game smacks of yet another generic incomplete survival game. Same mistakes, and some incomplete 'hack' mechanics and AI i've seen with some other games that never got fixed/completed. So I'm not holding my breath there. Developers have tried to bite off more than they can chew, diving into an over complex and incomplete crafting system that will likely stay broken/incomplete.",1708834255,1708837773,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,True

The trailers will have you believe that you might be scratching around in the dirt for a little while until things get going but I'm here to tell you at almost 10 hours in - ten goddamn hours - you will still be running around a landmass identical to one of the tutorial realms, still killing the same basic creatures (boars, wolves, bears) you've seen in every other game set in a forest you've ever played, and still nodding to yourself when you find things that are so clearly bad ideas they had to have come out of a committee. This game is really, really good at teasing you with potential and then wasting your time. 

Specifically, hail is a weather effect and it will damage you. It's not a lot of damage but it is constant unless you use your umbrella. If you use your umbrella, you have fewer expedient options with which to kill the same repetitive creatures over, and over, *and over* while you traverse the map because they include exactly one (1) fast travel option and, surprise!, it'll take you back to the ""abeyance"" realm instead of your most recently constructed base. Why? Because fuck you, that's why, and it's a design philosophy that runs through the entire game so far. 

Yes, it's Early Access and they want to remind you of that every single time you start the game, but that kind of flimsy excuse falls apart when you remember that during the desert biome tutorial mission there were some really cool, fantasy-esque wildlife but you won't see those again, at least not within the time the game managed to hold my waning interest. To be completely fair there are some little dragonette-things that run around and some green deer with red baboon asses but you need some kind of missile weapon to hunt them effectively and they don't seem to have implemented that yet. To be clear, they have implemented a ""launcher"" weapon you can craft and probably upgrade but I wasn't able to find a recipe for ammo of any kind. Not bolts, quarrels, arrows, ""ammo,"" nothing. There *are* some ""rock marbles"" you can craft but I didn't bother to waste time looking into it. Why would I? The entire experience is underwhelming, dull, and I've seen it all a hundred times before. 

Really, that's what this review boils down to: there is nothing new here. No interesting twist, at least not that you get to interact with for any meaningful length of time. Add the crushing tedium to the fact that the server takes *way* too fucking long to connect and actually let you play the game and this is just a bad idea all around. There's some potential here but it's all half-baked at best and I have no confidence they'll course correct and end up with something worthwhile.

As for the actual game it is one of the more fun just released early access survival games I've played.

Pros:
Fun survival systems.
Realm traveling is actually really interesting and fresh (think POE survival)
Has an endgame (So cool for a survival game)!!
Other than the characters, the game is beautiful
The online nature is actually a PRO once you play the game, it's so fun having persistent progress on a remote server like an MMO.

Room for improvement:
While I am having more fun playing this than enshrouded, enshrouded's building mechanic is what all survival games should strive for, this one is fairly basic (think ARK)
The UI is not the best and could be streamlined, including QOL things like auto pulling from chests.
Obviously more variety - buildings, monsters, weapons, combat, etc.

Pros:

- Genuinely enjoying the setting, story, and character (Puck) that guides you. 
- Visually pretty well done in contrast to some other traditional or voxel based games
- Interesting game mechanic with utilizing cards to custom-generate worlds for you to play in, each with unique modifiers

Cons:

- Character creation is kind of silly. Every character looks like they have gigantism or some type of FAS. Huge noses, knobby bones, teeny eyes, they look...creepy. 
- Extremely convoluted and complex crafting and build system. There are just too many stations that exist, arent explained, can utilize any combination of resources, and don't give any sense of 'X leads to Y leads to Z'. The whole system pulls you out of the game to interact with clunky menus.
- Granted im only about 10hours in but the worlds seem very small. Like, every resource you need is within eyeshot for the most part. This makes the game feel more grindy and less exploring based which is part of the fun of a survival game. Traverse dangerous conditions and elite mobs to find key resources you need to progress. Here? Just run 45 seconds over to that hill, boom. You can easily traverse the entire map in like 5-10 minutes. 
- The game needs more hand-holding. In the 3rd world I found some underground lair that had a portal. Obviously, I cleared the area and took the portal. When I was done, I used the 'Return Home' button on the map to fast travel. It took me back to my house from 2 previous worlds ago and I have no way to get back to the world that I was on and where my main questline was. 
- My last gripe is a general gripe to basically every survival game out there. This includes Valheim, Enshrouded, Nightingale, etc. Please, please put some actual voice characters and narration into the game. Im so burnt out with the 'random note found in a cave' or the absolutely mission critical NPC who doesnt ever speak. I want to HEAR the characters, I want to feel a part of the story, not a footnote of a long dead unnamed explorer who left his journal on a dead bear. 

Overall I would let this EA bake a little longer. I think it has promise and I intend on coming back to it but right now there are just so many other survival games out right now that do this formula better and more enjoyably than Nightingale. Which is, to be honest, a huge disappointment for me as I've been following the game for well over a year.

After playing both Pal World and Enshrouded, I've just come to expect some level of QoL in these games. Like a decent inventory management, a self explanatory UI, or enjoyable map traversal.

Well, none of that is present in this game. The only thing this game seems to have is a completely overcomplicated crafting system. 

So you want to craft some Vegetable-Thingy? Sure, depending on what kind of berry and other plants you use, you get the same Item with the same Icon but with different stats and not stackable. Enjoy your cluttered Inventory. 
How to get better gear? Who knows? Go watch some guides, because the game sure as hell doesn't tell you. The ""pole"" you were now able to craft, what is it for? I still don't know and really can't care about it anymore. The description the game gives me could as well just say ""hope some dude figures it out and makes a guide about it"".

Oh you just mined a few stones and also want to carry a bit of wood now too? Well, have fun walking at a snails pace. The carry capacity is horribly low and even worse, your equipped Items still count towards it.

For the UI, let's just say: It's a first for me, having to look up a guide on how to drop items from your inventory, that's how bad it is.

The Map traversal feels just annoying. You got that ""glider"" thingy going with your Umbrella, yes. Except, you have to manually equip it each time you want to use it. You can't just have your weapon equipped, jump from a rock and then open up the Umbrella. No, you have to equip it in your secondary hand and then you can use it. It's like the devs never really played their own game.

Then the ""dungeons"". It doesn't tell you why you can not enter any of the dungeons or what the requirements are. It just smacks you backwards. Sure you can glitch yourself in, but I doubt that's how it was meant to work.
And once you've finished the dungeon, have fun walking all the way back out of it. At least for me there was no teleport so far for any of the dungeons.

Now let's not forget about the NPC Companion that you will get at some point. As soon as you have one, you got a pack mule with unlimited carry capacity and some help drawing aggro away from you, yay! Just don't give it an Axe, otherwise it will try to kill you with falling trees constantly. Also be aware that the NPC will always try to burn your best wood as fuel for your crafting stations (just in case you're wondering where all that high quality lumber went, check your fires).

The combat is .. somewhat meh. Going up a ""overleveled"" enemy requires you to cheese it hard, otherwise you will just die. There are some bad choices like enemies that just shoot you through obstacles, withouth giving you much of a chance to react or even block. Mostly chip away at their health bars and try not do die.
If you want good 1st person combat, go play Vermintide 2 or Darktide. But that's not what you play this game for.

And then, there are no Character Levels .. would've at least given some feeling of progression. But I guess they rather have you feel how your time wastes away playing their game.

It's just my opinion, but the game needs a big overhaul in general. Especially the crafting system needs to be more streamlined. It can still be able to creaty highly customizable items, but not in such an overcomplicated way. It also needs a ton of QoL changes to the UI, the Inventory, the Map traversal and the combat. So basically the whole game.

Combat is fun, I look forward to crafting and using guns later. The variety of realms and enemies makes this a very fun and interesting game. I like the Victorian era feel the game has as well. The reason I give this game a positive review is because it feels like it is moving in the right direction, and I think it will be in a good place by the time it is out of Early Access.

Complex and fun. Very unique concept.
EA game with some bugs, none that were game breaking for me.
Takes longer to get into than it should, but then becomes very addicting.
Could use a bit more to the fast travel system.
Building system is the simple type (Ark/Palworld/etc).
At the current price tag, it's more than worth it and the dev team is working with the community (as all dev teams should!)


Defo early access, but diamonds don't come out of the earth all smooth n perfectly cut. We've recently been a bit spoiled with some EA titles (well played, Enshrouded), but at the same time, this one isn't nearly as raw as it first appears. 

Nightingale is possibly one of the most complex survival-crafter games out there. Some may see this as a fault, but I'm on the side that sees it as offering more unique opportunities. I was at first annoyed at how, for example, prey and predator hides needed to be separated, until I realized that they offer uniquely different bonuses in crafting. This allows us to tweak our weapons/tools and clothing to suit our own play-styles. Hell yea!

My lappy doesn't meet the recommended reqs and I live in a developing nation in SEAsia. That being said: no lag, no rubber-banding, no connectivity problems. I run the game in mostly performance graphics with a few things (like textures) bumped up. On all performance settings, the game looks... well, like it's on min settings lol. With a standard modern system, these worlds are damned pretty (and very trippy... for those of you in places that allow you the smoke, let's just say No Man's High has a fun new competitor.) I've had a few minor visual glitches (like the ""shovels"" across my toolbar) but nothing that was game breaking.

The biggest problems I see in this game right now:

1) By the gods does it take longer than normal to get into. Not exactly sure why, but it's a slow grower to start. For me, it took until near the end of what I would call the tutorial (aka defeating a boss character and moving on to one's first ""normal level"") to get hooked, but after that, there was no turning back.

2) The only fast travel is to your Estate (your base). I would love the ability to set a secondary FT point for when I've gone far from my base, or the ability to drop an FT point in the center of each new realm. I don't mind the walking too much since each realm isn't too big, but it'd be nice. Perhaps there is something coming later though. I'm a slow player who really enjoys takin' my time and trying everything possible.

3) The building system is, for me, too simplistic. I just like more complex ones that allow me more creative freedom (see Valheim and Enshrouded for examples). That being said, it's very easy to use and allows you to build the whole thing in a blueprint-type setup where you can later drop all the mats at any point and they'll go to where they need to. It'd be even better if everything connected to one structure did that (looking at you, rooftop lighting!), as currently the whole drop mats and they go where needed only works for the actual structural stuff, not lighting or furniture.

All in all, I most certainly recommend this one (unless you're not into survival/crafter/exploration games, but then why are you here? lol). After the first couple hours, I'd have said 6/10, but at this point I'm going with an 8/10. The devs are being active and vocal in the community, working on what people are requesting, explaining their thoughts behind their choices, and keeping us well posted on what they're up to.

So the cards: as I understand, you can create realms you can travel to at a portal, by placing certain cards into the interface. That way you should be able to travel to an infinite amount of procedurally generated realms. That's awesome! BUT unfortunately the rest of the game isn't. The story isn't presented in an engaging way and thus becomes boring very quickly. The graphics and art direction are jarring, especially the characters.

Why in gods name is the starting gear look so bad, even without the texture issues, it looks terrible on purpose.

There is no rewards in this game. Beat a quest? Nice job, you're now given chores to do.

The ludicrous amount of variety of materials that all make the same items is ridiculous. You lose all sense of worth of ores and fibers, and I ended up just not caring why I was harvesting materials.

This is the first survival game where item icons are so unclear what they are, I'm digging through my inventory twice or three times as long I normally would just to store my items in chests.

You're given 5 slots for main tools, and there are 5+ tools for the amount of useful tools, more item management for the sake of it.

Any progression is hard to advance, you don't get any nice breaks where stuff opens up and you get to experiment with more than one item. Either get a better pick or axe for your next few hours or a shitty gun which requires three(?) new crafting stations and (alterations?) to make. Why???

My interest was piqued by the notion of a world that was vaguely reminiscent of Carnival Row with a mix of Fae and Steampunk elements.  Thus far I have not been disappointed.  Without giving away any spoilers, I would best summarize it as a mix of Valheim survival with Myst like puzzle solving and atmosphere. 

Although it starts out slow, I would chalk this up to introducing the mechanics of the game which could prove daunting for first time survival players.  While the pace doesn't really change, the challenges increase and secrets are revealed.  I have no clue how this game ultimately unfolds, but there's enough to keep me interested based on the investment required.

Positives:
Beautiful and mostly stable.  I've had 1 crash over 18 hours of playtime.  I've read many complaints about this being an online only game, but given the multiplayer, multidimensional nature of the story, it's understandable why it's not.  This doesn't appear to be a one sandbox game, but rather many more.  I'd say it  looks more like WoW than Valheim in that respect.

There are sub-realms/dungeons which are themselves accessed within cave systems.

There are different kinds of puzzles that grow in complexity.  The first ones are initially very easy, but the same concepts are expanded into more challenging arrangements.  This takes an otherwise familiar survival/crafting game and turns it into something more.

There are secret rooms.  Without disclosing how they are accessed it's enough to say that they exist and that elevates the mystery of the game.

Negatives:
Some of the game mechanics could be improved or better described.  There are many enchantments received early in the game that aren't functional because the user lacks the appropriate level gear to use them.  There's no real indication of that being the issue, so it's hard to tell whether the game is broken.

Crafting station placement is awkward using a game controller and some interfaces don't completely work with a controller.  Some examples include difficulty aligning crafting stations flush with walls and inability to interact with Essence Merchants to purchase items.  This can be overcome using a keyboard and mouse, but it's  a negative.

Companion NPCs have zero personality and no control options (as far as I can tell).   They assist with combat and can carry items for you, but more often than not they're off cutting down trees.  They can also disappear and it's unclear whether it's part of the story progression or something else.  It's also unclear whether any gear or items they were carrying are recoverable.

There are some graphical anomalies such as black squares appearing throughout the world after updating the latest Nvidia driver.  They were not present before that, so it's probably not the game itself.

Early game combat is melee and its so bad, forget thinking about using an ax and dodging and blocking crazy attacks. I've fought a few bosses in the dungeons trying to use melee but the hit scan nature/pinpoint accuracy of mobs with massive AOEs makes getting close so much worse. Its bad enough you get into aggro of a mage and it teleport and bombs you and it isn't dodge-able but also when your across a boss arena getting chased by 5 mobs and the boss is shooting at you and doesn't miss while you try to load the slow crossbow in the beginning is not fun. 

I'm over leveled in the games eyes but definitely not mine.  This is the main loop of the game IMO, go to a world clear POI's with bad AI design to afford recipes that let you progress. The main issue is imma need to jump the bosses with a group on a low difficulty just to get the rewards to progress. I know its a group game but if i'm seeing a number about an enemy and mine is larger by a margin it shouldn't take a raid party, BUTTTT the game wont let you even enter before your matching level.

That being said, I am  enjoying this game immensely. There are many very frustrating problems that need to be worked out, but i see potential for sure in this first stage of the early access journey. A big one will be to smooth out the bumps on loading screens, loading into zones, traveling between realms, and loading up a portal. The delay's are too great to be fun. I sit around waiting to get into game. then i get into game and i am logged in to a zone i need to port out of immediately (for instance to get back to my home base) and then i suffer this next long load screen wait. Then i get to the intended location but 5 minutes has gone by and i haven't even played yet. This has to get sorted out. The combat is good, if a bit janky. The harvesting of materials is ok, although the graphics are again a bit janky. and an annoying problem with bosses running off and resetting after you grind them down in a 15 minute fight. pretty frustrating. So the game has alot of problems, but its a good base and with improvements to quality of life and the more obvious problems, this game has potential.

Beautiful vistas, inhabited by whimsical creatures who might be friend, for or neither, chock-full of intriguing ruins and points of interest scattered all over the place, with all sorts of small puzzles and challenges to overcome in exchange for some loot and new crafting recipes. And when you feel like you've had enough of that world, you can simply teleport back home and from there open a portal to an entirely new world. You even get to select the type of world you want to visit next, by combining destination cards to customized the destination to your liking.

There's a story running in the background, but the game mostly leaves you to your devices and doesn't hold your hand for long. You're pretty much free to explore and do whatever you want instead of getting railroaded.

Building is simple and the crafting is not complicated or annoying. No RNG. Through using slightly different materials and selecting different upgrades and magical powers, you can create the gear with the stats and powers you want instead of relying on chance.

Now sure, there are some niggling issues. The UI is pretty and functional but needs some fine-tuning here and there to make it more usable. Inventory management is an issue because there's at least a handful of variations to each type of material, and storage space is at a premium. However, once you craft yourself a backpack and unlock storage chests instead of the storage bags you get at the beginning, things get much better. Plus, the game has a great feature: it lets you, at any moment and anywhere, turn anything into magical dust that has no storage limits; this magical dust is what you use to repair your gear, to buy stuff from vendors, and to craft some stuff. If you, like me, keep picking way too much stuff off the ground (plant fibers! rocks! sticks!) you'll love this because it means you'll never have to feel guilty again for having to leave stuff behind. Some people complain about the enemy/friendly AI but I find it adequate. I'm not looking for Dark Souls combat, thank you very much. Combat feels dangerous enough.

Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to try the coop multiplayer because Nightingale came out right after Helldivers 2 (I love it too), and in the same week as Last Epoch and Pacific Drive, and that's what all my friends are playing right now.

I helped with the alpha of this game and the beta and still purchased it and my wife and I love it. Even my kids play it. Heres why.
1-If you've ever played an atelier series (the alchemy one) then you'll know what the crafting is about. It's not just tier 1 mats, it's all the mats and  attributes that are associated with that particular piece. I.e if you want a certain Stat, find that mat and mKe your gear with it. Those stats will be in it. And you can make some truly powerful stuff if you start with high quality base mats, and continue to add as you go. I absolutely love the crafting system. 
2. The exploration, it's procedurerally generated, yeah so ofcourse while there isn't  50,000 different types of enemies or puzzles or dungeons or whatever, theres plenty of cool things to find and do. Clear the maps then hunt the alpha beast or 3, then use those mats to make your next gear, visit the essence traders to but new crafting recipes and upgrades, build your house up and include all the accessories so you can make everything proper. 
3. fighting can be a bit hectic but as long as you keep your gear in order it's nothing to bad. This isn't a souls game but if you want it to be difficult, Amp up the difficulty. 
4. The story so far and progression required has been fun and intriguing in its entirety through. Most games I've played in this early access stage were not even close to as polished as this. I can think of two, grounded, and baldurs gate, and initially they got mixed reviews as well, then the devs delivered and the game was better than anyone imagined it could be. I love the game already, if you like personalized crafting, a game with room to expand and have endless possibilities as they add realm cards and new enemies, quests, mats, and storage capabilites, building recipes, and more. Try the game out. You can't really get into the meat of the game in 2 hours, but my family and I are having a blast together, and with all the time we've played we've had 1 disconnect. So what if you have to wait 1 min for a world to be repopulated and loaded up.  It's a great game, give it a chance.

1928980,159202863,76561197960844083,0,2,553,553,553,1708824732,"I'm an avid lover of survival games. I play them all, including the many many in Early Access. I ran into no bugs, very little lag, my system played it completely fine. I have run many D&D campaigned based in the Fae Realms. This game is the epitome of a game for me.

Do not buy this game.

This game, despite the marketing and style is barely scratching the surface of Minimum Viable Product. I played for 9 hours, and have made it through to the end of Tier 1 content (Which is actually the 3rd tier of gear and items). During my time playing 85%+ of the enemies in game have been: Bound (which lets be real are just Zombies) which are probably 60% of that number, Deer, Wolves, Pigs and Rabbits. For the remaining 15% I fought actual ""Fae creatures"": mostly Robots named after chess pieces which... I dont know maybe that's Fae but I've never read it before, Grasshoppers but bigger, a total of 6 Water Kangaroos (from the tutorial), Deer - but green and with curly fries for horns (thus Fae I guess?) and the one creature I might actually consider Fae being a Fae Elephant.

That's incredibly disappointing, they couldn't even really create a style of substance experience, in a theme that is so EASY to make stylistic.

OH AND LETS GET TO THE SUBSTANCE!

The main game loop starts up really fast after you get past your first few hours of grinding basic survival stuff to get your main base going and your crafting stations online. In hind sight, I should have got this much faster if it weren't for me trying to play the game like a survival game and collecting the items. A very large bottleneck for getting stations up was turning meat into fibre to unlock all the stations. I would go around hunting animals specifically to get more and more meat, but multiple stations took 30 meat worth of fibre, and that's when I started to notice something. The number of animals and locations always spawned near a point of interest, and in the same amount, and there was only so many to farm.

Then I realised that actually farming materials is not how you play this game. You need Essence, and this never changes. It is the only and single most important resource in the game, and is incredibly easy to get early game. I could buy a meat for 10 essence, and by cutting down a grass I could get enough material to turn into 6 essence per swing. Instead of 40 minutes of hunting I quintupled the amount I got in like 2 minutes. Oops, my bad for playing the game.

Now onto the main game loop. Stop me if you have heard this one before: You climb a tower in an area, and it unlocks the map of the area. You then run around and do highlighted points of interest to complete either an ""intellect puzzle"", a jumping puzzle, kill 5 zombies (and it was ALWAYS zombies), defend a machine from waves of Zombies (and it was ALWAYS zombies) or turn in a bunch of wood, sticks and plant fibre to complete a building an NPC requested. This would provide you with the true material that matters: Tier 1 Essences! Its like the other essence, but you have to do these events, and its green! Yes you can also randomly get a little bit from gathering materials, but it simply was viable or a good use of your time. You need these to upgrade the item level of your gear. No other materials needed, just the essence. Better or different materials will let you make the EXACT same axe, pick, weapon, umbrella whatever, but with slightly different or better base stats, but the item level of the item is all that matters.

So, the game is climb an Ubisoft Tower, then do World of Warcraft world quests. Except they are all procedural generated BUT also extremely samey, so ... worse than World of Warcraft world quests.

I tried to push the main story far enough that maybe, MAYBE This game gets better. I got to a point where I found Victor Frankenstein! OH! He was mentioned in the Trailer! This must be good!

Oh... he's talking about ... robots and the writing is extremely verbose, and not stylised at all... doesn't sound like the books. Sure whatever.

Not only this, but the deeply woven and Intricate story adds so much life to the world and the characters you meet throughout your adventures that I would recommend Nightingale on this alone.

Yes, there are improvements to be made. Yes, there are server issues that should be addressed and some quality-of-life tweaks that need to happen. Yes, the tutorial stage is longer than other survival games but in all fairness, [b]many other games tend to just toss you in and hope you figure it out on your own while Nightingale takes the time to explain this complex system and world to you.[/b]

However, it is also important to consider that this is not only an Early Access game but one that was released in Unreal Engine 5, and like many other UE5 titles that have been released this year, it shares the same set of common issues that should be expected.

Overall, I think the game needs a lot of work, I am not even sure it is even polished enough for early access. Nothing about it yells different than any other survival game and I want it to succeed - this review, although negative, is feedback, not criticism, and I hope that the developers would look into it because they can have a gem in their hands. I will keep on playing as it goes. It has a great opportunity to be unique, and much potential that right now is not being tamed or tapped into. For now, it needs time.

Character Creation: The character creation was great. Yes, it needs some polish, the models look like they need some work, but they have that very in depth creator that lets you choose your age as well as your lineage that affects your looks, which is very cool.

Performance: Starting the game though, almost right away I have noticed that I am infact lagging. Bad. Why was I lagging if I am playing solo? Well, they are working on a singlep layer mod now which is fine, but what if I want to play with friends as a host? You know, like Conan Exiles, Enshrouded, etc? This should be an options rather than sharing a server with everyone on the planet - it was unplayable.

Grind: Another thing is that if feels un-needlesly grindy, and I play lots of survival games. It feels slow. It is very grindy even for a survival game. And the beginning is very rough with the simplest items cost too many resources.

While the graphics are alright, it doesn't look like anything from the trailer, fooled me. And my rig is a lot better than the recommended that is shown and all on quality. It feels not very optimized either because the more I play the slower the game gets, if that makes any sense, but my computer doesnt seem to be bothered by it at all when it comes to temperature, load on GPU or system, not sure whats the deal.

Gear and Exploration: I find the decision to have a ""Gear Score"" that prevents you from advancing and exploring is not something that should be done in a survival game. It is up to me to get in trouble, to figure out to come back and forth and see if I can do it now or later. It makes the world feel smaller, and causes a sort of boredom that just enhances the feel of grinding, and halts exploration which is what I was excited and hyped about when I got the game. I say that game progression through gear score should be removed - no room for it in a survival game. Let the players make their mistakes and learn, its about exploration and knowledge - I get neither if I am gated by gear.

Story: So far the story is interesting, and another reason why I was hyped about the game, although it is very bare bones. This might be part of alpha/ea though, so I hope it gets better.

Direction and progression: I think a bit more direction of what and where to go would be nice. I am told to create a certain card, but I have no idea how to make the card, I have the card station, but going to vendors and looking around, I still have no idea how to find it - it is stopping me from moving forward, and because I am stuck with gear score that prevents me from moving forward, I can't go in some dungeons - I get pushed out instead of being able to explore and learn.

World Crafting: So the coolest thing about the game is the gate/card/world system which I think is awesome and where the game shines, or could shine. I feel like the system has so much potential, but it is not very utilized and the modifiers are not making a big difference in game play. Yes, they make the world look different, like purple skies, eternal darkness, more resources, such and auch, but the gameplay part is not very profound as I would expect. 

Repairs: I hink that repairs are done well. Interesting enough, you get these essence fro mthings you do, kill or harvest. You can use it to upgrade your gear or to purchase things like recipes or items. You also use them to repair your gear, and you can do it from your inventory and on the spot. Instant. Thats cool.

Crafting: It is cool, indepth with what material you use etc, but it is again, too complicated for several hours. It shouldnt be that way. Many times I will use fuel for cooking, forget the cooking part because if there is no fuel then your materials dont stay in there, and then there is auto fill, and how many you wnt to make, and it can be done better. It feels a bit 10 years ago, no ease of use or quality of life here, and it is not because it is hardcore, it is just not a polished design. Thingsshould not be complicated, they should flow.

Let the player have the ability to automatically use materials from their chest/storage. This makes sense, make the chests magical, fae touched - the materials flow from the storage into the crafting stations. Just quality/ease of life, in a magical world. Lots of games do that, I see no reason why not here. 

Where is the theme of victorian/steampunk that I was promised? Absolutely nothing after 18 hours. Yeah, I am a bit slow, sure, but still, if I wanted generic looking gear and items I could have played any other game - don't wait with that stuff to late game. If I come from a victorian steam punk society, I should know how to create minor things like wires, electrical current, stuff like that, yet I live in a wooden hut with... caveman tools. It gets better when you start getting into paper and galss, but its such a drop in the ocean you forget that the game theme is Victorian Steampunk and not Far Cry Primal.

The world, at first glance, is very cool. Then after a few hours it comes down to be very similar. Done this before feeling. You meet three wolves, five of the bad guys, four pigs, the same structures, etc. So it needs a lot more variety - it is needed so even if there is no story, atleast the players can fill in the blanks with their minds and imagination - can't do that when every encounter is the same.

When I heard about the game a year ago and saw the trailer I was already sold. I'm a hardcore survival genre fan and have been playing/trying-out every survival game I've come across that piques my interest and this one definitely sat on my wish-list with the most anticipation. Going into the first 10+ hours in the game with my wife, we really enjoyed exploring the first ""estate island"" but got pretty frustrated when we couldn't explore the dungeons on the island because they were locked behind an invisible gear score lock that wasn't really mentioned until we met the first quest npc on the island.

Another frustrating thing was how slow it was to get across the relatively big world but we hoped that there was some form of faster transportation as we progressed further even though there wasn't any signs that we could other than the rare airship sighting that kept us hoping. I really hope that in the future you can use mounts or vehicles to traverse the MANY worlds that you come across because that was one of the biggest downsides to this game.

All of my personal issues with the game:
- Portals take 5 minutes to open sometimes and another 5 to load into the world, and after being inactive for a few minutes they close and you have to open them again which takes the same amount of time.
- Lack of mounts or vehicles is disappointing 
- The 3 biomes being the only diversity in the world generation got very repetitive, after the 3rd rotation of worlds It got boring seeing the same scenery flora/fauna and POI's.
- Minor cards should have more information somewhere on the card or in the glossary rather than having a super vague description like ""this card speeds up crafting and increases outputs"" instead of ""This card increases crafting speeds by X% and increases yields by X%"" (yes im aware that it says this in the minor card applicator thingy but it doesnt in the crafting table for cards or in the trader) 
- Very repetitive puzzles and challenges
- Lack of information in material tooltips, lots of wasted resources to see whats better and no way to salvage unwanted refined materials like pickaxe heads and other things like that.
- Smelters have the possibility to have like 16 augments but can only use 3, found this very annoying and tedious when it came to mass smelting ores, had to make like 4 smelters.
- Crafting/Building resource requirements are very vague ex; precious metals, alloy ingots, etc.
- The progression reminded me so much of Black Desert Online because of how quick it was to get to The Watch (late game area) and then how slow it felt to get a single schematic set at one of the traders.
- Min/Maxing tools and weapons felt redundant in the early game with how quick the progression was, felt like we were making the newest tools and weapons and spending so much time gathering essence just to get the next upgraded set 5 minutes later and making them all over again.
- Not being able to see all of the locked schematics without going to each individual essence traders shop in the GUI was annoying as shit and tedious. 
- Searching for locked resources and items inside of your journal gives absolutely no information until you reach that tier or get those items.
- If you're playing with someone then you both have to buy the cards for crafting tables unless one person base bitches the entire game. This is especially annoying with the loading times and slow movement speed to acquire the cards and essence.
- The AI survivors that you can recruit are EXTREMELY DUMB, and you have to micro manage their inventory from combat to resource gathering instead of just giving them tools and weapons to switch freely from, i think a command wheel with basic commands like ""Gather/Hunt/Fight"" would go a long way to making them more than just glorified pack mules.
- PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL SACRED MAKE A QUICK STACK TO CHEST BUTTON IN THE INVENTORY, one of the things i hated about exploring was getting so much clutter in my inventory and having to spend 20 minutes sorting through everything manually.
- Giving npc's access to a wood chest will let them grab your high tier wood (refined too) and throw it in your campfire or smelter, also forgetting to grab whats in their inventory when you return to base lets them do it to.
- Movement speed foods, potions and enchants feel underwhelming or make no difference to the naked eye.
- Hate not being able to stack augments to make things craft faster, also it being an Online-Only game you cant change or modify your experience to your liking. (especially for people who have jobs or kids, this is really hard to enjoy grindy games when you dont have that kind of time.)
- Need more weapons other than a maul and that shitty slingshot - you have 5 different damage types (not including the elemental ammo) you have slashing / piercing / blunt / magick / and ranged. that alone should give you a PLETHORA of weapons instead of just using a maul and your axepick and guns (slingshot is shit) 
- the crafting times for somethings should take longer, and some shorter. Making ammo takes forever but making a motor out of 5 different refined and manufactured resources takes 3 seconds

LATE GAME GRIND ISSUES;
- you have to do multiple vaults/dungeons just to get a few hundred essence
- higher tier worlds arent rewarding more essence but yet the gear score requirement increases
- essence being the only form of currency should have more ways to be obtained rather than just farming dungeons
- just like you can extract essence dust from T1-2-3 i feel like it would be fair to be able to go from T3>T2>T1>T0 while keeping the grind.
- Scrapping old gear that have been upgraded should refund at least partial essence if any
- ^ i feel like we should get some of the resources back from crafted items instead of turning it into a useless resource like dust in the endgame when you don't use dust that much or at all.
- I also wish that resources show their tiers/item level in the glossary when searching the item as well as when you hover over it.
- The 3 vaults available (like the biomes) get very repetitive and boring after 3-4 runs
- the end boss fights feel unrewarding
- chests by default give nothing of value and are usually ignored except for breaking the chests to get the materials
- The endgame grind in itself feels unrewarding because its the end of the game and theres nothing else to explore after you unlock all the schematics from the traders (if youre insane enough to grind out 1300 t3 essence 25 times to unlock everything and all for nothing)
- Once you get to Ascended cards the game just drops you quest wise and doesnt give you any sort of direction other than a good luck, compared to the rest of the game where youre told/guided towards a goal and have that sense of direction.

TLDR

For me there are way too many tables going on for my taste and you cannot que up items.  So if i want to extract leather from the numerous sources i got hides from, i can only do my wolf pelts, then my pig pelts, then my little critter pelts one at a time leaving me babysitting a crafting table when i'd much rather be out exploring.    Also not all leathers are created equal, even though the end result description is leather.   so if i have 3 different hides that all make leather, but because the leather is extracted from different animal types, even though once processed it says leather, it slots them all in different spaces.   so if I have a recipe that requires 2 leather and I have 3 different leathers in my inventory and they are in 3 separate slots because they are not all from the same original source, it won't let me craft that item because it is saying I don't have enough quantity, even though I actually do. this ultimately is taking up wayyy too much space in my inventory.  the weight restriction is also a PTA.    so only 7 hours of game play and I'm disappointed.

TL;DR You should wait to buy either on sale or just a year down the line. In its current state it is a hot mess at best. 

So lets start the real review: I have numerous issues but we will start with the good. It has a very unique realm system that does put it apart from other survivals, and while I will complain there is no offline their justification for it being all online for that player hub in the end game zone atleast holds some weight. (although it could be accomplished equally so offline until you want to connect to an online version of it but w/e ). It also has a unique crafting system allowing to combine different woods, hides and metals to make an item with unique stats tailored to what you are aiming for. Outside of those 2, thats the only pluses because its just a regular survival game with everything wrong that I will list below.

So the bad, there are quite a few in its current state. As mentioned before there is no offline so you are at the mercy of ping and their servers. This leads to incredibly long load times when changing realms ontop of the already extremely long time it takes portals to open. 

My personal complaints: the stamina is just bad, like the worst I have ever dealt with. Everything costs way to much stamina, it takes a bit to recharge and its just the biggest hindrance I have ever seen. To build off that, there is a rest system in the game which when it reaches 25% you stamina drops down to 2, which means you cannot do anything requiring stamina which just makes you useless if you are in combat or a dungeon. This wouldn't be the biggest issue if it was at 0%, but 25% just seems really weird and honestly wrong. It makes the game super annoying to play for long times as it will require you to rest and possibly return home (which leads to long load times). This also happens with the hunger bar, but for your HP instead of stamina which is even worse. 
Now, another big complaint I have is there is no real melee combat weapon. You are stuck with an axe, pick, knife, ect and thats it those are your melee. Which is wild, like why can there not be a sword in the game but there can be guns? Just doesn't make sense. Nor is  there a bow, just some wierd pebble crossbow. I feel like they wanted to be different but missed both the mark but also the reason why every game has a sword and bow. It gets even weirder when you factor in there are crafting parts for a ""blade"" ""guard"" and ""hilt"" just no sword. 
Another huge complaint is in two parts: one every thing costs to much. Some ore types which is weirdly enough the type you need the most is far and few between. So you get very little, but you need alot. 2 ore for one ingot, 2-3 ingot for enriched variants, 2-3 enriched variants for final product which you then need 2+ of usually. Its all just costing way to much especially for solo play. To build off that the end game grind is WAY to much. T3 essence is handed in very few amounts but you need alot more of it compared to the t1-2 variants. For example 100 for crafting in T3 and 1300 for end tier stuff. Which is wildly expensive when you get 10-25 per major task. And you need 1300 per equipment piece not the whole. So if you truly wanted to be true true end game hard cap it would require more farming than almost any game I have ever played. 

I could go on about things I really dislike about how its currently set up. Especially my biggest problem of all which is how alot of items dont even have an icon which makes sorting a disaster. I truly just think this game is no where near a finished state for even early access and people shouldn't be getting it unless its on sale or a year down the line. There are so many obvious design choices that are just bad that it makes me question what the devs were doing and aiming for, because its honestly a hot pile of sh-.",1708475516,1708819296,False,9,0,0.495898127555847168,0,True,False,True

OK, so I'm a little back & forth, but enjoying the game overall.

- I like crafting, so I'm ok that the 'tech/build' tree is a bit on the involved side. We're not talking Space Engineers or anything, but more than Grounded I think (early impressions)
- there's a decent storyline; not enough to take it out of the standard 'open world survival' feel entirely, but certainly more than, say, Ark
- puzzles. This is not my favorite part. Given that it's EA, there are times when I don't know 'am I messing this up?' (which I often do) or 'is this bugged?'. Suspect there's some of Column A, & some of Column B
- combat is probably what needs the most tuning. Most is ridiculously easy. The dungeon bosses, OTOH, have been _too_ hard for me; I actually died to one.

Use your inventory sorter to sort chests. 

Bring enough fiber and sticks around to make makeshift tents and beds wherever you go, it's always better to be prepared. 

If you want to play on harder difficulties, make sure to imbibe them potions. 

You can have an open gate to every place you visit if you built a makeshift portal to each realm. The game expects you to, seeing how many portal materials I've found. This let's you build bases in each realm as long as you don't close that portal. A realm will stay open even if the portal closes, just reopen it using the same gate you used before.

It has a great aesthetic and setting, but does very little to differentiate itself or even rise to the level of other survival titles. If this game hadn't come out post Palworld and Enshrouded I would be a little more kind to it, but as it stands now it lacks so many QoL features and makes frankly baffling gameplay decisions. On top of the woes of Early Access bugs. 

Pros: 
- Good aesthetic
- Good setting
- Vaults are a neat idea, even though they are very shallow right now
- Using dash in the air with umbrella and veil card or soaring favor is actually so much fun. Please do more things like this. 
- Puzzles are fun at the start, but there isn't enough variety. 
- A bright future if the devs stick with it

Cons:
- Trivial combat, I died once ever on Medium and that was in the Apex swamp vault at ilvl 169. Then I came back with Ice Buckshot and killed him in 3 mins. 
- Bad gear progression. I used the same gear I started with to finish the game. I didn't bother to make new sets because they come so late and the enemies are just too bad to matter. I didn't bother crafting any of the firearms besides the first shotgun and rifle, and I'm certainly not going to grind for Dauntless stuff when the enemies are such jokes. 
- Item level requirements force you to do more chores in order to earn the privilege to fight a new boss that will take you between 60 - 200 seconds because they are so trivial. Then you go back to chores. 
- Horrible UI, placeholder icons, numerous errors with tooltips, codex journal and guidebooks all use unclear language at several points. 
- Can't craft in base with materials in chest, yes palworld has spoiled me. 
- Gameplay loop consists of doing the same puzzles over and over again till you can get a card so you can do the same puzzles over and over again.
- Outside of chores the content is very lacking compared to other titles such as Valheim, Palworld, Enshrouded, V Rising, etc, this will hopefully be improved over time. 
- As a solo I felt the content was boring at medium and hard, and then just long and boring at extreme, as a group I bet it feels even more meh. Difficulty just makes bullet sponges, it doesn't actually add gameplay difficulty.

Which is sad, as the world build, setting, and ideas are top notch.  Hopefully some further bake time allows Inflexion Games to get it together, and save what could have been a hidden gem.

Negatives:

Major Challenges:
Combat is uninspired, clunky, and lacks any systems that would make it more than tank 'n spank.  Building is a chore due to a subpar UI.  Progression is gear bound, but also quest gated, and teases at player agency, but doesn't actually allow any, as only total gear-score really matters.  Worst, the game runs poorly on the very best of systems, currently.

Minor gripes:
The number of crafting requirements and items forces 10s of random and arbitrary item types, and crafting station connections, necessitating chest and crafting station sprawl.  It's required for you to make a buckle from a metal plate, when metal plate takes 2 ingots.  Please just use the 2 ingots, the plate is unneeded, and adds a needless fake complexity.

Cold, heat, rest, poison, disease, and other detriments are impossible to itemize for, and defend against, and rather than adding a fun challenge, they detract by being annoying.

Sounds from Estate Cairn, Realmic Transmuter, and crafting stations need a player setting where we can configure them.

Positives:

The sound is excellent, water laps at the coast, wind rustles the trees.  Puck's VO's are 10/10, although sadly, no one else currently has voiced lines.

Graphics are pretty when maxed for Quality (but performance suffers).  Nighttime vistas look amazing, ringed planets and space views will amaze.  Trees' leaves tremble with the wind.

The setting is especially well done, and 1880 with magikal brits seems just like my cup of tea.  But it's currently a bitter, bitter brew.",1708722905,1708817738,False,1,0,0.488683134317398071,0,True,False,True

PROS:
- Beautiful maps
- Building isn't annoying and it's nice to have blueprints you can just put down and prebuild something and then get the materials when you have an idea of what you want.
- The portal system is fun and interesting
- People complain tree's don't bounce, but the fact is they do indeed bounce when they hit the ground, so appreciate that detail
- The story so far seems interesting and creating a character was fun

CONS:
- Combat and the follower AI need a lot of improvement
- The desert map is so unfun to play on, least liked map for me
- The UI and tool tips aren't that informative or helpful and I find myself googling information to get a clue on how some systems and items work
- Not a lot of background music, which makes for a lot of empty noiseless hours spent running around
- Fishing is not fun, and I love fishing in games usually

It's in early access and I hope they'll seriously take the time to improve and work further on this game, it deserves that chance. If you're not that into survival mechanics and can't overlook boring combat then this game is not for you. However I find myself able to just relax and build things, so far I spend most my time in game just gathering material and trying to further push the story forward.

The game is an ocean as deep as a puddle. The combat, the enemies and enemy types, the story, the worlds, etc. All lack any depth for gameplay, story, or any intention at building a universe with something other than boring gorgeous worlds. The ""Pale"" means nothing. The enemies are just some tattered and scrawny characters that have no depth, nor does the enemy in general. There's no culture/other sentient life that has anything worth mentioning. It's a group here defending tower. A man here offering to trade stuff (no voice acting after Robin/Oberon or whoever. Can't remember anymore) and the combat is swing. Then swing. Then swing. AANNDD shoot something with ammunition. It feels ""okay"", but that's it. It's a passable game that they had no real thought besides the initial pitches, which the ransom worlds with cards were NOT worth the time they probably spent on them.

Game has a ton of potential and the ideas are great, but everything pretty much falls short. Played for 5 hours fine yesterday, now I get a network error when trying to play solo. Why is my game even trying to connect to a network for single player? 

Combat is the definition of bland, simply wait for enemies to attack and side step and they will miss, then swing a couple times to kill them. Dodge mechanic is nice, but completely unnecessary. 

Haven't messed with the cards much since I'm still early on, but the idea behind it seems great.

The NPC that you get is a joke, completely non-reactive and just wanders around. Essentially worse than Skyrim's npcs. Pretty much just exist to hold stuff for you.

The building mechanic is nice that you can plan out the blueprints and the lighting mechanic to improve your workbenches is pretty good.

Graphics and lighting are nice.

Progression seems very linear. Gather materials - Craft better gear - kill boss - gather better materials - craft better gear - kill next boss. Seems like alot of these style games are doing this now.

Overall, it has its pros/cons, I feel like a couple more months of development would have given them a much better initial release. I'll stil play it since its too late to refund, but I don't recommend anyone buys it yet there are plenty of other games that do what this one does that are more polished.

Edit : 

In the tier 2 area now, gear score is level 67 or something of the sort. Boss fights aren't as simple, but still don't require much thought. Was pretty disappointed with the lancaster pistol as a ranged weapon, hopefully the later game ones are better. Several dungeons I've gone into + bastions I've done are exact replicas of the other ones which is pretty lame. I find myself going to a new realm and rather than feel excited to explore another area I feel annoyed because I know its going to be almost the same.

The crafting is very crunchy, so YMMV if that isn't your thing.

Multiplayer is easy to drop in and out of, as you can pull people into your current realm at any point, share an abeyance hub if desired (home base), or just set up permanent portals to their own bases. More of a lobby system like MH:World than a single world state like Conan Exiles or ARK.

In a year of hyper-strong survival game releases Nightingale is the weirdly-interesting-ugly-duckling. It's much more 'early access' feeling from a mechanical standpoint than Palworld or Enshrouded - and it's also doing some fundamentally cooler stuff than either of them.

At the time of writing, it's visually interesting and feels really imaginative but is not very complete. Where other survival games are getting records for being Ark: Pokemon Evolved or Valheim 2: we forgot the boats, Nightingale is trying something new.

I couldn't recommend you buy it right now, but I definitely think it's worth wish-listing if you haven't already. It won't take a lot of updates for this game to tip into being awesome.

UPDATED OPINION:
I will also add, I think this is 90% of the model/ game-play loop for an instance based MMO in the survival genre.

Some practical things about the game;
- Base building is similar Satisfactory
- Tool/Item crafting is possibly the deepest (and most time consuming) crafting in the genre
- Combat doesn't feel it's really coming online until you get further into the crafting
- Progress takes longer than average for survival games
- The story is much more present here than other survival games, it's also quite fun
- Always online (personally I think your Estate biome should be local)

- Online only (for now)
I usually play survivals in coop so the fact that none of us have to host the game is good for me.
It comes with three problems though.
First is the long time it takes to travel between realms.
Expect to wait about 1 minute every time you go through a portal.
It may not seem that long but you have to do it a lot and watching loading screens is not especially fun.
Second is the network errors.
It doesn't happen that often (1 for every 5 hours of game play for me) but when it happens, it can take about 10 minutes to get back in.
Third is the fact that you get disconnected for ""inactivity"" which wouldn't be that much of a problem if it was not based on movement.
Getting disconnected while you are checking the glossary (List of mats and their ""location"") or the Codex (Where you can read the lore you unlocked) is quiet frustrating.
I can live with that but it is still annoying.


- Combat
Combat is a little dull.
I like the fact that crits are based on where you aim instead of a stat on your gear but that's the only good thing I can say about it.
It does not feel challenging or strategic.
It's common in survivals for trash mobs but boss fight don't feel any better.
After 24 hours, I am still using my woodcutting axe as main weapon and switch to pickaxe when my enemies are resistant to my axe.

- Crafting
Probably the only redeeming aspect of this game.
It can be very rewarding for people who enjoy spending time looking for the mats that will allow them to craft min-maxed gear to their specifications.
Others will hate it because it makes crafting take longer.
QoL features like crafting from chests or queuing crafts in workbenches could alleviate this problem but it's not there yet.
The augments (decorations that unlocks new recipes in workbenches) system also need a complete rethink.

- Building
Builders will be disappointed by the low limits on the amount of structures and furniture one can put in a realm.
Also, a good portion of this budget will probably have to go into storages to stock the variety of mats.
They won't like the augment system either as it will force them to make choices between aesthetics and usefulness (Needing a saddle rack next to a workbench to craft a revolver for instance).

- Game loop
I like the fact that there's no xp as gear based capacity is better for coop games.
Progression is done following a series of quests gated by gearscore every few steps.
The problem is that in order to increase your gearscore, you have to unlock recipes for the gear, the workbenches and the augments.
The main way of unlocking those recipes is to buy them and this is where it become very boring.
First you have to farm the currencies needed and you do that by visiting ""POIs"".
They are not interesting at all.
You have three types that involves a little fighting.
Musical ""puzzles"" where you have to click three objects in the right order (you can do them with sound off)
One where you have to find and activate three glyphs in the surrounding.
One where you have do to do a little jumping and climbing (the only challenge being having enough stamina).
One where you have to collect and bring back the mats to complete a structure blueprint.
And the main attraction is the Fae towers which involve one or two combats and a little labyrinth (Will you chose left hand or right hand?) with mostly harmless traps every 5 meters.
Not bored yet ? There's more.
Now that you collected some essences (the currencies) you have to find the vendor who sells the recipes you want.
Vendors available recipes are based on the biome and faction of the realm they are in (determined by the two cards you use when opening a portal).
For example, if you want to unlock the first tier station to craft healing potions, it can only be bought in some low level swamp biomes.
Even then, vendors don't always have all the possible recipes for their realm and you may have to visit two or three of them in order to find the recipe you were looking for.

My conclusion is that I would only recommend this game, in the state it is now, to people who are attracted enough to it's crafting system to get past all it's flaws.
Others should wait and see if the game improve enough in the future.",1708814344,1708814344,False,118,3,0.71477121114730835,0,True,False,True

**updating my review because I've put more time in**

I really love this game. Feels like it was made for me. The way I've been playing it is essentially like a cross of Ark and Warframe. I connect to a zone. I make incursions into it for loot. Come back to my base to drop off the loot. Repeat until im done with the zone.

sometimes i take big crafting breaks where im just puttering around my crafting room building stuff. Everything in this game is crafted, the only thing lootable thats usable as is is food and pots. Crafting is interesting to me because in addition to crafting benches you have to build ""cosmetic"" pieces around them to get access to recipes. Some grant buffs to the things you make. So my crafting bench has like a saw horse and a tool box next to it and they buff the bench.

i can see how people will find this grindy. I'm a pack rat and I live here now. I've never had a game feel like home in the way this game does.

TLDR: Crafting and inventory management feels like a chore, building mechanics are too limited, and exploration and game content is repetitive and uninspired.

Pros:
- Game looks good.
- Melee combat is weighty and satisfying (reminds me of Vermintide a bit)
- The concept of exploring different realms based on a combination of cards is actually really interesting

Cons:
- Crafting is tedious and time consuming, requiring you to craft a bunch of intermediate materials that clog up your inventory and sit around not playing the game for a few minutes at a time.
- Inventory management is a nightmare because of item variety. The idea of using different types of materials for different stats in crafting is interesting, but it results in a storage and organizational nightmare, especially since you can't craft from storage or quick sort things into chests.
- Most of the gameplay consists of wandering around looking for these little activities that are almost identical each time. It's either kill something, jump to something, or press buttons in a certain order. There isn't even visual variety to these.
- Building is horrible. It's really limiting, and there isn't any sort of decor. I didn't feel any motivation to build a cool looking base because of it.",1708813256,1708813256,False,2,0,0.488011300563812256,0,True,False,True

A lot of the negative reviews I have read are from mainly people within refund hours of game play time and are about 2 things, connection issues, which I've only ran into 3 times in my 19 hours of playtime.

Or things that people believe are a mistake/hassles but just haven't figured out how to do something properly in-game. (like auto filling materials in a crafting station and ""losing"" your good materials when you wanted to use lower grade materials...Just don't click craft after it auto fills with your higher grade materials or choose the material you want to use manually?)

Some also complain about it being grindy....lol 

This game, you have to give it a little time to get going because it has a slight learning curve but it's different and interesting once you get going. Also it's in alpha, they are already listening to the community, it's still a fun game and i'm sure its going to get even better.

PROS:
~The cards- I love how you can change realm settings basically with cards you craft. It is new and an interesting concept. Jumping really high, running faster, doing more damage, randomly changing resource nodes, etc. Some even change the sky which is cool.
~Having traders in different realms as well as companions to tag along and help you fight or gather materials is nice.
~I'm addicted to the fishing.
~The crafting, while it takes a minute to get used to is unique and I like it.
~All of the stat changes based off of ingredients is in depth and adds more to the game.
~The different enchantments, charms, etc. you can put on your gear/weapons.
~I enjoy the dungeons.
~The fast travel back to your respite (base location) at any moment, even when exploring another realm.
~The building is nice. You unlock a variety of structure types as you progress and you can build an entire blueprint of a base and then just start gathering the materials and walk up to a one structure to start placing all the materials for any connected structure. (Also you companion, if gathering materials, will place things in the build blueprint, if they have materials in their inventory).
~Easily repair all of your items with a single click, anywhere.
~Runs smooth
~The sound effects are pretty cool, especially when chopping a tree, changing something in the realm transmuter.
~I'm sure there are more but this gives you an idea of some of the things I think are positives.

CONS:
~I don't like the fact I cant sheathe my offhand without having to sheathe both main hand and offhand and then pull the main hand back out. This is actually probably my biggest complaint and it is absolutely annoying to me, but I've got it down at the same time, or I just leave one of the offhand hotbar slots empty and equip that space.
~I wish the sites of power told you the requirements for entry.
~The inventory in both your bags and storage boxes is kinda strange. It basically automatically puts it in it's own order based off of how you have it set (Alphabetical, Newest to Old) etc. You cant drag and move anything around in your chests or inventory bag.
~This isn't necessarily a negative to this survival game, since I don't know a survival game that has this but I would really like the option to organize and save how my inventory is, especially after you die and pick your stuff back up.

At its core gameplay it is competent and fun, though I'd stick to first person view (you can switch to third person via menu but would be cool if there was a shortcut button to switch during game play).

Keep in mind it is still early access, though i havent encountered alot of bugs yet, none gamebreaking and none super annoying.  It is very much playable.

The character customization is pretty deep, lots of presets to start out from to customize from there, though there are only sliders for face.  You can also actually choose the characters age which will be physically reflected on the character's face, and im not just talkin obviousl wrinkle texture just overlaid on the face, the physcial changes is drastically noticeable from skin looking young and smooth to daunted, wrinkled and old.  You can go from 16 to 70 (or 69? i cant remember) and the difference in age from 16 to the oldest you can make it is very, very obvious.  Although, I dont know if age actually effects gammeplay.

The only possible downside (ho imo not that major) is the characters that ive met thus far other than Puck, are bland and robotic.  Puck is very much animated and fully voiced which i think was doing the narration in the opening scenes which is very well produced, AAA game feeling but then suddenly you meet the npcs and its just like any generic npcs in other generic type rpg/adventure game where they're just there to give you info, no vices, just text.  Think like some old school rpg games.  A little idle animation now and then, and some animations while you are talking with them would be nice.  Again, no totally against it but if you are gonna give us an opening like that, at least make the NPCs a  bit more lively with the expectations you juts given us with the opening scene, and with Puck!  The only similarities npcs and puck have is they can fucking give u jump scares with all that teleporting, though one is lore based and the other purely so they can keep up with u, which is not perfect and in turn makes them another creepy Watson (from that one sherlock homes game...you know what im talkin about, maybe :u)

Overall though i can recommend it if you are looking  for another open world survival game with interesting themes and lore, that can be fun with friends (there is an offline option but from what ive seen they were gonna go online only in EA.  i havent tried offline only so idk if i can progress with my character i made for online) and has competent combat system, that doenst feel shitty or dated or super rough (only a little bit enuff to easily ignore) like 7Days or minecraft (which tries to do 1D combat similar to retro games like zelda, but imo doesnt work coz at least with zelda its easy to gauge how far the enemies are and when theyll be able to come into range.  If enemies simply dmg u by colliding like retro games and not giving some visual feedback theyre attacking u, 3D 1D/simple combat is just fucking horrible for that).",1708808425,1708808598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

3/10 with work maybe can get to 5/10 but the base for a good game simply isn't there so it cannot become anything good.

Combat doesn't feel impactful. (There are no weight to the melee combat. As i do not feel as if I am actually hitting my targets)
Graphics could be a bit better. I play on Max with a RTX4060 and I'm not taken back by any details.
Crafting stations and augments are a Cluster Fuck! (my base looks like a storage unit with everything in a pile in the middle of the floor.)

Oddly, a week ago I would have been greatly disappointed if they had pushed this back 6 months to a year but now I find myself wishing they had. Oh well. 

Pros:
Pretty
Good Concept

Cons:
Bad network/server issues
Bad crafting system (too many of the same materials with diff traits, too much make this to make this for items you use once) Also, no linked crafting to storage.
Repetitive Scenery - a few 'oooh' and 'aah' PoIs but gets old fairly quickly
Grindy/Obtuse Quests - This could have been cleaned up with a little effort and I'm surprised it released this way.
 Boring combat.

 I'd like to start this review by saying this, if your going to buy a game knowing its in early access and shall be for some time, don't expect a whole lot of meat and potatoes as far as content goes. This game on the other hand has done exceptionally well at keeping me intrigued. I've read reviews saying ""I was bored after 20 min"" and ""Typical Server issues"". These people have no concept of how a survival game works. Yeah, there may be a tutorial start that's slightly stretched, but its necessary considering the amount of aspects you need to understand, to be an efficient player. And yeah, there may be some server issues while transferring to another realm. This should be and expectation for a server based game, lets be real. 

 There are a few things i look for when determining weather my time is worth putting into a survival game:
1. What aspects of ""survival"" do I have to endure?
2. How many resources are there to farm? 
3. Is there depth to the base building side?
4. How much meat is there to the progression? 

Now the last question may be the most important considering this is a non-mmo (initially)
My thoughts are that because this is still in early access there are plans to make some sort of transition into an mmo, based on the interactions I've had with NPC's. One could argue that wishful thinking, but it only would make sense. As far as staying busy, im 25 hours in and only lvl 60 gear score with some resources needing a lvl 400 to farm.

As far as aspects of survival, there's plenty to worry about. From thunderstorms that produce hail to burning rays of sun in the desert biom's, the struggle is real. I was especially happy with the extreme variety of cooking to the game, which segways to my second detail. Resources. The amount of resources in the game is comparable to mmo's like ESO and Runescape. 25 hours in and still discovering new plants, minerals and hide.

lastly id like to get into the base building. The only problem I have with this side of the game is the amount of time it takes to unlock detail i can put into my homestead. They've put great detail into different materials and styles of this aspect and its refreshing to see. No problems with snapping foundations or roofs like others in the past. I give an A- on the building side for that reason alone.

 Overall i am very pleased with what they've done so far and am crossing my fingers that this isn't a full release disguised as an early access. Give it a shot if you're up for a challenge.",1708763630,1708802925,True,199,6,0.825633823871612549,5,True,False,True

It’s still in early access so there are bugs, missing content and questionable design choices.
I am having fun playing it alone, but I do not recommend it right now. It needs more development.

Here is a list of cons I’ve discovered.

[b]Storage[/b]

Storage management is pure hell. Limited slot inventory system is a cancer of game design. Here it is just pure evil. There is way too many different items. Each item has several tiers. Every tier has several types. Nothing stacks.
There are no filters in inventory, there is no global storage. Every slot belongs to some chest you’ve crafted and placed somewhere. And there will be a couple of dozens of chests. And you will be running around trying to remember where you put this thing you need for crafting.
And chests have no labels.

[b]Crafting[/b]

Crafting is very intricate to the point it’s very cumbersome. You can use a choice of different resources to craft the same item, and this will affect the resulting item’s properties. But you have no idea what resources are suitable to craft this item from. Meaning there are very unclear resource types. And there is no indication what resource’s types are.
You must do a lot to craft an item. First, you must acquire a recipe from a trader. Traders have random selection of recipes available, and you may have to visit several realms to get what you need. But you must know what you’re looking for. But you don’t know which portal card you need to find this recipe. Then you must acquire a recipe for a corresponding crafting station (same problems with traders). Then you must build this crafting station from a variety of crafting components. Then you must acquire a recipe of an augmentation which unlock this recipe (same problems with traders). Then you must build this augmentation. That’s it. If you have necessary components, you’re ready to craft. Yes, you must do it only once for every tier.
Crafting stations have a limited number of connections to augmentations. Meaning some augmentations won’t connect and you won’t be able to craft a recipe. You will have to create an additional specialized crafting station for a recipe. Or just move crafting stations and augmentations around depending on what you must craft right now.
UI for managing crafting stations connections is badly designed. You can’t see which way the connection is working. Connections with augmentations are mixed up with connections to heat and light sources.
Crafting recipes include several steps of crafting recipe components from different resources. It could be a lot of effort to keep everything you need in mind and at hand.
There is no information in crafting recipe about the resulting item equipment rating.
You can’t mix different resources of the same type in one recipe.

[b]Bugs[/b]

Plant boxes aren’t working. So farming is not yet available.
If you dismiss a recruit all his equipment and inventory will be immediately lost. Dismiss recruit button is very close Manage equipment & inventory button in recruit dialog and makes it easy to mis click. Since there is no confirmation on dismissing a record, it is a very serious problem.

[b]Design[/b]

Very limited tool bar. There is only 5 main hand choices and 5 off-hand. And there is at least 4 tools and several types of weapons which you have to cycle constantly while playing. Off-hand choices are useless.
Umbrella only works when you equipped it in off-hand. So, when you’re falling you must quickly press one of hard-to-reach keys to use it (6-0). Other than umbrella off-hand tool bar is useless. There is nothing you can use it from there comfortably.
There is no tool tip when you aim at some object. You can’t identify an object or resource node until you swing a tool at it. Very bad. Basically, you must switch to other tool to see a resource node required tool level.
Resources are introduced badly. There are way too many high-level or not-yet-needed resources in spawn tables.
No character levels and no locking a high-tier tool to use on some level. Basically, some high-level player can easily outfit a total noob.
Resource extraction is designed badly. Basically, when you use tools on resource nodes it spawns a resource item in a world as a 3d object in addition to lots of visual debris. And you must pick it up afterwards. This is unnecessary and excessive. It creates a load on rendering, physics and network. Creates problems for a player (you must pick up items manually, co-op resource stealing). When you mine a resource node on a mountain, resources could drop very far below you out of reach. It would be better resources going straight to your inventory.
Recruit AI is terrible. You can’t control your recruit. If you use it as a mule, be aware that it will waste all your precious high-tier wood, stone, etc. on buildings if you happen to pass near unfinished building.
New heart shot mechanics is doubtful. I have no idea where harpy’s heart located at. Without an animal codex it’s no more than a critical torso shot.
Different resource icons are the same. There are way too many types of the same resource to make different icons. But developers could’ve implemented at least mini sub-icons for different tiers and resource origin.
Rest mechanics is underdeveloped. Right now, it’s just a necessity to touch a bed once a half an hour. That’s it. I haven’t seen any comfort levels modifiers.
Hope stat is unexplained, and I have no idea how it affects a gameplay.
You can’t move item to or from a toolbar while transferring items between inventories, chest etc.",1708802147,1708802210,False,5,0,0.484309196472167969,0,True,False,True

There are some folks encountering crashes, but those bugs will be squashed (and often are squashed by updating your graphics drivers).
Most folks complaining of a lack of particular Quality of Life features or functionality in the augmentation system are heavily exaggerated. There's already plenty of ""quality of life"" features, and it looks like it will only get better with time.
Look at it like this, it's early access and they've developed an excellent framework for future QoL improvements.

Also, the combat is much more fun that most people are putting it to be. I'd go as far to say that it's actually very exciting. I have a great time using ranged and melee, it's fun to use the dodging and critical hit mechanics. This is another feature that is heavily over-criticized or overlooked. Enemies are fun to fight and dodge. I have yet to get a ranged weapon beyond the crossbow, and have yet to play with magic, and I'm already having a great time.

The always-online system, while peculiar, and off-putting at first, is also an interesting and beneficial feature to the players. We can play in our friends' realms while they are offline, without the need to rent servers. That's an AWESOME feature in my opinion.
That being said, I feel for the players who are experiencing high ping... Offline mode for these players is necessary.

We are in early access and only a week or two out from release. The devs have already addressed some of the woes of the community (we're getting that offline mode as soon as feasibly possible) and they have laid out a fantastic framework for the future of the game.

Let them cook, this game is already very cool.

To offset my positive review, here are the features that I would like to see in the game:
-Some more building options early on, though it's plenty enough.
-Automation of some sort. I know NPCs are already capable of gathering resources, let's take it further and get them crafting, farming, or moving resources.
-Expansions to how storage works.
-More puzzles, more complexity.
-More complexity to AI, I want them to lead or anticipate my movements a bit better. They are fun as is, but could be much more.
-Alternative ways to unlock recipes. As of right now, I am aware of either purchasing recipes from traders or unlocking them via Bastilles.

Obviously there are still some folks who are experiencing technical issues with getting the games started. Make sure you meet the minimum specs and you have your drivers updated, that's a good start.

this game is a really cool take on the survival crafting genre. It has most of the staples but each comes with a twist that breathes new life into them. instead of one workbench that gets cluttered pretty quickly, each one has a few base recipes and then you build linkables that enable their own recipes so you can specialize each bench, room, etc. it's a small touch (that isn't nearly as much hassle as it may sound) that unlocks alot of customization for your base. crafting is now based on a number of components that each give their own stat bonuses as well that adds all kinds of depth, etc etc. the devs put alot of thought into making a pretty tired genre feel fresh again. absolutely recommend whether you want to get it now or when offline comes out.",1708474263,1708801483,True,0,0,0.511012673377990723,0,True,False,True

This review will be long as hell as it's taken me nearly twenty minutes to get my thoughts together; it will also touch on my thoughts on a lot of negatives people are listing in their reviews / on Reddit.

I one-hundred percent recommend Nightingale... for a limited selection of people. Don't get me wrong, I'd love if a bunch of people wanted to pick it up, but it is a strange blend of survival mechanics, mmo-ish presence and servers, exploration game and (easy, mostly) puzzler. The theme is going to appeal to more people's tastes than the gameplay itself, I think, especially judging by many of the negative reviews I've glanced through. (Common complaints I'm seeing are about the building system, the UI, the grind, or specific items / too many item types, just to state what I'm seeing.)

For me, this mix is perfect. This is ABSOLUTELY what I hoped Nightingale would be. I'm always stumbling over strange finds and exploring them, or being a busybody around my Abeyance (home) realm, or grinding materials with a gorgeous view. 

Notes on the negatives people have listed as follows for those in-between in opinion.

-On grinding: I expect the grind from a survival game - I've dumped a hilarious amount of hours into Conan Exiles, No Man's Sky on xbox (not so much on pc), etc. I personally enjoy it - not everyone will.

-On the UI: I honestly don't see a problem with any of it. It's to my taste, and I think it fits the game very well.

-The building system is ... like most other survival games? Again, I'm so used to this that it just works how I expect. It's not good or bad, really. I do see lots of frustration about Augmentations - little items you place near a workbench to increase it's speed / give it new recipes - but when I figured out to build a different one for my workbench that was overloaded, my mental response was, ""oh, I'll just move one of these away real quick then, they look like furniture anyway."" Boom, solved. Now, if you're coming from Enshrouded, you're going to be disappointed if you're expecting that, because Enshrouded *literally has the best building system I've ever seen* and I personally don't hold any other dev to that standard. Enshrouded also wasn't for me, despite the cool building system.

-Itemization. There are SO many different items. I will agree that it can get annoying trying to sort them all, because different items do not stack (in those items' defense, they are different items, so... duh?) which means to store them, they need to take up separate storage slots, which means that you need to build a BUNCH of chests. At the moment there is no craft-from-chests option, so you end up running to and from your chests a bunch while crafting if you're like me and have a short memory span or don't like to hold onto more than the necessities while at home. However, as an upside, this means the crafting is SO wildly varied - I can farm the materials that are right for me as they all have different stats. It isn't immediately clear which stats will modify an item based on type, but I honestly am so fine with experimentation that this wasn't a negative to me.

-The AI is actually moronic. My companion is an idiot who actually stands in my way while I mine, 90% of the time. I end up yelling at her a lot. Fighting the Bound is personally very fun for me, though.

-Combat isn't really flashy, but I enjoy it anyway. Again, a personal thing.

-The big one for me personally: Nightingale doesn't hold your hand through a LOT. I'm seeing this here and on Reddit: there's nothing that I saw telling you to look at your Glossary (journal button (J), Glossary at the top) to find where you can find an item. Nothing that really explains that different materials have different capabilities when crafting. Sometimes the cards are weirdly worded so it's unclear what changes they'll make, even if you're reading the stats on a realmic transmogrifier (I forget exactly what those are called). This can be... testing. I've had a good few times where I out loud was like THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT INFORMATION HOURS AGO. I will say that, in general, maybe Nightingale's lack of hand-holding is awesome in most cases for some players - maybe for some, it's the thing that makes you want to refund. I won't judge one way or the other, you do you.

I will also quickly comment that, having made it to the watch, I genuinely see the point of ""online only"" and honestly do not have any inkling of an idea what they'll do to make this NOT the case. When in the watch, you are in a public area more akin to the Division's home base. The dungeons there are very, very public. My friend and I entered one on a whim and ended up fighting with (three? maybe two, I was tired) other people against a giant Eaton (ent). It was dope. If they can figure out how to make it not online-only without compromising their vision, props to them.

Last note here, and this isn't touching on a complaint but a huge positive from me towards the game. The ambiance is astounding. The other night I was in a gloom forest, where it's always night, with a piercing moon through the trees. Far-off cries of predator vs prey and distant screams occasionally filled the otherwise-still air, and I had limited bullets left in my pistol and very few health potions left, so I weighed returning but I pressed on for just a little while longer. It started raining, and then hailing, and the hail and rain drowned out the distant screams and for a moment, where before I felt hope and excitement toward the realms of the Fae in general, now I just felt unnerved.
The ambiance is amazing. Sound design, amazing. From the ridiculous PING on a headshot or heartshot to the sound puzzles to the crumbling dusty ruins to the cries of the birds in the forest to the desert wind, sound is amazing.

TLDR;
+This game will absolutely not be for everyone! You've gotta love the theme, survival games, exploration, not mind puzzles. If you're naturally curious and go explore crazy things in the distance, you might like this game. If you're into crazy crafting systems, you might like this game. If you don't like your hand-held and are stubborn, you might be into this game. I have mostly played alone, but this game IS better with other players; you should be good either way (though I can't speak for how the dungeons in the Watch might play out after the Online Only change coming). I personally am very excited for the future of this game.

-If you don't like bugs (I've had very few but my experience is rare and I'm aware of that), wait till Early Access is done before considering. If you don't like survival games, hate the concept of something being multiplayer, are not the explorer type, or are really not into the concept of sorting items / your group doesn't have someone who can, maybe pass on Nightingale.

The setting is unique, so i am not sure why the Ui doesn't utilized on that, it is plain and typical.
A Survivor (The NPC companion)  started to chop all of the trees around my base, and they fell on my base, completely destroying it.
Learn from my mistake Do not start your Realm in Extreme Difficulty, it just increases the health and damage of enemies, while early game you do not have combat options, simply not enough stamina to dodge and block the multitude of enemies spawning at the same time. I would recommend starting out on Medium Difficulty.

Still.... i pushed through the early games grind and bore. And the game started to redeem itself the further i went.
The combat starts to become better with the addition of magic.
And around midgame, you also start to have enough health and stamina to actually manage better combat, and start to spacialize with your choices towards a preferred style how to approach combat(eg.: Stealthy Ranged, or Stalwart Meele)

The writing in this game and lore is pretty good. The characters personality shines through the dialogues written or voiced.

The Realmcards are fun and great way to add variety on how to approach the realms you encounter, but these are too, all locked through exploration. Almost all Quality of Life improvements are locked into exploration, and until you do enough exploration, the game is frustrating.
With enough patience, you can find enjoyment in the game, but it isn't one without flaws.

This game is exploiting Early Access - just straight up telling the truth here. Steams EA has become a way to dodge wonky launch criticism, this is not the only title to do this recently.


I am not sure how a game like this happens, a survival game with a really cool aesthetic and world generation mechanics is overwhelmed by the poorly thought out game play mechanics.   There are so many games to draw from and to play and understand how things work and what players enjoy, this missed every mark for me for how it feels to play.

The Dayz weight limit is an immediate turnoff, the 1st mission out of the tutorial is to build a home, the ""cairn"" or claim block type item, weighs more than you can carry, moving any amount of material around in this game immediately results is slowed movement and no jump/dodge, in a game that RELIES on dodging and jumping around.

WHY AM I DYING RIGHT NOW?  this is a question i'll ask myself as i just started losing massive amounts of health walking through some grass, there's a red marker indicating I'm hurt, but nothing else, and I can't heal it.

The always online thing... this didn't bother me too much initially, i live in AK and have internet outages quite often, it happens, I really don't mind if a game requires internet... I DID buy it on a digital store that loses it mind when I disconnect more often than any games do. 

That being said, the game is server sided, if you don't have FAST internet, you will rubberband, lose items, die randomly from things that are not on screen yet etc.  while playing completely alone.    This is where the online only component breaks down for me, getting at stuck on ""waiting for server"" when loading into a game with no other players is not ok.

Games like Rust work with this type of server sided data because you always inhabit a world (aside from private servers) that can at any time, bring other players to you and have interactions with.   Nightingale is a server sided game with absolutely no chance of me meeting other players by chance or per server population, being server sided makes no sense at all.



BECAUSE the game is technically early access, I'll let go of my gripes with npcs, puzzle designs and wait to see if they do actually intend to perform major fixes balancing mechanics in this game.

My only concern is as of right now, that the devs have not played any successful survival games, the carry weight being such a huge problem is an alarming oversight for this genre, it's a major game mechanic that I have never found issue with in any other survival builder.",1708798470,1708799865,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

TL;DR Summary, for those who might die from wall of text crits:

PROs

- Visually phenomenal
- Immersive environment feel
- ZERO performance issues (for me). I have never had a game run this smoothly, and 
  everything is on Ultra settings. 10/10
- Awesome, intelligent, unique setting that is a breath of fresh air from the usual zombie/environmental apocalypse/future 
   space survival genre.
- Exploration is fantastic, really compelling (for me anyway - umbrellas!).
- Weather matters. Seek shade in the desert or face the consequences, stay dry from the rain, don't stand in hail too long 
  or you'll regret it, don't wade around in swamps or you'll also regret it.
- Crafting is fun and the upgrade system allows for great customisation.
- Building! Great options, really nice looking results.
- Summon a new realm to explore/purloin whenever you feel like going somewhere new.
- Think the realm could be more interesting or it's not challenging enough? Mod it with cards to apply all sorts of effects 
   like low gravity, eternal night, eternal day, better loot but you continually take damage, mobs are more dangerous, etc. 
  etc.
- Seamless (and quick) multiplayer, and players can continue to share a realm even if one or more people log off.
- Puck! Puck is great - dev team don't you dare dumb him down! See special comment at the end. Elegant AF!
- Probably missed some stuff but it's late, I'll edit if I need to.


CONs

- I found the tutorial to be a bit dull/lengthy, but it does what it needs to do. You do have to repeat it for each character you 
  make, but once you know what needs doing you can speedrun it.


DON'T CAREs:

- UPDATE Devs are working on an offline version for those who hate always online. I personally don't care either way, but I know a lot of people were downvoting because of it.


TOO LONG; READ IT ANYWAY:

Visuals/Environment - This is quite possibly the most visually beautiful game I've ever seen. The water effects, especially the sea are some of the best looking I've seen. And the lighting! Absolutely gorgeous, and one thing I really love is that if you go from a light place into dark, or the other way around you have to wait for a second for your eyes to adjust. You've got god rays through windows. And the ambient sounds really add to the immersion - the rain, hail and storm sounds are really very good, this is one thing my husband and I always scrutinise in a game - how good are the weather effects? Excellent. For being procedurally generated instances, these are phenomenally well put together, they are seamless and beautiful. Each one I've seen so far looks like a work of art. BIG kudos to the art team on this, I personally feel they've knocked the whole look of the game environment right out of the park.

Unique Setting - This is a huge plus for me. I've played a lot of survival games. They are my go-to good time. But boy am I getting a little tired of zombies, post apocalyptic wastelands and alien moonbase mining colonies. This Victorianesque setting is a huge breath of fresh air for me. It's stylish, it's appealing, it's different, and gosh darn it doesn't treat you like you're an illiterate moron who never cracked a book before, or a depressed cog in the corporate machine. I am LOVING this setting. You wanna be Victorian Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider? Now you can!

Exploring - I live for exploring in games, and this is ticking the box very VERY hard! Explore the Fae Wilds! Find weird sh*t! Loot it! Also puzzles, with items, resources and recipes/schematics as rewards! Accidentally fell off a cliff? Deploy umbrella and float to safety! There's climbing picks too although I haven't had to use those so far. Points of interest have been very well varied so far, I don't think I've come across any two that are alike yet so I'm not getting any ""oh look, it's Generic_Ruin_01 again"" vibes. With a world this beautiful I can see myself exploring for the hell of it forever.

Realm Generation - You've got your home ""Abeyance"" realm where you can make your awesome base of operations - a jumping off point as it were. You can then create customised realms to go adventuring in using the mix and match portal card system. This is a really nice feature and allows you to fully customise the kind of places you'll be going, who can access them, and how difficult/rewarding they will be. An excellent system.

Realm Customisation - like the realm you've gone adventuring to but feel it's missing just that little something? Play minor cards to change it! Make it more difficult, make it easier, make it forever night, make you take constant damage, make it so you can fish in peace without getting jumped by random mobs, make it so the gravity is turned way down and you can ride the wind on your umbrella for leagues! I may have mentioned umbrellas.

Building - My husband has done most of that so far, but what I've seen of it is there are lots of options, you can place down a sort of ""hologram"" of each thing before you commit so you can see if you like how you've laid stuff out, and the finished results look great. The basic box house of stone he built with ROUND WINDOWS! ROUND! is easily the nicest shelter we've ever had in all of the many games we've played. I've seen some pictures of bigger builds and I am really looking forward to doing more with this.

Character models/NPCs - These are fine, if a bit to get used to, I get they are going for a stylised look. LOTS of customisation options and fine control over pretty much every shape/body part.

Multiplayer - I've never come across a more simple and seamless multiplayer experience. No server required. Just press P,  type in a character name to invite them to your group, then Invite them to your realm. Once they hit accept they are pulled directly to you (or possibly your estate cairn). You are then free to adventure together or go your separate ways as you please. If you log off, so long as they dont leave your realm they can stay and play in it to their hearts content. Even if they log off, so long as they didnt jump back to their own estate cairn in another realm, or portal away to another realm, when they log back on they'll still be in your realm. If they do leave for another realm and you want to play together again just Invite them back again, or if you want them to be able to get back to your realm from another one when you're offline, you can craft an Estate Address Card which you can give to them which will allow them to portal direct to your realm. You can have up to 6 people in a party and it's as simple and quick as that (be careful who you let come to your realm, to avoid griefers).

A special note on Puck - I love Puck. When I saw in a review there was a ""being who guides you through the beginning of your adventure"" I was sure I was going to hate it. Most games that have an ""advisor"" or ""tutorial character"" end up with them being irritating, borderline moronic, and they treat you like you're as dumb as a box of rocks. Not Puck. Puck is elegant AF. Puck mainlines literature for breakfast and he ain't gonna slow his roll for you, so eat your dictionary and keep up. As a Fae, Puck is innately better than you, inconceivably more powerful, and has been around long enough to finesse the finer parts of throwing shade with god-tier class - one gem of his so far which I failed to screenshot the first time round, so incensed was I ; ""How far you've come, and yet how little you possess. Is it an ascetic purity that keeps thee bound to such homely presentation?"" How absolute dare!

And this is before they make it better!",1708649449,1708799020,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Great game so far, unless you struggle with simple concepts like what Early Access is, what Survival Games entail, and why minimum system requirements exist.

The devs have already stated that, based on feedback, they are making an offline mode a priority so we can move on from that as well.

And now on to my ramble:

Nightingale is a proc gen survival game with a Victorian gaslamp setting that looks fantastic.
The start can be a bit to wrap your head around, and it takes a bit for the complexity of systems like crafting and placement of equipment takes off.  You have to work for your QoL upgrades, they are not handed to you right out the gate.

You can let friends come and go from your hone world, even if you aren't onlibe, which us a neat touch.  It's great to be able to show off builds and such and not have to worry about schedules lining up.  Adulting and all that.

A couple notes for beginners.  If you let a follow have an axe they will wage an unending war on every tree they see.  Perhaps a tree fell on their family and wiped them out, leaving them as the lone survivor, swore to vengeance... I dunno.  Take away tools and give them a pure weapon.

You can have only one active respite.  This is your home you can quick travel back to.  Later you'll be able to add a portal so you can easily travel to other realms from your backyard.  So in your starting realm find a nice scenic location to set up show.

Workstations are limited to how many augmentations they can benefit from.  Thus means you'll eventually want to set up different rooms/buildings for different crafting as there are often mire augmentations than slots.  

Craft from chest is coming in the future.  Put inventory controls to good use, your follower is indifferent about what quality of items they use for Building and Fuel, so put the goid stuff in chest they aren't allowed to access.

I enjoy playing open world exploration / crafting games solo and with friends so I was really looking forward to a new and unique entry in the genre. Unfortunately, the survival/crafting genre is pretty saturated right now with newish releases (Enshrouded, Palworlds, etc...) and a lot of established options (V-Rising, Valheim, etc..). Imo, Nightingale fails to distinguish itself in any meaningful way, and in several ways, it is actually worse than most of it's competition. 

The game looks pretty good. I like the art style. Conceptually, it seems fun. However, those were the only positives I took from my short time with the game. 

When farming for resources, I never saw a prompt showing what type of material I was picking up (maybe I missed it) so you basically have to grab whatever you see and then check your inventory. There's also little to no indication what each weapon/tool is in your quick bar. Some, like the knife, are obvious, but I couldn't tell the difference between the stone ax and stone pickax at first. 

The crafting itself was fine. I thought the menu was okay at best. Usable, but not great. 

The weapon/combat system needs the most work, imo. From what I could tell, the weapon swap system is pretty standard on keyboard, but if you play with a controller, which I did, trying to swap weapons was cumbersome. It was particularly frustrating when swapping items was necessary. For example, I would use the ax to kill a animal type enemy and then I'd have to use the D-Pad to switch to the knife to collect materials from the animal. 

The controls are setup so that there are two quick swap inventory. One for each of the player's hands (some items require both hands). You use the left and right arrows on the D-Pad to switch your gear. For example, if you had a knife in your left hand and you wanted to switch to your ax, also in your left hand inventory, then you had to press left on the D-Pad to cycle through the list of available gear assigned to your left hand. The same was true for whatever gear was assigned to your right hand. There was no way to cycle backward. It was forward through every item until you reached the one you wanted every time. I've never seen a system like this and probably for good reason as it is pretty terrible. I'm sure you can optimize the setup, but still it was frustrating enough to note here.   

All-in-all, I did not play it for that long so maybe it gets better. I felt the game was just too flawed in the foundational aspects of the game to keep it long-term. Building was not fun it was frustrating. Combat was okay, but not great. There are just too many good alternatives right now to put time and money into this one, Imo.",1708798486,1708798486,False,2,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

For 10 hours I kept trying to give it a chance, and in the end I just feel bored.
The technical issues don't matter, no point in mentioning them because they'll eventually be fixed and ironed out, but the entire gameplay loop (And I did watch late/end game videos to confirm) is basically the same as the first few hours. You never actually feel like you're playing the game, you just feel like you're desperately trying to scrounge enough component and resources to qualify to play the game except you never qualify to play the game, you just have to scrounge more. In my opinion, gear scores belong in MMOs and ARPGs, they don't belong in survival games, I don't feel like I'm doing anything of value trying to grind out the next tier of currency to have just enough to turn a piece of gear I'm using a slightly different color with a slightly different number.
Because of this, and extremely strict onboarding process which can take days of gameplay, you burn out very quickly. You cannot sequence break. You cannot stop the ""story"" to go to the side and find some epic recipe or item that will make you feel rewarded, hell, you can't go off to the side at all. The game starts you off and tells you to craft your first set of gear, but it doesn't matter it's your first set of gear because it is the ONLY set of gear you can get and the ONLY set of gear you will have for the next dozen hours. Then the game sends you to the next island where you're told to take one of those pieces of gear you made and make its number slightly higher. Then you're returned back to the previous map where you're told to make the other pieces of gear number slightly higher so you can go get the next card to go to the next island where you'll presumably be told to make the number slightly more higher than it was higher the last time you made it higher. It all feels so mindless and pointless. 
You cannot stop here. They've spent all this time touting and bragging about the portal system, but the game doesn't let you open a different portal and run off to do something else to decompress at this point, 10 hours in and this is the ONLY track you have available to you. This single tiny island to farm tiny green orbs to get your white gear to be green gear to do the same on the next island. 
I'll probably try this game again in a few patches, I think the artstyle is interesting and gameplay has potential if it's ever actually presented to you as something you choose to do rather than just as a thing you're forced to do.

I have been following it closely as it seemed like ""innovation"" in the survival genre. I never post reviews, but I have to in this case because what they have done here is totally unacceptable IMO. I received beta access to this game and played it during that time. While it was in beta there were a ton of issues with the gameplay and I assumed that those would be fixed before release (the  beta was last year for me). Now that the game was released I was pretty hopeful for this game being of a much higher quality since they had around 9 months since my beta period to fix ""core issues"" that make the game basically unplayable. 

Purchased the game today and hop in and start. First thing I noticed is that sprinting does not appear to be working, so I think to myself maybe its because im still in the ""tutorial"" phase of the game. That was not the case at all. I have found that it appears to only work when pressing ""shift"" to sprint about 10% of the time if your lucky (and no I am not out of stamina btw). As frustrating as it was to move at a snail pace without sprinting working, I continued on. So I hit the part where you have to kill the enemy monsters and they drop loot. Well here we go again with something not working. When the items drop on the ground I spend about 10 seconds circling it just trying to pick it up because it won't show me the option to hit ""e"" to pick up. In addition to that running through the map and hitting ""e"" as you run past the items laying on the ground rarely ever works (this always works in other survival games such as ark).

Moral of the story is I spent less than an hour in the game because at a ""core"" level this game is broken. There is no use in me investing any additional time in a game that is such low quality on ""core"" mechanics that should have been prioritized after the beta was done. This is a release to capture money on a game so they can further develop it and get paid while doing so. 

We as a gaming community should not be accepting this level of quality out of a game that they are taking our hard earned money for. If the game was ""incomplete"" for endgame and its in early access then that I find acceptable, but this nonsense of half developed games to go into early access we have to make sure that we let developers know we are not accepting it any longer. We have to hold these companies accountable for releasing a quality product that is function.

Let's use Palworld as an example. Does the game have issues that need to be addressed? yes. Does the game need more endgame content? yes. However, when you look at how much better of an experience it is at a core level (all of you keys actually work). There is no disputing that this game is about 5% the quality of that game. We should be expecting that we receive games of this quality, where you can actually play a game.

Game has so many broken elements, missing images for items, terrible AI, ugly a** faces for most characters, horrendous combat, soul crushing grind, badly implemented building mechanics, ugly hobo clothes (that immediately replace your cool starter outfit) they have you wear for waaaay too long (which they know from the looks of the twitch drops being clothes haha), a mess of a UI and the offline mode can't get here soon enough (disconnects, lag, long load times, etc...) and oh so much more.
Will change it back to barely a thumbs up if they address at least a couple of these.

First off: BEWARE of game breaking bug. Some people, me included (new character, didn't like how ugly the first one was), cannot finish the tutorial as the last portal just doesn't open after defeating the mobs that spawn. Basically you can't finish the tutorial. This is EA, sure, but COME ON, this is really bad even for EA holy...
And the current fix? Create new characters and hope that the new ones get to have a portal. Maybe a way to get people to get past the refund time limit? Who truly knows, because this happens at the end of the ""tutorial"" of all places.
(EDIT: Managed to bypass that but on my third character, but some have reported that making new characters has not let them bypass this terrible bug)


EDIT: holy moly, I got banned from the discussion forum because I quoted some guy continuously vehemently insulting some other user and simply said ""you need help"" (and pointing out that a part of what they said was funny due to irony). They were highly aggressive and insulted the other person (who criticized the game slightly, barely) and I was banned for not even insulting or saying anything remotely bad.
I literally just said ""you need help"" and then pointed out that the example they used made little sense, and then I finished that short 1.5 sentence long post by saying that them saying  ""understand??? Fuck me, you are dumb"" following that jumbled example was funny.
All I said was that it was funny, I pointed out that exclaiming some jumbled mess of a sentence followed by ""understand"" (which they said unironically along with insults) was funny (due to irony of course).
That's it, that's all I said. I got banned from that one thing, that one post.

I understand them stretching the rules to ban me, sure whatever, happens to many people in real life too, so why not in an easily censored online forum, whatever, that's life... but you know what's funny? That other guy isn't even banned for actually having insulted people and spammed the discussion board with attacks, venom and hate (which I only dumbly responded to once... the one i'm talking about here).
The moderators are lost causes for this game, no joke. Be on the side of deranged white knight fanatics or avoid the forums, you've been warned (i'm ""recommending"" this game, though barely (read the review if you want to know more), but Jesus i'm not blind to the plethora of issues plaguing this EA title).



Main review:

Yeaaah... I'm not exactly a fan of lagging while playing single player just because I need to be online all the time...
This was a bold decision on their part... A bad one, but bold nonetheless.

And boy oh boy are characters plain ugly. I decided to make a female character because they at least looked less like boiled potatoes that were dropped on the floor a few too many times... though not much better. If they wanted to make them british that much then they should have let us go even more bonkers with the crooked teeth slider (I know they want this to have a british feel, but man, shots fired with that slider).

Instantly felt janky too. Very much an EA title in how unpolished it can feel, much more so than other recently released EA titles (Man, enshrouded feels like a completed and perfectly polished game by comparison which, cards on the table, it is NOT... even if it is very very good)

Currently can only barely recommend it as it is. Probably follow the development, sure, but wait for a few fixes and more video reviews before you truly decide to buy it... I would even tell you to avoid it for a while. I am just a survival craft ADDICT (who completes games way too fast. I've always been good at games, my only skill.... my worthless and unused one and only skill in life that serves no purpose except making me burn through games way too quickly, taking away potential enjoyment time...) looking for his next fix, don't take me as an example to follow and maybe wait for this game to be fleshed out and for them to add a god damned offline mode, holy hell this is 2024.

The portals certainly are an interesting take, but currently too janky to risk going above the 2 hour mark for many (understandably). Some games I sometimes go ""Ah, screw it, i'll just keep the game and play it a bit more, it'll likely get way better and it's already pretty fun"", but this one? not as much, though not terrible either... I hesitated a LOT, unlike enshrouded where I was instantly sold and spent hours just building stuff (building is important for me in these games since I blow through the other content way too fast).",1708465459,1708796995,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Much to explore, craft, learn, and conquer. Diverse biomes, terrains, crafting, puzzles, flora and fauna, and a pretty nifty weather system.

PROS:
-Beautiful biomes to explore
-Decent, if repetitive, puzzles
-Fun movement with ""Mary Poppins"" like umbrella and climbing picks.
-Pretty deep and meaningful crafting
-Play alone or Co-Op

CONS-
-Server crashes from time to time
-No ""offline mode"" (yet, developer has heeded the feedback and is working on this)
-Bugs (it's early development, stop being an asshat)
-Incomplete character creation system (again, early access)
-Character models don't reflect the same detail as the environment (...early...access)

I would give this a solid 6/10, with it inching higher as they implement more and fix bugs.

Always online?  I'm not a fan, but I get it.  It's not a dealbreaker for me, but I'd prefer to only have to worry about load times on my SSD as opposed to that and my internet connection to generate the realms.

As with all early access games, it is a work in progress.  Comments on the industry trend of releasing unfinished games aside, there's a LOT of game here, and what's there is quite fun for me.  It scratches the exploration itch, wandering through a Fae forest and suddenly finding a piece of wrecked industrial-age machinery or a crashed (I'm guessing) airship.  I even chose to build my house in a specific spot because of the way the sun hit tip of an immense mast of one such wreck poking through the treeline.  

I've traversed a couple of realms so far, only two beyond the tutorial.  The worlds are beautiful, the creatures interesting.  It's pretty easy to see that many use the same animation set, such as the green and pink quadruped 'plant deer' (as they look to me), flock and run around like the deer in my respite realm.

Crafting is close, but not there.  I've run into some missing icons, and am slowly starting to understand what they were going for.  Crafting as a whole is almost entirely based on specific tables for specific jobs, and there are *many*.  Everything from leather tanning to upgrades, enchanting, mortar for grinding, masonry and smelting have their own tables.  Tables don't have to be manned to run, so you can fire and forget recipes at multiple tables while you're crafting.  You cannot (at least that I've found) queue up multiple recipes at one station, so you collect your craft and start a new one.  As a side note when starting out, build a small angler storage at each crafting table to store the materials used at that table.  Makes things pretty easy to stay organized.

Combat is about what I expect in a survivalcraft style game.  The enemies have been reasonably varied so far, and have both been ridiculously easy and infuriatingly difficult.  In the latter case, a fae tower presented me with a group of two floating enemies and two melee with dual swords.  The floaters were easily dispatched at range, but I found myself consistently dead within a few hits from the sword wielders.  Their attacks seemed to hit extremely hard and they were so fast it was very nearly impossible to get at a decent enough range from them to heal without them lunging and killing me.  Bosses, of which I've fought two, are complete sponges.  The second had a gimmick of shielded drones, floor traps and a ranged attack.  I'm not sure if it would be feasible to melee it when the drones' AI causes them to simply swarm you.  I admittedly cheesed their pathing and plinked the boss to death with a slingbow.  All that to say, I also could have spent more time upgrading my gear and it likely would have made things much easier.

Healing requires equipping the item in your off hand and using it, which I understand from a 'realism' perspective.  Combat at the moment almost requires having a single handed weapon and healing in offhand, because those (like me) using two-handed weapons have to swap to heal.  It makes sense on paper, but it really doesn't make sense in practice.  I'd rather see the items auto-used when I press the hotkey for them, where I very quickly swap and chug a potion or use a salve, and my character auto-swaps back.  Being able to do so while sprinting would be doubly useful.

Inventory management is a staple for the genre, and is no different here.  There are LOTS of materials, raw and intermediate.  Some of the design choices here are curious to me.  You have different quality of materials (such as animal hides) and they are also split by source.  So in the case of hides, leather, meat, and bones, you can have a basic animal meat (prey) and basic animal meat (predator).  If you get a high-quality hide, it is stacked separately from prey and predator hides.  Each of these needs it's own inventory slot.  I don't mind having multiple kinds of leather, or hides, but this feels a bit excessive.  Low level creatures should drop the same 'meat' and the same 'hide' with chances (or maybe specific creatures would drop the high quality stuff).  

Much like when I saw the trailer, I'm still immensely excited to see where this develops.  I'm curious to see where the next realms take me.

A few pieces of advice:
Read! So many complaints can be solved by simply reading what's on the screen.
When in doubt of how to do the next objective, check the journal - it often outlines *precisely* what you need to do.
Extinguish your fires.
Hold shift while dragging to split stacks.  The number you choose is the number that goes where you're dragging.
Resting is vital.  Stamina drain and max are affected *severely* by your rest state.

I am changing that today after another 15 hours in  to a thumbs up for a variety of reasons. I am however keeping a few key critiques. First the character creator is really bad. The lineage idea is very nice and intuitive however the characters are just plain ugly! No matter what i do I cannot make a good looking character. I don't expect it to have the look of say a black desert character from that creator but come on this is a new game and the characters look like they skipped a few steps on the evolutionary ladder.. just bad. 

Second the UI is very plain and makes the game look ""Cheap"" I would say in comparison to the beauty of the world itself it is out of place. I get it is early access and many items still do not even have Pics attached just the N Nightingale placeholder but hopefully it gets a bit of an update. 

What made me change my review? Two things first and foremost Seeing the Dev team took all of our comments about the bad Ui  the ""No offline mode"" and server issues and responded positively to the community feedback with a letter saying they understand , agree, and are going to work on it!! WOW Its refreshing seeing them listen and respond. Something I think not enough do in the gaming industry today.  2. Exploring the world itself taking my time to dig in seeing all it had to offer and the beauty of it.  This game has a beautiful world no matter the realm you choose it is just amazing! 

 If the Devs follow through on what they are saying and the game continues to grow throughout early access it could be very good.

Keep watching and in 6 months see what the progress looks like. This hurts me because this has been my most anticipated game release since they dropped the trailer. Here's why I still think we should support the developers.

1. The setting and narrative. 
Nightingale has possibly the most interesting setting of all time. A mix of 1800's gas lamp and ominous folklore fairytale fiction allows for rich depth and possibility. 

2. The graphics. Up close the graphics are muddy and unrefined but the skyboxes and distant shores are promising. seeing shimmering water from a distance is some of the best I've seen and makes looking out the window of my home feel nice. 

3. Character customization. Realistic and vivid spliced with a Tim Burton layer of ugly, and strange. The weird bone structures and facial features influenced by expressionism are distorted and exaggerated. What normally gives me uncanny valley, fits perfectly with the theme of the game.

The Following need much improvement...

1. Boring. The game opens up after about 4 hours but the gameplay loop is boring. I want to be fighting monsters, exploring and building my ultimate stronghold from the lurking dangers but the game seems to want to push you from gear score of 10, to 20 to 30. Instead of exploring, I go exactly where I need to get new recipes, the grind new materials, the craft new gear. Combat Ai is bad as enemies just run up to you, attack then move a little then attack. Very little enemy variety.

2. Quality of life: 
a. Let us pull resource directly from storage
b. let us autostack items
c. let us exit menus with tab or escape instead of having to click ""close"" with the mouse
d. show weight limit as its getting full

overall I have faith that the developers can improve and add new content and make this game as good as it's supposed to be. but right now it's a 5/10 for me.

Or how people can look at a project with as much promise as this one, being released into Early Access in a state better than the majority of titles that do so, and get hung up on things that are going to be addressed just because they're not addressed _yet_ 

Then again, I don't get a lot about the world lately. Maybe that's why I'm so enjoying escaping into a well-crafted representation of the Fae realms as a Victorian-ish scholar. *shrug*

Anyway, the true takeaway here is that if you are fan of survival crafters, and the theme looks even remotely appealing to you, this one is 100% worth a try.  They're putting a really cool new spin on the genre, and others' gripes aside, as far as I can glean from my few hours experience, the technical state of the game right now shows me that the studio has the chops to bring the full vision to life.

One of the major issues I encountered was the terrible teleporting system. It felt clunky and inconsistent, making it difficult to navigate the game world effectively. This lack of smooth teleportation greatly affected the overall gameplay experience. 

Another significant drawback was the lack of direction in the game. I found myself frequently lost and unsure of what to do next. The absence of clear objectives or guidance made it frustrating to progress in the game. It felt like I was wandering aimlessly for hours, without any sense of accomplishment or progress. 

Despite investing a considerable amount of time into Nightingale, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I hadn't achieved much. The lack of satisfying milestones or meaningful progression left me feeling unfulfilled and disheartened. Eventually, I reached a point where I decided to turn it off and seek out something more enjoyable to play. 

While Nightingale may have had potential, the issues with its teleporting system, lack of direction, and overall lack of satisfaction hindered my enjoyment. I believe that these aspects need significant improvement to provide a more engaging and rewarding gaming experience.

Радует, что в каждом типе мира все ресурсы есть, но не в каждом они в удобной доступности. Это не плохо, дает ощущение, что у каждого мира свои преимущества и недостатки. Но когда ты бегаешь по пустыне (а именно этот мир я выбрал как домашний) в поисках растительной фибры, но вместо нее падают то семена, то какие-то фрукты, то что-то еще, то начинаешь задумываться о том, хорошим ли это было решением (особенно с учетом, что растительная фибра является ресурсом для подавляющего большинства рецептов строительства). Это не плохо, это стандартный гринд в играх, но это трата времени и постепенное угасание интереса. Конечно есть вероятность что серп скорее всего помог бы эту проблему решить, но возможно на тот момент у меня случился какой-то баг (из числа многих, которые, я уверен, исправят), поэтому с использованием серпа (нажимайте Е, а не ПКМ, не повторяйте мою ошибку) мне выпадало такое же количество фибры, как и без него. 
С этим справились, дальше случился конфуз с тем, что выбрав красивое, но не самое удачное местоположение базы на карте домашнего биома, мне понадобилось много (правда много) шкур. Они нужны для инструмента чуть лучше первоначальной палки-копалки из палеолита. Ближайшим моим источником кожи оказался.. Слон. Животное не агрессивное до тех пор, пока не попытаться запихнуть ему заточку в заднее отверстие.  Попрыгали, побегали, да и затыкали его зубочисткой. Бой был веселый, захватывающий, а главное дал немного (правда немного) шкур. Хорошо, что я догадался первым делом сделать арбалет(?) который стреляет шариками сделанными из камней. Уникальное оружие, с которым из засады при хорошем аиме можно убить слона с одного выстрела. С этого момента игра пошла значительно веселее. 
И все же игра - ад для любителей строительства, ведь чтобы получить новые рецепты надо.. да без понятия что надо сделать. Рецепты можно купить у торговцев, самые простые. Пара новых верстаков и рецепт половины куска крыши. Другие рецепты падают после решения сумасшедших головоломок. Сталкиваясь в первый момент с головоломками вы удивляетесь: ""Почему так просто? Это что, детская игра?"", а следующая головолмка заставляет бегать вас по руинам в поисках рун спрятанных за разрушаемыми стенами. При этом рун несколько и появляются они только по одной друг за другом, а это значит что вы бегаете по этажам руин снова и снова, играете в паркур по тем же самым местам, где были минуту назад, и так раз за разом, циклично. Помните, что такое безумие, да? За выполнение этой головокружительной головоломки я получил рецепт чайного набора. Спасибо. Было весело. 
Квесты в игре довольно прямолинейные, но порой приходится догадываться куда тебе нужно попасть и что сделать, особенно если ты скипаешь часть текста, читаешь по диагонали и не слушаешь дополнительную информацию которая просто раскрывает какие-то детали чего-то. А ты рано или поздно это делаешь, ведь перед этим ты бегал по пустыне/болоту/лесу и гриндил все подряд чтобы что-то построить, потом бегал за реусрсами снова, ведь твой персонаж может таскать дай бог 20 больших камней (что больше, чем в реальной жизни, но крайне мало для строительства чего-либо в игре) и желания слушать речь какого-то сомнительного персонажа, который сутками стоит на одном месте и ничего не делает в отличие от запыхавшегося тебя.. ну сами понимаете. 
Но это все лирика. Все эти проблемы просты, с ними можно жить, мириться, особенно если в тебе есть немножко упорства. А вот что мне действительно не понравилось, так это плавание. Персонаж может сражаться с полчищами врагов, летать на зонтике, сменить фрак на самотканые одежды пещерного человека даже не скривив лицо, но лезть в воду - гиблое дело. Персонаж не умеет не только плавать, он и из воды вылезает черт знает как. И как я заметил, вес не влияет на перемещение в воде (хотя может это тоже очередной баг?). 
Чуть лучше выглядит карабкание с помощью (я их называю карабкалки) двух.. ээ.. что-то вроде ледорубов, но для камней, huh? Три раза подтянуться на вертикальном камне и упасть. Уверен все это решает использованием более качественного снаряжения, но на первых этапах игра абсолютно бесполезное приспособление (ладно, вру, в некоторых очень специфичных местах где просто допрыгнуть не сможете - они спасут ваш день, но не более). Тем более, что если вы не можете куда-то залезть - постройте там фундамент нужной высоты. 
Другой проблемой игры (на мой взгляд) является обилие вариаций одних и тех же предметов. Та же растительная фибра от разных растений не стакуется вместе, а занимает разные слоты в инвентаре. Это проблематично при крафтах, но (слава богу) не принципиально при строительстве. И не только она, разные чернила, разные шкуры, разные камни, всевозможная руда. И вот так у вас инвентарь забивается хламом который вы в итоге не можете куда-то пристроить, разве что наделать десятки сундуков и превращать в эссенцию лишние предметы, если их не четное количество.

В целом игра увлекательная, интересная, с изрядным количеством проблем и недочетов, как и преимуществ. Ждем новых патчей с надеждами и терпением.
______________________
Если вы только начинаете игру, то вот небольшой совет:
Ознакомительные миры вам дают просто для ознакомления и изучения каких-то простейших механик строительства и крафта. Но в этих мирах есть все же сундучки, головоломки и минимум каких-то наград. Можно все это пропускать, ведь весь скрытый лут можно будет найти после и в своих мирах, и в мирах новых, а потом и вовсе скрафтить. Но это на ваше усмотрение, ведь потратить времени в игре вам еще придется немало.
Попав в свой мир забудьте о строительстве базы - прямым ходом идите к торговцу. Где он? Да кто бы его знал. В пустыне мой торговец стоял возле данжа выглядящего как недоделанная пирамида. 
По пути к нему собирайте все подряд и все что лишнее - превращайте в эссенцию, ведь торговец будет просить ее у вас за рецепты крафтов и все остальное. 
Нашли торговца? Рядом с ним персонаж дающий квест, а еще очень грустный наемник. Поговорите с этим грустным человеком и по его просьбе постройте ему пару кроватей (палки и фибра, не забывайте иметь их в кармане всегда). Построили - нанимайте. Этот наемный работник будет рубить деревья когда ему взбредет в голову, не собирать бревна (а зачем), а самое главное - сражаться с вашими врагами и приоритетно воскрешать вас даже в гуще сражения.",1708788564,1708788564,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Realm portals take up to 2–3 minutes to load, based on how stable the server is and how good your internet connection is. It wouldn't be a huge issue if portals between realms wouldn't go into standby after a couple of minutes. This quickly adds up the more often you traverse between realms, e.g., to store resources or upgrade gear in your home realm. Additionally, you'll get disconnected if you are afk… Sometimes there is a delay in building, cutting trees, etc. I'm not quite sure if this is a code issue or if the game is waiting for a server response.

The combat, user interface, gathering of resources, and crafting are currently clunky. Crafting stations don't consider materials from nearby containers. There is no option to quickly deposit items into a container or nearby containers. A falling tree will destroy any building in its way instead of just damaging it (at least the stone-based ones), which is a terrible design choice in my opinion.

There are quests and bosses and all kinds of puzzles and combat encounters.

The only-online thing is justified considering this game has a Dark Souls type connection system that lets you visit public realms and meet randoms. There's no server hosting fee either.

You can invite up to 5 friends to your party but I don't know if there's a hard cap on players in a server/realm. If you want your friends to have access to your home realm while you're offline you can give them a craftable address card, which is handy. Or they can set their home to your realm too which my friend and I did.

The base building mechanics are a bit confusing at first, but it didn't take long to get a basic house set up and there are multiple styles of building you can unlock early in to the game.

There are no XP levels, just gear score (You don't drop equipped items on death). So you don't have that extra grind to manage.

The crafting system is easy to pick up and complex if you want to get in to the min-maxing of gear that you create, making it fun without creating needless complexity for those that don't want to pursue it. 

There are only 3 main biomes so far but there are multiple effects that apply to realms that transform them both visually and mechanically so they can look and feel quite different, despite being a forest, desert or swamp. I think more biomes are planned for the future.

There are a few bugs here and there, but it's been a much smoother experience than most early access games, so far. Every time we visit a new realm there's something new that makes us stop to check it out... Different enemies, new puzzles, new landmarks e.t.c.

Definitely recommend this if you like the co-op elements of survival games and I can't wait to see what content they release next.",1708785785,1708785785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Characters are fucking hideous. Your clothes are fucking hideous. You look like a hobo most of the time.

Terrible quest design, like telling you to acquire items you've never seen before 
Completely online means you're going to wait to play your fucking solo game, but it's not the worst, no, you're also going to have to wait when you jump realms because the system is trying to look for a server to handle the realm you're going to.

I booted up this game and was immediately enchanted. As a reader of Susanna Clarke, I 'got it' right away. As I am playing, I am excited, not only in the world itself, but the graphics, and the entirely novel and deep systems it brings to the table. Everything about the game both surprised and enchanted me. 

Then I look on Steam and see reviews are mixed. How so? Fortunately, most of these are of the 'mummy, I've peed my pants' school of criticism. However, there are some genuine observations too - should you have the will to dig for them. Yes I would like to play offline (but guess what? This is being implemented.). Yes the menus are a bit clunky - I cannot tell you how many times I have fought an enemy holding just an umbrella! I think the menus will have some reaching for the refund button, but as soon as you become used to them - they are just fine. Yes the crafting takes time - but as a veteran of crafting games, I have played a lot worse. I remember one game where you had to craft individual bricks to make a house! Now, I would not go that far, but (for me) it reduces the immersion if crafting is too simple. *Understand the systems* before complaining. Just load up your crafting stations and set them running, go to bed  - hey ho, everything is ready when you wake up. Combat *is* a little clunky at the moment, but if I wanted it harder, I would up the difficulty - seems easy to me. 

Here is a thought - the game is clearly defined as being in Early Access. By now, we should all know what that means. If you don't here goes: You have bought the game with the full knowledge that it is not a finished product (moan at yourself, rather than the devs if you did not understand this). Then, the whole point of early access is for the devs to get feedback from the community, and to use this feedback to develop the game to be the game that the community wants to play. May I humbly suggest that positive feed back is more effective than 'boy have I had a bad day at work' style griping.

I cannot imagine the amount of resources, time and hard-won skill went into this game. For my part, I always feel the urge to celebrate such things. I feel this adds more niceness than squirting out a dribble of bile. I want to acknowledge any achievements made, thank those that provide me with pleasure, and encourage those that do to continue working. 
Here is the thing - I am glad this was an instant purchase for me, and that I did not look at the overall score of 'mixed', as this is a signal to me that perhaps I should pass. I am not the only one that make decisions on this premise - in an increasingly toxic world, perhaps I need to review my stance? The obvious result of 'mixed' is that less people buy the game - That the devs get less funding and eventually get into financial difficulties and stop work on the game - or, as we have seen far too many times in the past year - have to close the studio and seek other work. So, if you hate the game (or your life) so much, this is certainly an effective tool to consider in that act of killing it. 

That out of the way - I thank the devs for providing me we an immersive and  unique experience, and give me an alternative world to counteract the terrible one I find myself in. It is the most excited I have been in a game for a long, long time, and a game I see myself getting lost in for years. 

Mixed yes - but a mix of pleasure and appreciation.",1708784743,1708785031,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

There seems to be a misconception that people hate always online and that's the reason for the bad reviews, but it's simply not true. The issue is mainly that the online is just annoying. Loading between realms takes around 2 minutes which isn't game breaking, but it's annoying. I have this game installed on a SSD, but every single time you spend 2-3 minutes waiting on server... While I find the various online issues really annoying, I don't think they warrant a negative review, especially since the devs have announced that they plan to add an offline mode. 

To be clear, I didn't give this game a bad review because of the online, although I think it's a fair reason to give a negative review since it affects people's ability to play the game. 

Now, let me explain why I'm giving this game a bad review. But first, let me tell you what's good about the game. 

This game is beautiful and the backstory is really interesting. The creatures are cool and the crafting is extremely indepth. Seriously, the crafting gives you a lot of ways to customize the stats of almost every item. I also like the way the building system works. You can place phantom designs and then fill them with mats when you have them. Also, you can move already built structures, this includes chests with items in them, THANK GOD. I mean this is amazing. Have you ever played a survival game and had to first take out all the items from a chest before moving the chest? It's awful right! Well in this game, you can just move the chest with all the items inside. 

Speaking of good stuff, the survival mechanics are actually pretty good. They're what you'd expect from a survival game, but adds a little depth to them without making them too complicated. 

Now, the reason for the bad review....

1) Repetition. Unfortunately, this game is really really repetitive. Survival games tend to have a loop, but this game's loop is unfortunately kind of bland and copy-pasted. Most survival games have you grind materials from biome 1 to go to biome 2. Then you grind upgraded versions of your tools and go to biome 3, then to biome 4, then biome 5, then biome 6 and so on. Each biome is usually different and completely unique to the last. 

This game does the same thing, but it only has 3 biomes, and you see all the different biomes within the tutorial. They try to vary this experience by making biomes randomly procedurally generated so each time is unique, but it just isn't that unique. The forest is still the forest and the desert is still the desert. After tier 1, you're just looping back to forest/desert/swamp over and over again. 

Speaking of repetitiveness, you have to complete point of interests to get currency to buy recipes for the next tier. But the POI's are all basically the same and a lot of them are just kind of meh where you kill 1 wave of braindead AI or press 3 switches sitting next to each other to solve a puzzle. None of them really feel unique to the biomes and after you've done a couple, you've seen it all, even if the format is very slightly changed. 

2) Crafting is TEDIOUS. The crafting is really indepth which is cool, but my god is it tedious. You have raw mats which have various different types and tiers for the same basic raw mat. Then you need to craft it into a basic ingredient to craft other stuff, but you have tons of different work benches and everything takes quite a lot of real time to craft. There's not crafting from storage so you're constantly looking through hundreds of different mats to find what you want, and then when you find the raw mat that you want, you need to find all the other raw mats too bc each of the same raw mat gives different attributes. 

Like I said, the crafting is really indepth and awesome, but it's just not streamlined and it's a serious pain in the ass at the moment. The crafting and inventory management is such a chore that it often fatigues me while i'm trying to craft stuff and I just take a break from the game for a while. 

3) Combat is extremely MEH. The combat is bland. The ai is bad, you don't need to block or dodge, you can simply just strafe and backstep and never get hit. It's also just really simple, you swing until you don't have stamina, and then just strafe/backstep until you have it again. The only time you might die is when there is a swarm of enemies, simply bc you might get hit from the side or something. Combat is a little more fun like this but you rarely run into swarms of enemies. Also, the combat just doesn't feel responsive. The feedback from getting hit just doesn't feel like much and the attack feedback, especially for headshots feels extremely arcadey, it's kind of a weird and out of place.

People seem to like the ranged combat, but so far I'v found ranged combat kind of boring. I think the heartshots for animals is extremely awesome, but other than that it's just slow, clunky, and doesn't feel that great.

4) Bugs. I know it's Early access, but there are some gamebreaking bugs that just suck. I almost refunded the game when I first started because I couldn't finish the tutorial due to a glitch where the final portal doesn't work. While I wouldn't really care about that, apparently this bug was fairly well known and common in earlier betas before the game released into Early access and it just wasnt' fixed. 

Some of this stuff can be fixed like adding new biomes to the game, but I feel like some things like combat, repetitive point's of interest, and crafting might not really improve that much. 

The game has opened up and become a little more fun after unlocking the first new tier of realms, but also, it kind of sheds like on the repetitiveness of the game. I have high hopes for this game, but I think it's really undercooked. 

My recommendation is wait to buy. Give it 1-2 years and see how the devs respond to feedback and expand the game.",1708784790,1708784790,False,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

It's gorgeous and the world building is top notch.  Building is very well done (though I'd love to know how long we are expected to play before unlocking more building styles.).  Crafting is involved and intricate (though that's not obvious in the first dozen or so hours).

It's not all roses.  The inventory system pretty hard to use, not least because your inventory and all containers like to shuffle the contents around every time you change anything.  The ability to pull resources from linked crates at stations would be appreciated too.

The hirelings are more of an annoyance than a help most of the time.  I advise removing the axe they have and giving them something else (remember to equip it) so that you don't have to hear and watch them deforest every space you pause at.  They make good pack mules, but that's about it.  I'm hoping for the ability to give basic commands (""harvest here"", ""follow me"", ""stop standing in the fire, you unbelievable muppet"", that kind of thing.)

Some of the basic keybinds need to be explained int he tutorial too.  Quick tip - H to holster your main and off hand weapon.  X to enter building mode to that you can move/remove building pieces and items without destroying and rebuilding them.

But when all is said and done, I am really enjoying the game right now. It's not everyone - I adore Puck and his dialog, for example, whereas some find him wordy and annoying.

In February 2024, does Nightngale have a clunky UI? Yep. Does it have a terrible inventory management system, particularly when it comes to crafting? You betcha. Does the enemy AI need work? Tons.

And yet, I'll give it a positive review, because those things are very likely going to get fixed quickly. Why? Dev quality / responsiveness. The Nightngale devs are hungry for feedback. And if you look at the differences between releases in the Beta phase, you know that they ACT on the feedback, while retaining their vision of the world.

That brings us to theme. In this category, they shouldn't touch a THING. The theme is amazing. It's unlike any survival / builder game you've ever experienced. Everything comes down to a flexible gaslamp fantasy shell. The worlds you travel to are modified by the tarot-like cards you use to create and modify them with. The gear you use is modified at it's core by the kind of ore and enhancements you imbue it with. The same axe you build with copper at the start is a completely different beast when built with platinum and enhance it with magic in the endgame.

So I can forgive the (hopefully) temporary warts we all see in Nightingale. It's Early Access, and I trust them to fix these things. The POTENTIAL of this game, the ceiling that you can put on the experience, is incredibly high. They invested in great voice acting, amazing graphics, and a core game play experience that can be expanded rapidly.

If the UI, inventory, and AI issues are being actively and iteratively improved by the end of April 2024, this is going to be a winner. Until then, it's your choice whether or not you want to experience a more rocky version of the game.

My computes is less than 1 year old and is capable or running games like Baldur's Gate 3 on max settings with no issue. However, with this game, I had to lower the settings to medium in order to reduce framerate issues and to stop my computer from sounding like a military jet engine. This isn't a deal breaker for me per se, but I do hope developers will work towards better optimization and performance throughout early access.

Yes its early access and there are some bugs and jank, but if you dont like that, wait for the full release. As for the online component, at least this game is doing online connectivity for something different. Each portal or gate you jump through is a new server or connection, and its nice seeing stuff in the other realms that I know I didn't create but were there by others. Still haven't run into another realmwalker yet, but its nice to know that I could.  

I dont understand the hate - this game has potential in spades and I am having a blast. If someone told me I could get a stargate hopping survival game set it a fantasy realm, I would have said where do I sign? This game is fantastic so far - I am loving it! It has the right level of grind, it's a bit more complex and there isn't that much hand holding but that's early access! And there are plenty of wikis available to research what you need. I really look forward to seeing what the devs do with this game and am excited to jump into something as fresh as this.",1708781721,1708781765,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The different creatures are very interesting in their design, and i was pretty happy they were not all the usual ""agro on sight"" monsters. (Some are, though there's some sense to it. Boars will agro if you get too close to their babies, Giant Grasshopers because they're hungry fellas, I imagine, and the murder kangaroos in the swamps ? Well, It'd be plain weird if they didn't try to murder you)

Crafting is interesting, though time consuming given the necessity to roam further and further to gather materials (Though crafting and upgrading the backpack fixes this somewhat, and there are Minor cards you can apply to a realm that increase harvest of specific resources), given theres a lot needed to set up your house. 

The Building, while it does have a limit system, is 300 Sections of major elements per building (I'm building a base atop a Desert pillar in my home realm, By not connecting the Giant Stairs up ot the top (100/300 limit already), I started out with 0/300 for building the actual temple !)

The Base Building isn't as granular as fellow Survival Crafting EA title Enshrouded, but the worlds you walk through feel so much more alive than those in Enshrouded.

The AI needs a bit of polish, and whatever server issues exist need fixing to stabilize the experience (though i never encountered any).

I really hope they implement a full-on bestiary, perhaps with entries unlocking based on discovering a creatures nesting site or observing their habits (also, I'd love dedicated routines and habits for the different creatures, to give them even more personality).

What I Liked:
This game is a dream come true, it legit hits a lot of right spots that a many games did (and did not) before and combines them in a very original way, it has a really tasty immersion and a very customizable experience: even thou I'm a fan of hardcore difficulties I managed to play with a very casual friend and my little brother and we all had a blast without feeling over nor underwhelmed.

What I Disliked:
We've been having a LOT of connectivity issues like lagging and getting disconnected from our Realms (even thou we play a lot of online games without these issues so it doesn't seem like it'd be our connections). And QoL.. like not being able to close things with ESC or not having like an Alt + Scrollwheel to change from item 6 to 0 are the biggest offenders hahahahhaha

Not only is the combat stale and uninspiring, but it takes forever to do anything. Im not joking. By the time you get out of the tutorial and can fully understand how lame the game is, its already too late to get a refund. Thats how slow it is. 

You are probably wondering why its pointless. Well, its mostly because there is zero character progression. No advancement (other than crafting new equipment) to keep you motivated. In addition to no story or real quests (which is standard for this genre of game). Why should I care to slog through the slow pacing of the world and gameplay, and endure the vanilla and boring combat, when I get nothing from it?

Yea... not a good game at all IMO. Maybe in six months it might be, since it is early access after all. But im not getting my hopes up.

I'm getting so sick of companies releasing their uncooked trash and calling it E.A.  How do you launch a game in this kind of state and think it is reasonable to call it E.A.?

Where has game development gone?  Where has quality gone?  Where have developers that care about their products and their reputation gone?

This game has simple stuff that doesn't work in it, like nearly 1/4th of all the icons are missing.... This is like a couple hour fix at max.

Then you have things like half the seeds that you can plant don't work.  The growing system exists and the seeds exist but half of the seeds don't grow....  So this isn't an unfinished mechanic in the game.  This is complete and utter laziness or greed wanting money for a product that isn't finished.

Where would we be today if car manufacturers were like, hey I hope you enjoy this new E.A. car.  The brakes work some of the time.  The handle for the emergency break is there and the brake is there but we haven't gotten around to connecting the cable yet.  We'll see how things look in a few weeks.  The engine works but sometimes it won't start....

This may sound like an outlandish example but this is really the type of crap we are paying for these days.  All due to F.O.M.O.  It has grown beyond acceptable now.  The last 5 games that I have played have been E.A. titles because nothing is actually coming out finished anymore and 4 of them have been complete garbage.

Aside from these problems the game has tons of mechanics that don't work.  The follower A.I. is complete trash.  They do everything exactly opposite of what you would expect them to do.  Then tonight I had my follower of 40 hours just ""disappear"" on me.  It was carrying hours worth of harvested materials.  It completely disappeared from the map.  I teleport back to my home realm and there it stands, but it is no longer my follower.  I have to walk up and claim it again.  Upon doing so I realize that everything it was carrying is gone, including all of the gear/equipment I had made for it.

Harvesting mechanics are completely broken.  Do not enter the swamp under any circumstances.  It is the most unfinished zone and has more bugs than all the others combined.

The crafting system needs a LOT of work to be fun.  The excessive amount of menus that you have to go through and the absolute lack of information on how crafting works and the excessively convoluted upgrading system including tons of addon upgrades for work stations that come in multiple tiers and don't even work like they claim they should.

I won't get into the always online issues with the game as that has been done to death but the fact that sometimes you have to wait upwards of 5 minutes for a realm to load while you are sitting there looking at a loading screen.

There is easily 500+ hours worth of stuff wrong with this game at this point and this crap should not be allowed to be on steam and should be removed and all purchases refunded until this game is in a better state.",1708772261,1708772261,False,6,3,0.424415528774261475,0,True,False,True

I was hyped for Nightingale since it's original announcement and eagerly followed it's development. I was lucky enough to play a bit during the Stress Test shortly before release, and have been playing for hours each day since release. All in all I love the game, it took a while but I love it!

The Mechanics of the Game are very nuanced, do they need refinement? Yes, but when you slowly understand the Mechanics of the Game, Hit-boxes, and Movement the game is quite fun. Is the game perfect? By no means, and I do believe the developers need to take their time to polish and fix certain aspects of game-play, but after actually giving the game a few Hours I am excited to see how this Early Access Title develops.
Some of my pros and cons to the game are as follow:

Visually Stunning: not much to be said, but the Graphics are really beautiful as are the Vistas.

Building System: Though it needs some fine-tuning, the building system is great and lets you use your creativity to build wherever you want and the ""Auto-Complete"" feature really helps at the start.

Setting & Lore are interessting a Crafting & Survival game in a Victorian Alternate Earth with Interdimensional Stargates is an awesome Idea and is mostly translated well. The great visuals with the little backdrop you are given do help with the immersion. I do wish that certain choices like the ""Proffessions"" (Soldier, Scientist, Ect.) would give your Character different starting Boons or ""Traits"" but right now they seem to be visual differences. 

Companion: Having one really helps, though their AI def needs fine-tuning and having actual Commands for them would help, you can use them as Packmules, they will Auto Complete any Building Tasks you have if they have the Mats in their inventory, they help with PvE though sometimes very Buggy.

Crafting & Gathering: Can seem quite grindy, a tip is you can collect all the Mats dropped in your surroundings with ""E"" but it does take a while to not constantly struggle with encumbrance especially at the beginning when building your first ""House"" 
Clunky/ Janky Controls Movement (Especially in 3rd Person, and when starting the game, once you get used to it, it gets better but you can tell this game was made to be played in 1st person with 3rd person feeling more like an afterthought and that is a bit of a shame, the Character Models can look slightly off, and their movement is weird and Hunched.

Server Stability and Framerate Issues: The Disconnects I've had. Not a lot, but a few that were quite frustrating and one that basically deleted my Character. The same can be said for the Framerate, though the game mostly runs quite smoothly on my setup, from time to time, especially when my Companion is harvesting and I am maybe in the middle of a fight, the framerate will just drastically drop and the game can get laggy.


Combat can get quite monotonous, especially when your Companion is constantly Pushing over enemies. Sometimes it's hard to follow, enemy AI sometimes act weird and buggy, framerates can drop, and since there is only seemingly one enemy faction once you know how the variants move and work, and where their hit-boxes are. Ranged Weapons seem slightly off, even when ADS

All in all I do enjoy this game, and find it is worth the 30$ price tag. Would I recommend it? Though I would personally give it a yes, I do understand the mixed reception this game has gotten. I would suggest anyone interessted in this game should form their opinion based on the reviews and gameplay they have read/seen.",1708771405,1708771405,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yes, If you like Survival games and want to go away from other similar games, then go for it. The game has a potential, but has so many down merits as well at the current state of the game. These can be fixed over time. Graphically beautiful if you have good PC for it. 
Puck's voice actor(Marc Warren?) should win an award! I love his voice.

No, if you don't want to put time and effort to the game. As above mentioned, the issues do out merit the good, compared to other EA survival released in this year. Fixing combat and performance should be their main priority to fix. 
I played on hardest difficulty for fun and I defeated my first dungeon boss Fabled Automaton Knight. It was rather boring fight...
Disconnected due inactivity and then wait 3-5 min just go back in to wait for server response...

Always Online is big NO for me, but I do understand why they want it. Who knows they might remove it once full release.

Not getting the same hype and praise because 1) many genre fans like the option to play offline, which is fair. They are addressing this is as a priority.

I'm giving a positive review but only because I'd hate to see development stop, but this game..... It needs probably another year in the oven. There are plenty of things to complain about that just... don't really make sense or is completely unfinished. EVERY SINGLE THING shown in the trailer is VERY LATE GAME. We haven't seen ANY magic, only one gun, and one boss.

-Sleeping. What is the point? There is no animation for it, 'short resting' is just another bar you need to keep full and it seems so redundant, you just go to base, press E a couple times on your bed, and leave again. It doesn't buff you, it doesn't debuff you. Why even have it in the game? You might as well just tell players you encourage them to return to base sometimes, it seems absolutely pointless. Long resting is only used to skip the night and even that has no animation, just black screen then comes back. Also, night time just switches to night time in such a sudden way it seems like your game crashed to a black screen, then fades to the correct shading. Its crazy. So many simple things that just seem completely overlooked in favor of an early release.

-Crafting. It is so... Convoluted. There are so many 'augment' benches which are just... it seems supposed to be decorative benches? But they also help reduce crafting times? I'm really not even sure still. It almost doesn't explain it at all, but there are more augments than there are crafting benches it seems, and some benches use more than one, some benches only use one, so you'll end up making a few of the same augments just because the range on the benches isn't very far. Also, it's almost impossible to know which bench affects which. You have to do such a waste-of-time image comparing to see which workbench is ""tools"" and which is ""hunting"". Which one is ""blacksmith"" and which one is ""tailor"". Some benches have 'fishing' augment, and some augments give fishing, but for some reason they don't affect each other. You also have to essentially keep moving and placing down the augment to see which bench it affects, because the green lines while placing it (to show what it affects) just seems to lead to every bench or no benches. It points to warmth, lighting, and benches it affects so there are just green lines everywhere and you have no idea at a glance what it's affecting. It's insane. Also you can stack benches or chests, but they don't mention you can't move ANYTHING you stack unless you move the last item you placed first. It's almost like a manual undo button, it's crazy. My friends and I were confused why we couldn't move a row of chests, and it's just because the last one placed needed to be moved first, then in reverse order. So ridiculous. The augments are also supposed to ""Unlock blueprints"", but they just do not. My group of friends have seemed to never unlock a blueprint to craft through placing an augment, we have only been able to unlock new buildings or benches by buying them or completing world objectives to earn them. The augments seriously seem so pointless, but they do reduce crafting time.

-The icons. Seriously? There are SO many icons that are just missing. Just a red N stamp. Not even a very basic icon for COAL or for CHITIN, even though they have good in game looks. It's so hard to try and differentiate items because they're just all a red stamped N. So lazy.

-The questing. The questing is also generally confusing. It starts out ok yknow harvest that, build this, traverse a different realm. But it seems like they wanted to encourage you to be traveling really consistently in order to unlock different realms/tiers of weapons, but also hold you back from doing so? But also you somehow end up way ahead of the objectives? I'm truly just confused a lot of the time on why I'm progressing and where I need to go. My group played for 20 hours+ before we were able to make guns because we just... Somehow fell behind the quests while staying ahead of the curve? It's a really strange thing to explain but it isn't done very well.

-The building. The building is just... bad. It's extremely basic, even though the buildings themselves can look really nice. it just always ends up being just a square room that you feel forced to build because of the amount of augments you're encouraged to build. I'm not even sure if I need all the augments, seriously. I don't know the difference or what they do because they definitely do not unlock recipes.

-The enemies. There are probably like... five variants of enemies? Each realm has some cool looking wildlife that can definitely change, but the main enemies are always the same select few and it just gets old and repetitive. 

-Unbalanced economy. Feels like they didn't test the economy at all, at least for basic T1 essence. You can buy a water bottle for 10 essence, and then deconstruct it into 200. What??? Why???? From there on out you can just buy all the materials you need. It's crazy, and this is basically right off the rip. The next tier of essence just seems so annoying to grind because you're just doing the same world objectives for different rewards that do the same exact thing. You make slightly different looking but oddly scaled weapons/outfits, to fight the enemies that are slightly scaled with you but the exact same look and feel. The combat just does not change.

-Just confusing. My group of friends and I play quite a bit of survival games and have for a lot of years. This is just the most confusing game we have ever played. It's just... So many stupid little things to make the game seem to have more content, when all it does is just make things more complicated. Like I mentioned earlier, I have played about 20 hours (They have played 30 or 40) and we are just now figuring out how to make a gun, and have yet to see any sort of magic, even though it seems really implied you're supposed to be getting those things early on with the amount of different things you can craft, which brings me to my next point.

-The crafting. You need almost nothing. I have NO use for ANY bench except the workbench and the sewing station for weapons and clothing. Every single other bench either is just to refine X material into Y material for the workbench/sewing station, or filled with stuff like potions/buffs that you just do not need and have zero use for, especially because you get so many from the world. I understand ""Well in other games you can't just build stone weapons then cannons from the same bench without some grinding/progression"". I definitely understand that, but there is just SO MUCH in this game almost to pad the content, it just all feels so useless.

-Bugs. The game is super buggy. There are just little bugs everywhere, in everything you do. It really seems yknow... tolerable? Ok? I find it so amusing I have put quite a few hours into this game with how many bugs or little things are just broken or don't work. The game is on such a good track but wow is it in bad shape right now.

Overall, I would wait to buy it. I mentioned before it seems like its on the perfect track it needs to be on. It's hard to stop playing even through all the bad aspects of the game, but there are just too many. It seems to *ALMOST* hit the mark in EVERY. SINGLE. CATEGORY. I really do have good hope for this game, and like I said I don't want to thumbs down it because I would hate for it to stop development, but it is just so overwhelmingly unfinished I for real cannot recommend it. From basic things like eating, drinking, building, to the main concept of the game like traveling and exploring (even that gets boring because you just dagger dash with your umbrella everywhere). I cannot say I didn't have fun playing this, but wow. It really did need another delay. Hopefully in 6 months it's polished enough to at least buy and enjoy, but I would say another full year of development and patches before it's in a state I believe it should have been released in today.",1708764294,1708765979,True,2,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,True

Overall, a disappointment so far :( 
About 10 hours played.
Maybe it was overhyped, maybe I have set my expectations too high. 

I was looking forward to this game for a long while, and to be honest the experience so far has been very underwhelming. I'm a single player person. I have been gaming since the early '80s, lived in MMO's for a decade, and prefer to play at my own pace now.

Survival build and craft games. I get it. I have played Valheim, Stranded Deep, The Forest, Enshrouded, Conan Exiles, No Man's Sky, ...
Gave Ark and Rust a try but those were not for me. Dislike PVP, griefing and having to see your effort undone each time you log in.

The positive:
- I really like the 19th century/steampunk theme.
- The music is nice and soothing
- The launch trailer is awesome (however the game for me is nowhere near what is seen in that video)
- Crafting and building has a lot less infinite resource grind feeling than Valheim or Enshrouded in the early game

The negative:
First of all, the game pace is very slow. 

Lack of information:
You get little to no pointers after the very basic tutorial on what to do and where to go. Islands feel empty and run pace is so slow it takes you 5-20 minutes to run across the landscape between the few points of interest a realm has. It generally feels empty. 
Buildings are alike and more often than not empty apart from a few chests with trinkets and maybe and Echo.
When you have a quest building or puzzle, it is all cookie cutter winding pathways and stairwells that look exactly the same. Sometimes the objective is that you need to find x hidden marks on walls to unlock something or open a door, so after 20 minutes running around in circles for some mark you've missed or trying to find some wall you can break with the pickaxe it starts to add to a feeling of futility and slowness.
Often it is unclear what reward you received or what it actually does.
The dialogues are dull and the highlighted words or the ""how to play"" sections provide little info.

I now need a specific realm card to progress, but no info where to obtain it. Both traders in my estate and last mission realm didn't offer the blueprint.

The world:
You get fibre, twigs, logs, stone and build some basic crafting and a small house, repeat for a few crafting stations. 
On to a little more advanced stations and you will be mining tin, quartz, coal, sawing logs to planks  and such.

Apart from some wolves and boar, anything else skeets off before you can get into range, crouching/sneaking doesn't seem to have much effect. The first ranged weapon, some slingshot crossbow, is so slow to fire and reload that any wildlife is long gone by the time you reload. If you chase after a prey sprinting, after a little while it just vanishes (unloads?).

You end up farming resources and converting it to essence, which is the basic currency to do anything and everything, including repairing your gear. 
The basic gear breaks every couple minutes of use.
Essence has different tiers and a specific tier is needed to unlock new buildings and cards at the essence traders.

The visuals:
If you happen to have a 3000$ GFX card it may look beautiful, but on balanced or performance it is very rudimentary and looks like a game of a decade ago.
On the lower end of the spectrum in machine requirements, even in ""performance"" you get weird lagging and grainy textures, when enemy mobs spawn in in a pack of 3 or 4 the combat is chaotic due to lag and enemies jumping past you and you have to seek and chase them.

Performance:
When you want to play, it needs to locate a server, set up a connection, generate the world, connect to the server again... Giving you plenty of time to make a cup of tea, go to the toilet etc before you can start.
Playing from the EU in the evening it can take up to 10 minutes to get you a slot, and every time you transition through a portal you're in for another 5 minutes load time. Like many stated before, not what you are looking for as a single-player game experience is desired.
15% of the total playtime is ""waiting for server"" :(

Fights are erratic; enemies jump through you, you get damage indication but no idea where the damage comes from. I find myself dying by going from full health to death in what appears 2 hits, 3 minutes running back to corpse, immediately dying again in some fights. If you swing a weapon like the axe, the weapon goes through the enemy without damage registering but stamina being spent. 3 swings and you are out of stamina, running around and kiting, then taking another 3 ""hit or miss"" swings. The combat aspect simply isn't fun at this point.

So after a while you encounter a companion. My guy is called Marvin. Marvin is the definition of dimwitted. He engages in combat with a pickaxe, wanders off and starts mining rock at any given time. You place him next to a tin clump, he walks away and starts mining stone. Oh, and he collects/steals loot when not asked. When running across the landscape, he wanders off, lags behind and then anchors/rubberbands to me after a certain distance. Not adding to the realism well.
So okay, Marvin will be a mule. I load stuff in Marvin's inventory (like a bunch of wood) to make my way back to base camp. Upon arrival, Marvin lost some or all of the stuff I put in his inventory. Not a good mule either then. Maybe that happens when the companion is overburdened, but you have no indication of weights when transferring with the companion (nor when you are interacting with chests).
Just good for a revive in combat so far.

You cannot instruct the companion to do specific things (at least I haven't found it and the game doesn't explain it)

The UI in general is messy, looks a little outdated and is clunky. 
You can't go from inventory to crafting without exiting/escaping the dialog first.
A lot of small QoL things that aren't there but hopefully will get added in futire patches.


If it weren't past the 2 hours just to get through the tutorial chapter and realms loaded, I would have taken the refund in its current state. So at this point I will slave on for a bit and update the review with new insights, but the game isn't compelling enough to have a 4 hour game session in the current state, which should be easy in some of the other games i have played.",1708720664,1708765057,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This review was written a few days after release into Early Access. At the time of review i have played 16 hrs.
At this time i cannot recommend buying Nightingale.

Pros
- Nightingale is a survival craft game, you collect materials, you craft things and you build a base. These things are fun in Nightingale.
- You can play solo or coop (up to 6 players). All players can quest together and access chests, this works pretty well.
- Random worlds can be created via portals, if you like exploring you will always have a new world at hand.
- The building system is decent and you will be able to build a base with it. There are some problems with the building system, which i list in the Cons section.
- The graphics are good (in my opinion).
- You can switch between mouse & keyboard and a gamepad. This works well. Personally i use gamepad for movement and combat. For crafting, building and sorting my inventory i prefer using mouse and keyboard.

Cons
- Animations are bad. The way the character moves etc. looks unnatural.
- The hit boxes are terrible. You never know where your hit will land. Hitting a moving enemy with a bow is a game of luck. But even if i stand face to face to an enemy hitting him with a melee weapon i miss a lot. Even gutting corpses with a hunting knife will only work after some fruitless attempts. Or hitting a tree, it sometimes just does not work correctly. This problem is always there no matter if you use mouse&keyboard or a controller.
- As i said in the pros section the building system is decent, but there are problems: Once built you cannot move walls or crafting stations, you have to destroy them. But there is no deconstruct menu, so you have to destroy them with a weapon. With the awful hit boxes you will often destroy other things than you intended. As the game checks structural integrity in a building this can lead to destroying bigger parts of the base (if you unintentionally destroy a foundation, then walls and roofs that depend on that foundation are also destroyed).
- Materials: if you collect meat, hide, fibers etc. you will get variations of that material depending on the source. In my opinion this is unnecessary and makes crafting more complicated than it has to be. For example you need 2 hides but you only have 2 different hides than you can not put them into the crafting slot. You need 2 identical hides. And your chests will fill quickly with all the variations of meat, hide, fibers etc. Everything starts a new stack. If a developer should read this: why not just 1 sort of meat, hide, bone etc?
- Long loading screens: everytime you log into the game or use the portal to a different world, you will have to wait appr. 3 minutes …
- Nightingale is in EA, but in my opinion it was released at least 6 months too early. Comparing Enshrouded and Nightingale i have to say that Enshrouded is a lot more polished and nearly bug free. The things that are implemented work fine in Enshrouded. Not so in Nightingale: The stone pile which is your binding point will randomly stop working, then you will enter the map at the default position (in my case at the other side of the island … 1000m to walk … every time this happens). Some items don‘t have icons. Sometimes your character cannot sprint anymore, if you are using a keyboard and have connected a controller. All these things should not happen even in EA.",1708760788,1708764516,False,2,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,True

So, I actually expected more free exploration, encounters. But for now it looks like very same: same places of interest, same enemies and same mechanic.
This game could have been so unpreictable and fresh, but current mechanics actually does not bring you the joy of opening something new. I wich encounters were 5times less but if they were more meaningfull. And recapies, just find a person and buy one. No struggle for exploration.

I'm 5 hours in and still finding a lot of new things during exploration. I love so much about this game.

Really like the long term plans for this game, this is more like a ""Raft"" where it's story focused, the eventual addition of the city of Nightingale is probably my most hype for thing on the roadmap.

Of the recent survival genre explosion of top sellers, this has the most potential.

I think the mixed reviews are a bit silly since reading them seems to be about the always server issues on day 1 but I didn't get to play til end of launch day; experience is fluid and crisp.

My issues lie with the core gameplay.
Combat: enemies teleport spawn infront of you, 5-15 of them. There is no parry and they are huge bullet sponges. This makes the combat very sluggish and unengaging and annoying.

Gear score: Who thought this would be a good idea? I understand that it might have a place in games where you play with randoms so you can't bring the group down to much. But in a game where you are most likely gonna play solo or with friends? The only thing it contributes then is that it forces you to complete the grind for ""new better gear"" before progressing, you can't skip grinds and tackle the challenge with skill instead, NO, you are blocked by a number because the developers really want you to complete that slow grind for better gear which is just your old gear with a higher number, nothing intressting, nothing you look forward to unlock and get.

Generic and grindy: I know most survival crafting games has grinds, i expected something akin to valheim, but this is a slower grind which just results in generic progress which isn't intressting.

All of this results in an annoying experience, I want to like this game, the realm cards and aesthetic really speak to me, but they become such a minor part when the core gameplay is unintressting. 
I'm sorry to say it, but just go play valheim or core keeper instead.",1708762281,1708762281,False,2,0,0.500875651836395264,0,True,False,True

My husband and I have played for just shy of 30 hours and I can safely say- The characters are flat and uninteresting: No real story or purpose other than to give you fetch quests or grind material for them.  The combat is a joke: you can stand in the middle of a mob of monsters and swing a lumber ax around and be just fine. The realms are all the same: Each feel empty and meaningless. going to another version of a biome slightly changes the color scheme and there maybe a new monster if your lucky. 3ish monsters per realm and the reoccurring main bad guys in the dungeons which are also the same. Every dungeon is the same: no point in doing them other than to grind essences which is money to buy recipes. some of them have a bit of a Mario element but the movement is not precise or fluid enough to aim or jump correctly. The ONLY thing that was kind of neat about this game was the crafting system. The workbenches have augments and you need to place them near  the relative crafting benches. sound familiar? yes Valheim. So not unique but still satisfying to lay out your grandpas garage workshop just so. the materials you choose to use modify your end result which is also cool.  Planting is a joke. plant a berry seed to get one berry and no seed? plant a sunflower and get 3 sunflowers and 7 seeds? that needs some wok. the construction system was okay. not a lot of variety but you can make do. 
I was so excited for this game. What a giant disappointment. the concept was cool and the previews were interesting.  I was looking forward to the flavor of a ""gas lamp"" themed survival game with multiple realms to explore. No mans Sky's endless planets did it better (which are also the same but more dense and diverse than these stupid realms) 
2/10 would not play again. 

As a side note- I'm getting really sick of these early access games to be honest. Enshrouded felt more finished than this but alas its early access and we have already reached the end of that.

There is a trend with games lately that just feel soul-less and empty. Enshrouded, Palworld, and now Nightingale. 

The concepts for this game are so amazing but they are executed in a way that just leaves me bored. 

Pros:
-Super Rich crafting system that has a ton of mixing and matching, material hunting, and hours of optimization.
-Survival is a focus of the game, unlike Enshrouded where survival feels like an after thought. You need to eat, you need shelter, you need to improve your tools so you spend less time crafting and more time in the world
-The Portal system is amazing, and you can go to or live in a variety of places. Love the concept of building a village with friends.
-House building is really good. Better than enshrouded.

Cons:
-No matter what background you choose, it is plastic wrap on the fact that your character is the summation of your gear. Behold, my stuff. I'm okay with being about your stuff, after all you are nothing but your stuff in Valheim but: This wouldn't be so bad if the world felt more populated with enemies and wildlife, but it's not dense. Not at all. It's empty. There is supposed to be a Victorian theme to this and there are NPC's in the world you can meet who are from both real history and fictional history, but meeting them does not feel special. They are boring quest givers wrapped in cool name tags. Puck is cool I guess. He has a personality.
-Combat: Enemies move faster than most enemies in a dedicated first person shooter. They jump right through you, combat feels like your running around trying to whack a mole.
-Dungeons feel repetitive, same design, same lay out, three sets of enemies and maybe a portal to a mario dungeon.
-While you can go several places, as craft custom realms they feel the same just with different colored plants.
-The game is 100% online, which feels like a cool concept but there have been issues with sudden drop offs etc. My wife and I are more interested in playing with eachother more than other people to be honest. So it would have been nice to have a local game option. 
-Death in this game is meaningless.
-I had to think really hard why I liked Valheim but did not like this. Valheim had a lot of ""Woooo"" moments, and intricate and challenging combat. This game I don't think i've had a ""Woooo"" moment to date. Nothing memorable that I'll keep with me.

I think when this game hits it's 1.0 Version, my review will change, but this is a disappointing start to early access. I'm going to stop buying early access games. Palworld, Enshrouded and Nightengale have killed that spirit for me.

I give this game in it's current state a 5/10. 

When someone makes a meal that doesn't taste great, but is edible, we say, it will make it or push one out.

This game will make one or push it out, if you need something to do. I hate to be mean about it, I know the company that made it, put a lot of thought into it, but in the end it feels like another Soulless Survival game. Show me the love and I'll come back.

In it's current state 5/10",1708761478,1708761478,False,24,8,0.505549430847167969,0,True,False,True

But we have to remember it is in early access, the devs have plenty of time to iron out these flaws. The game has backbone though and a hell of a lot of it. So let me get to the review...

Nightingale has stunning visuals, The graphics are amazing, creature and character design is phenomenal. The game-play loops at the beginning can be a bit confusing but once you find your feet there is so much to explore unlock craft. And the character creator is pretty dope if you're into that sort of thing.

The story so far has been good, i can't comment too much on the story as I'm nowhere near done with it. I would appreciate a few more of the main story NPC's, quest givers and your assistant being voiced. But I mean you can only compare this game to games similar to Ark, where there are no story NPC's and the story is told through collectables similar to this game. But i believe that voice acting of the lore would bring the story more to life and the game with it.

QoL..... Containers need to link to crafting in the base. With so many different types of the same resources it becomes an inventory management nightmare very quickly after leaving your starter realm. I feel that food should have its own buttons dedicated like the potion slot and not need to be held in your hand. The same with the umbrella I feel like it should be a part of your outfit and only be used when pressing space and not grounded. So boring walking like a snail because an enemy knocked you off a high place and you had some roasted meat equipped, or because I jumped expecting to have my umbrella equipped but did not.

Live service means you have to be online to play, leaving your smooth game-play at the mercy of the servers and long loading screens. On the other hand this enables you and your friends to play any realm at any time without paying additional costs for a private server. (The devs have stated that they are working on offline mode for all you moaners out there that are trashing this game over a feature that was advertised).

Overall I am excited to see what they bring us with the final product. If you don't like flawed games wait until full release. I feel like the dev team will be working hard on fixing QoL issues and Ironing out kinks as they responded to people crying about live service pretty quickly. I just hope they also take time to flesh out what is already there and add more types of biomes and such. this game could be one of the best if feedback is listened to and they continue putting in the fantastic work they have been",1708761285,1708761285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1928980,159127415,76561198136763966,0,2,2278,2278,1704,1708840632,"I've been playing a couple of days now, and while I am enjoying the game, I can see the issues everyone else is complaining about. To me, this game feels like it needed a lot more time to flesh out before being revealed/ put in early access. It's very pretty, but it feels very bare bones for a survival crafting game, and the mechanic of realm travel is not enough to hold it up. I'm just at the point where I've crafted an herbarium card and updated to trappers gear, just so people know where I'm at, and why I might not know of something later in the game, but here are my thoughts.

Issues:
1. The tutorial takes too long yet somehow shows the hand of the game way too fast. I'm of the belief that since there are only 3 realm biome types at this time, swamp and desert should be left to be discovered until later. It feels very hand-holdy instead of letting players explore and discover but I'm guessing that this is because the systems of the game are very convoluted.
2. Every realm has 2-4 creatures types max. There isn't even any variation to them. They all look exactly the same, save for the fabled creatures. All of them, save for the Bound, act exactly the same. They either run away or charge at you. Also, the loot is separated into prey and predator, which as far as I've seen makes no difference in crafting and just clutters up your inventory.
3. Speaking of, theres a lot of parts of this game that serve no purpose other than to clutter inventory space. Why are there so many types of ore? Fibre? Stone? It makes crafting and inventory management so much harder.
4. The realm travel mechanic is cool, but after looking at the same types just to see (I wanted a pretty place to put my estate), nothing much changes other than the POIs. The color of the foliage/terrain/sky does not change unless you put in a different secondary card, but then if you want to build in a prettier realm you like, you won't be allowed to use your respite action to go back to your home because your home has to be in an abaylence realm to use it. So to be able to effectively make a decent estate in a realm other than the standard 3, you have to create a portal to that realm, then run all the way back to your estate. It makes no sense because the cairn suppresses creatures from spawning around, so I don't see why its exclusive to abaylence 
5. I don't mind having a lot of crafting tables, but what I do mind is the fact that igniting/managing fuel is in a completely different menu from crafting, which means you have to exit out of fuel to craft, or you have to exit out of crafting to fuel, then go back to crafting. I also don't like the fact that trying to figure out what you can craft at certain tables is completely separate from the tables themselves. Augmentations don't seem to be really useful since you could build them, but the recipes are still locked until you unlock them at high level essence trader down the line..
6. The recruit AI is terrible, in the fact that you can't really tell them what to do in any capacity. I've accidentally wasted so much stone/wood because I gave it to my recruit to hold, only for them to automatically use it to built only my estate. They do make a good tank though.

Honestly there is so much more I could complain about, but I'm going to try to offer solutions the best I can.
1. The realm travel mechanic needs more variation. If characters are only going to be stuck to a certain type of realm  for home, allow random variation in the colors of things, or even the types of foliage itself. We're in the Faewilds. We're the giant, crazy, colorful flora and fauna? The team could go crazy with what these places could look like, but they look very Earth like for a place that is fantastical. The same goes for the creatures. Even if its just a change in their texture colors. There needs to be something.
2. For now, do not focus on the weird, unnecessary gear score that explains nothing. What is hope even for? Why does this matter if things are locked by gear score (which I don't believe they should be. I think it should be simple enough to say 'this material is better than this material' and be at that. Unless there is variation and different sets at the same 'level', theres really no need for that information to take up such a giant part of the screen that could be used for something else.
3. This is common amongst most games, but since this game is graphics intensive, I think it'd be good to have mouseover explanations for graphic settings, as in what they do and what their effect on performance can be. I started with this weird grain around everything that was extremely hard to look at (and my PC is decent), and while I know how to fix, newcomers might not and get frustrated.
4. The minor card system seems lacking. A lot of the boons don't seem worth it for the banes. There should be some purely cosmetic minor cards, so if people are stuck to a certain realm, we can at least freely make it as we want.
5. The crafting materials and menus need to be condensed.",1708761041,1708761041,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you'd played any game in the genre you'll be familiar with the gathering and crafting elements. Combat is very okay. AI isn't great but far from the worst i've seen. Landing a critical hit feels weighty and satisfying. The environments are very nice looking and varied. Human characters look a little wonky though. 

Where this differs from other crafting/survival games is the realms network. Instead of one big open world, you travel smaller discrete maps using gateways. You can use cards that you craft or find to determine the environment and difficulty and other variables of the realm you're traveling to.  You start with a home realm and travel on from there. For each realm you enter, you can either build a gateway to a new realm or put new cards in the one you used to get there. Every gateway remains open unless you change the cards in it, in which case the old realm is lost and you can travel to a new one. This sounds more complicated that it is.

The UI / menus are so comically bad and needlessly complex in this game and definitely cause most of this confusion I think. They definitely need better instructions and the ""No Offline"" is kind of true however the way they did it allows for all friends to play in the same realms without a dedicated host or renting a server which is actually kind of brilliant.  

Whoever did the UI really did this game dirty because its honestly incredible in all the other aspects. Combat is great and not mashy, environments in each real are wildly varied and unique with just a ton of different enemies that are also unique. Their is a ton of complexity here and its done well just not exactly interfaced well. Better building and tutorial / guidebook mechanics being more clear would help a lot of these people struggling with the game.

I have had very limited network issues so online play isn't a factor for me and I get why they want to have it which will create a potentially amazing end game with teaming up with players even though you played through solo.  

The good:  

Visuals/environment -  Amazing in UE5 - I run all ultra settings and TSR quality setting with a 4070ti with about 80fps in 4k ultra wide.  No rubberbanding or lag of any kind for me.  The sounds and music really set a relaxing tone and then lets you know a fight is coming.  I'm also in the US so I am not impacted by the distance of GCP instances hosting each realm.  Offline play will be added later, but you might lose the ability to use your character to play with a group for end game quests designed for groups.  I think everyone can agree this game looks beautiful.

Unique way for replayability with having different realms and portals you can create, keep, or reset versus having 1 big map.  I put a few portals by my base for easy access.  Your base location will need a Cairn marking your home realm and spawn point where you can teleport from any other realm.

Crafting - This is not basic crafting like some other games so if you don't like crafting then you won't like this game.  This part is very complex with many different stations and lots of parts, but it all makes sense on what station you should use.  This forces you to build a base with all of the crafting stations, then upgrade those when needed and add augmentation pieces.  When crafting you can choose what qualifying material you want to use for the best stats or color.  Lots of thought went into this.  I think building is good with the blueprint method and you get resources back when demolishing, except it seems that stone walls aren't giving resources back.  I prefer this than creating 30 walls, 20 ceilings, etc and then being over or under what is needed.  You can also move your storage with items in there!

Difficulty - Starts with enemies with really basic movement and then gradually keeps getting harder and harder with tougher enemies including animals.  The puzzles also have a variety of easy to more time consuming.  Some people were complaining about how easy the fights were, but they didn't put enough hours in to get to the much harder fights.

The bad:

Your companions AI is awful, they try to work but lots of the time just stand there while you work or fight.  They are good at helping build from your blueprints for building and will help tank or revive you when needed.  They are ugly and generic, but can hold a ton of supplies.

Bugs to be expected which will be worked out.  If you get stuck there is an unstuck feature in the system menu.  Some network instability, but I've only encountered that about 3 times.  

They didn't finish creating pictures for items so many have N instead. 

Climbing picks are just plain awful shaking everywhere.

Overall, I am hooked on this game as there is so much to do and the atmosphere is really chill when you are not in a tough dungeon or boss fight.  I can only imagine how this game will look after a year in EA or however long it takes to work out the bugs.

And finally the online only is just sucks ( I hope they release the offline soon ) as I mainly play solo, I hope they add more features to the Survivor AI though that would be nice, like giving command or possibly multiple recruitable followers at once.

The Reason I set this review on Positive is because I enjoy playing the game, i have fun.  It's visually stunning, sound design is great at some parts, the art style is nice, and the theme is what i love the most, since I'm just a sucker for Gaslamp Fantasy lol, the dialogue on some NPCs are good even though voiceless. And there's actually goal to the game as I dislike open-ended survival games. Meanwhile the exploring is pretty relaxing i guess, desert realm is probably the one that felt ""vast"" while the other two are just island. 

So should you take it? At this stage if you're looking for an Open World Survival Craft, there are way better titles out there in early access, give it a time to cook and check it back time to time, but you can take it if you like the look of it, you'd be the judge.

No weight display, no weight warning until you're encumbered.  Feels like the devs spent lots of time on the concept and structure and forgot about the interface.


Update 2/24 - 

Stuck with it and got to Herbarium realm.  I like the detailed build-out of the crafting, although it seems like its going towards serious micro-management.  The card unlock quests are challenging, perhaps a little buggy, but the combat is better than the faceroll Fae tower essence grinding runs.  Devs if you read this stuff I would recommend a couple things:

1) For all the augmentations/upgrades make it clear in the notes about what's need to open ""X"" schematic.  The lines to the relevant crafting station are helpful but not precise.  Still not sure how to craft my rifle ammo consistently, because it seems like I can only do it when the saddle isn't next to my refined workbench.  Even when playing the Artisan card, I have recipes that I bought but cannot craft.  Consider something other than the janky spacial based thing you have going.
2) The combat pretty bad and you guys know this, enough said and not a deal killer.
3) Given the complexity of your crafting streams, consider some kind of streamlining via leveling - i.e. you get to the next craft bench upgrade and you no longer have to have these 8 augmentations.  Clarify which stations need to be placed in close proximity and remove some of the guesswork for the end user who has bought the schematic and is trying to craft said schematics.
4) Like the status effect balances and ability to experiment - i.e. What food + gear buffs can I use to nullify the need to use an umbrella at all times in the desert.  Liked what the NPC fae hinted about frost.
5) impressed with the procedural generation, although its unclear how to get to certain places at times.  The climbing picks could use some work but I think I'm doing it as intended.  
6) If my initial load-in times out with the server and I have to try again, from then on ""esc"" no longer lets me exit chests or crafting stations and I have to use my mouse cursor to close.  Just adds clicks to an already complex game, should put that one at the top of the ticket pile.
7) One last thing - my hired help keeps putting my new T2 wood in the fuel pile for the cooking/smelting/etc station.  Consider some controls in which you can specify the level of material that your NPC hireling can interact with instead of just having certain chests be non-accessible?

Will keep playing towards endgame, its mostly enjoyable (I do hate the swamp, but know thats intended)  Look forward to the alpine biome and keep up the good work!",1708495619,1708755400,False,7,0,0.539045512676239014,2,True,False,True

Did you do any research into the game besides watching a video or two? Did you notice that Nightingale was starting in early access? Nightingale is a different take on the survival genre, it's interesting how some people want something new, but do not want change, instead falling back on the familiar.

I know I went in knowing all these issues and knowing the game is not complete, I have been mostly happy with the game
play. Though I don't enjoy the wait in loading in a realm, it does allow for a short break. 

Nightingale is a different type of open world survival game with many opportunities  for fresh game play due to the realm portal system. I enjoy the Fae lore background aspect, I hope they put more of this lore in to the game. I have not found it to be grindy, often I have more materials than I need from casual gathering, though there are a few times I have had to go out and get additional  items to complete a quest task, it was not taxing for me. The game is great for exploration, though some POI's may be repetitive , many open world games have similar repetitive elements, and Nightingale is till in early access, so I expect more POI types as the game develops.

Right now with the game in Early Access, I would recommend Nightingale to gamers who  understand what Early Access means, that they are testing while they play, that  there may be issues. For me the launch was the smoothest for any launch EA or Full Release I have had in a very long time.

I have not had any server lag or anything either. I am really liking the pacing - progression is steady, but not so fast that you're blowing through content. It feels just right. Crafting may be a little confusing if you aren't prepared for it, but I watched a ""before you buy"" video that made everything pretty clear. About 12 min video, and I felt well-prepared and nothing is so mysterious in-game as to be frustrating. Over 3 hours in, and I have not had to look anything up on the wiki or reddit etc. I also like the trading system, I like my assistant, building is straightforward and makes sense. I think a lot of the criticism of this game came from it being different from expectations - not objectively bad. So it would be beneficial to check out some actual game play how-to like the aforementioned ""Before You Buy"" video to get an idea of how it's pretty different from other survival crafting games. With that basis, I am really enjoying this so far and will definitely keep playing, and am looking forward to even more content and refined gameplay.

Update :
I had to re-edit this review twice because I can say many things about this game, but you know what? At the end of the day, a game must have at least one thing that gives some sort of enjoyment or reward, something that really works well in the game. Well, this game doesn't have it. This game is just a bunch of survival crafting elements put together with a very weird and dated UI system and mechanics, asking you to go against enemies (packs of wolves, a few variations of bears, packs or single poisonous spiders or scorpions, plus goblins and mechanical enemies) which are very easy to kill. So basically, the game tells you to grind for this and do minimal puzzles. The main features of the game are grinding, walking (meaningless exploration), and completing meaningless objectives with no rewards. The card system is kind of fine, but you can place only one minor card, and it doesn't really offer anything interesting or valuable to the realm.

I do understand what they are going for with these realms being server side to allow multiple people to explore the same realm, but honestly I believe that to be a niche case.

The combat is super clunky; you've got three animations that you cycle through when using a tool/weapon and if whether you actually hit a creature or not seems to be completely dependent on the whim of the game, a few other people have mentioned it feels like playing an old mmo with high ping and thats so accurate. Accessing any menus is bad; the designs and layouts of the menus are just not user friendly or intuitive which makes crafting or building things tedious. Keys randomly stop working especially after being disconnected from their servers which is such a sucky thing to happen when you're playing completely single player.

yes the devs are planning an offline version and obviously the game is EA so i'm assuming things will improve but I would honestly say wait a bit before spending your money.

Ignore the negative reviews, People are upset about online only which I understand, but the developers have already said they are working to make it offline after the backlash.

First off this game deserves way more than the lousy 58% you guys have given it at the time of this review. Wait to review a game after the first few patches if your are going to dis the whole game on one stupid feature you do not like. This game looks great, plays great, and the developers defiantly put the work in and you can tell. A lot of reviews try to say this is just another ""Survival Game"" you are right, but what do you mean exactly cause this is a pretty good damn survival game. If you don't want to play another survival game then go buy something else. I have played almost every survival game that managed to even be in probably the top 50. This game has a lot of elements most survival games never think of. I almost did not even buy it because of the negative reviews but I figured I would give it a shot anyways seeming most of them were ""Online Only"" or ""Just another survival game"". I thoroughly enjoyed the first 1.5 hours I have played. If I had more time I would still be playing.

If you like survival games this is a good game with different elements from any other survival game. The only thing I could have to say is it could use some optimization but that is probably my fault with having a AMD graphics card and a 4K monitor, but nothing lowering my settings a little cant fix. I just prefer the highest settings. Seems most indie games do not work well on AMD cards like the RTX cards.

Bugs will be fixed, features will be added, placeholder icons will get replaced, and so on.  With the stage of development I have personally not hit much in the form of anything game breaking.  The TL:DR considering everything is that I would give this game and the development team a solid 9/10 so far.

That said, I have jumped into the game after work for the past few days and am having a good time.  The crafting is in depth and feels like its own little mini game of matching up different components to get the end result that fits your play style.  The building is significantly better than most survival games I have played and feels way more in depth. The game gives you just enough guidance that you can start to understand what you are capable of and then leaves you to discover a lot of things on your own which feels rewarding to me.  There are a lot of aspects of this game that remind me of a Victorian/Fae version of Valhiem, which is another game that I enjoyed, but there are enough differences that it has kept it interesting for me.  The art in the game is enjoyable to look at, which is good because I can tell that the amount of progression that is planned for this game is going to take awhile to get through. The addition of a companion has been cool but right now the AI could probably use some work.  Giving them a weapon other than the maul tends to lead to them just dropping a ton of entities on the ground which can kill server performance. So many trees and rocks mined for no reason before I found the maul was an option.  

The two negatives I have seen so far is that it does have a bit of a loading time when realm jumping.  It takes awhile for the portal to open then has a long loading screen when you walk through, then you click on a button saying you want to start exploring the new realm.  The screen asking you to click the button also serves as a screen that tells you a little about where you are about to end up.  It doesn't bother me too much but I can see where it would annoy some to not really be doing much for that time. The second being that I would like for them to add the ability to craft out of your bases inventory.  Having to find things in chest and bring them to the crafting table is not the worst thing in the world but it does feel better to just source the base's inventory in the games that have that feature.

As it stands right now they have mentioned prioritizing adding offline support which I don't think aligns with the stated vision of the game or the purpose of getting feedback during early access.  But realistically how they decide to prioritize features isn't too much of an issue unless later on they express that they cut features to facilitate the change.  I know that there are many people who will benefit from this change when it happens.  While I think it is a bit tone deaf to focus on the end of a game's life cycle when it's still in development, offline play will also add to the ability to play past Inflexion being able to support the servers. So despite my thoughts on it there is something to be said about it being added in eventually. I also respect that they are willing to make a change based on what some of the community has asked for.  I just hope they don't compromise their vision chasing goals set by people who don't understand what they are trying to accomplish.  Right now this game feels like a breath of fresh air to the genre and I don't want it to lose that.

The visuals are Great,
 The Voice acting there is i Enjoy. wish there where more of it.
The gear crafting system is very interesting not reached endgame yet so not sure if all the options will actually give build diversity or if there just is a BiS material. 
The Realm card system is really fun and gives me a lot of ideas.

And now the reason for the thumbs down.
The UI is hard to work with clunky and slow and building does not feel fun when using this UI, Even interacting with chest/follower inventory seems clunky and weird. 

The followers feel more like a chore than a help. they cut down resources a lot slower than you, since they are linked to you if u move they will come running to you so if you want them to gather you need to stand there and watch them. They do okay with mining since the ore ""spawn"" instantly when mining and they will try and pick the ore up. Trees they struggle with. Since there is a fairly long time between felling a tree and the logs ""spawn"" most of the time the follower will leave that tree to go find another and not pick up anything. In combat they do okay with a Axe as it has a wide swing. My best suggestion for dealing with follower is give them a axe and Treat them like a extra backpack, anything more is Bonus

The Quickslot bar,
You got your standard 1-0 quickslot bar with a Single extra slot for a potion.
now the 1-0 bar is split in half. 5 buttons for ""main hand"" and 5 for ""offhand"" its a interesting idea however since there is no option for more bars and no way to adjust how much is Main hand and how much is offhand it gets very frustrating. there are alot of tools/weapon types you interact with on a ""journey"" into the realms. and almost all of them are main hand. This leaves you going into inventory swaping a item on quickbar, then use it, and then swap it back again while on the offhand bar you have almost nothing. you can have your 3 foods (that you interact with like every 20 minuttes, a Torch(that gets obsolete with magic imo) and umbrella that is rather useful. Not to mention that it IMO hurts the crafting, you can try and make realy good gathering tools at the expense of damage. I would like to do this but with the limit on quickbar/inventory slots i just dont feel its worth it. 

When and I do hope it is When some of these issues gets  fixed/changed i will revisit the Thumbs down Because is realy do think there is a fantastic game idea here and want to see where the game takes us

I don't care about the story.

I actively dislike the crafting. Feels like a gear treadmill and I hate those.
There's practically no reason to build a base. Stone? T2 stone? Cool. Why? What is the point? Obviously there's a reason to build a base but it's just so that you have a small room to put all of your crafting stations. No reason beyond that.

Many room for improvements but it's a beautiful playable game already.

UI, build menus and navigation need improvements. You always have to close and reopen instead of building different structures rapidly. They need to do something more efficient like Valheim or Enshrouded quick build menu.
Melee combat too, it's not perfect but still decent.
Ressources seem to never regenerate which is limiting the building potential. I guess they will improve that over time.

Coop is well done.

Journey to the fantasy world that you can craft with your own option, decide the difficulty, biome, and enemies. Explore the realm that keep offer a new destinations. Build the dream house in your own estate realm, or build temporary cottage in each realms that you venture into. All while looking good in Victorian/19th Century fashion! It's a wonderful and fun survival game.[/b]

[u]What I love so far:[/u]

[i]- The art style in this game, it is so wonderful, from outfit to items (I love Victorian fashion).

- PvE, Always glad to see more player helping each other kind of games. ♥

- Crafting/Building materials is not too complicate, or hard to obtain like many other games, at least for me right now.

- You can recruit one NPC to journey along side with you and your friends, not just a companion, they can help you gathering/fighting as well.

- Enchantment, and upgrade are kind of easy and you mostly are in control of the effect you want in item upgrade. 

- Beautiful world and scenery in each realm, always in awe as I venture into the new realm portal. :D[/i]


[b]Although the game is currently online only, I have no trouble loading/lagging in this game, like many other, so I can't really say on that part. However, as early access game there are bugs here and there to be expect, but no game breaking for me so far. 

The game is kind of confuse and seem boring at first, the tutorial isn't very helpful that much and you left to wonder what to do or what is this item for most of the time, which is why I understand most people didn't like the game at first glance, but as you progress the fun will keep coming and there will be more thing for you to do and to understand later on. :D[/b]

The customization, visual presentation and setting is 11 out of 10. I can't remember being this excited about a game in the first hours since... well, Baldur's Gate III. My heart and mind were blown the first night I spent maybe 6 hours straight in Nightingale, without sleeping, just being mind blown.

Now, with this said -- after about 50 hours, this game is a rough gem. The potential is above great, but there are a lot of tough obstacles in the way.

Setting and visuals - This is what this game does best. Everything from environments to creatures is just fantastic.
Sound design - Very, very good. The music is fantastic. The sound effects are impactful, eerie and beautiful.
Combat - Stable and functional but basic. The weapons and tools (yes, tools are as viable as weapons for combat) have a good FEEL to them. Hitting something with a maul feels bombastic. Slashing a crit is fun. Dodging is impactful and fast. However, there's a lot here that oculd be improved. Better enemy AI, more weapon types and moves, more magick.
Story - The main mission and storyline is, apart from the grinding, interesting and fun. Puck as a character is fantastic. Still, they could make mission points and info on what to do more clear. It starts out well, but eventually you will find yourself confused at certain stages. The other quests are lackluster. However, if they can pick up the other quests and NPC dialogues in the same voiced sense as Puck... then this could be great overall.
Crafting - Great potential. Rewarding, but clunky. There are a lot of quality of life things that could be improved here - especially a more traditional crafting journey (instead of essence traders being vital, and certain soft locks in the loop). Still, being able to plan out your constructions in blueprints is neat, and the stuff you craft in themselves are fun, visually striking and nice overall. This - along with combat and quests - are what I think needs most attention in the next steps.
Worlds: The realm system is creative and works really well so far. Being able to customize and change realms is fun and keeps things fresh. The realms themselves are GORGEOUS and full of... well, very interesting things that could be so much more.

I feel this is one of the strongest launches in terms of what this game could be, in years. The world carries so much feels and settings, but it's still so early that after a certain amount of time you run out of content. The worlds are amazing at first, but in ""late game"" (30/40+ hrs or so I reckon) you start to see how empty many things are. A lack fo NPC:s, quests, a fully realized crafting system and basic combat keeps Nightingale from being truly, truly great.

It's on its way, hopefully. WIth polish and much more content, this could seriously be the new Skyrim. That's how strong I think the foundation is. Hopefully the team keeps working on it, despite mixed responses!",1708741380,1708741380,True,3,0,0.533631742000579834,0,True,False,True

But this game is all i had hoped for. been waiting for a very long time for this to come out. I am not disappointed.  That being said it is early access but seems very polished for that. lots more content to come I am sure. I still have a lot to see for now anyway, so I am very happy to see this title. I am disappointed to see all the complaints on this game. It is early access and there are risks to getting into early access. You are paying to kind of be a play tester and to provide feedback to a developer so they can polish their game and when they are a legit dev they are getting funded to help them continue development. in this case I believe in this developer as they have provided a polished early access game. it shows their vision and that vision is absolutely amazing. I've not even unlocked any other realms than forest at this point and I'm excited to see more. 

Is it perfect? no its not as there are some confusing thing's but Iv'e been able to figure them all out so they are not game breaking just a little annoying and maybe not intuitive for me. But if I will do my part and note these things and report them to the Dev's it might spark them to think, hey you know what we didn't see that, and they fix it or improve it.  I have never done game development before but I've done some creative things and sometimes in the middle of my creativity I am blinded to certain things because I don't see it and that's because i know it and it makes perfect sense to me. so Dev's keep up the work and keep listening to your community you got a banger on your hands. Love what you are doing and am enjoying the adventure. 

To anyone thinking about this game. Again its early access so its not finished. you may have to play through many different times thanks to you getting to an end point in the early access and not having more to do yet and when they do add new content your like I don't remember all the details of what I went though or you might just need to start over to catch some new things. who knows? its the risk you take to get in and play a work in progress. 

To all the complainers about network issues. ITS EARLY ACCESS and not all early access is a cash grab. some are yes they exist but some are not. I believe these Dev's really have passion. if you look at what is actually in this game right now they didn't do no copy pasta that I can see. maybe there are some asset flips I don't know. a lot of games have stuff in them that look like stuff in another game but sometimes I've go to a friends house they have the same TV I do or something else so i don't normally notice the sameness of a desk or a wall from one game to another unless I've seen it a lot. and yes I've seen same assets in many different games plenty of times. so far the assets in this game look as unique as they can I mean a table is a table after all. but so far all the placeables I've seen look unique to me. creature design looks to be crafted with love and care. I mean a boar is boar right? but at least its not the same boar I've seen in 900 other early access  games I've played.  and as for the aforementioned network issues I bought this game day one. i got in a couple hours late and have had very few network issues. have I had 0 no not 0 but less than 10 or so. 

For all the people with network issues I'm sorry you had them. Wish they hadn't happened as this game deserves High praises and Maybe I'm wrong could this be all we ever see from the dev's? I don't think so but anything is possible these are the risks of buying anything that's not finished. I am counting on the dev's to finish it and I'm sure they will but I guess time will tell. I'm hoping to put in my entire weekend off on this game and get past the 30 hour mark and hope there will still be more to do or a patch gets released with new content before I exhaust what is available in the game now.  and if exhaust the content tonight I will still be satisfied with my purchase as I'm sure more is coming and TBH I've almost got my moneys worth already and I'm sure I'll get a lot more of my monies worth out of this title. 

sorry for ramblings but I had to say the above and probably have a lot more i need to say but you get the point and I apologize for the poor grammar and sentence structure I was never good at all that and I just vomit out my thoughts. 

Anyway I wrote the above for 3 reasons.
A) For people trying to figure out if the reviews are correct. Go watch some good streamers play this and see if you like what you see. if this type of game is something you like then I think you will love this one. 
B) To encourage the Dev's as I believe in their vision or at least what I see of their vision so far.  :-)
C) All the bad reviews about networking issues and if there are any people that gave it a negative because it has bugs. this game is early access if you don't understand what that is go get educated and if you cant then please stop buying early access games. They are probably not for you!!!!

Hope this helps someone and please just get educated before you buy a game so you know what your getting yourself into. I've bought games I didn't like but I could see that they were probably good games just not my type of game. so if I reviewed I would not say this game sucks (At least I hope I didn't or wouldn't) I Might say hey not my kind of game so see if it's yours before you buy it. NO need to thumbs down a game just because it isn't my style of game and I thought it was going to be. Anyway Thank You",1708739807,1708739807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Forced online play (being addressed by devs according to statement)
- Really needs a means of faster transportation once you reach the desert maps, but hey at least there's auto-run... 

I had high hopes for this game and was initially disappointed in my first impression. But wise from my Ark Survival Evolved experience (when it was in EA I bought and refunded it twice - I now have 5000 hours played) I gave it a second chance to change my mind and happily it did. There's a fair amount of room for improvement - the UI is messy, it overall lacks polish in the character models and icons, but beyond that it plays like many other survival games - but with a few very fun, very different twists in the realm travelling, the Victorian/steampunk+fantasy theme and a pretty good variety in activities.",1708738621,1708738621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Slow, dull, and tedious start with no reason to keep going.

This game is no in a vacuum, there are many other survival crafting games out there, and there is nothing here to stand out yet. The tutorial has zero bells and whistles so nothing really stood out. the typical, grab berries, make a campfire, cook, make bad tools, make a tent, kill a basic monster. 
This game likely will improve with time, but the intro is a massive nothing burger doing the same thing I have done from minecraft, Ark, Conan, 7days, and even Palworld at this point. There is a lot of lore things but nothing happens to pull you in, no taste of power where you have a gun or magic things, just the same old ""Press E to collect sticks"" just with fae and you in a Victorian looking outfit.

Is it garbage? no, not really, Is it doing anything worth while yet? not at all. Returning it for now but will come back eventually, but there are a lot of issues that didn't impact me that I am reading on too that just makes me question how long this game will stand.",1708495053,1708738535,False,2,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,True

- In depth Character Customization (Can even build your family tree but note, it's had no impact on game play outside of the character creator)
- Beautiful areas filled with dungeons to have fun in.
- Not survival heavy focus - I can actually eat 3x and go for a day or two, not stop every 4 minutes to focus on my hunger and have to cook x40 chicken meals to fill it.
- Weather system that even has some that can kill you if you aren't prepared.
Some other aspects I was happy about but could use some modest tweaks / improvements was combat.  Reminds me a lot of Skyrim.

I honestly don't really have very many cons outside of better improvements on a game pad since there seems to be some odd and end issues there, especially in character creator.  The biggest con is the performance is god awful and I'm well above specs, even NVIDIA Now struggles with this game, to be expected with Early Access titles, so not exactly downing this game over it, rather putting it out there for the devs.

--
Pro:
Incredibly beautiful graphics. Your video card will most likely suffer. It uses the lumen of the Unreal 5 engine to its fullest and the result is a game that looks simply incredible.
The authors appeal to British mythology. There is a lot of old English in the game texts.
It's just fun to explore.
Contra:
The project is still VERY raw. The NPCs you hire are extremely stupid. The balance is pretty tight and the game punishes you when you touch content that you shouldn't touch according to your level.
The worlds themselves are not fully completed. For example, I observed rain in the desert and there were not even clouds in the sky. Moreover, the rain penetrated even into the dungeon.
The change from day to night is just a click away. One second the sun is setting and the next it’s pitch black.

And the game lacks character leveling at all. All leveling is only through equipment items, so you will have to grind like on a plantation.

You can buy it if you are a fan of survival games AND you like steampunk and Victorian England. The game is worth your time and I hope the developers don’t give up halfway through.",1708646982,1708735771,True,0,0,0.264550268650054932,0,True,False,True

Almost a great game.

After the first three or so realms and you build your first house, it dawns on you that you're going to have to do everything you just did over and over again to get the next piece of gear.

They need to tweak drops as my T2 realm gave me very few T2 ingredients and only about 20ish T2 essence. That's enough for one station blueprint.

Also Please let Gear of the corresponding realm level have a chance to spawn in chests. I have a bunch of different potions I'm never going to use and only ever finding ingredients is lame.

It removes the excitement of exploring realms when the only thing you are ever going to find is the essence, making the minor realm cards meaningless, if you're doing the same thing in 100 new places is any of it new?

I have played many early access games, and have never requested a refund until now. Because of the notoriously inherent slow start to the game, I exceeded the 2 hour mark that Steam defaults to as a barrier to a qualify for a refund because I was working hard to give Nightingale a fair shot.

At this point it feels as though the team spent the majority of their funding on producing their demo, which is dangerously misleading. Early access should indicate a level of preparedness to go to market. 

Connectivity is slow and inconsistent. Perpetual server connection is problem. 

Multiple disconnect issues. 

Interface bugs. A lot of them.

Lack of access to previously divulged info screens inside the game play and help sections. 

Myriad number of issues with crafting (this looks to be huge show-stopper due to the intricate levels required to progress in the game). 

Recruit needs micromanaging to an unsustainable level; at this point they are more of a nuisance, including chopping trees that land on your character causing damage even while working through other npc's dialog.

Nothing placed can be retrieved without simply destroying the object, losing tons of materials in the process - whoever considered that workbenches couldn't simply be picked up and moved needs to re-think their life.

For all of the beauty of the environments, there is little content aside from resources. 

Monsters always attack in packs of three, with very little variety in monster type.

--------------

There are many elements that made Nightingale feel like it would be a promising venture.
Sadly, the initial, tantalizing dialog with Puck cannot carry the entirety of the product.

The aesthetic has really delivered throughout the tutorial and my starting realm, and I've created a homestead I'm proud of already. Like I'd want to live in this place, it's wonderful.

I haven't had the performance issues other people reported, which is not to say they don't exist, but I haven't had them. I capped my frames at 60 and it usually sits there.

The environments are gorgeous and animations are smooth. Combat is basic so far, and reminds me of other survival games. Character creation has a lot to choose from, but the characters have a specific look that might put you off if you're trying for a very realistic or ""pretty"" character.

The only bug I've had is occasionally crafting materials clip through the ground and disappear for a while. They tend to reappear, though.

A few things aren't yet added, like being able to change your character's look after creation, and there are messages that it's going to be added later.

I'll definitely be continuing to play this. The story is intriguing and it's a beautiful world to survive in.

Edited: After 15+ hours I have to add a few things.
1. The animations for gathering are wonderful, as trees or ore slowly falls apart, and the sounds are so satisfying.
2. Messing with your home realm via minor cards is a lot of fun. You can really help yourself out, or totally screw yourself.
3. Companions are a bit like Skyrim companions except you can't marry them, which is ok, because they're like Skyrim companions, as interesting as dirt. Carry my burdens!
4. The environments are BEAUTIFUL. Weather effects are also gorgeous. The sound of rain! Ahhhh.
5. I'd like more clothing and building options sooner, because it's a visible way to see progress, and I like progress.
6. It feels like there are too many types of materials to craft with, as in too many different types and levels of ore etc, but that may even out over time.
7. The climbing picks are a great idea but extremely janky to use. I don't trust them.

Visually the game looks good, water looks amazing.

The stamina drains so fast, probably drains slower later in the game. But when it is used for everything and drains after a few seconds or running, swimming, or gliding with umbrella..
It gets annoying fast...

The building seems ok, except that you go into a pause menu pick what you want to build, place a few down and then back into the pause menu to pick a wall or whatever part you are building..

The upside to the building is it tells you all the mats needed for the full build after planning it out

Needs a better menu for initial build

Not being able to use items from a chest for crafting or building is hug downside. Especially since it has different rarity levels of everything you pick up.
Trying to find what you need later on would be a nightmare..

The combat seemed rather week or maybe the AI needs work. Did encounter one named mob who seemed to have abilities, but would freeze when trying to use them and just move around again.

Due to the complexity of Crafting systems, I think the quests lead people astray. They tell you to go places/kill bosses without informing you that you need to do every Single type of portal first in order to get the patterns to make new gear/weapons to fight the bosses with.

The first couple of quests are great and do a good job of preparing you, but once you get past the first Realm, it does little to inform/teach that there are patterns you can get from each world type and that these patterns are required to progress. Also, the crafting system is very complex with how the benches/Augments work. Be prepared to read a lot haha!

If you do not rush the game, it will take 25-30hrs until you unlock Guns/Magic. Which I think is a bit on the long side when these forms of combat are something the game advertises and many players want. 
Questing aside, The combat animations are a bit clunky as well, and there can be long loading screens (2-5 min) when phasing between realms.

Firstly, you should watch videos before purchasing this game. The first hour you make your character, watch the cut-scene, listen to Puck, and proceed through the three small areas provided to teach the game while finding goodies like potions left to prepare you. Past that, Puck tasks you to learn base building and sends you off to a local merchant who only gives you even more items for base building and crafting. In other words, the first two hours are basic elements that tbh are no different than similar games. Hard to determine if you like a game with this.

Secondly, many of you may be determining if you are going to buy Nightingale or Enshrouded. Comparing the two may shed some light even for those who are not considering this. I will detail Enshrouded only enough to highlight Nightingale for this review, the opposite for Enshrouded's. 

EDIT: There are tricks to character customization that help but I'm not getting into it here. Still Nightingale's faces are extreme and Enshrouded's is simple, choose a face and go and it has a much smoother start. END EDIT. 

In Enshrouded, you get right to fighting and base building is fast (yet surprisingly versatile since you can alter every single block). Nightingale however has a deeper story and is stunningly beautiful (at least my starter world is). Puck talks to you, helps you understand what is going on and what your goals are, but the beginning is a slog of old school crafting, base-building survival that keeps you locked down at your base for way too long, crafting one station after another (I'm at seven stations in my little stick house and this is my first day playing this game). Combat so far only requires getting the mob to lunge at you and side step, then wack a few times and repeat. Enshrouded has dodge rolls and more fluid and creative AI for its mobs. EDIT: I still find Nightingale's combat boring. Poor AI. I cheese fights easily and mobs use overly obvious move sets. END EDIT. In Enshrouded, I spent the first few hours fighting and exploring; In Nightingale, I've spend the first few hours gathering resources and unlocking stuff in a stick house. This is a shame because visually and creatively Nightingale is a dream (Shakespearean pun intended) when compared to Enshrouded. This is the reason I've give this game a positive review so far. I love travelling around this creative and beautiful world; I want this game to succeed and hope the slog becomes less and the excitement grows. 

That said, I will edit this review in the coming days to let you know more. I hope my Shakespearean dreamworld comes true  and this game keeps its thumbs up from me.

EDIT: Some objectives are just not intuitive. There's a section closed with an electrical fence that pushes you back when you try to enter; it has the first boss fight that unlocks the cards you need to advance. You raise scores to get entrance, but what they don't tell you is that the fence doesn't disappear, you just have to push your way through it when your score is high enough. I wasted some time here.

Finally.  I'm 70 years old and have been gaming since my Amiga computer in the '80s.  I do NOT play 1st person games because I suck at them.  I love crafting and building.  However, my 2nd most played game (following Rimworld) is 7 Days to Die with 2600 hours.  I don't really like 7DtD.  I'm not into the whole zombie thing.  I don't like the run-down broken environment.  I don't like the whole horde attack thing.  The character graphics really suck and, after 10+ yrs in EA, there's still no story at all.   I do like the survival aspects, provided I can dial them down to grandma level, which I can do in 7DtD.  And I love the voxel-based crafting and building that does not look like Leggo.

I always dreamed of a game where I could actually be a character in a beautiful world.  Not a linear story RPG, but an RPG-like game with progression, good graphics, and Nightingale gives that.  The gear-based progression is as good as any other system of character growth.  The grind is the same as in any crafting/gathering game.  And I actually get that ""Gee, I wonder what that is over there!"" feeling...often.  Even though there's a lot of unfilled space, there are enough little encounters with animals and sites to keep the exploration great.  I like the building mechanics; not as fiddly as the voxel-style.  I don't see 3D irl, so this is much easier.

There are obviously issues.  Some examples:  The keyboard keys lose focus frequently (ESC stops working periodically...thank you for the Close button).  It's 50/50 whether you load properly or get a tool bar of shovels (TAB, run cursor over them brings back the icons).  The slight rest potion does nothing at all.  How to close a window is very inconsistent.  And I will very often lose connectivity when changing realms.  So the game isn't what I would call ""stable"" yet.  And if you remember the launch of any MMO back a few years, you'll recognize the feeling of frustration with servers that won't let you in.  But the game works pretty well for me.  Yes, I play on grandma difficulty, but the realm tailoring is what stands out.  I can adjust difficulties in-game.  The crafting system is quite fiddly -- OK by me -- and the interface is funky but I got used to it.

All in all, this is the game I've been waiting nearly 40 years for people and technology to make.  Thank you Inflexion Games.  I don't know how much time I've got left, but you've made the gaming ride worthwhile after all.",1708729158,1708729158,True,585,23,0.93321382999420166,27,True,False,True

The game was advertised as online required, so they bought a game that requires online and complained? Doesn't matter now though, devs are working on an offline mode for those that live in war torn countries with unstable connection or 3rd world backwaters like the UK.

My best description of the game is Conan Exiles with a better combat system. It's clearly not complete, so content might not match, but it's a solid start. The randomization factor of being able to travel to different worlds with different mutators helps keep things interesting. There are pretty basic companions that can help with combat and some passive harvesting.

Performance is not ideal, but it's not the worst either. Again it's early access.

It's one of those games where you slowly invest your time in building your base, crafting your gear and upgrading said gear. One reviewer thinks that we should have access to end game content as soon as possible, which is idiotic to me. I don't think Conan Exiles, Ark, or any other survival crafting game does this.

Pros:
-The crafting alone is very enjoyable, and I've only really begun to scratch the surface. There is a lot to dig into, between finding advanced recipes, using better mats, and different augmentation combos to help with crafting.
-Survival wise it's pretty similar to others, and in a decent spot in my opinion. Not too harsh where you have to spend too much time micro-managing it, but does need to be kept up with or you'll have to deal with some annoying debuffs. 
-Weapons/tools feel good so far, and there's plenty of grind for those who enjoy that. 
-Graphics are absolutely gorgeous, especially the coastal areas. Game runs pretty smooth on my 3080 with everything maxed (1440p).
-The lore is interesting, and the realm concept is pretty novel (and well done imo.)

Neutral:
-Building isn't terrible by any means, but missing some QoL stuff. 

Cons:
-Networking errors when changing realms sometimes.
-Combat can be a little simplistic at times (AI needs work.)
-NPC hirelings are useful as meat shields and pack mules, but really need their AI fleshed out as well.
-Scattered bugs (nothing game breaking so far, though.)
-Storage/UI needs some work, and the ability to use mats directly from storage for crafting (in the works already per the devs.)

Overall this is a definite buy in my book as I feel I've already gotten my money's worth, and yet I've only scratched the surface. There are great bones here, and with some polish/QoL stuff this is set up to be an absolute gem. Launch has had some hiccups, but has gone *much* smoother than many AAA games of late.

So why am I not recommending it?

Simple - host server controls. This is a six player co-op survival game similar to Conan Exiles, Valheim, etc. Conan servers can be hosted by players on their own or rented hardware. From 10-60 players can join. But with Nightingale, every time you enter a portal it has to communicate with the devs servers. We know this because right now every time you change realms you get a disconnect and have to reload and retry five times to complete the transfer. Why would they control connections to realms that are already part of a game we paid for? This isn't an MMO ... only one reason seems viable: future microtransactions. They likely will plan to offer more rich and rewarding realms/spheres to people who buy proprietary portal cards in a store, DLC, maybe even selling essence outright. And the only way to keep people from gaining access without paying (hacks/mods)? They make you authenticate to their servers first. IF this is accurate, that would mean the devs will not allow workshop or nexus mods and thus greatly limit the kind of expansion that we see in almost every survival genre game released to date. You have been warned of this possibility.

Bads:
1. The disconnects themselves are unbearable. Network error, failure to connect, relog five or more times to play a single player or at best 6-player co-op?
2. Parkour is painful - climbing picks are worthless and stamina drains WAY too quick to complete any agility trials. Building foundations and stairs is the only way to complete those. You bounce off of anything and break your ankle.
3. Characters swim worse than Lia Thomas.",1708726717,1708726717,False,5,1,0.505873024463653564,0,True,False,True

The real reason I would not recommend this game, would be because it requires you to be connected to their servers to play. Even on a solo playthrough. It is neat that you can join your friend's world even when they are not online, and the measures taken to ensure that strangers can not simply come uninvited are nice, however I do not believe this justifies having players depend on the company's capabilities and willingness to maintain their servers.

Any time they have issues with their servers, you will not be able to log in and play.
If you stay AFK (or just crafting in your base) for too long, the AFK timer will kick you off the game.
If your internet is not working, you will not be able to play
And most importantly, ONCE (not if) this game is no longer supported by the company, it will simply vanish. Because that is the nature of every online only game.

I liked the art style and the setting. The card system for generating and altering worlds is interesting. The crafting system allows for more variety, and there are some qol features in the building, exploration, and crafting systems that I enjoyed, so this game has a lot of promise. 

The problem is that the game does not deliver in regards to a lot of the core components, such as combat and progression. Combat in this game is very generic. Each weapon has 1 attack, and they feel very similar to each other. There is not any mechanical depth to the combat, as the enemies are poorly designed and the AI is horrible. Most enemies will rush you in a large group, and fighting them is just a matter of blocking until they finish their attack, and swinging back. Most of the challenge is created through the volume of enemies that swarm you, which just gets to be annoying instead of fun. Then there are enemies that are impossible to consistently dodge. The bosses and some of the rarer enemies have attacks that have a huge range, will overpower your ability to block, and attack with such a frequency that it is hard to hit them and move out of the way. The follower AI is even worse, and at a certain point they just become fodder, and barely do anything. The progression also needs a lot of work. A lot of the difficulties you unlock don't do anything that the previous ones didn't, so there is a lot of content that does not serve a purpose. Upgrading gear, and understanding what you need to be doing is also unclear, and leaves me frustrated and bored instead of interested in what works and what does not. Some of the survival aspects to this game feel really out of place as well. The tiredness mechanic, as well as weather such as hail and the cold of night are just annoying, and don't serve much purpose.

It is early access, please give them some room.   I come from 4000 hours of Rust, play, and yes I find the controls different.   However there is probably good reason for it, being the depth of the crafting.   There is also a visualization of what you are building, before it is completed, which is completely different from other games I have played.

After playing now over 10 hours, and dealing with some frustration of the controls, the potential depth of the game begins showing itself.   I look forward to further discovery.   The path is not obvious.   It will be interesting, where it goes with the elemental inputs into each manufactured item.    What potentially goes in, has an effect on the end product.   This could get very interesting, which therefore will contribute to a depth of play. 

I have now played almost 30 hours.   The game keeps getting better as you understand it.   Yes the crafting is complex.   But that is part of the fun.   

Also the multiple worlds to access by cards, looks promising, but I have not investigated that far yet.    Multiple worlds, equals different depths of difficulty.   Different depths of difficulty, equals development of character at your own pace.

I think the developers have put some thought into the game, leaving it open ended in terms of directional character development.  

To get away from the same old, same old, games you have to create mystery.   That element is here.   A story is of no use, if you can figure out the ending before you are finished.    A game is of no use, if it is the same as the last one you have played.     This game is different, I look forward to continuing playing it for some time. 

I therefore highly recommend the game.   There is quality and quantity here, to keep you entertained.

One example a solution for some of the complaints.   My backpack and carry weight is so small.   This is now part of the character development, effected by how/what you eat, and what help you can hire/get.

In generall i recommend this game as an EARLY ACCEESS Release for under 30 bucks, but you need to see it as that.

It is in Early Access and the Dev's explicitly said the wanna advance the game based on player feedback,
so im finding it interesting that people who didnt even play the game for 20 hrs without even seeing the start of the current end-game content and already come to conclusions about the whole game.

Technical:
First of all, technically besides a few disconnects and a few minor bugs it is one of the better online game releases that did not have massive server issues in the first few days.

Online:
The forced online nature is part of the game since it is a co-op/group game that isnt at its current state to be played completely solo, especially later in the game. But the Devs already took feedback and working on a offline version.

The Worlds: 
You only have 3 Biomes to start, a few Major Cards to set the difficulty and the general tone of the worlds.
After you get into that world you have a lot of Modification Cards that mostly change the playe/crafting stats or change the world entirely.
Only one of this modification cards can be active at once. This leaves you with around 12ish more or less individual worlds in the early game with some differences in creatures/nature or visual.

World activities:
These are based on the World you choose with your cards, but agreed are pretty repetitive after a few hours.
This consist out of sequence and search puzzles, defense and enemie camp combat activies, rare animal hunts and help on building npc housing. 

Creatures:
Also based on the choosen world, mostly biome, these are also pretty repetitive.
Only real exception are the boss monsters you can find in special hunt worlds, which are a bit more challenging.
The same goes for dungeons you can embark later on in the game.

The Crafting: 
You have to choose a recipe, then fill it with the ingredients, then click to start crafting.
Sometimes you also need to fuel and light up a fire in addition. This seems tedious until you realize that in the game there are different levels and stats for ingredients. So a Fur from a simple boar is different from a Fur from a rare mythical creature.
If you use the rare one in your recipes the result has better stats upon them. In addition crafting tables can be affected by upgrades placed in their vicinity by either unlocking new recipes or improving the outcome.

Building:
The game has a blueprint system, so you can plan your base completely before starting to build,
the choices are very limitied in the early game and more building types and architecture is unlocked at a later part of the game,
therefore early bases feel like makeshift block huts not like real homes with more artistic freedom.
A nice touch here are extensions for crafting tables that sometimes fit the table (like a hanging pan would fit in a kitchen) and do actually have an impact to the crafting and are not just aesthetic.

Combat/Movement:
The Movement in the game feels really nice and going to combat, the animations feel nice also the feedback for hits is there but could need some small improvements to just get a little bit more *umph*. You tend to just buttonsmash attacks until you are out of stamina, then notice you are out and go back to regain stamina and repeat. This changes with the first guns and boss monsters where you get more into acutally aiming for headshots.

Dungeons:
Later in the game you can kinda unlock worlds with dungeons or go from a hub world directly into ones, These are definitly more challenging with bigger enemy groups and boss monsters with a loooooot of health. Here again seems to be an opportunity to improve bossmonsters with more complexity like multiple phases in combat.

Since there is no official roadmap and the devs announced they will go for feedback of players, this could go really positive or bad based on what their takes are from that feedback.
I personally like the looks and the general feel of this game and i'm eager to see not only the full end-game but also having everything base building related unlocked.
Most of the improvements i could think of for this game are UX related:
Crafting -> Prefill resources after choosing a recipe, maybe get the closest chest as target/source?
Building -> Easier to find out which extensions benefit which crafting tables.
Quests and NPC -> If you dont read like reading tons of text, these feel dull and more in the background then they should be. The main quests are what are driving the progress for your character.
Tutorial -> A lot more needs to be explained, starts with certain UI Elements like bottom left (Bars and Buffs) and right (Actions) to general shortcut usage (hold E for Area pickup?). Also things like Extensions for Crafting tables are not really explained.
Some UI -> Comparing Cards or remembering which are major/minor cards could be improved. 
Generally to have some sort of notebook you can right your own notes in would be nice and fitting for the setting.

Of course expanding the game in general with more biomes and creatures and activities will be the key for this game to be a success.",1708725454,1708725454,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Very happy to hear about the internet connection requirement being removed as a priority. I will gladly give the game another try a few updates in, once the changes have been made. 


ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:

I do not recommend this game at this time, based on the following:

- Requiring an internet connection to play a singleplayer campaign in a survival game is a non-starter. I lost progress because your servers fluctuated. It wasn't a ton, yet, but that is simply not acceptable to me. Not to mention server downtime like its an MMORPG? Absolutely not. Long term, this will probably mean at some point I will lose rare materials, building progress, or quest progress because of a server disconnection. There are NO systems that are worth this trade off, the only thing I can see is that you can buy the ability to visit an offline world, which is not worth it. This simply cannot stay the way it is. 

- The early game is painfully dry and tedious. Everything takes an absurd amount of resources to craft; making a small four square hut with a roof took about 30 minutes and like ~50?? wood or some crazy amount like that. Worse, wood and stone (as well as other materials) weigh a TON, meaning you can't stock up on a large amount easily unless you abuse a NPC inventory. 

- There's a lot of small quality-of-life stuff that this game had a long time to learn off of other Survival games. Crafting/building not taking into account your stored materials. Overly punishing encumbrance. Dropped items rather than depositing them in your inventory.  Loot sources are arbitrary in how much they give you (massive tree = 3 logs, minor log on ground = same sometimes).

- Resources shouldn't have different variants, especially simple ones. I do not need several different types of plant fiber. I can see it now, that the fucking inventory will eventually get filled with different types of resources that have ""higher quality"" when they are functionally similar.

- Crafting feels cumbersome and confusing from my early uses of the system.

- The game just fundamentally doesn't feel ready yet. Something about it just isn't quite there. I was initially impressed by the visuals and the gameplay feel, but once you get into the meat of it, it just feels rough.

- Combat feels okay, but isn't anything special. It looks like combat gets more involved in later game from the trailers, maybe incorporate more of that into the early game.

The one positive thing I can say is that I really enjoyed the aesthetic of the world, which was very pretty. I also liked the Fae Guardian and his voice acting. I think there's a lot of promise in the systems and the gameplay I have seen, but it just isn't there yet at all.

I recommend waiting for a few large patches before you give this game a try.",1708492269,1708723675,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Nightingale is a fantastic game either solo or with friends. Inflexion have crafted a deep, atmospheric experience that is visually stunning and rewards exploration.
Are there issues? Of course, combat - while improved since the closed play test - sometimes feels floaty and incoming hit detection needs work.  
Some POIs begin to appear repetitive as you progress and the gear score requirement for entering boss areas is, in my opinion, questionable.
The crafting system needs attention and resources pulling from chests would be a great QOL (if they worked it into the in game progression similar to how Enshrouded handled it I would be stoked and it would be lore appropriate too) but if you're looking for a shallow, basic system go elsewhere, don't ask the devs to dumb down the process because you're too lazy to learn.
Much of the negative feedback I've seen relates to the issue that the game is 'always online' (which is being rectified soon). In response here's an idea - before you spend your hard earned money on a game how about a little research? It has been clear since day one that Nightingale was going to be a live service game - if thats a deal breaker for you go play Minecraft rather than leaving negative reviews for a game developed by a team that have always been open and transparent about their vision.
I personally hope that the promised offline mode draws more players into what is quite possibly the most interesting early access foundation for a game in years - the possibilities for expanding on the core concepts of what Nightingale is blows my mind.

Nightingale does that, you are doing the upgrades and resource harvesting and hunting for a *reason*, you need them to progress through the story that's woven into the game. Gotta get to the next tier of gear score to access the next tower of power, so that you can then access the next tier of realms, repeat. Its all in a solid line, and it does a really good job of keeping you engaged. 

Now, there are a few things about the game I do take issue with, as annoyances. 

You need Augments (physical objects you place down inside your base) to power your crafting tables to be able to make specific things. Your crafting tables only have so many augment slots. So if you have too many augments that effect that crafting table near it, it wont accept the extra augments, and the objects it lets you make. So you have to delete another augment you put down, to open up the slot, so that slot can be taken up by a different augment, that lets you make the thing you want. This to me is ridiculous, as well as the super short range of influence each of the Augments has. So if you want to build the crafting section of your base and make the most efficient use of your augments, you need to pile all your augments in the center, and build your crafting stations around those. Even though its obvious that alot of stations (like the blacksmith forge) were designed to be placed against walls. If you do build your base with your crafting stations against walls, you will end up needing to make 2 or 3 of several augments to place around the middle of your base so that they can all effect all the crafting stations they can, because their effect range is so short. 

Your follower has several bad habits, including dumping off their carried inventory into random chests, and eternally grabbing all your paper and expensive, rare, processed wooden items to feed them into your campfire and forge. You absolutely have to keep all of your burnable objects inside of a chest that you do not allow anyone but yourself access to, or else he will keep every fire you have merrily blazing away, eating all your valuable resources whether you are using the fires or not. Out in the wild, if you are surrounded by rare ore, valuable crystal, and otherwise fairly useless lumps of sandstone, you better believe if you stop for 5 seconds, instead of mining the useful things, he will be chipping away at the useless rocks and filling BOTH of your inventories with them. 

I've got a few other small gripes, but honestly the games been out for 3 days and I've got 32 hours in. Its absurd how the game has grabbed me and pulled me in, its engaging, challenging, and very good looking. The combat feels like it has *weight*, when your axe hits something, you know it. And my god the shotgun, it sounds and feels better than any other shotgun in any other game I've ever played, including games built *exclusively* around shooting other people with shotguns. 

All in all a big thumbs up from me, but the issues that I have with the crafting system and the follower AI are fairly grating, and I very much hope the devs put in adjustments and fixes for them.",1708721930,1708721930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Traveling is way too slow - mounts or whatever is planned needs to arrive asap.
The grind for T1+ essence for gear upgrades is boring and mostly based on traveling from ""event"" to ""event"", which brings me back to 'Traveling is way too slow'.

What I need to see be added or adjusted for the game are:
- faster traveling: mounts, vehicles or similiar
- fix climbing
- stamina consumption when gliding with an umbrella, or when climbing needs a major adjustment. I can realistically reach my arms higher than I can climb with 130 Stamina
- AI Survivor controls. This ***hole Survivor keeps dropping trees on my head mid combat, instead of participating in the fight
-> A higher recruitment limit than 1, with the above mentioned controls I could send one out for logging, another for mining, a third for gardening, etc.
- Light level adjustment in caves. It's too dark and exhausting on my eyes. Turning the Gamma up will have my eyes burned when I run into a sun-like light source (torches, etc do not illuminate much and in caves not at all)

- a lot of stupid UI things, whether it be inventory management or trying to find crafting recipes
- the grind is real and not fun, like upgrade every piece of gear for every phase it seems
- general confusion in what to do a lot of the time, things just aren't explained well
- the unenjoyable game of ""can i climb this?"" - sure i've climbed the same thing before, but can I climb it this time?
- tedious puzzles - like I was doing a sequence puzzle spread across an annoying to traverse area that had SEVEN nodes. And it takes a full 30 seconds for it to run thru the sequence. So crawl all around, jump up etc finding nodes. If you just missed that one activating now you can wait another 30 seconds to figure out which order this one is in. Then on to the next, then time to finally enter the sequence omg it's just so annoying. (Ended up marking with unbuilt crafting stations so like campfire meant that was #1 etc...SEVEN NODES ...I mean it's just annoying)
- repetitive already - like the same 3 or 4 activities and they're just not that great
- not a lot of variety in enemies though some of them are imaginative
- the realms system is just not good - like it sounds like it has promise but in reality you just get a bunch of disconnected, boring, maps that take forever to load. Need a crafting material from your home node for a quest? Good luck you can now spend literally up to 10 minutes to warp home (loading screen/connecting screen) grab it, wait for portal to re-open (takes a few minutes) traverse it (another loading/connecting screen)

So I'm changing this to a do not recommend. It's got a lot of style but no substance. (I think of the 3 open world survival games i've bought in the past month, enshrouded still stands out)


Nightingale's greatest strength is its world building and overall atmosphere. It's fairly standard survival craft stuff, a touch grindy, but as it's fresh it hasn't been an issue. Runs fine for me (modest system a few years old, 3070 graphics card, 16gb of ram). I haven't seen enough of the realms system yet to pass judgement, but it's very intriguing. 

Few things I found confusing here and there, but nothing too bad. The biggest issue with the game is always online, even playing player, which, IMO, is a huge mistake. Like my complaints have been delays logging in (to my own SP game), and the first server maintenance was a disaster - like an hour or whatever it was of maintenance in a brand new game is perfectly fine and understandable - but the game did not communicate what was going on just said shard unavailable. Now I eventually went to the discord and saw that was the case, but I feel like a lot of people will just see that it's down and not playable.

Pros:
Beautiful Scenery
Amazing crafting system with depth and complexity
Variety in equipment and clothing
A ridiculous amount of cosmetic items for customizing your base
Card System allows the devs to constantly add new content without forcing a restart.

Cons:
The biggest one is restricting players to Abeyance realms only for their homes.  This is a silly restriction as players will quickly out grow the location and find exotic new ones they want to colonize.
NPC AI as they constantly put wood into fires, even if it's your high tier wood, they are OK but super slow at gathering resources etc. Making their only use really combat sponge and minor pack mule.
some serious need of QoL improvements, ie. ESC works most of the time to close windows but sometimes bugs out.  In those instances it's really apparent that the ""Close"" button isn't consistent, sometimes on top, sometimes on bottom, etc.  Benches and such should allow resources from chests nearby.  Would also love a key to auto put resources into a box that already contains it instead of having to open each one, etc.

All said and done after 32 hours, I'm still really enjoying this game and I can't wait till our group finds the gear to fight off some of those big world bosses!

Now to the game and my thoughts.
The always online is frustrating when playing solo but that will soon be fixed. Hopefully my realm will be as it is. When playing co-op I've had some issues with disconnections but I could always log right back into the realm. I also noticed it mostly disconnected me when I entered a portal at the same time as my friend so I started entering after him and seems to be working, not 100% sure but it's something.

The combat: People are complaining about boring combat. I hope they say the same about Skyrim and Fallout 4 and similar games then. What is Skyrim? Spam left click until the enemy is dead. Same here except that here you want to aim a little bit even with melee weapon because striking an enemy on the head will deal bonus damage so that's something to think of. It's the most satisfying sound when you hit the enemy that way.
All weapons/tools (your tools are your weapons basically) are good at different things as well. There's a thought behind the tools, at least that's the impression I get. I haven't tried the hammer yet so I'm not sure how well that weapon works against enemies but for example, the pickaxe is much more effective against machines than an axe but axes are slightly faster to swing with plus their attack swings can at times be better against animals, easier to hit their heads.

I've only unlocked the first pistol you get, it wont take you 30 hours to do that btw, I've spent 50% of my time co-op and 50% solo on 2 different characters so maybe around 8-14 hours before the first pistol depending on how quickly you go through the quests.
The first pistol is a nice looking one, good design, and as for the combat and effectiveness of it, the game becomes something else when you unlock it. Ammo will be needed, a lot of it but it's a very nice addition to my arsenal. It's not very effective against machines though.
I haven't unlocked any real offensive magic yet but using magic in combat is definitely viable and useful. It's a nice way of doing magic, connecting it too your weapons and the animations are really nice. Looking very much forward to unlocking more.

Let's touch on the bugs and all that crap. They exist, they annoy me, I want them gone, the developer is working hard at fixing them and I wish them the best. The end!

The companions you get, you can have 1 each per playing so a full team of 6 players will have 6 companions as well, they are useful but stupid. They will become your pack mules like in Skyrim, they'll carry all the ore and wood and such for then you're out looking for material. I can't recommend unlocking chests for them, at least not the chest with wood as they will use all wood to ignite fires in your smelters and cooking stations so beware of that, you might loose a bit of wood there. You might be burning your nice carved wood when making those ingots. I hope the developers implement a way to lock out the companions from crafting stations.

Lastly I want to mention the visuals. On my PC they are stunning. Can't remember what settings I'm playing at but the game looks very good. Except for the character faces for some reason. The character creator is really nice with some unique elements to it like ancestry and a sort of mold tool to make you look a certain way depending on those ancestors you choose, a nice touch. But the faces look a bit... Horrible is the best word here actually.",1708718843,1708718843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Aesthetics are nice, but 5 hours was enough for me to feel like i have already seen the core loop of the game.

- The 1st/3rd person combat has no nuanced gameplay like backstep/dodge/counter, you basically just need good gearscore and buttonmash to kill stuff before it kills you.
- Early building progression is standard fare and nothing innovative.
- gathering is extremely grindy, inventory space is small, and the first storage container is needlessly small since youll just have to make a ton of small containers to store alot of loot that you wont be sure if you should use it, or save it for later.
- having to hit a certain gearscore to progress objectives takes away any option of trying to do stuff 'undergeared' intentionally
- many items were missing correct artwork icons, so managing inventory of a few hundred things at your base becomes annoying.
- the procedural caves were extremely similar, small  and had no depth to them.
- you never really feel 'lost' in the game worlds, they are too small and easily navigatable.

the only reason i didnt refund this game was the aesthetic, artstyle, and ambience of the world is really nice, and i hope there is alot more they will add to this game to give it some real depth.

Though managing so many item types and qualities all at once gets really tricky. There are other games that I have had worse. The thing that really trips me up with items are when their are things with matching icons but have different effects. Like the difference between “ predator and pray” leather or meat. That both look the same. There needs to be some form of indication which is which without having to  click on or hover over each item. 
With as many items as you end up getting the ability to build from storage is a necessity necessity, especially if you let the NPC deposit stuff into your storage, you can kiss any sort of manual organization good bye.
Also while having the NPC companion it needs some more controls like the ability to tell it to NOT gather crap just because it has an axe or a pick in its hand.  A simple toggle like (protect, build, or gather) would suffice. 
Another thing that bugged me is that creatures and monsters at a distance just stand in one spot and do nothing until you’re within spitting distance at which point they just auto attack you. Stealth or not from my experience. Which wrecks any kind of immersion IMO.
Then there is the POIs (not the ones with portals) they’re basically all empty, if you’re lucky there is a chest, a sigil and maybe you get ambushed by enemies. But most of them are all the same design within the same biome and have nothing that really rewards you for bothering to explore it just empty space inside. For the  'portal' 'gated' ones of which i only did the first one. There was a handful full of groups of evil fae the boss at the end and a LONG clime down. Which did not feel that long while there was things to fight, but having to backtrack all the way back up was a PIA. An optional teleport or something to bring back to the entrance would be nice. 
Playing in a group was also annoying, if we wanted to zip back to say my base to drop of loot or make more food only I could teleport to my base, she telaported  back to hers, and then if she wanted to rejoin me she would have to port back over to my Realm with the address card, or if she did not have one of those I would have to manually re-invite her to join my realm.

One of which I wish there was a ""maybe"" option...

EN
I love the game, i really do,  and I still think recommend it but you need to be aware of some short comings imo. I'm not especially an aficionado of survival crafting, more an RPG kind of guy but, when possible, I do end up using mods or in game option to add survival and immersions options to my games. I watched Enshrouded launch but decided not to buy it. Nightingale tho, had me hooked and hyped. I still am glad I waited for it and liking it even tho I will name a few things I currently not like but am hopeful they will get address in part or in totality, many other did point to some or all these grievances. So here are my beef: 

I hate the fact that it's currently server side ( you need to be online to play, even in solo mode)
I hate ""waiting for server"" each time I log in.
I hate there is no pause
If I did like the (rather long) intro/tutotrial but,  I am not willing to do it again to start another toon and chose different options.
The grind is real. And you have limited inventory and EVERYTHING is link to stamina which is depleted fast. Drops are too small and illogical imo. A hippopotamus will give you 2 bones, 2 skin and 2 meat. same as a bull or quite smaller kangourou-ish predator thing.  You can collect plant fibre with your hand (the only thing not linked to stamina) OR use your Scythe (which IS link to stamina) to collect...the exact same amount. Many have pointed that using scythe should give you more fibre and/or provide with another resource.
You can recruit NPC which are supposed to help you, while exploring or farming resources but they barely seem to. Would help to have a follower menu where you could give basic commands (harvest this or that or follow me).
Base construction is from your inventory. We need either a general construction box or multiple resource specefic ones from where you and/or your followers would automatically pick from to construct, these would also serve as drop points when ordering your followers to harvest resources or, if playing multi, where friends could drop their excess resources.

That said, the setting, graphic and base story really are compelling to me, the price is good and judging byt the fun I am enjoying already, I cannot but give it a thumbs up nonetheless. The dev reputation and past achievements also weight a lot in my confidence that most of these, if not all will in some way be address in the future.  Been a while I haven't be thrill this much by a game.

Un de ces jeux qui pourrait avoir un ""peut-être"" comme option ...
Je trip plus sur les RPG que les survival/crafti1g mais quand je peux j'utilise les options ou les mods pour ajouter des élément de réalisme et de survie à mes jeux.  J'avais cependant très hâte à la sortie de Nightingale, j'ai lorgné longtemps Enshrouded mais à date chu ben content d'avopir attendu. Je donne un pouce en l'air mais faut savoir qu'il y a unbe couple de bémol qui pourrait faire pencher la balance pour certain à savoir:

Toujour en ligne (oui même solo) c'est gossant. j'ai pas eu trop de problème à date ais parfois un reload ou au login faut ""attendre le serveur"" un bout. bon pour ma part le plus long ça été 5 minute avant que le message change pour ""preparing world"". Faut savoir que cela veut dire, pas de pause, donc si on prévoit un afk de plus que 5 min et comme les besoins de notre pesro (manger/dormir) continueront de descendre, vaut mieux sortir du jeux. 
Le jeux a un intro/tuto obligatoire, pour l'instant entéka, pas moyen de sauter si mettons on veut se partir un autre perso. En fait, j'ai bien aimé, l'espèce de narrateur (Puck de ""songe d'une nuit d'été"" de Shakespear) est juste parfait pour le setting et je trouve que ça met bien la table pour l'histoire de base . Mais bon, une fois c'est assez (un peu comme la carriole dans skyrim quoi) .
Le grind de ouf! Pour l'instant les drop de ressources sont assez poche et pas full immersif. Un hippopotame te donne les mêmes ressources qu'èa peu près toutes les autres bêtes j'ai pu tués.  Aussi TOUT (à l'exception des fibres végétal que l'on peut récolter avec nos mains ""E"" ) est lié à notre stamina qui n'est pas des masses. et notre capacité de transport devient vite dépassé (plus de sprint) et pour le building et le crafting, tout est lié à l'inventaire perso. Il y a donc un manque ici, pour des inventaire lié soit généraux ou spécifique. Il y a bien des NPC que l'ont peut recruté et qui sont supposé nous aidé à la récolte, au building et ç l'exploration mais c'est strictement basique pour l'instant, on  ne peut les commander pour des tâches spécifique et fouille moi si il foutent vraiment de quoi... Pour l'instant elle  (j'en ai juste trouvé une) est plus souvent  planté avec sa tronche de cake dans mon putain de chemin... Enfin bref, ça reste encore basique mais les graphiques (même sur mon toaster équipé d'une patate graphique) sont super, et le setting, l'histoire est passionante. Donc malgré ces quelques problème que j'ai nommé et d'autres que ça me tente pas d'énuméré parce que j'ai envie de retourner jouer, je dirait encore ""Ta yeule pis prend mon cash"", j'ai de toute façon pas mal espoir que la plupart, sinon tout ces points seront éventuellements revus et corrigés.

That being said, let's just jump into the meat of it and go pros vs cons.

Pros:
-It looks beautiful.  I've always said that Skyrim has some of the best sky boxes, especially at night, but this game is a very close second.

-Being able to customize your lineage and have that potentially influence how your character looks, while it has some hiccups, is definitely unprecedented as far as character creators go.  Kudos to them for trying something new.

-The crafting and combat is really engaging. The fact that your equipment can look different depending on what you use to craft it is a very nice touch. Also the only game I've seen where you can instakill enemies by shooting their heart is very unique, and forces you to really study your enemies instead of just blindly rushing them.

Cons:

-Everything.  Costs.  Stamina.  Stamina management in this game can be a nightmare.  The fact that I can sprint halfway across a map before running out of stamina, but can't use the climbing picks for more than 2 seconds is kind of baffling.

-The idea of having 2 sets of hot keys for both hands, while it sounds good on paper, it's pretty awkward in practice.  Having to let go of my mouse or movement keys just to switch to my umbrella is cumbersome and clunky. I'd suggest using a key modifier plus scroll wheel to scroll our offhand slots.

-Being able to craft items from storage is the default of 90% of survival crafting games, so it beggars belief why this game chose to forgo that on release.

With all that being said, I'm still going to give this game a thumbs up.  Not for what it is now, but for what it has the potential to be.  Because under the clunkyness and weird design decisions, there's a fantastic game that just needs some nuturing to become easily one of the best survival games in 2024.",1708716793,1708717003,True,2,0,0.502323448657989502,0,True,False,True

i'm also hoping that maybe it's very early access and they will add a bunch more updates and improvements (or take community advice and tweak things), but i've been having quite anti fun honestly.

it feels almost MORE grindy and less active than palworld (and my opinion of that one isn't very high, if not obvious) - but as I said, maybe that's just because I'm solo. But having progression locked behind a gear score requirement that doesn't really lead you instinctively to make gear upgrades is confusing - maybe cause it's different and I need more practice.

The persistant server feature also sounds nice, but if you play solo at all, it can be rough to wait 7 minutes or more sometimes to load - and be wary if you walk away for too long you'll get auto disconnected from inactivity XD
hopefully this also can be fixed with updates and load speeds will increase 

all in all, still on the fence (because this game seems to have multiplayer a NECESSITY rn) but needs one or two more options if you want to try for the solo run, and should get better.

For now, wait it out and see where they go would be my best recommendation

The game runs fine and looks great, and yes, it is obviously unfinished, but the “gaming audience” at large has started expecting [u]WAY[/u] too much out of early access releases. 

People need to stop going into these expecting a 10/10 flawless experience or unlimited, perfectly balanced depth. Everything I have seen so far is very promising, and I am reviewing this based on the assumption that it will improve based on the level of quality on display so far, which suggests a great final product.

Let’s not forget that a bunch of people were complaining about the Baldur’s Gate 3 early excess being “too expensive” and “too hard” and ""too short"" and “too unbalanced”. While I don’t expect this to be the next BG3, it’s still illustrative of the point that early access means very little when it comes to the final product, and you all need to stop buying and complaining about unfinished games.

If, like me, you are perfectly fine with a bit of beta jankyness, and you know that this is the type of game you like, and you just want to get in early and go along for the ride to RC1, then I can recommend what is here.

While I understand people's gripes about it being online-only, I've found the convenience of having a persistent, shared world that myself or my friends can load into at will to work on things, without having to worry about hosting a server somewhere ourselves, a huge positive. I agree with the general sentiment that having an offline option makes sense too, though, just isn't a deal breaker for me personally.

Much potential. Looks amazing. tutorial is awful, elements of the UI don't make sense, crafting UI sucks, combat needs work, online only with no OCE (or close) servers pissed me off (offline version announced).

However, there is something about this game that keeps hooking me in that I'm finding hard to express, There is a primal need to keep exploring and the mysterious ruins/artifacts excite the imagination. First iteration of building is fantastic, variety and flexibility even if resource management is painful.

The devs have a unique design view which I'm find very interesting even if not all parts of it have hit the mark. Obviously needs work but I guess that's why it's an early access, right?

-The biomes are all the same with the main variations seeming to be the colours of the flora and fauna and placement of sites of attraction. Its like no man sky when it first released...

I can come across and make new resources but cant make anything with them, i have a plethora of different metals and materials but cant make anything, Im assuming i will be able to later through finding other traders for blueprints. but id rather not have to play 20 hours before i can stop wearing ugly deer hide and make better weapons.

-Storage is very small and limited, no auto drop or links to crafting stations. 

-Cant split stacks of heavy material, like wood. a stack of wood is 150 kg and I HAVE to pick up the whole stack if i want to use 4 pcs of wood. Then I become encumbered moving super slow to where i need to place my material

Yes, it's in early access, so there are some early access bugs, but considering they launched in to early access earlier than originally planned in order to get some initial hot fixes implemented prior to the weekend to not leave their players hanging, I'd say they are definitely on the right track.  The developers seem to be doing all they can to keep the player base happy, so it's sad to see the negative reviews here.  

Are there quality of life improvements to be made? Absolutely, and they already know that, and are working on them.  Again, EARLY ACCESS, so if you can't handle early access games, just wait for full release.  I do think the melee combat system for the enemies could use some work, but I believe that will become better over time.  

My buddies and I have all had no issues regarding connectivity, lag, etc., and we are spread throughout the US, from east to west.  

Is it fun?  Yes
Do I get engrossed and stay up late on accident? Absolutely
Do I plan to continue playing through full release?  Definitely
Do I understand the game fuller after 14 hours of playtime?  Not even close, lol

Overall, highly recommend.  I love the building system, the crafting is super in depth in a good way, though I'm very looking forward to when you can craft using any materials in any box in your base, rather than only materials on your person.  Again, QOL improvements that they're working on.  

They're responsive to the player requests and desires, so I think this will become a very well made game.

I'm also not the hardest person to please when it comes to games, so take what I say how you will. The game has its flaws, the connection issues being the one I've primarily run into. But when compared to the rest of what I've experienced, the connection issue isn't a deal breaker. The game is in EA and there are graces that go with that. I've had a wonderful time exploring the different realms - primarily in the tutorial and have spent the majority of my time exploring one realm. The map is dotted with various different things to do and while most are ""defeat enemies"", I haven't gotten bored with that. I enjoy watching the random things that are walking around, the skybox is wonderful to just stare at (especially at night), and the building/crafting system is pretty par-for-the-course. I enjoy the ""Realm Cards"" mechanic as it plays into the idea that the Faewild is filled with all sorts of different places of varying danger levels. Character Creation while a little interesting and took me a second to figure out, I do like the way I can modify the difficultly and mix and match it at the starting point of the game.
 
TLDR: I'm really enjoying the game, sure the connection issues are a little annoying but it's not the biggest deal (at least for me). Otherwise, the aesthetic, the Faewild in general, and other survival staples such as base building and crafting are right up my alley.

Also to load a Realm takes forever to the point I start the process to open portal and go grab a bite to eat and use the restroom... Yes it's THAT SLOW.

Finally, a survival game on an Unreal Engine 5!

TECHNICAL PART:
Right of the bat I can say this is a survival game with best graphical fidelity among it's genre. On top of that it does run smooth: 50-60 fps and no sudden frame drops (ryzen 5 5600x, 4070TI, ultra settings, 3440x1440, no dlss). Also motion blur is off by default, hats of to the devs!

Launch was good for an early access game so I don't really understand people review bombing the game for not having an offline mode. Playing from the central europe and I am having 55ms of latency so online play requirement is clearly not a problem.

I have however encountered a few game crashes (while keeping my drivers up to date) - this is most likely the bad that comes with an early access game. If you absolutely can't stand game crashes, I would suggest waiting for the full release of the title.

UI design could use some improvements, there are some UI bugs that should be easily fixable:
Examples: temporarily disappearing icons on hotbar, ability to drink stone marbles if placed in potion slot.

NON-TECHNICAL PART:
Game has the best character design system I have seen in a long time. It has a ton of customization options and everything is quite easy to control and understand (you can even choose your characters teeth).

Crafting, gathering seems sort of similar to other survival games but with a bigger variety of resources to choose from. Base building is satisfactory so far. I need more time to asses this aspect of the game and will update this part of review in the future.

Combat seems well done, quite engaging, most weapons have a secondary action such as dodge/jump with a dagger or block with an axe. Ranged weapons are fine but sometimes a bit finnicky when trying to hit moving targets. If I could point out one thing that could be improved it would be the ""AI"" of the enemies.

Game has a lot of survival mechanics, in addition to food, weather effects and stamina it also has additional statuses such as shock from fall damage, poison, disease and many more.

Exploration seems to be one of the highlights of this game, there is many mysterious structures to discover, many containing puzzles that reward you resources for completion. Puzzles however are way too easy for my taste. I would love to see something bit harder than just clicking on 3 totems in a right order.

Finally I see a great potential in this game due to it's realm generating system.
Not only it provides a ton of replayability now, it could make it relatively easy for devs to bring new biomes and modifications to the game without altering existing realms where we already have our bases etc.

i would like to start this off by saying that my initial review for this, that i have since deleted, was positive. at the time, i hadn't run into any major issues. my stance on this has since changed drastically.
the game is almost completely unplayable, the lag is debilitating, and i am in NA, npcs and ai are both broken (puck). i got the unfortunate no-portal-in-swamp issue, and the game kept crashing there. now it crashes on startup. the fixes haven't chanced this :/

I've been following it for about a year and have been counting down the days before it drops. It's got a very interesting steampunk/Victorian aesthetic that was the initial reason I was drawn in.

That said, it does needs some work. It is very early access at the time of me writing this. The initial lack of an offline singleplayer mode (the devs have confirmed this is coming, but still) was disheartening. The worlds don't feel super immersive, the AI of the animals and monsters needs some work. Often times you can just run circles around them and stab them in the back for massive damage and barely ever get hit, making combat very dry and more of a mechanical motion than a fun or challenging experience. 

The music and voice acting so far is very good. The graphics are stylised and pretty. The UI is definitely there, but could use some quality of life improvements like a sort system. The build system is kind of bare bones and boring, where you just slap down a ghost of what you want then push E to instantly build it. Why is that second step even there? The Forest had a pretty good system for building where you manually put the materials onto the ghost outline. It gave a real sense of accomplishment for what you did.

The problem with this game is the time is takes to get anywhere and do anything.

I like the theme and vision, but as others have said, it takes FAR too long to do even simple tasks, and the materials req./weight limit is immensely restrictive. There is an instant teleport to your home, but it still takes a long time to build even a small home. Speaking of which, because you are on a quest for the story, and recipes are restricted to what gearscore the world is (i could be wrong but that seems to be the case, that or story progression), theres no reason to stick around in the first place.

pros: 
*very impactful swings/combat/chopping/mining
*interesting era/thematics
*i personally like the idea of a survival game with a main story
*building walls/doors/floors/roofs, etc can all be setup at once, then materials added
*third person fov and first person fov sliders
*interesting rune crafting system to stitch into gear for additional effects
*repairing equipment uses ""essense"" which can be gathered from deconstructing any item in your inventory, no longer need mats
*mobility feels great when you dash (more in cons)

Cons:
*low weight limit (even with additional backpack)
*items of practically the same thing take up multiple slots of inv. (i.e. meat from prey, meat from predator, bug meat equivalent
*cannot adjust direction following a dash, leading to possible fall damage (its a large leap too, so its not that outrageous to happen), also it seems.... silly? as a ""dodge"" you full on leap 20 feet in a direction..??
*many containers are not interactable. Literally only chests it seems
*the ui needs a complete overhaul- lots of unnecessary information that is quite overwhelming, and lacks important information (i.e. how much armor does this provide, how much damage does this do, how much weight does this increase my bag). On top of this, there is easily 5/6 clicks to do anything. Too many tabs, too many subtabs.
*as much as i like the teleport to home, it is quite immersion breaking, as you can use it LITERALLY whenever- mid combat, doesn't matter, blink, youre home. Overweight by 40%? Teleport home.

I will keep trying the game out, as i imagine later the game improves, but the base functions like the ui make it difficult to return when there are much simpler but effective crafter/survivor games out there. Updates to come as i make this journey.

The game has a wonderful and subtle way about it that keeps you gaming for hours, with a beautiful soundtrack. With some attention to detail, players will quickly notice how layered the complexity of the game is from its base building, crafting and combat to its lore. This is a true slow burn hit.

While I would prefer offline content for faster loading and game stability, here is what I love so far:

+ Storyline is great. It doesn't just dump you off and say good luck, but there is mostly clear direction towards an end goal that I really enjoy. I feel like I have something to work towards and look forwards to.

+ Graphics are beautiful and I love the work they put into creatively designing their fauna and monsters

+ I love the option to move biomes at will and select how difficult they are. I am not forced into extreme survival unless I want to be

+ While it is online, I don't see other players and am not constantly worried about being smashed by some overdeveloped players. This gives the feel of being a lone explorer

Here are some of the negatives:

- Game crashes and loss of connection with server are frustrating with the latter being common

- Can be tedious to have to build a new base to work on some new thing I need in each biome but...this also extends the game and adds to survival feel so not sure if its positive or negative

- Some points in the quests have bugs or don't give clear direction which makes you really have to search around to know what you need to do next

So to go into further detail.  I don't see why people are upset about the character creation.  I thought it was interesting and I liked the addition of a lineage to affect the over all look of your character.  I think it maybe a good idea though to have a random button for the lineage in case people don't want to have to choose.

I really love the look of this game, the animation, the music, the ambiances is great!!  I just wish I had a better graphics card to appreciate all the detail, running on a GeForce 1660.

I think they do a really good job at walking you through the steps to get you familiarized with the game. Excellent tutorials and hints.  

As far as the building goes, I do like it a lot but hope they add a bunch more pieces, shapes and inverted shapes to create more interesting houses, keeps, lookouts, etc.  I am only a level 20 so far so maybe this all changes when you get to better crafting materials.  If the devs read this, the best building mechanics I have come across so far in my opinion would be from the game Enshrouded.  

The lore and the store so far has been really interesting and I always love reading notes, messages, etc left by NPC's or the characters that have passed before us to hear about their journeys, romances, and history.

I am a fae and Victorian era lover, so the blending of both in -- even better a survival crafting game -- was an enticing exciting idea. Add to that the promise of beautiful reams, magic, and beautiful haunting beasties and I'm hooked. However, this game is just missing the dart board for me. 
The UI:
Firstly, the UI is clunky, more so than other survival crafting games which can often have clunky UIs. Some items do not have pictures, they simply have a wax seal with the letter N on it. I thought for a while I had lost items I picked up because of this. I understand early access, but every item SHOULD have a distinguishable picture even if it is not the final picture it will have. There are simply too many items in this game for something as common as chitin to not have an icon. 
I did see someone else mention different colors for different tier levels, and yes each item has different tiers of quality, and I agree. Even if it is as simple as a different color background helping me to identify the difference between a tier 1 and tier 2 hide would be lovely considering there are so many items and tiers of these items.
The exit button... You must hit 'e' to open a storage container, or 'b' for the building menu etc. however, you cannot simply hit those buttons again to close the menus and even worse the close button seems to be in different parts of the screen depending what menu you've open. I should not have to spend minutes looking for the close button in a menu in a game that does not have a pause button even in single player. It does not feel good, it is not a good flow, and it does not help that the cursor speeds between my FP perspective and the menu is WAY different. I have lots of wrist problems, and a few minutes into playing this game I can feel it.
The Crafting:
There are too many items, too many item tiers, too many crafting benches, too many add ons for those benches, too many storage boxes needed, and too little carry weight for this game not to pull from the chests in your base or have storage options themselves. Crafting is a level 12/5 in annoyance, and this is coming from someone who enjoys the crafting in games like Conan Exiles, and Valhiem. I will say that the base building itself, allowing you to place down the blocks and allowing you to add to the building from anywhere building it all at once is a feature I like. 
The Armor/Dungeons:
Firstly, I'd like my starting gear back thank you. I look like a vaguely Victorian inspired caveman at the moment in patchwork brightly colored YELLOW hide clothes. Personally it does not feel good to feel as if your gear has been downgraded when you are supposedly 'upgrading' it. The starting gear should not look better than the first gear you are forced to craft and wear. And yes, you are FORCED to wear it otherwise you are bared from dungeons. I do not like this mechanic. I would rather run around in my starting gear (which was explicitly stated as having been prepared for this journey in the case of character creation) yet I must do away with it moments after arriving because this ugly, yellow hide number is twice as good. Now this isn't a visual downgrade with a story to it. Its not garnered off the back of a powerful early game enemy one must defeat and wear as a sort of trophy or because this creature offers some sort of magical extra protection. No, its made from simple boar and deer hide. HOW is that better than the explorers gear I started off with? The simple pack looks like it can hold maybe two rocks, how is that better than the explorers pack made by much more skilled hands than mine surely are?
Dungeons require a certain gear level (gathered by downgrading your visual look and upgrading your other equipment) to enter. You are barred from entering unless you meet this requirement. Absolutely hate it, it breaks immersion. While this is explained away by the spirits deciding if you are worthy or not, it makes zero sense. I would much rather have tasks I have to complete, monsters I have to slay, or puzzles I have to solve be the deciding factor in my 'worthiness' than what level of gear I'm wearing. More than that, accidentally stumbling into a far too high level dungeon and either being instantly vaporized or having that nice little 'you are about to enter an area above your skill level would you like to continue' menu pop up is much more preferable. 
Realm Walking:
I do not mind the always online aspect. Do I believe an offline single player option would be something we should have? YES. Recently they announced they are working on that, and good, honestly that should have been the thing it came out with. I understand wanting massive co-ops, but most people play alone or with one or two other friends. Having one realm open at a time and forcing everyone into that realm for co-op and allowing an offline single player option would have been a MUCH better start. However, as I stated, I don't mind the always online aspect since I understand what they are going for.
My issue with realm walking is this: My partner and I just arrived at our first realm, we're greeted by an incredibly generic NPC (all of which go on incredibly boring, un-voiced press next or E to read the next line text chats, this is however a rant for another moment) and are given a task. One that requires upgrading or infusing or something of that nature a spyglass. This requires the benches we have back on our main realm. Oh, but when I try to return I'm met with a message saying I may not be able to return to the realm I've just opened.
So what am I to do? Re-build EVERY ONE OF THE INSANE NUMBER OF BENCHES EVERY TIME I'M MET WITH A NEW TASK? That is absolutely ridiculous if it is the case. And there is no help to figure out a fix for this, as like many games (in fact this one is a worse offender than most) it does not hold your hand and guide you into what to do and how to do it, because otherwise I'd have to basically re-build our home base in every new realm only to leave it for good when we head back. Progress lost, locked, stolen, thrown to the ether. What?! I saw someone here mention they have like five realms open at once, how does that work? Because I'm now scared to leave the realm I just opened because if I leave and lose it, I won't be able to finish my quest.
Enemies:
I don't know about late game, but early game the AI is janky at best. You hit a monster or mob and they run away from you only to return at breakneck speeds. And often music is the only warning something is near as most of them make no sound. The number of times a wolf or boar has blindsided me is ridiculous. They should make SOME sound. A howl, a grunt when they hit you, the soft footfalls on the leaves, something. No, the world itself is very quiet.
Music:
The music is lovely, the ambient sounds are alright though they are MOSTLY disconnected from the surrounding wildlife.
In closing:
I am fighting to want to keep this game and not refund it. I WANT to enjoy this game, but there are so many issues, not even counting the bugs and other problems it has, that just make it very hard for me to want to spend the MANY hours this type of game requires to get enjoyment out of it. I can see the developers listen to what the fan base is saying, and that honestly is the only thing keeping me from emailing steam right now for that refund. 
I would not recommend that you pick this game up at this time. There are far too many QOL issues to truly find it enjoyable.

Building is good.
Great variety in materials/resources within the world adding to complex but enjoyable depth in crafting, upgrading, and resource gathering.
Combat feels good from the player side.
World building and exploration is sublime, it really instils this otherworldly aspect. 
Love the well crafted voice acting, it really helps with the above.
The portal mechanics are very enjoyable.

Negatives:
AI is a little simplistic, enemy AI can be exploited quite easily, helper AI leaves much to be desired (a chaotic walking backpack).
No offline play (though that's coming as the next thing being worked on due to popular demand).

On the whole, it's an enjoyable experience to build and explore in, so much thought has been put in to the world building that the game truly shines there.

The game has a few issues true, building can be a tad restrictive at time, sometimes things can be a bit buggy (chopping trees only for them to explode across the landscape stands out in particular), but is that not the point of early access? which the devs have been very clear that this still is?

Personally to me the game has very solid bones, I particularly enjoy the mechanic of upgrading crafting stations by building little amenities and knickknacks (sure we're surviving in a hostile fey realm but can you really call it  a home without a hat rack?) and the fact that its a survival game that actually has some colour to it 

now for the strangely coloured elephant in the room. Yes the game is always online, if that is a deal breaker for you that is very fair and you can choice not to play the game. However its hardly a hidden surprise and the sheer number of people feeling the need to leave a review about it (and also frankly some of the other negative reviews) is bizarre to me. For what its worth in my 20 odd hours of play as someone outside the US and with a fairly mediocre internet connection I've had exactly one connection issue, on the main menu trying to load in to the game and hitting the join button again was all it to resolve the issue.

Essentially dull games that quickly become boring. Nightingale is NOT that! And that's precisely why I love it! In my opinion, it stands as one of the best releases in the past few years.

Most of the grievances voiced by negative reviewers are actually features already present within the game. Nightingale is a profoundly in-depth experience!
For instance, one individual mentioned struggling to access a portal situated atop an unscalable mountain. However, they could have easily opened the map and fast-traveled back to their home, bypassing the need for the portal to exit a realm.

Other reviewers dislike the crafting system but seem to lack a comprehensive understanding of its intricacies. Given that multiple variations of an item can be utilized to craft a specific item, it logically follows that you shouldn't use the autofill option, even though it exists. Additionally, selecting the desired item for crafting is straightforward.

I could delve into numerous other points raised in these reviews. In essence, my suggestion is this: If you seek a game devoid of basic cognitive challenges, Nightingale may not be the right choice. Instead, perhaps consider downloading Roblox. However, if you appreciate engaging gameplay, I recommend watching some YouTube guides; there are plenty of amazing resources available that can enhance your experience within the Realms of Nightingale.

What I find most captivating about the game:

• The game's visual aesthetics are absolutely breathtaking! Regardless of the hours invested, players are consistently awestruck by the game's beauty. With settings optimized for Ultra Quality, such as Lumen, AA, and TSR, I maintain a steady 60 FPS with an RX 6700 XT and Ryzen 7 2700X. Admittedly, FPS can fluctuate when more players join the servers.

• The gameplay loop is refreshingly dynamic. Initially, I completed the tutorial and acquired basic gear. Subsequently, I spent hours constructing my first home. However, once the novelty of building wore off, I delved into exploring different realms and collecting essence. This essence is then used to unlock crafting blueprints and other items from the essence trader. After hours of exploration, numerous new blueprints are unlocked, revitalizing the base-building aspect of the game. For instance, I unlocked a larger chest and devised a more efficient storage system. Now, with my base settled, I can return to exploring and unlocking new content. This dynamic loop keeps gameplay varied and refreshing.

• Crafting is remarkably intricate and, therefore, incredibly satisfying.

While the game does have its drawbacks, such as occasionally dim-witted enemies that become stuck, I wholeheartedly recommend it. I would gladly pay double the price for the content offered in Nightingale!",1708705484,1708705484,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

TLDR:
Wonderful unique IP with a good foundational design. Build, Craft and Explore solo or with friends. This is Early access and as such there are some elements still to be introduced and optimizations needed but the game runs well for me on a 1080 and played several hours at the time of this review without issue.

Pros:
[olist]
[*]Unique story driven IP - interesting lore and setting. Very much an Alice in Wonderland vibe
[*]Characters - Although primarily focused on your guide at the moment. Voice acting and writing is well done.
[*]Building - some small quality of life additions that I appreciate such as being able to layout the design of a structure and then dump resources in all at once to complete is very helpful. Exploration is required to gather blue prints. some have complained about lack of options here but knowing what is available would require far more play time then what those reviews would suggest.
[*]Server Based - I know this is controversial but I was able to give a friend access to my start zone and he can log in to it whether or not i'm online. Makes things very simple for co-op play.
[*] Character Slots - There are 4 character slots so you can have different ones for solo play or various friend groups
[*] Weather - A bit of dynamic weather here which helps set the tone (rain, hail). I hope to see some extremes. If you've ever played Icarus there is just something powerful about weather being a character in and of itself.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
[*] Building functions need to be further fleshed out. hit X to dismantle built items but there is no UI indication of this.
[*] Menus are a bit cumbersome. The game has some complexity so a little of this is expected however it can be improved.
[*] Performance - Although the core game functioned fine for me there is optimization needed for combat / server lag. fights showed signs of delayed reactions. One portal didn't recognize that I ran through it until the third time trying.
[*] Character creation - still a work in progress. some items missing which are clearly called out.
[*} NPC - Puck is great but other NPCs do not appear to be voiced. I hope this changes as they feel glaringly empty.
[/olist]

So far, it looks like a good start. The initial session went far better than the reviews would have led me to believe. I know people have really strong opinions about server based applications as a service but it does provide some benefits. There is certainly work to be done on optimization and UI layout but the foundation appears to be quite stable for the immediate Early Access launch. Devs have responded with a day one patch. Hopefully quick attention and updates continue. It is quite an ambitious game with the possibility of endless exploration.

Also note that the current review scores of 57% positive are completely unfair, that number is low due to organised review bombing by a large number of players who were mad about the game being ""always online"" (something that wasn't hidden from anyone...) and many of those players don't even have a full hour of gameplay under their belts.  Filter the reviews to players with 1+ hour and the overall score jumps to 75% positive which is the score that this game actually deserves.

For an early access survival crafting game this one has a lot of polish and some great ideas however it has a lot of ""grind"" at the moment because of the way the crafting and upgrade system is designed.

Nightingale could be described as a a Victorian Steampunk remix of The Forest, Valheim, and Conan Exiles with some Fae magic thrown in for fun.

The maps are procedurally generated like Valheim's maps and it's got a stamina and health system that's similar to Valheim's as well.  Your food choices give you buffs and if you don't have active food buffs you end up being weaker than you should be.  You do have a food bar, and a ""rest"" bar that you need to maintain so you can starve to death or succumb to excessive fatigue, but it's very easy to maintain both.

There are several biomes (forest, swamp, desert at the moment) that determine the basic type of terrain you will find in each map, and many ways to modify each new map that you create using portals and different magical cards that you can find, buy, or craft.  It's a pretty cool system and you can even adjust the basic difficulty of each map so if you found the last one you created a bit too easy or too hard you can tweak the difficulty - but of course harder maps may come with better rewards.  Some of the modification cards you can use will make major changes to the map, such as changing what basic resources you obtain from different sources - maybe instead of getting bundles of wood from a tree a card might change it so ore nodes become a source of wood bundles and trees become a source of metal.

Constructing buildings and crafting stations reminds me of The Forest because you drop blueprints of what you want to make then add materials to them.  The system works very well, it's very streamlined and easy to use, and one of the coolest things about it is that you can simply add materials to one section of a building and it adds all the relevant materials that you are carrying to the entire construction making it much less of a hassle than it is in many other crafting survival games.

Crafting stations and to some extent both building and combat remind me of Conan Exiles.  You will need many crafting stations to produce good equipment and as with Conan Exiles equipment is very important.  Nightingale has no level up system, no character perks or traits that are inherent to the character.  All of your core stats and abilities are based on your equipment, boosted somewhat by the foods you eat as noted earlier.  Equipment can be crafted, upgraded, enchanted, and modified in several ways, plus some weapons can use different ammo that produces different effects.  You have plenty of equipment slots so it's not hard to boost a lot of different stats by putting different enchantments on your gear but there are some limits to this.  If a piece of gear doesn't have a ""strength"" stat you can't put a ""strength"" enhancement on it, and if you have a tier 2 weapon but a tier 3 enchantment it won't be compatible either - tier levels have to match.  This isn't really a major drawback and it helps keep power levels in line.  You also get a cairn at your base that lets you set a recall point for instant fast travel back to it, and this can be changed by building another stone and setting that as your respite cairn.  You can only have one of these at a time and the respite recall cairn has to be in a low tier ""abeyance"" map that will serve as your ""main"" base.

Your power score,which is a gauge of your overall power level, is reflected by your current carried tool or weapon plus your equipped clothing/backpack and to access certain areas you need a minimum score which, so far, hasn't been too hard to obtain but at later stages will involve some grinding to upgrade your gear.  Generally if you compare your realm + difficulty level to your power score you can estimate how hard, or easy, things will be.  If you are at gear score 20 and are trying to deal with an area that has an overall difficulty of 80 you might have a tough time, but if your gear score is 40 and you are going into an easy realm with an overall difficulty of 10 it's going to be very easy for you.

There are four difficulty levels you can choose from, easy, medium, hard, and extreme and each one determines the additional power level of the map you create at the portal.  The first two are quite easy e with the easy level having no modifier to realm power and medium a meagre +10 modifier to the realm power level. The third is what I would say is the intended difficulty level and documentation states this adds +25 to the realm's power level, and extreme adds 40 points to the realm power level.

When making a new map to explore using the portal and card system there's a drop down menu in the bottom left that lets you choose the game difficulty on the new map.  Cards determine the base realm difficulty, then this is modified by the difficulty settings you choose, and a second card determines what type of map you will be on.  This system gets more complex as you gain access to more cards.

Combat isn't terrible but it could use some work, it is one of the two places the game needs some attention because for me it's just a bit too basic.  It's far too easy to simply circle strafe a lot of the game's enemies, even using a melee weapon, so they need to work on that a bit more.  It's not terrible, but it could be a lot better.  The other area that I think needs a little attention is the grind, the game's pacing.  I'm only 6.5 hours in but I can already see how slow progression is going to become and I think the developers need to be aware that too much complexity in the crafting systems and too much grinding will drive a lot of players away.

Overall this is a solid 8/10 for me and I highly recommend checking this one out if you like survival crafting games.",1708703987,1708705383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1928980,159070152,76561198060104912,0,1,2685,2685,1954,1708807117,"I absolutely love this game and I think possibly the difference between me and a lot of the negative reviews has to do with target audience. Many of the things people dislike about it, I really enjoy. It's not perfect/polished, but plenty good enough for me to be willing to put up with some of the EA jank and I have no complaints about the design or gameplay itself. 

So, the good: 
The crafting system is deep. 36 hours in and I am still in the first tier of gear available but I have remade items with better materials for stat boosts that are noticeable. You don't graduate out of tiers so quickly that the things you spent time gathering and crafting for becomes obsolete 20 minutes later and there is plenty of scope to customise stats to your preference and play style, or even have gear sets for different biomes and activities. Between crafting, enchants and realm cards, you can spend ages tinkering and inhabiting the world. It's a slow burn and I think you get the best from the game if you engage with all the systems and stop to smell the flowers a bit. I notice a lot of the negative reviews that mention the game being boring and empty don't have much play time- it takes a while to explore and unlock all your crafting options and systems, I simply don't believe you can do that in an hour or two. 

Nostalgia: I am a gamer of a certain age. Messing about in menus and taking time out of progression to just play and do optional content like hunting mythical beasts or decorating a homestead or evaluating gear stats and planning load out feels like playing oblivion or fallout 3 or 4. Its recapturing a sense of adventure and investment for me that I haven't found in a game for a long while. I have seen complaints about repeat structures but that has been a feature of popular 'big' games for ages, even solo RPGs like Skyrim. You either get big, or you get handcrafted, and enshrouded just didn't last long enough for me (and despite handcrafting, a lot of villages and points of interest were not particularly unique in enshrouded). Valheim was worse, seen one troll cave or crypt, seen them all. No one seemed to mind that so I can't agree with the hate Nightingale is getting on that score. 

Gameplay loop (so far): Visit the 3 biomes of your current major card tier, clear the Fae tower for essence and points of interest reveal, throw in your favourite minor card, find the essence trader for new recipes, explore, loot, hint a fabled beast if you are into that, maybe pick up a side quest, go home and craft/build. You can race through just doing the tower and trader in half hour  (I am not a fan of the desert aesthetic so I do that more in that biome) or you can clear the map, notice all the details, spend several hours on it, make a mini base and spend several in game days there. It's up to you. I get the most out of it somewhere in between- I don't fix every settlement and clear every point of interest as that probably would get tedious but I do engage with the biome and make it an adventure rather than zipping through and moving on to the next tier asap. You have to play the game to enjoy the game. 

Crafting: Love the aesthetic, love the help from the follower, love using augments as interior design and creating a workshop/playspace. Building is fairly standard (things people complain about like second story issues are fixed in later recipes and unlockable build options). Love seeing my base grow. You can move chests even if they are full! I love that. 

Exploring: Love being able to repair gear on the fly, break down trash to essence, build anywhere without making a song and dance over setting up a cairn or flame or whatever, prep for specific environments, alter the rules of the realm, find new things even after many hours exploring, ignore things I don't care for (there are multiple ways to get most resources).

The follower: I know this gets a lot of negativity but I find him useful. He farms mats, he carries things, he helps me fight, he revives me, he helps me build, he refuels my fires (but I have to make sure he doesn't have permissions for chests with good or rare  fibre in or he tried to burn it). I would like a bit more control of his activities and the AI needs some tweaks- sometimes he starts chopping wood mid fight and is unreliable at picking up items. I am pretty sure sometimes things he picks up vanish from his inventory or I am unable to see them. Could have a bit more personality, but mostly, he is a useful companion. 

The bad: 

Combat is kinda janky. Monsters seem to teleport making them hard to see/target. I am not struggling so far but maybe when the difficulty ramps up I will start to feel that. Targeting ranged isn't terrible but as soon as things get close or charge, I am just swinging blindly for the most part. 

I personally don't love platforming puzzles in otherwise non platformy games. Personal preference. 

Farming is useless. Fishing takes a bit too long and is hard to control. I usually like fishing minigames and farming but, meh. Kind of love the water barrel though, that's cool. 

Normal early access niggles: disconnects, bugs, systems that need tuning up. I don't mind this, I have played full release games that have these issues. 

Performance: This is the big one. Sometimes it's all fine, sometimes it's using 98% CPU and stuttering like crazy. My friend has a pc with better specs than mine and can hardly run it, no one can figure out why. 

Co-op: Honestly, game seems to be geared to a more solo experience, you have to unlock and build everything individually so rather than sharing a base as we intended, we ended up with our own bases, started working on our own stuff and then got out of pace with eachother in terms of progression. There was never a point we all got to the same place in the game and started merging our resources or base or progression. So it's mostly sitting on a call while doing our own thing. I think co-op will start to feel more wanted/needed in late game when we have moved through the story and are playing with ascended realms and challenge type environments but for now, even though we specifically got the game to play together, we have barely partied up. Plus the gods of varying performance issues and bugs seem to have favoured me, I am not struggling like my friends seem to be despite having the lowest end pc of the group. I did not like how enshrouded made it feel mandatory to team up for everything to prevent people missing the progression and the fun of discovery/recipe unlocks, but this is at the other end of the scale. I don't hate that, I am having fun doing my own thing, but I expected more of a co-op experience. 

Overall, I adore it, I can see myself spending many weeks on this game and it pushes all the right buttons for me- deep crafting, slow paced progression, a lovely setting/art style, a world with weather and water physics and atmosphere, nostalgia for older games, a sense of adventure, a cosy respite, a clear (and repeatable) game play loop, multiple things to do and focus on, autonomy of experience and freedom to play how I want and choose my own adventure. I look forward to future tweaks (let me escape out of chests!) and am excited for future biomes and mechanics.

I don't like writing negative reviews, this is only my second one to write.  I will change the review if you fix this terrible mistake.  Reverse course and add offline play and dedicated servers.  There is zero reason for this style game to be online only.

I like Nightingale.  I have been waiting for it for a few years and bought it as soon as it released.  In the days leading up to EA launch I started having doubts, why would a survival game need stress tests?  Well, that was answered at launch, the game is always online.  No single player offline mode.  No small teams on dedicated servers or P2P connections.

The gameplay seems solid from what I've played so far, the world looks beautiful, and the concept of portals that allow you to travel to realms has endless possibilities.  All of that greatness is overshadowed by the fact that if you don't have stable internet you can't play.  It's overshadowed by the fact that players are at risk of another vanishing game if the devs or publisher abandon this project.  This should NOT happen with game development anymore.  If you're not developing an MMO you MUST have offline play.

I was blown away by the exploration part of this game early on, and the graphics are gorgeous. 
The steam-punk feel works very well with the Realmwalking theme, and you can find some really cool sights.
The crafting is great, each type of stone / wood / metal / whatever have bonuses to different stats like Stamina, Health, Melee dmg, Ranged dmg etc., so to optimize what you craft you have to go out looking for specific materials to make the perfect Rifle.

The pathing of AI creatures could use some work. The mobs kind move like they have no inertia, doing 180's and sometimes making it difficult to aim at with ranged weapons.
The UI is pretty rough at times.

A lot of players are upset about the 'online-only' aspect of this game, which does present issues such as downtime when the servers are down for maintenance, and if the devs ever abandon the game you wouldn't be able to play anymore.

That being said, there are far more benefits than drawbacks.
It allows several players to put their 'home' in the same realm, so they can work and live together, without a certain person having to be online... and you can meet random people if you set your realm to public.

I would much rather have it this way than having to pay 10-20 dollars for a dedicated server for a month.

Let's start with the good things.

There is more of a story here and tasks than i the usual survival game specter. 
I think the graphics are on par, and the landscape is pretty good. I haven't been stuck once, and that by itself is a miracle. There are a plethora of different minerals and items you can gather.
The food consumption speed is totally ok, I've been through a lot worse, also you can modify your realm if you so chooses to slow down the consumption rate even further, and it is a big change!

Now for the not so good part.
Some thing could absolutely get reworked, there are as I said a lot of different materials, and maybe they're too many. Some seemingly the same thing but with a slightly different name, and they don't stack of course.
The erratic movement of some of the mobs are just, well stupid. They jump from one place to another and the turn radius and movement speed to some are ridiculous.
The building of houses seems fine at first, but they are very limited, and the biggest problem I have (as of 19 hours game time) is that it doesn't really matter! [SPOILER] You probably aren't going to see your house again anyway due to the way you're moving in between realms.

Some mechanics needs a better description and some others need a description period!

Now a lot of reviews says that it's a single player game and for that reason it should be able to be played offline. Now, I don't really have so much of an issue with the concept, but! The servers right now are horrible, it is laggy, it takes forever and then some to get them to create your world and you lose connection more often than the hipsters in the 60's! 

Unless they get their servers in order pronto I will change my review from recommend to do NOT recommend. If you release a game (EVEN if it is early release) your customers needs to be able to play what the game is at the time. With the servers like they are, you can't really do that. When prime time comes you're out of luck getting in to play.

There seem to be a lot of superficial, honestly downright *weird* criticisms of this game that have little to no grounding in what the game actually is, at least given my experience with it. 

Straight out of the box, there seems to be a ton of knee-jerk detraction surrounding the always-online foundation of this game, which I think has been blown entirely out of proportion. I dislike always-online as much as anyone else, I feel like it's almost always a bad decision and there's really very few games that actually necessitate this sort of ""feature."" That said, when always online IS necessary, and it's done properly, there's literally no issue with it. The game was flagged by my firewall initially, I don't know if all of these people with problems just missed that on their end and they don't know how to remedy the issue once the OS prompt goes away, but I've had zero issues with the connectivity at all. No issues getting in to the game, no laggardly loading screens, hell, I don't even feel any latency. So, from my perspective at least, the extraordinary amount of backlash regarding ""another always online game"" ruining the experience is fundamentally baseless.

Secondly, I've seen a lot of people complaining about...character creation? They say the characters are ugly as sin. I genuinely don't understand this angle at all. This game has an insanely robust character creation system, with you being able to pull genetic traits from your lineage (selected from up to 14 of the preset faces) in order to get a very particular face blend to start working with, BEFORE you begin tinkering with all of the nuanced options they offer. Not to be that guy, but if your character is the ugliest thing you've ever seen in a game then I have to say it's literally a skill issue.

The world building is lovely. Now, I find ""survival-crafting"" to be an EXTREMELY tired genre, with an absolute deluge of the same game being churned out and completely saturating the market year after year. That's not to say that the genre is devoid of its gems, however, and I think that the key really lies in how a game situates us in order to give us circumstances that would rationally lead to a survival-crafting system. I really appreciate when games give us world building and lore that contextualize and rationalize the building-from-nothing progression, like Valheim or V Rising (each remarkable in their own right), and I find that Nightingale executes on that remarkably. Playing cards at gateways as an in-universe justification for drastically varied procedural generation, portal-hopping through fae worlds and dimensions? Lovely. An absolutely novel concept and it really does just elevate the vibe of the game. 

Graphically, the game could use a bit of work, but it's miles above what I've come to expect from any Early Access title, and I'm sure they're going to be improving this as time goes on. The lighting and edge sharpening specifically seem pretty ""graphics engine default"" to me, I'm not sure really how to explain it. The way light plays through grasses and shrubs, for instance, is kind of rough, but overall I find the visuals to be unexpectedly captivating for this type of release. 

There seems to be a great deal of depth in the actual mechanics of the game, that I've not yet scratched the surface of, but my initial thoughts are that it's... good? There's a lot of information and different systems at play, but the developers have given us an extremely robust and intuitive UI that makes parsing all of this information a breeze. I, again, do not understand all of the criticism I've seen leveled at the gathering/building/crafting components of the game.

The combat, I suppose, is the one area where I'm closest to understanding complaints I've seen about this title; but not nearly to the extent I've seen some individuals caterwauling about. The combat itself is actually quite satisfying from what I've experienced so far, it's behaves quite similarly to Vermintide 2 combat (which, if you've not experienced it for yourself, is the single most satisfying, well-honed combat system I've seen in any game where you're contending with more than one assailant at a time). That said, enemy AI is rudimentary and could use a decent amount of tuning. To which I say: this game is Early Access? This game is, at time of writing, TWO DAYS Early Access and literally everything is going to continue getting touched up on as development continues, and people have been lambasting the game over this. Such complaints don't really hold water in my opinion.

So, in summary, a vast majority of the criticisms and negativity surrounding this game seem to be really....disingenuous to me? This is an exceptionally solid foundation for the developers to build on, and even this very first build of early access is something quite special that I look forward to sinking my teeth in to further. I'll update this review if my disposition changes, but I don't reckon it will, and I just wanted to put this up so that it might give any undecided buyers pause for thought after seeing so many negative reviews that are in my opinion extremely unfair and bad faith.

For a moment, I almost changed my review from negative to positive. I'll try to make the updated portion short and concise. So I'd say Nightingale is experienced in three phases.

[b]Phase 1[/b] - The Long Tutorial (10hrs)
[b]Phase 2[/b] - Gaining momentum (20-25hrs)
[b]Phase 3[/b] - Endgame

Phase 1 sucks. It's a negative, you quickly come to realize that they went bonkers on some core principles of the genre. Not enough that it feels different, but different enough that it feels disjointed.

Phase 2, because you suck it up and guess what, things fall into place. You find your rhythm, you meet obstacles but decide to power through and the game does pick up.

Phase 3, you realize there is a social aspect to endgame, and then, all the things you hated from phase 1 are dished out tenfold. Mindless grinding and jumping from menus and machines only to get that one mat that will unlock the next table, but no, that table can't be unlocked because said piece is missing from this other machine that you also have to grind mindlessly and so on and so forth...

I should specify, I love grinding. I have embraced the appeal over decades of gaming but this game does not make that process enjoyable, even if repetitive. It is chaotic in the worst possible way. The game also doesn't do a well enough job at conveying what it is that you need to do to get the thing you're missing to progress.

It is in dire need of balance, right now it just goes far too deep into excess and it does so in the weakest aspects of its mechanics, rather than doing so on its strongest. It's mind boggling really.

[h2]ORIGINAL REVIEW (around 15hrs played at the time)[/h2]
---

So. I've been told this game was 2 years in development. I believe it but...

If the question was ""how many of those 2 years served what?"", I'd think it has been 15 months to conceptualize and 9 to build the game.

It's an early access, and it shows, and this is not a compliment. It's not a ""I got a great build and what is in it is enough to warrant EA"" but rather a ""I got a bunch of assets, a structure but lost control so we're going EA and we'll build off of feedback"". I can't help but wonder if it released cause they needed money pouring in to keep afloat. It genuinely feels like that at times.

Those words may seem harsh because conceptually, it's very VERY strong and potentially one of the better survivals out there if done right. It could have tremendous replay value, kind of Voidtrain in potential, and thankfully better as well in overall gameloop but it's far from perfect. I've played many survivals that seemed lesser than what this title is conceptually, yet they ended up being a far superior in their initial 10 hours for how much smoother and clever that the gameplay was.

In Nightingale, the mundane feels like a chore and even with the helper, which alleviated a lot, it still remains clunky as an overall experience. I don't mean a chore because it's repetitive, but a chore because the game has roadblocks that makes you scratch your head with just how badly designed that they are.

On another note, it is gorgeous, audio is overall great and I can safely say once you've learned to accustom yourself to the frustrating aspects of this title, it does get more digestible... somehow. 

But allow me to give you an example, you forget to sleep right? Cause nothing warns you anyway. Well, that'll bring your character to an absolute HALT except walk back to base. I get slowing down the player, whereas coming to an halt is problematic in the flow. Imagine being in the middle of nowhere, your character needs to sleep, yet you do not have the ability to even swipe at a tree, even at 0.5x speed, to get the ressources to build a bed.

Make my screen hazy, make me lose HP, make me go slower but mercy, don't stop me from being able to fulfill the task to fix the issue I'm faced with. And that's what you'll go through a lot in this title in different forms. It almost feels like, for the sake of being different, that they decided they couldn't make dumb decisions...

I'll keep playing this title as I see its potential, but to give you an idea, I finished RedFall and no, I did not enjoy it. My point? I can enjoy playing games for the potential that I can see it be, while that realization not quite being present, this is this title so far. 

It needs another extra 6 months to present a decent ""early access"" build. The mechanics... icons.... revisit not being able to stack 5 iterations of the same piece of lumber cause they come from different pieces of wood. It's not significant enough to justify going through the unpleasantness it provides...

Even for an early access game this one is in a very early state. The graphics are beatiful due to Unreal Engine 5 but the assets are poorly implemented into the game. The most interesting locations have no integration into the game world. The design is very intrecate in some ways and very simple in others. 

[h1]Crafting[/h1]

Crafting is complex and interesting but also annoying. No crafting from containers which is industry standard by now. Many interwoven conditionals like proximity to X or being exposed to Y while crafting make it an unholy mess. The game loop is very short and gets boring fast. Go to Fae tower. Kill the mobs there. Do some simple puzzle somewhere. Get essence. Go Home. Repeat. This would be fine I guess if the combat wasn't so simple and uninteresting. The attack and move sets are just the Unreal Engine 5 basics. Magic is practically non existant. Crafting the base item has some novelty to it. Using different materials to craft something gives the items different attributes. This is also very inconsistent. Some do what they are supposed to do others just don't do anything. But you don't know what works until you craft it and your materials are gone. After that the upgrade system is very simple. Apart from some guns the weapons you have at the beginning are what you have in the end game. Just with higher titem level. Typical bigger number better. This is difinetely wasted potential. Then there are the charms, enchants and infusions. These are fine but give the player less choice then you would think. Many can apply to only one specific item. Their description is lacking and does not tell you for which item they are or even what they do for some. So you end up crafting a lot of stuff you can't even use or don't want to since this slot is already filled. Items themselves can't be modified in their basic makeup. So if you have upgraded your item to a state where you want it and find some material - say better wood/stone/ore/leather - that would make it better. Start from scratch.
 
[h1]Game Play[/h1]

The game loop is very short and gets boring fast. Go to Fae tower. Kill the mobs there. Do some simple puzzle somewhere. Get essence. Go Home. Repeat. This would be fine I guess if the combat wasn't so simple and unterintesting. The attack and move sets are just the Unreal Engine 5 basics. Magic is practically non existant. Injuries are just annoying, have no way to fix them (so far) and just waste the players time.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]

Many quests require every player to do everything. The 3D map markers have poor visibility due to the chosen colour. There seems to be no difficulty scaling for player count at all. The tutorial seems to be single player only and even parts of the later quests encourage you to build seperately at first. Weird choice.

[h1]Art direction and graphics[/h1]

The game is really beautiful. UE5 is not used to its full potential but the world looks really good. Art direction is all over the place. I am not sure if this is intentional or not. Most places fit the steampunk fantasy universe. Some seem a little out of place. Evil tongues may say they were just cheap in the UE asset store...

[h1]Performance[/h1]

If you could live with everything mentioned above here comes the part that is [b]game breaking[/b]. The game runs fine most of the time. Loading times are a little long but if the game ran fine otherwise I would be ok with that. Then there are the frame drops. These can be very bad and even constant. They could be related to physics or lighting (falling trees or night time seem to make em worse). In some cases I went from a stable 60 fps down to 7fps at which point I had to fast travel home. This seems to fix the issue at least (memory leak?). [b]The servers are terrible too[/b]. Getting kicked and rolled back a few minutes is common.
(Happened 4 times in one session. All players affected. Clearly server side). A big portion of my play time is just in the menu waiting to be able to reconnect. I had an instance crash which made me unable to play my character. [b]Now every time I tried to connect it kicks me out with the server issus message[/b]. This is where I wanted to cut my losses and request a refund. But hey - steam policy. More than 2h played. No refund. I would not have written this review if they had actually refunded me since the game is in realy access after all. But not being able to play at all seems like a valid refund reason to me.

Crafting is fine, same as other games really. 

Survival could use some working, having to sleep in order to continue using attacks or do anything sucks. And we got food, why no water?

I have had only 1 time I got booted from a world due to connectivity of the servers. It being online all the time does not bother me as we don't play games forever despite what some people seem to think. Also this does limit the audience a bit. But this is an Early access game and the Devs addressed that yesterday. 
Things to know. 
1. This is a marathon not a sprint. There is a little bit of grind to the game. After 12 hrs of play I have yet to find a gun and am still using the simple tools you craft early on. So dont expect to be lighting fae up with a shotty in the first few hrs. 
2. Character creator is rough. While you have freedom I feel this and the models needs some work. They are just ugly and rough. It is better than some games in the genre but I feel like making a character is like a who is the least ugly contest. 
3. World is gorgeous and i could see this becoming a relaxing game for some people. The customization of the world is amazing. Love everything about the realm game play. 
4. Probably by design you can only have 1 follower. Aid quests seem a bit pointless to complete when you cant have more than 1 follower. 
5. ""What is this similar to?"" It takes from a few different games. Its survival crafting but I like the fact that their is a story line and a clear goal. Open ended is great but its refreshing to have something specific to do and work on. Makes it feel like skyrim with crafting survival elements. 

Overall the game is fun. As a solo player I enjoy it a lot. I know the Devs had a big focus on multiplayer which is why we have the online only mode.

I'm sorry for those that keep reporting issues, but my fiance and I have been able to jump in and play fine each time we tried. We've been able to access our realm without issue, and explore to our hearts content. 

Yes, it does take a little time to connect to the server, but after everything is good. We've also gone idle for a long period of time and have been fine and NOT kicked. I'm not sure what those asking for an Offline mode expected from this game... they very clearly from the beginning marketing this toward co-op/online. 

There are some bugs of course with this being early access, but if you're familiar with modding or any sort of Bethesda game, than you know the kind of bugs that are laughable and a little immersion breaking but they do not completely break the game. 

The game persistence is sort of like NMS, but this game handles other player's buildings way better. Not sure of the construction limit yet, but the builder part of the game could do with a better tutorial system. 

Combat is fluid and addictive but could still use work. Magic feel clunky and the way you equip/holster items and weapons really needs to be looked at. 

Crafting is probably the best part of the game so far with the story being a second. Though, there is not much voice acting outside of Puck.

From the store page under the heading ""Build and Manage"":  ""Design and construct an impressive estate from a variety of styles and tilesets. Upgrade and customize your structures, and form communities to safely live off the land. You can even recruit NPC workers to help harvest resources as you work to expand your property.""  

I took this to mean that you could build buildings for different harvesting and crafting purposes and hire NPCs to work for you.  You can only hire one NPC and they basically follow you around to help fight things and they will randomly harvest resources if you equip them with a harvesting tool.  That was pretty misleading.  The ""management"" aspect doesn't exist.

Otherwise the game has been okay but a little boring.  Other games have done the initial survival loop a lot better and made it more interesting.  I understand the early game hand holding to teach you the mechanics of the card system but most survival games just drop you into a new world with no explanation and want you to figure out what you are supposed to do on your own.  I never feel any danger at the beginning of this game.

So many negative reviews on this title have nothing to do with the actual game. This game has attracted new gamers to the survival genre and they are rating the game down simply for being what the the game is supposed to be. 

 This game is a breath of fresh air in a genre that has been over saturated with same ole same ole.  The graphics and atmosphere are simply stunning.  The creatures and enemies and npcs are all well done in regards to theme and style.  The game play loop and progression system is awesome and a fresh take on the genre.  The combat is fun and engaging without being overly complex or bogged down.  The base building is very well done and awesome and is only going to get better.  The game has actual lore and story to tell to flesh out the world and make things make sense which is something most survival games lack.  The game world and realm systems are so fun and unique. The points of interest are fun and really well done.   I can't wait to see more updates and content for this game as it gets more and more fleshed out but don't worry there is already enough in the game to make the price point more than worth it.  You are gonna get you're money worth out of this one don't worry about that.

Nightingale has so much potential, and while I have enjoyed playing so far im at a point where I don't want to play it anymore, simply as I don't want to hate it, this game is in very very very early access and personally I think its been released too early.

Cons for me.
- Crafting - Seems great! Theres so much to do, menu's and UI's however are lacking. A pull from chest system also needs to be incorporated asap!
- Combat - feels empty and boring, really disconnected... its too easy, enemies are dumb
- Companion recruitment - reminds me of the guy from sons of the forest, doesn't do anything to help you what-so-ever. Need to be able to set tasks and leave him behind while your doing your own thing.
- Building - seems OK however have experienced lag when placing blueprints - I have a high end pc and this shouldn't be happening.

Needs work, but there is a lot of potential.

Top thoughts: 
1. Online-only, even if you play alone. This means any server-side issues or updates prevent you from playing the game. 
2. Crafting feels poorly designed, and unnecessarily cumbersome. 
3. Gathering generally ranges from feeling average/normal to uninspired. Though when you have harvested enough stone for 2 foundation squares/sections, and are so over-encumbered that you have to slow walk back to your ""estate"", this just feels like poor design/optimization. 
4. Crafted 10 meats, thought it was cool that I could queue up multiple items for crafting, then immediately got disconnected from the server due to inactivity. #sigh.",1708516961,1708691659,True,0,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,True

The hotfix seems to have solved a significant number of technical issues, which seems like the right moment to give a thumbs up. I can't complain on that front, despite having a fairly old PC atm.

Building and crafting feels great, though a bit of QoL is still needed. The game does have its own unique QoL features, like the NPC sidekick which is really useful, but the menus are bit convoluted. 

I did more exploration and it's been pretty good. I didn't expect there to be quite as much variety and content already. Even the same biomes come in noticeably different variations which is pretty cool. There's always some place to go, something to do and craft. The loop really sucks you in after a few hours.

The people who are reviewing the game negatively are doing so purely out of a gut reaction to some server instability and crashes on not even the first day, but first few hours, of this EARLY ACCESS game going live, not on the merits of the game itself.

Just to get a few things out of the way, I started playing on day 2 after the release:

- I have a 5-6 year old PC, and I've not experienced a single crash.
- Apart from a lengthy initial load in (maybe 2-3 minutes), I've had zero server issues.
- A lot of games are always online these days. If you don't want to play an online only game, that's fine, just go play something else. Online only is not a reason to rate a game negatively, when the game is otherwise great.

The game is beautiful. The story is intruiguing. The music is atmospheric. The gameplay is already rich and deep, with a plethora of building schematics and recipes. Exploring, gathering, and crafting is a joy, and picking up bits of the story is fun. Which is exactly what you want from a survival game! I don't think Nightingale really innovates on the genre, but the world building is what's hooked me, it sets it apart from other survival games.

There are a couple of issues I do have, but it's not stopping me from enjoying the game:

- A few small graphical glitches, plants coming through foundations, clouds not blending well with sunrise/sunset, etc
- Building can be a bit of a chore because you have to be carrying your building materials, they won't get auto pulled from nearby containers

First off. It's early access, the game reflects that, but Devs are upfront about it. It's not one of those EA titles where they're trying to pretend it isn't.

In some aspects there's a great foundation in Nightingale. But raw content aside, there's a lot more work to go.

Combat has potential to be really quite fun and engaging. But it will depend solely on improvements to AI. The tools you have at your disposal are already really quite fun and varied. But what you fight against is currently a bit dull, and a bit dumb.

Crafting will be absolutely fine, and serve the vision of the game once the Devs implement some QoL features, and overhaul/update parts of the UI. There are too many different stations in the game to not have the option to craft from nearby storage (and build, but more on that later). Even if it has to be an object you build, or when you upgrade your crafting stations to the next level - it NEEDS to be added. 

Also you can't currently split and merge stacks of items without first transferring them to a different container, or dropping them and picking them back up. That needs to change. 

A quick stack into an open storage (all of same type) is desperately needed. And quick stack to all nearby storage on top of that would be greatly welcomed. 

Being able to type to input the amount to craft also needs to be added. 

And finally we need to be able to access fuel (for stations that require them) easier. There's literally a radial options menu, add it to that.

The environments feel very samey. I've been to a few 'major' different versions of the forest biome, and all are very similar aside from a few minor variations in the structures that spawn. I really hope I'm either missing some later game changes, or that way more variance is added as new content down the line. Otherwise Inflexion are definitely falling short of what they intended with the exploration part of the game.

Too early to tell how good/expressive the building system is. It's definitely functional. But unless some fundamentals are changed, then how enjoyable it is, and how unique you can build your structures is going to depend entirely on how many pieces (and variants) are available. It's far more like static building blocks and far less 'physical' and free than say, Sons of the Forest or Valheim (where your only real limit is game physics and your imagination). As previously mentioned. It would also help the feel of the game massively if you could use the radial menu to add materials from nearby storage. And while I'm not expecting the voxel editing of enshrouded, some kind of terrain deformation (or at least letting us remove non-mineable rocks etc.) would benefit the system greatly.

Puck's VA is great. So great that it's jarring that no other named NPCs talk.

Graphics/Visuals are weird. Hopefully they can be addressed in a major way, otherwise it's always going to fail in comparison to everything else in the genre that has recently released. Having foliage react to weather and fixing the many lighting issues will go a long way.

Performance is also really, shockingly bad. The game is very unoptimised right now. 3rd person inexplicably runs better than first. As soon as a few enemies (but not neutral creatures) spawn nearby it tanks the framerate. If you were to compare Nightingale to Sons of the Forest (even when that first entered Early Access) it's not even close. Nightingale looks worse whilst also running at significantly lower framerates and having a lot more instability and random drops. Inflexion have a long long road of optimisation ahead of them if Nightingale is to succeed. 

TLDR; It's good, but not great. If it's your kind of thing then get it when more QoL features have been added and performance has been improved.",1708525397,1708688776,False,3,1,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,True

Here is why:
- Setting: It's fresh and full of potential and possibilities.
- Graphics: Although there are always some people who think they can impress others by their supposedly high standards and therefore find it a good idea to act snobish and entitled, Nightingale offers good viduals and a more or less solid UE5 implementation.
- Realm Cards: The core mechanic, supported by procedural generation of the relms itself, is sometimes confusing, sometimes lets you get a glimpse of what could or will be possible with such an amount of various combinations.
- Thoes devs care. A lot. The respond quickly, the implement changes the crowd is asking for, they are open for ideas.
- From a technical point of view, this game is very much playable and not overly bug-ridden. I appreciate that.

The building is pretty good can really make your house look good with all the different structures you will find your house will fill up with Augmentations Pretty quickly ( They help with higher level crafting and some items are hidden until you place the Augmentation) 

i have been to each Biome now and feel like i have experianced nearly everything the game has to offer with saying that. Yes i am still enjoying myself, Yes i feel the Main bosses ( Quest towers) are Copy and Pasted so you know if your going to the quest its the same Boss!

Grinding all these different Materials will have you stacking Chests too much.

the best card i have used so far is The Hunt and my godness that on extreme is basicly  2-3 hits and your dead :P

i would say its a fun game and if your looking to play some Survival it hits the nail but dont expect miracles it is only early access.. Now for the fun part

Most bosses Can be Easily defeated ( Farm Essence every way possible) Buy every upgrade you find from Essence traders and you will notice that like us we had the shotgun wayyy before we was supposed to and it made beating boss's faster and having your little helper use a Axe or Pick ( Usually pick on metal guy) Helps a ton and if you die and they are alive Free revive dont need to run back..

i would Recommend if your looking for something to play, And YES its Always online but that doesnt bother me!

if your looking for a challenge i would say Char either hard or extreme and Realm Extreme most things will 1 shot you xD

Nightingale is a great game for people who like crafting and exploring. At the heart of the game is crafting, but it is a slow process and it takes a while to gain all the crafting recipes you want, and in that time, you are crafting and exploring. You explore to gain materials. New materials unlock more crafting recipes. A lot of crafting recipes. 

Early game is mostly crafting, while exploring to gain materials. Eventually you start to explore random dungeons. Dungeons have special materials to unlock great recipes and cards. Cards are used to traverse into other dimensions and modify the context of that dimension, such as having more materials or having more enemies. Different dimensions have different materials for different recipes. The different materials change what bonuses you gain. So there is no one perfect dimension. This forces you to explore. 

You level up your gear with, you guessed it, crafting. Enchanting tables, upgrade tables, etc. Your gear level allows you to progress further into the more complex attributes of dimensions, and harder dungeons. Eventually, from what I have read, you will be fighting along side other explorers, taking down large beasts for rare materials. 

So far my experience has been fun, but filled with hiccups due to early access. In no way has it hindered the fun level I am having. I love crafting games, and this one scratches the itch. Yes, it is also a survival game, but at its heart, its a crafting game. Just have patience. Its a snowball effect.

QoL is lacking. Combat is basic. Enemy and ally AI is bad. Followers can't even use ranged weapons and are teleported everywhere as they can't path.

Building is very basic - I wasn't expecting Vintage Story or Enshrouded but was hoping to atleast have half walls like in Grounded.

not to mention the games indpepthness, this is definitely not a game you will finish in a day or 2.

7.8 out of 10.

lost 1 point for big performance drops sometimes falling from 90fps down to 40 an seem to happen pretty often.
lost 1 point for ping issues.    apparently the only server is in the USA so if you don't live there expect your bullets to land very late.
lost .1 of a point for long server load times when teleporting to a new world.   which you will do alot.    possibly again due to poor servers
an lastly lost .1 of a point for incomplete icons.    not all the items in the game have an icon yet.     some just have a red sticker which when your looking for a single item an you have to mouse over every single red sticker to see what it is can be very annoying.

the game also have the weight an quantity in the same spot on items which can get super confusing but im sure will be fixed later

all in all awell rounded survival game that will keep you playing for many hours.     even better if you happen to be close to a server.

I hope Inflexion continues to work on the game and improve it in a way that caters to all potential players!

~~~~~

So... after hopping on their Discord and getting a better understanding of the technical aspects of this game, I have to say that it's probably my favorite survival game I've seen thus far. It's a shame that Palworld and Enshrouded both released so recently, as they've overshadowed this absolute gem.

Now, don't get me wrong - there are flaws with core aspects of the game's back-end if you have particular methods of playing [b]or[/b] are not physically near servers. Namely, the fact the game is built with online-only gameplay in mind. A huge thumbs down to Inflexion for not transparently telling the community about it until after launch (NOTE: Developers have released a statement where they have collectively decided to prioritize an offline/server-free gameplay mode!). While the reasoning behind it is very logical after understanding how fluid it can get (more on that later), at an early state of the game and even earlier in initial progression, it makes absolutely no sense. 95% of players will probably have this gripe and stop playing within a few hours at best. Once you've progressed to a part where realms are actively explored and you're playing with different groups of players to tackle new obstacles, it begins to come together and just click.

This all said, the fact the game is built in the way it is - it [b]must[/b] be on the ball when it comes to server management and load balancing. So it's a shame that like so many games in the past, AAA or indie, that they've hit a number of set-backs that as a result have caused the majority of players to talk poorly of it. Even the games I mentioned earlier had issues, but most importantly, they had solo or self-hosted options available that were clean enough to play without disruption. Meanwhile, Nightingale requires all players to be signed in and accessing servers. I also believe they've built it this way to prevent cheating and griefing, as once offline/online systems co-mingle, anything goes in all the wrong ways.

Each 'realm' is saved and actively hosted for people to join and leave as they see fit - but it's why this game has the back-end it does. Once you start playing with a half dozen people and you're all tackling different realms, but assisting one another in building your own little town, everything clicks and you begin to appreciate what the devs are striving to create. It's very cool once you start placing portals to each discovered realm and set off on your own expeditions to finish your objectives, all while having the flexibility of tackling it with different friends or going solo.

And don't get me started on all the other combat mechanics I've begun to discover. Crafting will be a huge rabbit hole for some people and I won't get into it for now, since it's an essay in itself. Gear score isn't the greatest way to handle it, but I understand why they settled on it for now - anything more and it's just mindboggling. At first glance, it's a pretty basic system that you'll see in many survival games. But once you open the hood, it has this Bioshock/Elder Scrolls vibe to it. And I love it.

Overall? This game needs work. And devs need to be transparent to consumers about what they can expect, especially with poor internet connections or remote locations. But for now, and for [b]me[/b], I'm giving it a huge thumbs-up. And this is coming from someone who's already completed all of Palworld and Enshrouded's current content (All achievements and full codex; and all quests complete, all achievements, max skill points - respectively).

[b]TLDR[/b]: Nightingale is a culmination of No Man Sky's ambitious 'multiplayer' promises, Conan Exile's base building, Skyrim/Morrowind/Bioshock's combat, and Valheim's survival aspects... except it's actually 70-80% there on all fronts. While in Early Access. If you want to support these devs, get this game now, give it a shot, and provide feedback. They [b]*listen*[/b].

The crafting is currently a burden. 
The game is definitely designed to be a co-op game and shouldn't aim to be just a single player (that's why the choice of having online servers).

I think we're on Day 3 now.... and a lot of my complaints seem to be fixed. The only complaint I have left is the load screens are a bit too long for my taste.

I've played 2 hours and am just a little ways out of the prologue/tutorial and I wanted to offer my thoughts to people willing to listen.

Lots of games in early access are cash grab scams. Nightingale is a good game with lots of room for growth. Its current state is definitely early access, but there are some solid foundations here.

Some general feedback to the devs in no particular order:

- Server stability is paramount in an online only game. I've d/ced on loading screens about 3-4 times but have been able to reconnect quickly (It's launch day, and my experience was pretty smooth, I'll be patient!)
- The world is gorgeous and so is the setting.
- The UI needs polish. Don't reinvent the wheel. The escape key should close the currently active window. No cursor necessary.
- Hireling AI could use some upgrades. Also, please let me designate a task to my hirelings (chopping wood).
- I see a lot of points of interest on the map that have resources but are otherwise unpopulated. I hope these will contain encounters/puzzles/npcs/loot in the near future.
- Pucks Dialogue and voice acting is amazing. Please add voice acting for other major npcs.
- Please let us use materials in our storage containers at crafting devices without the need to pick them up.
- AI can eventually craft on our behalf, right? I hope so.
- The default resolution/graphics settings are pretty low. I should increase it, but other games have fried hardware... and I'm cautious about it. I'll give it some time.
- You have an in-game bug report feature - that's great. Now we need an ingame bug report feature that captures game logs. Users don't describe bugs well. Accessing the games code will help diagnose issues. Please add an in-game suggestion feature too.
- Having a game that saves your progress by being online only means I don't have to rent or set up a server for myself and/or friends, which I like.

They need to add in the feature for us to automatically get the items to craft from the chest.
There's so many resources and each of it gives the armor different stats depending on what you craft it with.

You can't skip progression. The game actually makes you progress slowly as you follow the tutorial to the quest that's available to you. It's nice but you won't get the ""Oh shit I shouldn't be here yet"" feeling like what most survival games offer.

Overall it's a good game but like a diamond in the rough. It should get better after a few more patches. But for the time being if you don't have the patience to build, craft and progress I wouldn't recommend.

Positives:

+ graphics are pretty to look at
+ the lore and the theme of the game are generally interesting
+ crafting galore, many systems to discover and upgrade
+ attention to detail in the environment
+ doesn't take itself too seriously and remembers to have fun with concepts
+ possible to choose between 1st and 3rd person view (though 3rd person is a bit experimental and sometimes clunky)

Negatives:

- the tutorial is way too long and tedious, while the lore in it might be interesting to some, it can be applied elsewhere
- the tutorial holds your hand with very basic objectives found in almost every survival game pretty much and then the game stops giving you the necessary information to progress at certain things
- the UI is a mess and far too complicated to use
- combat feels a bit clunky, the mob AI needs work (mind you that I am using the first tools in the game though and have little experience)
- slight worries about the development promises of the EA lasting only a year
- gathering resources feels a bit inconvenient and slow, but bearable
- one of those ""always online"" games even when playing SP, which may cause performance decrease with some users with bad Internet connections or even less than high end hardware (based on other people's opinions and content, as I have high end specs and Internet connection myself and don't see any problems even when running the game on the highest settings in the experimental 3rd person mode)

Overall First Impressions:

The game is not as good as I expected, but given that the developers can fix some of the things the community generally seem to find problematic and takes a little more patience promising deadlines, I do think it can turn out to be a great addition to any survival collection.

However, at this state I can't really recommend it to anyone else, than survival game hobbyists and EA enthusiasts such as myself, or if you really enjoy the themes of the game.

Overall I think where this game fails where as Palworld in comparison succeeded, is that the game mechanics lack polish and QoL features. World generation has a difficulty setting for example, but you have no control over certain aspects to customize your experience, such as resource spawn rate, enemy health, enemy damage, player health, player damage and so on.

The UI is... well. It's there and while I do not absolutely hate it, I have seen better in most survivals I have played. I feel like they tried to create this steampunky feel to it, but they went way overboard with it and made it too complex and messy. Even quit button was harder to find than in most games and the game can only log you out and you need to log back in or quit, so you can't simply return to the character selection screen.

Something about mob AI and hitboxes feel weird, but I have only been using the most basic of tools and have not gotten actual weapons yet, or killed any of the bosses, so there is little for me to say at this point.

Building system has functioned, though again the UI is very clunky and confusing. Getting materials for building can be tedious though, since you need about 600 stone to make a big stone house and the minable stone takes only a single hit, but provides three stone, that weigh quite a bit. There is the possibility to open the map though and return to your base after mining yourself full of stone, so that helps, but unless better tools provide more stone (which I don't yet know), building something like castles may get very tedious.

Overall I think the content so far has been decent and I'm not feeling cheated buying the game, though my expectations were slightly above what the game currently is (mostly for the UI and AI really based on my first impressions, as well as the always online way of playing).

I will say 55% recommended and 45% not recommended, so this is why I say yes. It's a decent game, that may have potential to become a great game, when given the time, resources and attention it requires, but may not be appealing to some people at it's current state, as it lacks attention and polish.",1708679863,1708679863,True,3,0,0.552238762378692627,1,True,False,True

People also ask
How does multiplayer work in Nightingale?
Nightingale allows players to set up private games, where up to six players can join together to adventure through the Realms in drop-in/drop-out multiplayer. You take your character with you when you enter a game; when you leave the game, you leave with all the materials and loot you collected.

It is very much like if Ark was more akin to the mechanics of Terraria, reminds me of Rift with the private realms but it would be much better if there were integrated public lobbies and servers

This game is not fun to me, in any capacity.  and as a dev I can see that the devs intentionally drew out the intro of the game just long enough to get you past the 2 hour mark before interacting with the multiplayer so that you can't return it once you realize it's bad",1708664952,1708679616,False,1,0,0.472862958908081055,0,True,False,True

Save your money, see where it goes.

Pros - Nice atmosphere... ish. Great concept for a game, executed horribly.

Cons - Game play loop.
Open a new portal -> wait a few mins for portal to fully open (Longest wait - 10 mins) -> open map, clear fae fort so you can discover the main poi's. Do them, as they are mostly puzzles, leave, deposit goods, rinse, repeat. Maybe stick around abit to mine resources from that world, or keep it open.

Always online. This has been beaten into a bush already and left half dead, but a valid point. If they close servers, you lose access to this game unless an offline version comes out
Big Note - Umbrellas. This is a huge advertising point, as you watch in the trailer as people Mary Poppins their way around with the umbrellas. They aren't ""That"" Bad, but they go in an offhand slot, and cant be used with most weapons. This does mean that when you land you have to equip your main weapon to then begin combat which can take a good bit. Especially when the slots this consumes is used for food for increasing your health, or healing potions to make sure you don't die.

Inventory space.
Basic AI not responding to things they should be.
Simplistic combat. (Damage types between axe / pickax / maul / ranged)
- Night time is aids, but cool.
- Difficulty actually matters in the game, Easy is run around and solve puzzles one shotting everything, extreme is suffer alone and die any time a mob hits you 
Extreme is Built for groups.
Easy is Solo play.
(I Played on Extreme for 24 hours, and 21 hours of hard - Hard is perfect for solo play, anything under and its too easy.)

Icons for materials / goods.
This has to be a joke from the devs. Your going to have a bunch of items/buildables that have icons and a bunch that just don't. Sulfur and Coal don't have icons outside of a generic N icon. Gunpowder has an icon but the items to make it doesn't? 
To add on to this note - Too many icons are shared between items.
For example - Hide is split into two categories. Predator / Prey. 
- These icons are shared. So its the same tuft of fur. 
- There is also Tiers to this lovely system. so predator goes into T1 to T3. That's 6 items all sharing the same icon.
- This extrapolates on itself the moment you bring in meat, bones, plant fiber, and other drops. 

Then there is the named mobs - They drop unique tiers of the same crap, but the difference between predator T2 hide and the special predator hide a little crown on the icon. Stat wise? Almost no difference. .5% resistance between the two parts is a joke.
Stats on these crafting materials is a mess. Predator gear is health based and prey is stamina based - That's fine and gives you something to understand. But bloats crafting due to all these little augments that are needed on your bench as-well. More small clutter around your building makes it look lived in sure, but build mode only lets you place 300 items. Each bench can only have X amount of modifiers. Lights to make crafting faster, a hat rack so you can craft a specific hat, a coat rack to make a coat, it gets cluttered quick.
You now have incorporated micromanaging augments for your crafting system. Hurrah!
Not to mention the not being able to pull from local storage does really hurt. 

No animation for opening doors. Its either open or closed. and when you hit it to open it, its suddenly the other state. Pretty jarring experience.

AI will attack mobs that hit you, that's fine. However their weapon will damage your building. So if you have a shelf with all your crafting augments on it as they have short range, and you are afk and a wolf runs in and hits you, your ai follower may break that shelf with everything on it. They may even break a foundation and really rip stuff up.

- Follower AI - This is something that people are overlooking. As more people get on the servers, ai goes from being useful to just standing in place and swinging their weapon in place and missing everything. They also have unlimited weight, so you can dump whatever you want on them if its too heavy, its just limited by space. BUT WAIT. There's these little aid quests that pop up where you need to build on a building for an NPC to hire them as a recruit. You can only have one. So if your companion has a bunch of your wood and there's a wooden house that needs to be built, suddenly your wood goes into this building that cant be taken apart. The last 20 mins you just spent farming? Gone.

- AI Cant use long range, is stuck swinging tools as weapons because there are no other melee weapons. Maul is useless against any kind of wild animal that has skin.

- Debuffs. Not having an explanation on these or even having nothing to show up when you get one outside of a little red indicator that ticks down, you cant do anything to clear them short of dying. Only way you CAN get a description - Open inventory and hover mouse over it. Two debuffs that sucked the most was broken arm and broken leg.
- Broken arm - you cant block and lose out on damage in melee.
- Broken leg - Cant evade or jump.

- Sleep - Cant swing a weapon/tool when your character is tired. The moment you hit 25-30% or so on the sleep bar, your stamina hits down to 1-8 so you cant run anymore and need to put down a bed to rest. You will need plant fiber and sticks with you all the time. 6/6. Thankfully when you deconstruct you can pickup your materials again. Just plop it down, hit e a few times and your fully rested. there's no animation here, so long as you have it plopped down on a rock, your good! Oh wait, there's another problem. 
If its night time, mobs will spawn on you constantly, which will prevent you from sleeping. So either you take the death or you try and run with very little stamina in hopes you can slap your little roll out and get some rest in so you can kill the mobs.

- Picking up your stuff after you die. This shouldn't even be an issue. yet it is. Because you open the whole inventory and you have to hit move to inventory. Should just be hold e -> loot. Instead current system you stand there and hope what killed you doesn't hit you again while your trying to find that button.

- In their defense on the storage is a system they are supposedly working on, however, if its not in the first or second major patch, expect it not to come. 

Me and my sister got tired of the same three biomes, same copy pasted puzzles in each one. Maybe one new enemy type as we progressed into the harder difficulties, which was cool to see, but got bland quick.

To give an example as to how little faith I have in this company, and I'm glad to be proven wrong at a later date - 
Multiplayer - When inviting someone to your realm. The accept button is on the right. Not the left. Its common sense to place it on the left. Why is deny on the left?

I've seen alot of empty promises from other companies, and this is one that seems loaded with excuses, especially when acknowledging it always being online. I don't know how they couldn't see the same exact issue with H1Z1 survivors and expect it not to meet the same backlash.

As someone who's been in a lot of EA titles, including on the development side, some of this is fine. I can excuse some stuff, but there are glaring issues that should not have cleared internal QA, like the placement of buttons on UI, or the lack of icons both are stupidly simple to correct and would have taken little less than a common work day to correct and get right. Missing a few icons is fine, missing half of your game as icons is not. Instead they overlooked it and shipped it on out. My hope that this company isn't acting out of malice is pretty much shot at this point.

I will not recommend this as there's too little your getting back for what they are asking price wise.

Yes, that's a little bit of clickbait im sorry about that! Have to get some view some ways. Don't hate the player hate the game. Well not this game but you know what i mean.

Played a bit further! It's rough it's a typical survival game rough though. Unless i'm very very stupid which might be true. You will consistently be like: HUH? WHere is that? Why is this like this? Huh why is this happening? But i was the same with ARK and i played that for over 300 hours or something. So if you play survival games you know what you get and you just have to keep going i guess a bit longer? We will see ill continue to play.

Oo fighting is cool i think didnt do a lot but it feels impactfull that i really like.

- Home realm if your friends explore the area without you and complete the starting quest dungeon temple thingy then it doesn't seem to re spawn for you when you do it resulting in an empty run through, though i could still fight the boss.

- Public realms when travelling i encountered issues of network errors kicking me out on the loading screens though entering the home realm i had no issues. I'm putting this down to a lot of players playing causing it. Also if someone on the public realm has done all the ruins and looted the chests, again i found no re spawn of the enemy and chests remained empty.

-When moving to different realms i was able to get around my friend completing stuff by going in solo in private and then i could complete the area by myself or invite my friend to the area. I am curious to know if we was to reset the portal and do the same cards again would we get a refreshed area or would we return to the version you were originally in when you first visited.

The major failure of the current game state is the lack of information. Most items don't have any meaningful description despite great flavor text. A lot of basic functionality of the game has a slew of additional factors that affect them without either intuitive design or reasonable explanations to give you an idea of how to properly utilize them. This list goes on, and on, and on. My biggest effective hindrance right now is that so much progression is seemingly locked behind random chance that promotes inflated playtime rather than enjoyment; I'm currently just scouring realms' merchants looking for the one crafting bench I need, hour after hour.]

Struggling to find the joy in the game. It feels like it's got good bones but is missing all the meat.

Pros: Card stuff and portaling is novel and good. Dialogue and writing is great. The different realms are really pretty, as is the game overall. Great price point, for sure.

Cons: Some really unclear elements of mechanics and systems that are entirely unintuitive. Unreasonable running simulator; huge maps that quickly wear thin with uninteresting exploration and weak puzzles/combat/rewards when you end up finding points of interest. Puzzles range from baby mode to frustratingly obscure. QoL features missing that are usually survival-crafting 101: storage management is a nightmare, no 'move to stack' so you instead have to manually transfer each item to and from storage, no crafting from storage. Always-online feels like such a weird choice for this style of game, and seems to lead to exceptionally long loading times with portals and logins.

Currently, the game is not really in a state to be fully recommended to anyone interested in jumping in. But I see that once the obvious problems are resolved, this game will be an awesome experience. They have already said they are working on an offline mode (that should have been on release), so at least I know they are listening to the critics of this game. Because as someone from Chile who is far away from any current available server, playing as a ranger is a no-go.

As of now, the one thing that should be a priority is the AI of both enemies and the recruit. The recruit feels especially underwhelming. It won't pick up every item that it is near, and when it does, it's slow. I feel like the recruit should feel like a better version of Kenny from Sons of the Forest. And maybe solo players should have a way to be able to recruit more companions.

Other than the above, I do like the game and hope they end up making it better for everyone.

Not just graphics, but atmosphere design, and also sound design. The game excels at mystery and curiosity.

The game is its own creation, and makes for an incredibly unique experience, and thankfully lacks that Depth/less procedural generation that have come out with recently. 

I haven't gotten too far into the story, but the content that I have completed has made me question some actions I've been force to take on a moral level. Puck has a great way of making you know that the realms is a gift, and Humans have a way of taking things for granted. 

The scene of wanderlust the game gives you is just want I've been craving. And I'm grateful to have the game. I really hope that the devs push through and continue to polish and add more to this wonderful universe.

Nightingale's blend of complex crafting and poor storage solutions creates a frustrating experience after 10 hours of gameplay (currently over 20 its been a nightmare to work with). While exploration and puzzles offer engaging moments, they fail to compensate for the game's flawed crafting and storage systems. Individually, these issues might be manageable, but together, they make the game nearly unplayable.


[h3]LONG VERSION[/h3]
Deciding whether Nightingale is worth recommending is a challenge due to its intricate crafting system and inadequate storage solutions. While crafting offers depth, its complexity can hinder enjoyment. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Nightingale boasts an elaborate crafting system, possibly the most intricate in the survival genre. However, this complexity often becomes a barrier to enjoyment. Augmentations add layers of complication, with each refined bench accommodating numerous augmentations. Consequently, players must contend with a plethora of required items, leading to missed crafting opportunities and frustration. Unlocking recipes, such as the pistol, can be daunting, further impeding progress.

Every item in Nightingale can possess different stats and perks, adding depth but also complexity to gameplay. This variability extends to materials, with multiple tiers of hides offering diverse boosts. While some may appreciate this depth, others may find it overwhelming, particularly given the vast array of items and crafting possibilities.

One of Nightingale's significant drawbacks is its inadequate storage system, considering the abundance of items and variations. The absence of features like auto-sorting and auto-transfer exacerbates the issue. In a game with such complexity, streamlined storage management is essential to prevent frustration and maintain immersion.

Nightingale shines in its building system, allowing for intricate structures and personalized homes. The structural load system adds realism and depth to construction. Exploration, coupled with puzzle-solving, offers excitement and challenge, although some puzzles may prove daunting.

Combat mechanics in Nightingale remain unclear, with confusion surrounding skills and magic usage. Despite this, the upgrade system is straightforward, utilizing essence tiers for gear enhancement. While combat may lack satisfaction for some, progression through upgrading gear remains a redeeming aspect.

Nightingale offers a mix of highs and lows, with its crafting system and storage functionality serving as major stumbling blocks. While the complexity of crafting may appeal to certain players, it can overwhelm others. The inadequate storage system further detracts from the overall experience, hindering enjoyment.

Despite commendable aspects such as building and exploration, Nightingale's flaws, particularly in crafting and storage, make it difficult to wholeheartedly recommend. Players interested in complex crafting mechanics may find aspects of the game appealing, but for many, its unnecessary intricacies and poor storage implementation overshadow its strengths.

My first review of this game was a negative one and then I was mad and sat there and thought ""c'mon.. it's so unique there has to be a way you like it"".... So I kept playing, gave it a second try and now after 22.5 hours I will give it a thumbs up, only because it managed to keep me busy for that long. If the exploration of this game would not be so fantastic, nothing would keep me playing it. 

So here is my pros and cons list.... which is probably not surprising. 

Pros:
- The voice Actor of Puck is amazing. I love listening to him and the story he presents
- The exploration is fantastic, although I wish the climbing hooks would have been explained in the tutorial. 
- Beautiful world. The setting and the atmosphere which I can even change on my homeworld, are breathtaking. I love looking around and enjoy the diversity of landscape and sky

Soso:
- While I enjoy the vast majority of items and crafting stations I became confused with the crafting stations upgrades. They look cool and apparently they allow you new recipies. Do they though? I have yet to see one new recipie from the Addons.

Negative:
- The explanation of the game and certain mechanics is majorly lacking. This begins with the Addons which promise new recipies, but how? They arent there. Do I have to discover them, buy them, upgrade something else? Why is area looting a tooltip and not explained in the Tutorial? Why is not explained how trees regrow and I have to find out through google? Why does porting from a world giving me the prompt that I may not be able to return, instead of telling me how I can return? 

- The Tutorial is pointless at this stage of the game. Eat, build a fire, cook, build a tent, build tools, sleep. Those are the basic functions all survival games have, but an explanation for the (to me) important things are lacking as I mentioned above. Also why is there no explanation that I can get Essentia from Challenges I finished? 

- The UI is a mess. I personally dont undersand how such skilled and creative designers can come up with that UI. It feels like old Forest but more chaotic. Menus meet submenus and more menus. Crafting stations have two seperate menu-spots but nothing is truly explained. You want to see the stats of the armor you create? Okay, you have to check that in your construction menu, because the crafting station falls short of telling you that. You want to see the boni of your station? Okay, find another sub menu. It's finnickey and tideous and took me 5 hours to somewhat understand. Oh and you want to put a seed in your planter? Well no, it's greyed out, but why? Do I need soil? Do I need something else? No explanation. 

- Autosorting is just a no-go. In a game with roughly 500+ different items and icons and a cluttered inventory I can not find my most important items or tools in any other way other than sorting it by ""newest"", so my old stuff is where I expect it. That needs to be changed. 

- Instant-sorting. Seriously.... So many many items and I have to either drag or right click all ""fitting"" items into a chest by hand. That's just frustrating when you have about 20 storages around to sort all the different materials which come in different versions. Maybe its there and I havent found it, because once again... lacking explanations. 

- Not building from boxes has been mentioned many times and yes, it is an issue. 

- Combat is not fun to me. It feels like a hack and slay with pseudo Eldenring combat and I hate it. The AI is quite dumb and  in other areas is so tough, that they fry you to bits and pieces if you don't watch out, or explode behind your back, killing you in an instant and you won't know what happened. Combat is my least favorite part of this game. 

- Armor and Gear was promised and I am still waiting for it. All the trailers show the players with some sort of rifle or something and yet I am on a lvl 40 world with still a knife, an axe and a slingshot. I find that very frustrating to be honest. I keep looting ammunition, but can not use them in any way. Crafting gear is great and should always be a priority to get the BIS gear, but c'mon you already added 500+ items, why is there not a random drop of gear or weapon here and there to be found and looted? I travel through modern landscapes wich machinery but I can't find any piece of broken gear or weapon, at least sometimes? I hope this gets fixed in the future. 

- Resting feels incredibly pointless. It serves nothing because I can rest anywhere I want, all I need is a tent and a sleeping bag or sleep in one of the premade houses. Useless feature. 

- New Recipies go under among old ones. I don't understand why a new recipie or a new crafting station is not highlighted in a different color until I built it at least once. Don't get me wrong, I do know that there is an option to see wether I have buil a station before or not, but that once again is hidden somewhere among the sub menus of the UI. 

Quality of Life is majorly lacking in this game as of now and I am looking forward to the future that this Game, which truly can become a jewel of its genre, will get the updates it needs to reach that goal.",1708479344,1708672831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The graphics in the tutorial were lovely then when me and my friend entered our game in a private multiplayer, the graphics got really blurred even though I fully meet the requirements and changed the graphics settings a few times. 
The controls are absolutely awful, they are janky and require way too much buttons to do anything. I was using my Xbox controller and at times I wasn't able to do anything, switched to keyboard and mouse and it was still very difficult. The amount of buttons required to do something so simple as to speak to a trader was really long-winded.
The crafting system is also really jank, why can't we just make an item instead of auto-filling? Seems like just an excuse for yet another button to press.
The map is annoying too. No mini-map and it's another 3 buttons just to look at the map. The menu system in general is button heavy, confusing and has too much information in several menus.
The hotbar is also very questionable. Why have 2 left and right mini hotbars when you can have just one bigger one? More buttons to press too.
Combat is extremely lackluster and the mobs seem to all do the same thing, no characteristics. I also found the characters bending down to grab things kinda looked weird and the graphics didn't help with that.
The character creation was great and that was about it.

That being said.......

I bought this game the morning of release and have only been able to connect a handful of times. The tutorials were most frustrating, as the most prominent connection issues occurred when passing through a portal (which you do three times early on), and loading in to a new realm.

In it's current state, I wouldn't under any circumstance tell anyone to buy this. Once the understandable server issues get resolved though, I believe it will be an adventure more than worth having.

People are complaining about online-only, which is probably valid, but for those of us with reliable internet, it is a non-issue.
Combat is clunky, but satisfying.
Crafting system is fairly original. Building is ok - nothing to write home about.
The progression is extremely slow, especially if you play solo on the hardest difficulty.

If you're like me and were disappointed by both Palworld and Enshrouded due to their lack of survival mechanics and difficulty, this might be for you. I enjoy survival games like Valheim because of their difficulty mixed with ambiance and satisfying progression. This game seems to have that, albeit at a slow and somewhat confusing pace. That's not a bad thing. I'm ok with being confused with a new survival game, because it implies it's not a a copy+paste of other game's mechanics.

Know what you're looking for in a game. If you want more of an RPG, you might be more content with Enshrouded. If you want difficulty and a seemingly long progression, this game might be right for you. This game isn't going to hand you anything unearned, especially at higher difficulties.

I have a strong suspicion that this game has a lot of depth that hasn't been revealed, and even more that will be revealed as development continues. I'm going to give this a qualitative recommendation, but make sure you know what you're getting into.

Nightingale certainly seems to fit the bill for that combination, puzzles, portals to wide ranging realms, bunny hopping and flying with umbrellas, all while surviving an unknown fae magic steampunk landscape.

Realm loading is quick, co-op is the most seamless thing I've ever seen, and they can join you in the realm you are exploring! 

You'll find a bulk of negative reviews at time of writing are talking about no offline mode, but considering how easy it is to join together, have public worlds, and the story loosely leading you to a No Mans Sky style hub, I think its by far not a single player game first, and there are plenty of other games that cater to that. I don't believe this warrants a 55/100 rating (at time of writing). 

Overall Score 7.5/10 (for now)
Well worth the entry price for this game, you could spend this money on far more incomplete or worse titles.

Pros: 
-Essence: Using essence for repairs get rid of tedious bullshit. Hate gathering? Get essence by killing things. Love gathering? Get essence by gathering things. Love Puzzles and find everything else a bit meh? Get essence and free unlocks of things! Trash your old gear, get essence! Its a wonderful system.
- Building: So many games screw up building, this has a built in copy tool! And you can move things! Wonderful.
- Visuals: Yeah, the myst part comes in two ways, the visuals, and the puzzles.
- Variety: Map variety, creature variety, enemy variety. What more can you ask for!
- Puzzles: Really fun, one even lead me in to a puzzle realm, where I had to work my way through the puzzles to get out.
- CoOp: Parties of 5, some weirdness (needs to be public for realm invites) but very seemless. Feels like good MMO quality.
- Lore: Feels really fleshed out, actually engaged in the story for this, but not too overbearing or fetch quest type deals.
- Scary: Yeah, hearing things scream and whisper ""Why!?"" in your ear when you get too close to a dungeon means you need to gear up.
- Realm:  Spice up your realm with low gravity, or have a special crafting discipline on your map. Bring eternal hellfire if you feel like it! Or live it up like Alaska in summer with no nighttime!

Meh:
- Unlock progression seems to be tied to story progression, even if you have certain augments.
- Tutorial parts pop in too early some times.
- Combat: Nothing really groundbreaking, but very suitable, even with low frame rates.
- NPC: You get an NPC, who does things depending on what you equip. Good as a damage sponge, kinda dumb in other occasions. Very fire prone.
- Inventory management simulator: Yeah, while I love different stats and combos for everything, I do wish the inventory spaces were larger to accommodate. Gets easier when you unlock the trunk however.
- Usual Early Access bits: Some text not spoken, but at least its consistent. Characters haven't started talking out of nowhere when they didn't before.

Cons: 
- Unreal 5: This engine looks wonderful, but the performance sucks. Good luck getting over 60 FPS without a card that has been released in the past few years. Overall I think they made the right call, but this game is not going to look its best on older cards.
- Only 3 realm Biomes. While they all change drastically, even on the same biome, I love what I see and want more biomes!
- Some frustrating parts of the UI that I keep having to mark as read, and not unlocking the ones I want to read.

Pros.
There's Fishing and yes you can build a Dock to fish off of

An overwhelming amount of materials which I love and they affect the items you craft; different ingots have different  affects on the axe you craft and gearscore. 
Perhaps some kind of cloud storage to make the crafting not so tedious. There's magic, enchantments. and charms so the possibility is certainly there.  

Realm cards is different and honestly one of the best features of the game. I cant wait to see them expand on this.

Always online, while I dont mind it this way as I'm usually a MMO player I can see this bothering others especially if there aren't any servers in places such as Australia.

Cons.

Combat needs improvement. 
NPCs need improvement, Puck seems to be the only one that has a personality. I'm sure thats a work in progress though.

Need more POIs and Puzzle games, maybe wandering merchants or NPCs fighting creatures in the environment,  something to make the world feel lived in. 
I want to see a group of Realmwalkers in the midst of an intense battle with a clutter of venomous spiders whilst I cast my line in the depths of the ocean to fish for some delicious rainbow trout. its the little things

I really like this game a lot!  I'm playing a mix of solo and multiplayer, which I love the ability to do (with or without my friends) since it's technically one of my friend's starting realms, and I have a lot more time than the original realm owner does.   The realms are really beautiful! The card system for creating portals to new worlds is really unique and interesting.  Being able to alter the realms rules is also fun.  We are LOVING the Thinned Veil card

The recipes to craft new items being scattered across the realms really pushes people who like crafting out of their bases and into the world (me..it pushes me) instead of waiting for their more adventurous friends to bring them back a new item to touch and then learn a recipe like other games.  I like how the augmentations open up the crafting tables to the potential of making new items as a separate thing and that your friends might know how to make something you don't.  

It's EA and there are a few things that I'm sure the devs are already working on; some they've mentioned already.  If you like beautiful worlds, interesting takes on survival crafting games, I recommend giving it a try.  It's less than $30, which I think is pretty fair for a very playable EA game.

   Pretty good survival game with plenty to do. The crafting system is VERY DEEP. Graphics are good. Combat is decent. Building system is simple and has many items. 
   The bad parts are to many crafting stations, where you forget what station makes what materials. The tutorial  isn't the greatest, it feels like its trying to feed you more lore and story then how to actually play.
   After a few hours you figure out that you grind essence to unlock further tiers of equipment at traders, then make portals to go into higher lvl worlds to craft even higher lvl equipment. The worlds are populated with puzzles to gain essence and NPCs to help earn more essence. The worlds feel empty without other players so the game is much better with friends.

This is a great game for those who get burnt out or bored with traveling to different biomes by foot.

I have tracked this game for over 2 years since it's initial trailer and I can say I am absolutely enthralled. I can't put it down without a fight and every trailer looks EXACTLY as the game does. You will not be disappointed with the game i promise.

- Your Structures have an overlay that shows the total amount of each resource you need to complete the building.
- You can track any craft you plan on making to always have the needs on your screen
- Ongoing Crafts auto-complete when you take a long rest (No matter the amount you have queued up)
- Building was given so much love you will feel excited to buy more construction options
- Grinding and resource gathering doesn't feel hindering or boring and is aesthetically pleasing to do
- Combat is challenging but not overtly punishing on Medium Difficulty
- REALMS ARE NEVER ENDING!
- The game is generous on things like ammo and certain more expensive crafts (Could craft x32 ammo with only 2 materials needed)
- You always have a goal in the top-right to provide direction and not get lost

I could not recommend this enough if you are a fan of open-world crafting games and want a more rewarding change of pace with the realms since you can actively edit the difficulty of realms on a whim. This is such a refreshing change from going into certain biomes to fight level-specific enemies. You can just craft a harder realm and immediately continue your journey.

They hyped it as if it was going to be fully released and not Early Access, not complaining but a bit disappointed. IMO, it was overly hyped. That being said, as I was very excited for Nightingale, has it delivered? I can't say for sure, but to me I'm neutral about the game. Why? The screenshots and trailers make it out to be so much more than meets the eye. The things you see in the screenshots and trailer are to attract you; however, you will not see that type of gameplay for a LONG TIME. The grind would be so much better if there was more going on in between the game to make it more enjoyable.

I'm 10 hours in and I feel like I haven't progressed at all, still chopping away with simple weapons & armor.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
Nightingale is in horrible need of a QOL update and lacks a lot of BASIC mechanics with Building, Follower AI, storage, crafting, etc. You're going to spend a large amount of time grinding through a beautiful world with linear quests, and those quests are the only way to progress, instead of progressing freely like in most survival crafting games. I'd only recommend if you enjoy a huge, easy and long grind.

[h1] EDIT [/h1]
Almost 20 hours in and I'm seeing some difficulty increase. This feels like an MMO, holy. At least I'm losing health and fights are starting to pick up. Enemy AI is still bad though. I ended up removing the AI follower since I don't need 'em anymore. I'm at gear score 87 and finally got to the point where item Tier is changing and higher level materials are useful. I was stuck for a very long time due to a progression quest that wants you to shoot animals in the heart (heartshot) and it took so long. I eventually went back to my realm after an hour of trying and got a heartshot on a boar and a wolf. I had to stealth to do it too. Very redundant quest. Anyway, I'll update as I go.

[h1] Review [/h1]
I have an open mind when it comes to Early Access. I haven't come across anything besides one crash and some minor lag spikes here and there. No issues with coop, servers, etc. Although, I really feel some of the things added within the game was not thoroughly created very well. For example, a lot of things are missing more (refer to Building and Follower AI). I also see almost everything shown about the game having third person, there's even a third person fov slider but yet no key-binding for third person.

[h2] Major Complaint [/h2]
""Waiting for server"" takes forever between realm load times. Not sure why this game needs a game server when it's online coop, not an Online MMO.
The Quest System. As you know in most Survival Crafting games you have freedom to do what you will. In Nightingale the Questing is basically your progression. I want to be thrown into an open world survival crafting experience to do what I want, not what the quests want me to do when it comes to progression. I want to explore, unlock progression materials or items by myself -- not through a game's questing system. You have the freedom to do a lot, but you're limited on progression until you follow the questline. Big disappointment from me as I don't feel the freedom like I do in most open world survival crafting games.

HUGE Bug when going to or from realms: I lost all of my items (not gear) when going through a portal to another realm. I lost a lot of time in progression because of this. Not sure how such an important feature like going to other realms has this major bug with losing items.

Running/Walking Simulator: You will be running a LOT. Realms aren't too big but they can become big when you're going from one POI to another.

[h2] World [/h2]
The world is beautiful. Atmosphere is most definitely there. Gathering, chopping, crafting and mining is very satisfying.

[h2] Difficulty [/h2]
So far I'm not seeing any challenge to the game. Enemies are easy and their behavior is very dumb.

[h2] Building [/h2]
Very basic. There's also no ""destroy"" button after placing an object down. Only thing good about building is the mass ""add resources"" to build everything at once.

[h2] POIs and Events [/h2]
Each POI is the same in every realm. Nothing really special except the chests. Honestly, it seems added as a filler to unlock certain things like POT PLANT or CANDLE for your house. They aren't too worth doing unless you think you're going to get a card from one.

[h2] Combat & Enemies [/h2]
Combat is pretty basic from what I've seen. Nothing that stands out. Hit enemy, block their attack, eliminate, done. There's quite a lot of different types of enemies, but they aren't all that hyped up to be anything majorly different. Early bosses and AI are underwhelming.

[h2] Realms / Cards [/h2]
You can create realms, explore and do random POI events. I'm not seeing too many BIG things going to different realms. I'm only 10 hours in so I'm hoping I unlock newer things that spices up realms. 

Cards seem cool. Some cards you can add buffs to realms to make something spawn more, etc. Neat idea.

[h2] Item System [/h2]
I'm not really understanding the item system. When you, for example, kill an animal and the fur has ""Maximum Stamina: +10%"" and to craft an item with it, it doesn't apply the stamina. I did it with fur that had Health and it actually worked, but it was only 3 HP so it wasn't at all worth it. I feel early game you skip literally trying to gear out how you want and just progress. I'm honestly not a fan of the different types of Tier items. The main issue with this system is you cannot combine two different furs to craft an item, when you need that item now -- have to go out and farm more.

[h2] Stats, Food and Sleep [/h2]
The worst thing you're going to run into is Stamina issues right away. Lack of sleep or no appropriate food to keep your max stamina up. Food system is basically Valheim's food system. Eat certain foods they give you HP or Stamina. It becomes a nuisance after awhile having to constantly keep the food buffs going.

[h2] Follower AI [/h2]
There's no way to change the behavior of your recruits or ""followers"". They'll chop trees everywhere for no reason so watch out if your base is surrounded by trees. They'll pick items up but it seems no limit to their encumberment. The only thing they're good for is to be bait when killing enemies or bosses. To be fair, they make it too easy because their AI is so dumb. If they go down it takes one click to revive them with full HP (which to me is very cheaty).

[h2] Vendors [/h2]
There's vendors across the world so you can purchase upgrades from them. The main issue with the merchants is everything is too damn cheap. We're grinding hard in this game and I feel the merchants were added as a weird filler to have in the game.

[h2] Crafting [/h2]
Crafting is there. You don't unlock things fast so you normally look at the same stuff for awhile until you progress. I feel as if they could've handled managing everything better. Like, there's no quick buttons for adding fuel to anything, quick crafting, etc.

The thing I dislike the most is the storage doesn't show resources you can craft. You need the items in your inventory to craft them. This won't make much sense if you aren't at your base, but if I'm at my base at least show items I can craft with that's in storage.

[h2] Armor, Buffs, etc [/h2]
Not fully understanding this system. Infusion, armor enchantments/enhancements seems REALLY pointless in the early game. The stats are minimal from these items. I guess I'll wait til I'm at guns and stuff before writing more about this.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
Overly hyped. It's not a ""too early for Early Access"", it's right at ""if they gave it another year the game would probably be ready"". I /like/ the game, but I feel like I only enjoy it because I want to reach end-game so badly. The grind is ridiculous. Feels like I'm playing Project Zomboid or 7 days to die when it comes to grind, but I feel like I can progress in those games faster.",1708581155,1708664494,True,2,0,0.538057565689086914,0,True,False,True

The game’s captivating story, visually stunning environments, and intriguing premise are its standout features.

The game’s art style is truly unique, offering a refreshing take on the survival genre. The blend of Victorian aesthetics with magical elements creates a visually captivating experience that is both immersive and engaging.

The story of Nightingale is rich and intriguing, offering a depth rarely seen in survival games. The narrative is woven into the game play, providing context and motivation for the player’s actions.

The game play, while complex, offers a rewarding challenge. The crafting mechanics are intricate and require strategic thinking, adding a layer of depth to the survival aspect of the game.

However, like any diamond, Nightingale has its rough edges. The game’s complexity can be overwhelming at times, and the user interface could use some improvements. But these are minor issues in an otherwise stellar game.

Despite the mixed reviews, Nightingale is a game that deserves a chance. It’s a testament to the creativity and innovation of its developers. With a dedicated development team that listens to player feedback, this game has the potential to evolve and improve over time.

In conclusion, Nightingale is a diamond in the rough. It’s a game that dares to be different, and in doing so, offers a unique and memorable gaming experience.

makes going out of the way to kill big monsters or do anything really feel very pointless for a survival game.
Game needs a lot of work in general.
CONS:
- Can only play online.
- Weird FPS drops.
- AI is clunky and dumb like ARK Survival.
- All UI menus are drop down boxes, its super annoying trying to craft or even use a merchant.
- Progression is based on gear-score and traveling to new realms for recipes for gear (it is very boring).
- For some ungodly reason the game has built in voice changers that players can use.
- Characters are stiff , no idle animations , no blinking , perma surprised face , 3rd person looks awful.
- New Realms feel very copy paste.
- No leveling, progression feels boring and not fun.
- Buildings randomly take damage from nothing in random spots.
- A lot of areas will have like one spot of terrain missing and can see under the map lol.
- Food system is awful, I hate that games keep trying to copy of Valhiem's bad food system.
- Always out of stamina.
- Killing random elites in the world and they don't drop anything :) woohoo.
- Some quests/puzzles refuse to complete.
- Killing monsters and animals is boring because they all drop basically same thing.
- Vaulting is insanely slow and clunky.
- Music is a jumpscare, will randomly play the most terrifying sinister music when just relaxing and woodcutting.
- I could prob come up with way more issues.

PROS:
- Realm system could be good.
- You can turn off the music.
- No matter how hard you try to make your character beautiful you will fail, so everyone is equally ugly as f***
- ALT F4'ing after a puzzle refuses to complete kinda works in closing the game :)

The UI and menu system is simply awful.
Controller support is a joke when navigating inventory and especially when in combat and swapping to different tools or weapons on the hotbar. Very poorly implemented controller support.
Nothing feels rewarding. Did several dungeons with a friend and there was practically no reward for beating the final boss.  (You'll experience this on your first ""story boss"")
Enemy variation is pretty poor too. Same few enemy types over and over.
The crafting system is very poorly implemented. It feels like they tried doing the Conan Exiles sort of crafting stations but failed bad.

I am genuinely quite impressed with the quality at launch and have all the faith that the minor stuff and QoL will be sorted out before a 1.0 release. This is easily one of the best and most polished releases of a survival crafting game recently. It needs some balancing to make certain things less of a slog for solo (building requires heavy crafting materials, combat could use some more rigidity), but overall the game feels incredibly refreshing, it's aesthetically gorgeous and cohesive, and you can see the love that the devs filled it with. 

The online-only is whatever for me personally - I would prefer both options (and dedicated servers) but am not disgruntled by this. It also was pretty clear from all prior press information available and you could easily have found this out months ago on the Discord (reminiscent of D4 here, with people showing up having bought it Day One out of FOMO and losing their minds that it does not have something that it was never purported to have had). 

If you are voting it down for that reason, shame on you.

However, I cannot recommend it in its current iteration (early access) when there are similar, better games in the genre that have also recently released. I do realize I've only spent about 7 hrs so far, but here are my comments as a new player to this game, but a deep player of the genre.

One of the core selling points of this game is the procedural generated worlds which are created through the card system. However, oftentimes the points of interest feel too spread apart and you are just spending your time running for an extended period. I think what was meant to feel like endless exploration hit more of the ""everything tastes like bland oatmeal"" kind of procedural generation.

Combat feels good when you hit a critical hit point, but that's really where it ends. Most of the weapons don't really have their own ""special lane"" to add diversity outside of which way it swings from and how fast it swings. Most enemies just run/jump at you, which makes combat feel incredibly tedious.

Building your base is ok, but it's not a robust system that gives you a bunch of freedom in design like Valheim or Enshrouded do (or even Sons of The Forest). Think of it more like The Raft or Grounded build diversity. It does have structural stress like Valheim, so you need to think about how you build vertically, otherwise the game just shows the piece you are trying to place as red without any other indication of why.

The core loop of the game seems to be do quests, get your armor score up, get access to slightly new area, get armor score up again. It doesn't feel like a rewarding loop. 

So, between combat being lackluster, the build system being a bit more shallow, and the procedural generation feel not landing well (at least for me), the game then really only indexes highly on ""a beautiful world I'd like to explore."" I'm gonna keep playing til I get to 15-20 hours, and I'll update my review here if I change my mind on anything above, but I'd also argue that it shouldn't take that amount of time for a person to feel engaged with the core elements of a game.

Then I got presented with an issue logging into the server, had to set Steam itself to run as administrator to get past that and finally got to character creation.

Got through that and and was finally logging into the game server - and it keeps crashing right before logging into the server.

This game should not have been released in its current state. I know it's early access so you should expect bugs and to run into issues but to have bugs that are so bad they can destroy hours of hard work is so depressing and deflating. 

Items will just disappear, they will vanish into thin air especially anything you give your followers. Your followers also will chop down trees that spawn INSIDE your base and I mean inside your actual foundation and building which will destroy everything. Do not let your followers equip axes. The fact that trees are growing through buildings is already awful and if you chop it down it will destroy your building. If you have chests in your base and something happens like a roaming translucent monster walks by and causes trees to start falling down it can break your base and cause your chests to despawn. So you can lose EVERYTHING you have if you dare to put them into chests for safe keeping. This is just ONE of the big issues players are dealing with right now as well.

This is certainly the epitome of early access.  There are a lot of positives and still definitely a lot of negatives.

The biggest negatives first.  The game has just tons of different resources and even different levels of the same resource.  It is an inventory/storage nightmare.  The different levels of resources do not stack together meaning sometimes there are 4 or 5 different stacks of fiber for example.  It desperately needs either an interconnected inventory between boxes or a crafting from boxes if not both.  The devs have said this is being worked on though so hopefully this won't be long.  The combat is still a bit wonky.  The pov/fov is too close to the enemies.  You many times end up basically standing right in the enemy and can no longer even see him much less hit him.  This has been marked as being worked on also. The server issue has been singled out as the biggest complaint so far by many people.  And indeed the time to load between realms is far too long.  Private servers and working on the public servers has been marked as a priority by the devs.  So each one of these negatives is listed as being worked on.

The positive.  If you like crafting this is a players dream.  There are so many things to build and craft and different levels of crafting and different enchantments and charms to put on your equipment.  Huge amount of customization here.  The graphics IMO are superb.  The different realms look really good with more to come.  The whole idea of the different realms are very unique and I really like them (aside from the long load times when traversing).  The card system is an interesting adjunct to the realms.  Points of interest are really fun although at this point in the game some of them are beginning to repeat. Big variety of MOBS and they are both familiar animal types and bizarre imaginations.  

The single biggest positive is that this game is FUN.  Can I say that again. It is FUN!!!

If you can put up with the rough edges then this is a definite thumbs up.

TLDR;  Certainly some EA problems which are being worked on, but the positives outweigh the negatives and the Fun factor is huge.

As for weight management of your inventory, you get encumbered very quickly, almost to quickly at the start of the game. Thankfully you can just steal the backpack from your helper.

Fall damage is a bit of a hit and miss, you can sometime fall farther and go OH CRAP and not be as hurt as you would think, and then the opposite happens and break your ankle in the water from the same height. 

As for weapons, there is basically no weapons to choose from in this game except your basics till later on I hope and even then it's limited it seems. I haven't played far but I have watched a lot of people play the hell out of this already and it seems like your stuck with the basics for a long time. I know for a fact that we should be able to makeshift something of a better knife or even machete of some sort. We get guns but basic weapons are mostly meant for gathering. Not sure how that works for a game but sure, why not.
Your helper is for a lack of better words, an absolute moron. Literally does whatever it wants, even if your not wanting it to, and then it'll do absolutely nothing when you want it to.

How to best describe this game? 

It's a mix of Last of Us, Indiana Jones, Secret Worlds, Fallout and Sons of the Forest all in an Victorian Steampunkish environment.

UE5 Truly takes the Survival Craft to the next level of immersion in this one.

The Realms (worlds you visit) feel alive, the first minute you're contemplating the panorama and 5 min later you're looking behind you after hearing cracks coming from deep down the forest. Next thing you know, some demonic ghouls appear out of nowhere and it's time to take your knife and fight for your life :D

The crafting/building really goes in depth, there are a lot of passives (buffs and debuffs) available.

The fighting feels super satisfying, can't really explain why, it just does.

First off - its early access. DEAL. WITH. IT. Fed up with bad reviews citing bugs and wonky things that should be expected when you buy an early access title. I hit a bug that prevented me from leaving the tutorial. Rather than flame the reviews and refund, I checked the bug reports, saw more than a few players had the same issue, added the details of what I experienced and re-rolled my character. 2nd time though I exited the tutorial with no issue. 

The game world is gorgeous. Characters are a little frumpy, but spend a little time in the character creator and you can dial it in (the Lineage piece is not at all what I expected, but a very fun way to tweak a character's looks.)

I see a lot of complaints about crafting. I assume these are from people who want everything to be crafted instantly and in cookie-cutter fashion. Personally, I like the deeper mechanics where the type and quality of material affect the final product. It's not quite Star Wars Galaxies level crafting, but its way more detailed than other open-world survival craft games. Yes, I specifically crafted my first set of clothing from predator hides only.

The enemy and follower AI needs work, to be sure, but that's feedback the devs need and the purpose of early access. 

The building system is simply awesome. I love that i can place hollow structure blueprints without spending resources to get a feel for what I'm building. Even better, when i start adding resources to my ghost hut, they are added to the structure as a whole, not just the piece i am targeting. Thank you SO MUCH for that, Inflexion!

The only thing I don;t like is that I can't host a dedicated server. As an owner of a small gaming community where I mostly host other open-world survival games, this makes me sad. I'm sure it deals with the resources needed to actually run a server where any number of proceduraly generated maps could be active. Remember trying to run an Atlas server (megacluster)? Yeah, there will be connection issues until the kinks are worked out- not a reason to review bomb an early access title. 

Give it an honest go. If you don't like it, refund and pipe down, or wait for some updates before you post a negative review.",1708648651,1708648982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Your reviews DO affect if people get a game, and if you tank the player base, the devs aren't going to keep working on it, cause why would they if no one is gonna buy it?

I like it so far, I played a bit of Enshrouded and honestly felt that Nightingale had more lore, more content, and the building/menus feel less clunky. I saw someone say the opening bit was a bit boring. I don't think so honestly, its a tutorial, but you can explore each map you're brought into. Once I was done, I literally had to drop stuff because I had too much to carry! I DO think that players should be given an option to not play the tutorial bit if they've already been through it. 

I like that there's a companion you can get, helps make material collecting a little less grindy (if you're not playing with friends ofc). And the building is good I think, you can plan out your whole base before you build and I think that is really helpful. There's nothing worse than building something, realising it doesn't work and then waste time having to destroy it and recollect materials 

Edited: I saw a post by the dev team that they are working on an offline mode, this part of my review is no longer relevant 

In all, I think it's worth getting, if you aren't prepared to deal with less content/optimisation issues/bugs, then wait for a full release.

I was very on the fence as far as whether I wanted to recommend this game or not. It has so many great aspects to it, and in a lot of ways it's what I've been waiting for as far as survival/crafting games go. On the other hand it has some flaws that frustrate me deeply. I'll start with the good bits.
The realm cards are a very interesting system for keeping the world evolving and interesting. The way that they interact to generate each new area is a lot of fun to mess around with and definitely feels like a core mechanic rather than a gimic. Crafting is cool, allowing you to use higher quality materials with the same recipe to yield better results, and having to craft components in order to craft more advanced items like firearms helps make it feel more involved. Finally: I love that there is some semblance of a story. Even though it is very lacking in its current state, I enjoy that they took time to explain what's actually going on and to give a little bit a backing to the world around you.
Now for the flaws. The major one is supposedly only temporary, and I'm only reviewing positive because this morning they announced that they were prioritising a fix: this game is currently online only, and boy does its servers SUCK. Playing solo I have plenty of moments where I ping back and forth around the map because my connection to the server gets rough, and my internet runs at a stable 400+ mbps most of the time. They are apparently taking the feedback to heart and making an offline mode for the game, so that's exciting (both that it's happening and that they actually listened), but it probably will take awhile so if this is an issue for you, wait to buy until that's figured out.
Moving on: graphics optimisation sucks. I don't know if it's that DX12 is unstable currently or just the way they built the game, but my 3060 has random moments where it just can't render textures fast enough to keep up with the game. I know it's early access, and hopefully that gets better with time, but usually graphics requirements go up over EA periods, so I'm not hopeful.
Finally: combat needs some serious work. There are plenty of enemies that just feel very boring and lazy in construction (looking at you Automaton Knight), and take a lot away from the experience. They're also actively working on fixes for overly aggressive fauna and random spawning that can swarm you with enemies. Later in the game it isn't much of an issue, but for the first 10 or so hours while you're trying to harvest and craft with borderline 0 stamina, it gets pretty annoying to keep getting harassed by enemies.
This is getting pretty long so I'll just sum it up with: good game, hopefully will get better and fix the big flaws, devs are listening to feedback for once.",1708647029,1708647029,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

They added too much to crafting. Most of my time is finding how to craft something in one table to take it to another to make something else to make something else that is only a part of one other thing. with the limited weight and the sheer amount of things you need to craft to get to the bottom of some recipes they should absolutely add some way for the crafting benches to use mats from your storage. I had probably 10 different crafting stations and 20 different augment stations before i quit. you want 5 rope? you need 50 string, oh you need 50 string? you need 100 fiber. everything ramps up that way and takes more and more and more and some recipes requiring you to run around your base like a mad man looking for the first thing to craft the second thing to craft the third thing. you want a gun? congrats you need 4 things that require 4 things that require 10 things that require 15 things. the ladder of crafting is not fun.

I'd like to address this briefly because the developer has already responded to this concern. They've announced their commitment to delivering an offline option as quickly as possible. You can read their statement here: https://playnightingale.com/news/offline-play .This proactive response within just two days of early access demonstrates their receptiveness to feedback and their dedication to resolving issues promptly.

Now, onto my review, which will also include a couple of suggestions. I'm thoroughly enjoying the game and eagerly anticipate the improvements that will come during early access!

Tutorial: The tutorial is decent, although not exceptional. While it succeeds in teaching the basics, it could benefit from tweaks to enhance the overall experience. For instance, having Puck move with you while explaining concepts would be more engaging. His interesting dialogue could be better utilized if he led players to relevant locations rather than delivering information in one spot. Additionally, implementing a system where quest objectives are automatically checked off upon completion would streamline gameplay.

Combat: I haven't played enough to form a definitive opinion, but the combat seems promising based on the limited encounters I've had.

Umbrella Mechanics: The concept of how the umbrellas work is intriguing. Despite initial skepticism about the ""Mary Poppins"" aspect, using the umbrellas proved to be enjoyable and added depth to gameplay. The idea of them assisting players in various weather conditions and then floating around adds an innovative mechanic to the game.

Server and Graphical Performance: I've experienced no server or graphical issues, which is a relief in 2024, considering many new games have been plagued by such problems, often due to unexpectedly high player counts.

Character Creator: Personally, I'm not deeply invested in creating characters. Typically, I'll lightly craft a character resembling myself, then dive into the game. However, I must say there's certainly room for improvement with the current character creator. I'm honestly not the person to give advice when it comes to character but id probably start with the lineage part being described better so i understand that i will be using my parents likeness to craft my characters.

Price: At $35 for an early access game, it's honestly pretty standard these days. However, considering the potential of this game and my confidence in the studio to see it through, I personally consider it a steal of a deal.

Building: I'm absolutely loving the crafting and building mechanics! Planning out the floor plan before construction and the smooth snapping of pieces are fantastic features. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to construct even larger structures soon!

In summary, I genuinely enjoy the game and plan to continue playing it extensively. It's a great early access title, and I believe the developers are moving in the right direction, especially demonstrated by their responsiveness to offline mode.",1708537214,1708644673,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

After doing some online digging i found that there are many other people having the same problems as i am, unfortunately there is no true fix to this issue as it is something that the developers need to fix on their end. Pretty sure it is a optimization issue/memory leaks. This really sucks because honestly for what i have played i have really enjoyed it and i do think this is a fun game but again as of right now with these performance issues i just can not recommend it tell it gets fixed. Small Update: today i decided to have a ping counter along with a fps counter on at the same time while playing, i noticed when ever i start to lose fps my ping always sky rockets, This has made me start to think that the frame loss is mostly related to the server's ping meaning if the ping goes up then i lose frames. Good news though, the devs have said they are working on a offline mode so hopefully this will fix these server side ping/frame loss issues. Again i want to say that the game itself is not bad at all and i do really enjoy it but due to the performance issues that occur from time to time i still can not recommend it to people as of yet.

I'd like to start off by saying I have really enjoyed the game so far and do intend to keep playing but I can see this game not being for everyone. I'm also going to leave out any mention of there being no offline mode because the devs did say that during early access launch it will be online only but they do plan on adding offline mode later so it's kind of a moot point to mention. I'd also like to add that the devs have been amazingly receptive to player feedback and quick to start on changes as well as keep players in the loop on what's going on which is something I appreciate and an added benefit.

The good: The crafting and gathering mechanics aren't incredibly tedious and don't feel like a slog fest, you don't have to spend 7 hours grinding just to make a couple things. The recruits are really useful to have with you for combat and to carry your things if you're weighed down. Enemies are interesting looking and have unique qualities such as animations, combat mechanics and weaknesses. Players are encouraged to explore and go outside their comfort zones with items, creature types and unique environments locked behind different realm card types that increase difficulty. Having NPC's around the maps makes the environment feel more alive and immersive. Stats drain slow and increase quickly so you can actually do a fair bit of exploring without having to spend hours preparing to keep your hunger meter full. Fairly in depth character creation especially for a survival game. The dungeons are cool looking and interesting enough to enjoy exploring them. 

The bad: NPC's can't be set to gather or craft anything on their own and don't really do a good job of gathering materials with the player. The player character animation definitely needs work especially compared to everything else in the game that is so well animated. The tutorial is kind of a slog fest, I personally just rushed through it. The writing/dialogue, while fairly decent, seems pretentious and drawn out with some of the wording used. I've never felt stupid reading anything before this game. Puck exists. The button to organise your storage seems to just randomise it rather than organise it. The same pop ups everytime you load into the game over and over with no way to turn them off. No reward after completing a site of power beyond unlocking a card for a higher realm difficulty. Game needs a dodge mechanic badly. No crafting from storage but this one is kind of whatever and the devs are adding this in a future update.

What I would change/add: Either rework the tutorial to be more interesting by adding side quests and points of interest like you'd find in any realm that reward you with starting gear or shorten it to a brief summary of what you'll need to know to start. Add a skip option for the tutorial for those that prefer to learn on their own. Add different varieties of enemies/bosses to the different sites of power, increase the size of the boss areas, require players to drop down into the boss area or teleport in so you're forced to engage (way to easy to just hold up where they can't get you and shoot them. Introduce a dodge mechanic regardless of what item you're holding. Send your recruit to your estate cairn even when in another realm rather than dismiss and having them despawn forever leaving behind all their things. Add tasks that could be assigned to your recruit such as gathering, building or crafting that they can do separate from you. Add some fae NPC's so there's more than just Puck and some realm walkers. Have NPC's move around the map that can give you fetch quests to earn some essence. Allow players to build NPC housing at their respite point that allows you to recruit more NPC's and send them there and have them walk around maybe with random dialogue. Add additional requirements for the sites of power such as higher level building materials and maybe a trophy or something from an apex creature to slow down pacing and encourage exploration/gathering.",1708644074,1708644357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The world and concept is nice, it looks good and has a unique vibe to it. But sadly there is a lot that takes away from the enjoyment for me. I would wait for more updates to arrive and hopefully they iron out the experience.

I didnt bother much with smaller bugs i encountered, or lags at peak times. Its early access and for that it was okay for me. Bigger issues i had:

The Inventory and crafting systems are pretty clunky, and a lot of basic features that has been proven in other survival games are missing. And it gets even more tedious with diffrent tiers of the same material and lots of stuff to refine in the game.
 
Biggest problem to me is the combat, i rather had no combat at all than the combat it has right now.  Encounter design feels pretty bad. Enemys have 1-2 attacks, that they aimlessly repeat, horrible pathfinding and get stuck many times, Hitboxes seems off and makes the feel of weapons not great. This takes away the satisfaction of upgrading your gear, as you will get back to the same tiring combat loop.  Its a shame because some enemys look pretty cool.

With my 76 hours into the game and running, it was very much worth the 26.09 euro price tag. 

However, since its an early acces, there are some downsides that I will list below:
- always online (I personally don't care for this)
- beginning is very linear and slow due to gearscore requirement up to rank 50
- game needs optimisation, even on the lowest settings it is demanding in the hardware department.
- game does not tell you when you need to upgrade benches, I was stuck for an hour trying to make the herbalism realm card only to discover I could not make this on my basic enchanter, but needed a refined one, wich I had missed unlocking and still had to realm hop for to find the vendor.",1708643336,1708643336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Crafting is expansive and fairly intuitive.

My main gripe is the combat. It's clunky and inconsistent. 
Sometimes stabbing from behind does more damage, sometimes it does none at all (even though it does the animation for stabbing from behind). 
Occasionally you have to aim low because the goblin critters are crouching, which would be fine, except it makes it so you can't see anything going on around you. 
I don't know if I am not far enough, but I cannot attack and defend effectively in any fight, it's either or, because the stamina pool is so small.
There is a strange lag to combat I cannot put my finger on.

Next gripe is the building/crafting. Again, I don't know if something unlocks later. But you cannot build a second story wall, without one underneath it. This means no overhanging pieces. I'm not sure I am making sense, but this restricts you to cubes, and nothing else (without a lot of workarounds) I was able to place blueprints, then remove some to 'trick' the builder at a couple of points, but I don't want to have to outsmart a builder to not have to build a cube.
Crafting is wildly unintuitive. There were four types of plant fiber for gods sake, and I still have no idea why, all I know is the inventory management is a nightmare when I have bones from four different creatures (which near as I could tell made no real difference in their use)
I found something that said it could augment my armor, right clicked it, and the 'apply' button was grayed out, saying I had no armor to apply it to, which I did, so if it had further requirements, it didn't specify that at all. The way I see it in a crafting game, you either explain everything, or you make it feel natural to figure out. I feel like I need a technical manual, and they gave me an IKEA pamphlet, with vague, not quite accurate directions.
They made it so things craft themselves (which is nice) but those that require fuel, like the campfire, or the forge, continue to burn the fuel even after they are done. So you have to babysit it either way. Now I know what your thinking, just put enough fuel in, so that it doesn't burn too much, that would be a great idea, accept these dopes didn't put any way to split stacks up...in a craft/survival...there's no way to split stacks, it's like they've never played one before.

One of the first actual tasks you get is to get a high enough gear score to enter a...I don't want to call it a dungeon, because that would be misleading, it was two awkward fights, then a clunky boss. Other than that, the thing is empty. No chests, no loot to speak of. Then once you are at the bottom...you gotta hoof it back out the way you came. Which is extra awkward because the 'climbing' mechanic is an absolute mystery to me, couldn't figure out what activated it or not.

But the positives are outweighing it by far for me. I love the realm and card system and think it's incredibly unique for a survival game. The building system is fun so far, although I'm not far into it. I'm enjoying the way you unlock blueprints through exploration rather than leveling like Ark. The worlds are very visually beautiful.

((Update: If you liked no man sky at launch this game is for you, if you didnt then I recommend avoiding.

After playing awhile the game is just such a chore. The progression feels so messy and awkward worse than destiny old progression. Farm essences get gear score up do a dungeon repeat with maybe 1 or 2 new enemies every dungeon, It takes so much time to do anything even remotely basic. 

The realm system is basically teleport to a biome farm x y z then teleport home with each teleport taking a few mins to load (even when you dont d/c). You dont even get access to metal tools or guns till you get to get to Provisioner card and until then you are just using basic tools you made at the start but upgraded state wise. 

The combat can be kind of fun but it gets old quick you just spam left mouse button (no heavy attacks or anything to mix it up at all) and aim for the head or shoot them in the head (or heart) but you wont get anything but a crappy slingbow till Provisioner.

 The building system is not really anything crazy and doesn't really let you do anything unique, You cant even rotate freely. There are tons of little ""augments"" you have to build for certain recipes but you dont get access to the benefits of them till you get a Provisioner card.  You cant set any of the cool looking places to be your home base as your limited to the starter realms.

TLDR: I have no clue what happened to the original vision of the game but this isn't anything like the trailers made it seem it would be. All in all the game is alluring at first but quickly becomes a chore doesn't open up till you unlock the Provisioner card and then it just becomes more of a grind. The pacing needs fixed and certain mechanics need to be re-thought out (why gearscore based??). Hope the game can turn around.))

((2nd update: it gets even more tedious after finally getting metal tools it takes such a long time to make or do anything. Smelting 30 ignots take 20 irl minutes, You will be using these up rather quickly and the furnace and the smithing station are a single shared bench.  All the recipes get more convoluted and complicated for no reason (you would think you go from logs to timber for this tier but instead you go logs to timber to carved wood as an example). The augment / recipe system is just nonsense. You have to not only find and buy the recipe but also find a augment with that recipe in order to unlock said recipe.))",1708499218,1708642742,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't in good conscience recommend this in the early access state that it's in now. I genuinely would have preferred them to do a full release as opposed to releasing it in this manner. There's just a lot of unnatural quality of life issues that go beyond the standard ""bugs and glitches,"" and kinks that need to be worked out. 

First, Navigating the inventory is excruciating, No hotkeys make crafting, storing, and organizing tedious.
(Also everything auto sorts which isn't a deal breaker, but I like to organize my inventory and the auto sorting is nasty to be  quite honest. Why aren't the potions together, why aren't the upgrades together, why aren't the equips together? It's nasty).

Hitboxes are also so wonky. I've never in my life had issues with hitboxes as much as I have with this game. I'll be crouched, face to face with a sleeping deer with it's head stationary, aim my bow directly at it's head, and the bullet will glide right through. No contact. This is an issue mainly because you HAVE to crit a deer or you won't be able to kill it before it runs away.
I could overlook this as they're minor creatures that you encounter early on in the game, but it's every. single. mob. Creatures that run and sidestep especially, I shoot and SEE my bullet go directly through them. 
It would be a different story if the hitboxes were just scary accurate and it slipped between their arm, but it's sadly just not the case.
Bow and arrows are such a staple for me in games that any game that implements it, I'll almost always love it, (Dragon's Dogma, Elsword, Path of Exile, Warframe, Palworld) but I absolutely dread using the bow in this game. It's horrible, which again, is saying a LOT.

There's also nothing to keep up my interest in the process of travelling, and half the time I don't even want an encounter because I just want to get where I'm going already. I've never had to backtrack in a game like I have in this one before, mainly because quests that SHOULD have a quest marker do not have one. No hints, tips, or guides to point you in the direction, the quest description is just ""Go to the Site of ---"" Okay, but where is it...
On top of that, you can only have ONE spawn anchor and you can only teleport to that ONE spawn anchor. And it's unreliable. I've used the ""Return to Anchor"" button in a desert realm to go to my home in the forest realm, but since this games loading screen is roughly 3 minutes, an enemy ended up spawning in, making it's way to the corner I was hiding in (Just in case something like that happened!) killing me, teleporting me BACK to my home in the forest, forcing me to run back to the desert realm and never trusting the Return Home button again. 
The sad part is I could hear my character dying and his heart beating faster, but I was helpless to do anything because the loading screen doesn't invulnerable your character which seems like a huge oversight where most creatures will attack you in this game. 

This may be my biggest turn off on a game. Walking upstairs consumes stamina, walking up a slightly steep cliff consumes stamina, swimming consumes stamina, running consumes stamina, dodging, basic attacks, gliding with an umbrella, EVERYTHING costs stamina. Some people enjoy it, but this is my personal pet peeve. If your game is genuinely all about TRAVERSING, why are you making the stamina system so punishing where I have to essentially choose to WALK on flatland every single step of the way?
I don't mind stamina systems when they're done well (Legend of Zelda being most people's favorite), but when basic attacks take 10 of your stamina bar every swing and I only have 50 to begin with, combat becomes a repetition of swing when I finally have stamina, turn around and walk 5 feet, swing when I finally have stamina, turn around and walk 5 feet. It's honest to god the worst part of this game. Granted, food/water will increase your stamina bar, but even with 3 food types stacked, it's not enough for the 7 enemies I'm facing off against without inevitably going back to the same ""tactic""

Lastly, and this is something that I will NEVER understand. Why are the bosses just DAMAGE SPONGES? This is the worst thing that has ever came out of survival crafting games. A 5-10 minute fight with the highest gear I can get at the time of me circling a pillar, swinging my knife/shooting my bow, and dodging the 1 out of 3 attacks that the boss has. After about 3 minutes of the same movements, hitting every crit possible, it literally becomes ""okay I get it, let's wrap this up"" I cannot STAND a damage sponge boss, it makes for horrible boss designs in my opinion, and makes me dread having to think about any ""boss content.""

There are so many things about this game that I love, but the things that I hate about this game I hate with a passion to the point where it ruins my drive to keep playing. I wish I would have waited until the full release, I want to love this game so bad, but the fine details that make a game memorable aren't even close to being there.",1708642715,1708642715,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Fast forward to the Early Access release and the realms cards are just fine, I was really expecting some major differences between the different realms but they are all really samey: Go to the fae tower and then proceed to clear the mini events around the world to get essence of that tier, buy stuff from the realm vendor. Rinse and repeat.

The problem is that these events in the realm are all the same and with the same enemies, just in a different level, the mobs that change between the realms are the animals (preys and predators). The buildings are also all really similar (although I haven't checked the late game major cards so this could be wrong to an extent).

So with the main selling point of the game for me not being what I was expecting what we have left? A very basic and lacking survival experience which has way too much item bloat for a game with a very bad inventory management. Items stacks independently from their source so you end up with 3 different meats from the same tier just because one of them is from a prey and another from a predator. In a game with no auto fill chest option and no craft from the chests yet implemented this creates a very exhausting process of gathering and crafting

I dropped the game right after unlocking the last major card, in a Quest that requires me to gather arround 6 different items in different quantities and I was simply tired of dealing with items at this point. Really was looking forward to the social space and what it had to offer but I can't get myself to play the game in the current state.

I would recommend avoiding the game for a while, wait for some QoL patches and then give it a shot.

My only gripe with this game so far is that the textures on clothing are a little strange and the character face models often look very.... alien, be it from shape or from lighting, they look odd. Aside from that, it has a lot of potential unlike the size of my character's storage weight limit.

I think the ""Always Online"" aspect was a technological decision most likely as well as a metrics gathering decision.

In any case - the gameplay feels a lot like ""The Forest"" and ""Sons of the Forest"". It looks and feels very similar - for example early combat and the behaviour of humanoid enemies early on in the game, the look and feel of the game engine...if you've played either Forest games you'll likely know what I mean. 

The actual concept of Nightingale is also actually really interesting....survival in randomised worlds as you travel from one area to the next. I definitely think this game continues to have potential. 

I also think launching it in early access was a good choice, it definitely doesn't come without problems and because it's early access, I'm alright with its current issues. 

The UI and feel of the game reminds me a lot of some of the quirkiness of the recent Cyan Worlds games.
It delivers something different and manually clicking through dialogue brings back some old point-and-click memories. 
In that regard - it feels a bit experimental and a willingness to provide something different at the risk of perhaps not satisfying everyone. 

I definitely think (and hope) this game has the potential to get better and better with time.

So if you decide to pick this up at this stage I would keep these things in mind:

- It feels experimental, trying to provide something new that may have the potential to feel strange at first.
- It definitely needs work but it's also early access. 

But I think they definitely have the right idea - I like the concept of it and even if it may need to bake for a bit, I'm glad I picked it up.",1708640438,1708641165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not to mention, gorgeous music. If you like exploring the world, building, farming materials, grinding for gear, surviving, etc., as is the case in all survival games, this game is a good addition to your repertoire. Basically, If you like survival games, you'll probably like 'MOST' of Nightingale. Unfortunately, the game is very very early access. It might be a good idea to wait a few months for this one. Some of the issues are too much to bear. 

Cons:

- The beginning/tutorial of the game is unbelievably dull. Not to mention, it is too long and un-rewarding for what it is.

- The HUD, menu system, crafting system, and storage system need serious QoL improvements.
The crafting menu system is so bad in Nightingale that they have included an 'auto-fill' button for crafting. You don't simply move items from your inventory into a crafting table or just click a button to craft and it uses the items that you have. No, you have to first click 'autofill' for some weird reason. You can't even see your inventory while in a crafting station. Really strange design choice.
As of right now, you also have to reach across your keyboard for 'esc' to close out of everything or swipe to the top of your screen to find the 'close' button in the top right. It gets very annoying after opening a few things in your base.
There's also no straightforward ctrl-clicking or shift-clicking options to stack/split/take-half/take-one of the items. It is only if you are opening something that you can use the janky shift-clicking system (it's still really bad). As someone who has played a lot of survival games, this is a MUST FIX. This game is going to give people carpal tunnel. 

- Items would benefit from colour-coding based on tier-level. 
Right now, items are a field of beige and grey's which is not great to look at or easy to distinguish between. If you have the same item of multiple tiers, there's no easy way to see what tier it is without hovering over it and reading what tier it is. 

- All materials in the chests in your general vicinity should be accounted for when crafting.
This isn't a problem in many survival games, but because the menu system is so bad and there are so many materials and different tiers of the same materials that all do different things in Nightingale, there is no reason why crafting tables should not be able to pull stuff from chests that are close to you. Enshrouded did this very well with their 'magic chests"" and Nightingale desperately needs something like that. 

- The building system overall is meh. Doesn't feel good. 
It is crazy how small the early weight capacity is (even with an early backpack) which makes building very annoying early on. You need multiple materials for every build, except you can't hold that many without being encumbered. Therefore, it results in a constant running back-and-forth from storage containers and using their very bad menu system to grab a couple items to run back and place something, running back again, grabbing a few more things, using the bad menu system, running back, placing an item, etc.

- This game can feel empty and the creatures do not always feel like they belong in the world. 
There are cool POI's in the world, but many of the creatures and NPC's feel 'copy-pasted' with their sole purpose being for you to run into and kill. Very few of the animals and creatures look natural or like they belong in the environment. Many of them stand in place staring out into a void until you get close enough where they finally 'activate.' They do not feel real. I wish there were more animations for the creatures which showed them just hanging out, playing, eating, doing things with each other, etc. The behaviours and animations are seriously lacking and at least for me, it disconnects me from the otherwise beautiful and cool looking game. 
Also, You will often run into a creature where 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, etc. Again, this makes the world feel fake and eerily empty. 

- There should be more variety in the types of POI's (it is early access though, so I'm hoping for more). 

- Combat is lacking mechanics. Very boring. 
Every creature I have come across or seen in videos so far attacks in a straight line and you can just back up in a circle and go around them over and over waiting for your stamina to come back. The combat devolves into holding 'A' or 'D' or 'S' and waiting for your stamina bar to replenish. 

- The whole gear-level requirement to get into dungeons is dumb. 
Players should not be met with a gear-level number requirement that basically says ""get better gear"" in order to enter dungeons. This isn't an MMO. At least not in the beginning. 
As I understand it, this game will have a dungeon-like or raid-like end-game mechanic so maybe in late-game when you've already done everything it is okay. But when you're just out exploring and feeling a little immersed only to be hit with numbers that don't allow you to go into places because you have cloth instead of leather pants.....it's just dumb and immersion breaking. Players should have to figure out for themselves that they do not have the required gear or stats to beat something and be punished for going out into the world when they are not ready. Conversely, they should be rewarded if they do beat it when they are not prepared. Some of the best moments from survival games comes from venturing out where you don't belong and being absolutely annihilated by a creature you didn't even know existed. It also works as a tease and motivates you to want to get back there.
Overall, the immersion-breaking progression gate-keeping is weird and uncalled for. TAKE IT OUT. 

- I've heard that progression is very slow and grindy.
In my opinion, this would be okay if the world itself felt more lived-in, immersive, and enjoyable to be in. Valheim, for instance, is a very grindy/slow progression later on. However, it is very dense and despite the graphics/art-style, the world feels natural/lived-in so people love simply 'existing' in that world. If Nightingale could add more animations, polish up the creatures, make combat more enjoyable, make building more enjoyable, get rid of so many number indicators of level requirements (strange immersion-breaking progression gate-keeping) and convince the player that the Nightingale world is real overall, progression taking a long time shouldn't be an issue. The problem right now is the world can feel empty, unnatural, and janky, and so you just want to progress quickly rather than exist in the world for it's intrinsic value. Unfortunately, if it takes forever to progress and you don't want to be in the world because it doesn't feel real, there is an obvious problem with wanting to keep playing. 
Still, if the progression is TOO grindy as I have heard people saying, that is simply never good. Regardless of how real the world feels. People have lives. 


Conclusion:

I have been waiting for Nightingale for almost two years now and unfortunately, I am disappointed. The world is so beautiful and it has so many opportunities for improvement, but as of right now, it feels dead, empty, soul-less, and unnatural. The setting/atmosphere/skybox/environments/music are gorgeous and unbelievably refreshing for someone who has over 4000 hours in survival games. However, nothing feels real. The HUD and crafting system is going to give you carpal tunnel, The combat is boring, the game is grindy, the creatures are cardboard cutouts, etc. With some serious work this game could be great. But as of right now, it is a struggle to even enjoy.",1708640851,1708640851,False,381,4,0.78928297758102417,0,True,False,True

From the moment you step into its beautifully crafted environments, you're greeted with stunning visuals and atmospheric music that immerse you in a captivating fantasy realm. However, beneath its picturesque surface lies a game still in its infancy, grappling with numerous shortcomings that prevent it from reaching its full potential.

One of the most glaring issues with Nightingale is its early stage of development, evident in the myriad of missing quality of life features. Players will find themselves yearning for basic conveniences that are standard in most modern games. The absence of these features disrupts the flow of gameplay and detracts from the overall experience.

Combat in Nightingale feels clunky and unrefined, lacking the fluidity and responsiveness expected in action-oriented games. Engaging in battles often feels like a chore rather than an exhilarating experience, dampening the excitement of exploration and progression.

The building mode, touted as a cornerstone of the gameplay experience, falls disappointingly short of expectations. Its simplicity limits creativity and fails to offer the depth and complexity necessary to engage players for extended periods.

Character animations are another area where Nightingale falters. Characters move stiffly and lack the lifelike fluidity that breathes personality and charm into their actions. Instead, they stand static, devoid of the soul and expression that would otherwise bring them to life.

Adding insult to injury, Nightingale lacks essential features such as an offline mode and servers in all regions. Players from South America are forced to connect to North American servers, resulting in frustratingly high ping and subpar gameplay experiences.

Despite its myriad flaws, Nightingale shows promise. There's ample room for improvement, and with dedicated effort from the development team, it has the potential to evolve into a truly exceptional game. As it stands, however, Nightingale falls short of its lofty ambitions, leaving players longing for the polish and refinement needed to fulfill its promise. If you're willing to overlook its current shortcomings and hopeful for future updates, Nightingale may yet prove to be a diamond in the rough.

Sometimes the enemy will be right in front of you but you cant hit them because .... whatever. The first boss fight was so terrible, enemy ai is completely out of touch. It really needs a complete rework. Another thing about crafting, and i dont know if i missed something or may be the game doesn't explain it very well. I have 5 prey hides, I go to make leather but can only make 1 and the rest is only good for straps. Does the same for pred hides too.

This game I will have to say its fun both playing alone and with friends. The game is designed to explore and have a small base of operations. If you think you need a massive base and hate the limit cap of the building size 300 parts then go play something like ARK. This game is intended to explore, craft your gear, go out and explore more. There are quests to complete, bosses to kill, RNG biomes that generate each time you drop cards into the portal. 

Its drop in/Drop out Co op. Plus if you log out and your friends want to keep playing and progressing it wont kick them out. Think of it this way. Its a Private server you DONT have to pay for. People fail to understand this apparently. I get playing solo having to hook up online sucks but if you think about it. This allows to also set a portal you RNG to PUBLIC and meet up possibly with other players in the game to MAKE possible new friends to have more fun.

So many people say this game is ""Bad"" to be honest I don't see why. Most people say they dislike steampunk theme but I find it enjouable. A game doesn't need to  be flash or have crisp visuals to be fun and enjoyable. Plus it does not need to be massively innovative or stand out from other games for it to be ""Good"" Yes there are other games out there that may or can be better. Overall this game I have enjoyed. Only a few gripes but that is every game.

Everyone has their own opinion. ""Opinions are like arseholes everyone has them and they all stink""

Supports 6 player co op and it runs well (At least for me). Most people that say it runs like junk are probably people with ancient PCs that didn't follow the recommended specs. (MINIMUM is meant to run the game and play it on lowest settings you dolts)

For those who care these are my specs and the game runs just fine with a few performance tweaks:

First thing you have to be connect to one of their servers to play even solo which may sound tolerable but just now I found it to be game breaking as apparently they must be having server issues or something went broke as I was playing then all the sudden kicked out of the game. I'm just playing a solo adventure at the time to see if it's a worth purchase for others who seem interested in maybe buying it to play with me, but if I cannot setup my own server or play without a connection to someone else's server you are at their mercy that their stuff is working! Honestly I don't see where having to connect to their server as being a feature so please drop this ""feature"".

Another thing I found very annoying was the first character that you run into that is your sort of guide, he is so annoying I had to quickly run thru his talking to avoid punching my screen. Maybe I sound like I have anger problems but he came off as some sort of theater clown in yoga pants who thinks they are witty and I guess I felt an animalistic instinct in me to want to fight him, maybe this game gets better where I can fight him then never hear him again? I could use a plot twist like that but I never bothered to hear his story.

Again this seems to early to hate this game but I cannot play because they seem to be having server problems and that I find to be a major problem. You may go what are you saying to me as you don't realize you are connecting to server out of a list of options but this must be the case as I cannot currently play. One thing holding me back from a refund is the game is at least affordable and seems to have something to make me want to try exploring more, just I can't at the current time!

tl;dr: A purchase recommendation from me - you need to know - Von mir eine Kaufempfehlung - müsst ihr wissen

Spent 6 hours in the game today. 
What can I say - we like it.
I can understand that those who want to play completely alone prefer an offline mode. For us who play in co-op, the solution Inflexion has chosen is excellent. We don't need a paid dedicated server, but we also don't have to host it ourselves, so everyone can play whenever they want. We find that very convenient. 

Now to the content: The atmosphere that is created is very appealing. My initial worries about the graphics have been dispelled. Overall, the graphics are harmonious and, thanks to the ambience created, surprise us again and again. 

The menu may take some getting used to at first, but you can quickly familiarise yourself with it and find your way around. 
The enemy AI could beworked on a little. They often stand around in the area, look in the wrong direction or are in a kind of stasis. But I think this will be improved. 

I think the crafting is great. I like it when the path from the early game through the midgame to the endgame is a longer process. I don't want to get to the endgame after a few hours and then wonder where the content is. Especially not in an EA game. 
All in all, I have to praise the game. Also with regard to the behaviour of the devs: releasing 2 days early to have enough time before the weekend to solve the first problems. Then they work directly on an offline solution because they have heard the community's desire for it. In general, those who are disappointed here should try the Discord, the devs are really active there and respond to us players. 

Crying directly because this or that doesn't work is childish behaviour anyway. It would be better to engage in open discourse, but ranting just costs less effort. 

A purchase recommendation from me - you need to know

Haben heute 6 Stunden in dem Spiel verbracht. 
Was soll ich sagen - uns gefällt es.
Ich kann verstehen, dass diejenigen, die gänzlich alleine spielen wollen, einen offline-Modus bevorzugen. Für uns, die im Coop spielen, ist die Lösung, die Inflexion gewählt hat hervorragend. Wie benötigen keinen kostenpflichtigen dedicated Server, müssen aber auch nicht selber hosten, so dass jeder spielen kann, wann er will. Das empfinden wir als sehr komfortabel. 

Nun zum Inhalt: Die Stimmung, die erzeugt wird, ist sehr ansprechend. Meine anfänglichen Sorgen bzgl der Grafik haben sich zerstreut. Die Grafik ist insgesamt stimmig und überrascht, gerade durch das geschaffene Ambiente, immer wieder neu. 

Das Menü mag im ersten Moment gewöhnungsbedürftig, jedoch kann man sich schnell damit anfreunden und findet sich zurecht. 
Die Gegner-KI ist verbesserungswürdig. Oft stehen diese lost in der Gegend herum, schauen in die falsche Richtung oder sind in einer Art Stasis. Das wird man aber in den Griff bekommen, denke ich. 

Das Crafting finde ich super. Ich mag es, wenn der Weg vom Early Game über das Midgame ins Endgame ein längerer Prozess ist. Ich will nicht nach ein paar Stunden Endgame ankommen und mich dann fragen, wo hier der Inhalt ist. Schon gar nicht in einem EA-Game.

Insgesamt muss ich das Spiel absolut loben. Auch im Bezug auf das Verhalten der Devs: 2 Tage früher releasen, um genug Zeit vor dem Wochenende zu haben, erste Probleme zu lösen. Dann arbeiten sie direkt an einer Offline-Lösung, weil sie in der Community den Wunsch danach gehört haben. Generell sollten sich die Enttäuischten hier mal in den Discord bemühen, die Devs sind dort wirklich aktiv und gehen auf uns Spieler ein. 

Direkt losheulen, weil Dieses oder Jenes nicht passt, ist sowieso ein kindisches Verhalten. Besser wäre, in den offenen Diskurs zu gehen, aber schimpfen kostet halt weniger Anstrengung.

Y'all are some nice people not calling out these other folks as straight up liars, let me tell you about my experience:

Within a minute or two of starting the game, I was able to figure out where to build a little spot to roast berries, and after all the propaganda on how bad building was, I was incredibly grateful to note I can auto fill slots for crafting, and even extinguish my fire to save the sticks I was burning as fuel. Think Satisfactory and how it uses biomass to power generators early on, which was never bashed as needlessly complicated, right?

After becoming encumbered fairly quickly, I noticed an option, after hovering over my items ""extract."" Extracting converts items into various amounts of essence dust, which is basically a resource for repairing your gear. So yes, you can reward yourself for being encumbered by consuming excess weight directly into your repair materials, which I think is the most brilliant unique QOL concept introduced in this game, so far. There are other uses for the essence, revealed later, but that's going beyond being helpful, and actually spoiling things.

The first tutorial area has some berry bushes in huge clusters near the shore, and instead of letting Puck (who in my opinion has epic voice and dialogue, fitting of a Fae) rush me through, to the next portal, I collected / cooked so many berries, that I will probably be munching them well into mid-game. 

I will admit I couldn't find a marker for my campfire, but after checking my map, I noticed a squiggly line that represented my path thus far, and was able to use that to back track, to where my campfire had been randomly built, to stave off starvation. Then, I noticed I could manually place a marker like most games, and the issue never happened again. 

Just while exploring the first island, I found a hidden piece of lore called an ""echo of hope"" if I recall, and was immediately given a snippet of info about things relating to the story, as it pertains to how our present circumstances came to be in this altered world. 

Many players have left bad reviews insisting that resource gathering is random and doesn't clearly identify what can and can't be harvested. Again, I didn't have that issue. Any large stone or tree, even driftwood by the shore, if I hovered over it with my view, my skill rating for that type of gathering appeared above my head. 

I have third person on, with a slightly increased FOV (75) and am running my game on performance settings, which is still beautiful, even with a slightly dated NVIDIA card, and no sound card (still has awesome effects, birds chirping, etc.) It's a slower-paced, very relaxing game, if you want it to be, and the nature and ambiance really feed into that option, if you choose to immerse for long sessions of play. Rocks that have ore absolutely do have pieces of VERY visible ore deposits jutting out of them, but the people leaving hateful reviews may not be able to see them, with their sloping foreheads covering their field of vision in real life.

My character wasn't very pretty as the standard white person, so I figured hey, why not make a Native American character? The frames and looks for the characters are actually quite nice, if you aren't trying to make a white person, and my character, Smiling Ant, was born. I even got to add family lineage and customize those, as well, giving my character even more of a backstory, with more options, up to and including your background / life circumstances, which I won't spoil.

Food is pretty easy to cook, and you immediately get some useful buffs off the lowest tier of food, such as health regeneration, which is very nice. I'm playing on Hard, and so far it's just right for me. I also play games like Remnant 2, Elden Ring, Palworld, and a few others. I think the closest game I would compare this to is Valheim, but I like the solo experience in this much more than Valheim, and with the very tiny amount of time I have on record, I'm already figuring out how to break the game and advance rapidly.

If you are a resourceful person, capable of critical thinking, and you don't blaze through the tutorial messages popping up, to tell you how to do ALL the things these negative reviews are saying you can't do or can't be found, you'll be totally fine. I'm also playing on cheap WOW cable company WiFi, and it runs great. I even opened a Vampire Survivors clone called Holocure, to play that, while my food passively cooked on the campfires I built in rows, and prepped with the max amount of sticks to kindle their flames. Literally no issues or stutters, except that first second or two when I log into my game, and the world populates its vegetation and etc.

It's got a level of control over tiny details, like extinguishing flames to conserve fuel, as I mentioned, that really hit that survivalist itch I was hoping for, and I do feel the graphics are very pretty, even on my lower settings. As far as the world and the way you can navigate it, there are some really nice ideas and interesting nuances, with a fresh approach to things you may have seen in a dozen other survival games. 

One area I did encounter bugs and just a really big disconnect in general, was the first boss fight. There weren't any visible trails to see how I was being struck, and it appeared to be able to hit me through walls, and even at higher elevations. It was a difficult battle, but mostly because of how dysfunctional the fight felt. My AI companion and I chain revived each other to slowly whittle it down, while tanking the invisible hits, that I had no way to predict or counter.

Items can be crafted after a blueprint you acquire, that will increase your weight capacity, so just convert the excess into essence dust until then, or store it once you unlock storage options :)

I wasn't here for day one, so maybe the servers really were bad, but so far I'm fine, and definitely take all these hateful reviews that are straight up lying about what is / isn't in the game with a grain of salt. I've been gaming since old school Nintendo, and EverQuest on PC, back in the 90s. You don't need to be an old crusty gamer like me to appreciate this one, so decide for yourself, as is your right. But don't let these people talking so hatefully and immaturely represent what it will be like for a real immersive gamer / escapist. You'll be missing out.

As far as combat goes, I was facing level 25 enemies on the hard setting, and yes it was challenging. I was lucky to discover the mining pick naturally lends itself to good weak spot / head shot damage, since it naturally strikes straight downwards, and that did help significantly, as enemies are fully capable of killing you on higher difficulties.

Crafting times can be impacted by the terrain a station sits upon, and whether or not your stations are sheltered, but if you just take a nap in your bed, after auto-filling your crafting mats and amount crafted, you can totally bypass the wait time, regardless.

I'm not sure what the controls are for consoles and etc, but on pc, if you jump and then use your block button while holding an umbrella, you'll do a nice little boost forward in mid air, kind of like in Starfield, that doesn't consume much stamina, and really helps in disease-ridden bogs, and getting to some areas that have little bits of loot you can skip, like tin ingots. It won't work with 2 handed weapons.

Final Note: You can find cards hidden in the second area, as the tutorial takes you to new biomes, so do take your time and explore. I have a stamina cost reduction and low gravity card, just from checking some stone structures in a desert. After exploring the second and third areas during the tutorial, counting the cards I started with, I have a total of 7, and a weak umbrella to glide with, never mentioned during the initial tutorial.

Jokes aside - 

Tutorial, well done. The quest objectives are in the top right corner, if you can't figure it out from there, well, there is no helping you. 

Graphics are amazing, absolutely no lag or clunky movement. Fair warning don't try to play this on a potato or with a substandard net. 

The journal and help guide in game are comprehensive and detailed: Hit J and look through the tabs, reading isn't a lost art, well maybe for some it is. 

Reporting bugs and issues, there's a discord, forum, etc. Once more, reading and checking around will save one the embarrassment of looking the fool when saying they can't find something. 

Game play is smooth, systems are well developed, guidance is clearly displayed, journal entries elaborate on details. 
This is not an arena game, so don't go at it thinking it will be. 
Survival mechanics aren't over board or over bearing, unlike some games (cough cough, 7 days to die - still in alpha)
The game is in alpha, but has been released in a much better state than any other in alpha.
There is a road map and development to come.

 [UPDATE: Devs listened to player feedback and have announced they are actively working on an offline mode now vs waiting till after the game leaves EA.]  ONLINE ONLY for those wanting to play single player makes no sense.  SP shouldn't require constant online connection to play.  This is for a number of practical reasons and preferred play styles.  One being is the availability of servers if the developer decides to take the servers down for whatever reason.  Then you have server stability, lag etc.  And a lot of folks just prefer to play SP games offline for a whole hosts of reasons.  Not sure why (as evidenced by comments in the discussions) that triggers people.  No one is saying you shouldn't be able to play online.  A lot of co-op games that are also SP games can be played OFFLINE.  My single player play through was nearly impossible to enjoy with all the rubber banding. And that's just not fun. 

There are good things about its current state and there are some not so good things.  Glad they implemented both a 3rd and 1st person mode.  Controls and Crafting are a little clunky at this point but this is probably something that will be improved over time.  I like complex survival/crafting/building but there's a difference between detailed and the minutia of multiple screens you sometimes need to click back and forth from to craft something simple (or even complex.)  Crafting from storage isn't available at the moment and with the myriad crafting resources, ought to be implemented as a QoL feature.

The game is graphically beautiful in some ways and comparatively primitive in others.  Character creation (and that of your ancestors) - meh.  Needs a lot of improvement.  The scenery, etc. is significantly better but still needs improvement. Definitely needs optimization.  FPS was about half what I see on any other game I play on high to ultra. The worlds are rich, and its definitely a platform to build and improve upon as the game progresses through development.

NOT a fan of the fairly invasive privacy (data mining) policy you have to agree to.  I've played a lot of games in EA and I can't remember any that were similarly worded ; not saying there aren't... I just don't recall BG3 (for example) forcing you to agree to anything like this one does.  Usually you can opt-in that sort of data sharing with the developer (and ""third party"" sources outside the EU, US, etc.)  

I really do hope they work some of those issues out.  The concept is an interesting one and there's lots of potential. ",1708472671,1708638195,True,0,0,0.532271683216094971,0,True,False,True

But yes, in general, the game still needs quite a bit of polishing. Crafting can be quite a chore and confusing at times. There are still various bugs, crashes, and missing icons, etc. Additionally, the combat system could be a bit smoother, and the AI could use some refinement.

I hope for more biomes, smaller cards, and a greater variety of creatures and POIs (Points of Interest). I like that the game places more focus on story compared to many other survival games, and I would love to see them continue to expand on that. Perhaps more voice-overs as well? Maybe also some Mechanic Reworks of the Bosses and give them a more unique approach would be nice.

The game is far from perfect, but with some time and effort from the developers, it has the potential to become a gem. The atmosphere and style are truly unique.

Positive:
- Inredible beautiful Landscapes & Skyboxes. Best Water to date. 
- Coop
- Unique Artstyl
- Insane Big Crafting System 
- For me it runs pretty well FPS wise
- Realm Mechanic 
- Building System is good but not as good like in Enshrouded
- Exploration
- Story
- Character Editor (God is that a Monster of an Editor xD but neeeeeds more Hairstyls and Facial Hair! Where is my Beard?)

Negativ
- Bugs, Crashes
- Always Online (I would like to see a System like in NMS where u can Switch between both Modes)
- Combat System is a bit mehhh. 
- AI is like in Alpha Status
- Character Models & Animations are a bit odd maybe also not finished
- After some realms it can get repetitive (But yeah game still EA. There will come new Biomes, POIs etc.) 
- Game need more Creatures. Why no Sea Creatures?
- QoL 
- Performance

There's a lack of information in certain parts of the game when you're asked to create a part and you have no idea where that part comes from, if it wasn't for the internet games like this wouldn't stand a chance.
The action parts in particular suffer from what I consider to be poor networking, most times you hear an attack before you see it and then it's all over you, good job the monsters, wolves or whatever don't hit too hard.

The crafting and base building are somewhat deep but some QoL are currently missing and much of the crafting recipes are a bit too deeply progression-gated.
Chests communicating with crafting benches would definitely go a long way to alleviate some of the frustration.

I have to admit that the early game is a bit of a slog and the combat/AI is janky at best.
Some more monsters variety/animation/attacks as well as better hit-boxes would improve the overall experience.

First off: this game definitely has the potential to be amazing. the realms and story are interesting and there is a lot of things to craft and do (more so than in most early access releases in my mind). having a big set goal to work towards in this case ""get to the city of nightingale"" feels especially nice in a genre that often times gives of the feeling of meandering in place for way too long with no goal in sight. Sound in fights (only fought melee so far) is also pretty satisfying. Hitting the crit spot feels rewarding with a special audio cue playing if you hit it. the evasion move with the knive also feels nice to use (in both traversal and combat)

BUT it also still needs a lot of work.

AI of enemies needs improvement (especially the minibosses in the first few dungeons. they behave very erratically and dont telegraph their moves well).
The Tutorial and first few mission are way too handholding and long and dont explain enough so i still had to look up how to progress at some point. taking 3-4h to get to opening up the first portal out of your abeyance realm feels way too long and in general the beginning feels quite a bit like a grind. especially collecting the essence dust for the traders. it would feel better to unlock the recipes in a different way (you can unlock some through puzzles but not all of them and they get repetitiive quite quickly).
A lot of the ruins and buildings you can find in the world just feel like set dressing. nothing to interact with. nothing to find. just a bit of rubble/coffins/etc without even a way to destroy or harvest them. they feel really static and not relevant. i wish that would change.
As most of the other reviewers i had some lag and server issues. i know its early days and its early access but if you develop an online only game you should damn well make sure its stable (for all players in all regions you sell it in). so even if i understand and i personally dont mind that much (because its early on. the game has been out 2 days) i get all the anger in the reviews.
the menus are a bit confusing and there are quite a few of different fonts which makes it look a bit ugly at some points. that can easily be fixed though and i read the team is already looking to change the menus a bit.
last but not least i hope that with a bit of tweaking the different major versions of the realms can look even more different than they are right now. because even though they look a bit different and have a slight change in the set dressing scattered throughout them they still feel quite samey and could be a bit more differentiated. if they address it through adding a lot more biomes and major cards i'm fine with that as well.

So to get this all to a satisfying end: Why do i still recommend the game? Because after all the criticism i wrote down here i still think its fun! Not as fun as it could be, sure, but fun nontheless! The developers have their work cut out for them but i got faith in them that they can pull it off. its early days and i hope they take all the community input and constructive criticism to heart and change it for the better!

I'm playing multiplayer with my wife, and we've been having a blast exploring the initial realms, clearing the first 'dungeon' and getting into the Antiquarian realms. We could have rushed it, but we're taking our time and enjoying the world.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]Game looks awesome. The aesthetics are just glorious.
    [*]Character Creator is great! The default faces are bloody awful, but the sliders and ancestry system let you make some good looking characters, or incredibly ugly ones (whatever floats your zeplin)
    [*]Building system is great. You can plan out an entire structure in blueprint, and then deliver materials to any part (including finished parts) to build it.
    [*]Crafting system is really neat. Materials have stats, the end result of your crafting is changed by what stats you use.
    [*]Realm generation is a neat idea. Very gaslight-Stargate.
    [*]Arachnophobia mode replaces the spiders with other models (ants for the small ones). My wife is not a fan of spiders, so this is great for her.
[/list]

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]Building system is great as mentioned, but is also VERY limited so far. No wedge foundations, some missing roof elements (at least at current tier), feels like an area that needs a lot of love, but the underlying system is solid.
    [*]Farming system is 100% worthless. Gather 5 blueberries. Process them into 1 seed. Plant seed, water seed, wait for it to grow, harvest... 1 blueberry, one time per seed. 
    [*] Elements of the game are not particularly intuitive. There are several augments you can make for benches that ""enable new recipes"" but these appear to require that you know the recipes first. Not a big deal, and there is an in-game section of info you can check for details.
    [*]Your NPC hirelings can and will chop trees down near your house if equipped with an axe. The only way to stop this is to uequip their axe or replace it with something else. Why is this a big deal? Because falling trees can demolish your base. And have. Twice. Until I took away the axe and told them they'd only get it back once we'd deforested and rebuilt.

The crafting alone...I've seen systems that have tons of recipes that lead to other recipes. This one is much more about the materials used. Then you've got the story, which has a number of characters contributing to it through echoes(letters/notes) or direct contact ranging from real, historical figures to fictional. The combat is simple at first, but gains a little more depth as you begin to come across more varied and intelligent enemies, not that the AI is all that smart. The only challenge is offered at the beginning every time you encounter something new. Once you learn the limits to each creature, the fighting becomes a simple thing. Gear progression is kind of an odd thing in Nightingale. Normally you would just swap out your old piece of gear with a new one, and while that does happen, most of your progress will involve improving pieces via upgrading, magick, and using better materials during crafting.

The problem, and reason I don't recommend it to anyone who can't handle a buggy game, is all the compounding issues. Some of these are not early access level problems and would fall into the realm of beta testing. And I know, there are people out there who would argue that early access and beta testing are the same thing. Those people are morons and a big reason why so many early access launches suck. Here's a list of a few of the problems:
1. Third person doesn't have the same aim as first person. I'll be looking at a log in third person, swing with the axe, and it misses. Without adjusting at all, I'll switch to first person, take the same swing, and it hits. Such a simple, stupid mistake. Where's the incentive to play in third person if the aim is complete trash?
2. Sometimes all interaction prompts will just vanish. You can't see what it takes to build something. You can't see if a chest can be opened. You can't see the prompt to release a hope echo. It takes logging out and back in to fix it, which is another problem.
3. Logging in is such a time consuming process. If the servers decide to work, which there are times where you can't connect with a server and have to retry, you're looking at anywhere from one minute to a few minutes load time unless your computer is current and in good working order. Also, the country you're in, or the distance you are from the servers, will play a big part in this.
4. Escape, or your menu/cancel button will randomly stop working as a close button. This required me to shut down the game and restart to fix. This one, and number 2, are examples of problems that shouldn't even exist in an early access launch. These are basic function.
5. Online only servers...I mean, we all understand why this is so stupid, right? Having dedicated servers is cool, but why can't I host a server locally and play solo without all the ping and crazy long load times?
6. This is the most minor problem on this list. At times the items on your action bar will be replaced with generic images, or the number value, like with consumables, will disappear and the image will grey out. It prevents you from seeing which items are where on your bars or how many of an item you have. There is a simple fix. Open your inventory and hover over/select each action bar box. That seems to prompt an information refresh.

I've had one crash in my 17 hours of play time.

I expect all of these, and more, to be fixed at some point. If you're cool with powering through very frequent bugs then give this one a try.

HUD disappearing after a while making any interactions impossible, not good. Menu not displaying tooltips at all, or your codex not being clickable but also uses tooltip to display. I am not running some kind of beast computer but it is more than good enough to play this, or even ICARUS on max (without Ray tracing). But in this game I am getting shoddy textures and framerate drops even on medium settings, with DLSS on for good messure. 
But look. The idea of the game so far is good, but has a long way to go in my oppinion. There is alot of work to be done and it should not have come out yet. The online only is a big no fucking thanks in my book since online only locks you out as soon as there is an issue server side. Give us normal local play like any other survival game so we can do what we always do without the headaches of stupid servers. 
I regret having bought it on launch day after following it for so long only to get this. 
My recommendation is to not buying this game. Wait at least 6 months, or until someone you know that has it, or maybe some streamer tells you that it is ""good now"".

Edit: So after being able to spend a bit more time with the game and actualy seeing some more of the content, I wanted to update the review a bit.

Positive: The realms look very beautiful and lush. There are several ""events"" that you have to do to boost your essence income (just harvesting is too slow). There are even a few ""dungeons"" to do for items. Some of these will be items that boost your crafting tables, like in Valheim. For those of you that don't know, you build a item to place close to a specific table to boost it, in this case it lowers crafting times or adds new recipies. 

Negatives: It is slow. Everything that happens feels slow. Except the most basic crafting, everything feels slower than neccesary. But this is due to the mechanics they use, but if you are like me and are a bit slower with pushing ""Main"" quest lines, it will be a while to get the faster crafting. I put this in negative because there are people that dont have 15h a day to spend with this.
Now this is a small one, opening realms. This is super slow for some reason, I would not be able to tell you. 
The online only makes loading realms so slow it kills so much of it. Your computer will not matter here. if their servers put you in a queue, you have to deal with it.

Overall: This is a great game. The concept is unique and the execution is also a bit different. It doesn't stick to a mold that many survival crafting games do. This means that there are things that you will have to learn how to do, instead of just knowing how to do it based on previous games. There are aspects of other games mixed into this one, such as Valheim where a roof over your head and a fire nearby provide comfort.

Sure, the always online thing is annoying and having network issues is a pain. This is early access though and I've not had a ton of issues with it, even having mediocre internet. I've seen a bug or two as well, but nothing game breaking.

Pros:
- Absolutely stunning scenery and graphics. I find myself stopping to admire the beauty.
- Lore, soooo much lore and story behind everything (sometimes this can be a bit annoying lol)
- The ability to open numerous realms, farm them, and then move on to other realms as needed.
- Partying up and taking down dungeons with your friends, it's a fun time
- Unique crafting system, there's so much to make and it's not all introduced to you at one time
- The music and ambiance are amazing, really draws you into the game

Cons:
- Online game, this really should allow you to play offline when playing solo
- Network connectivity issues, I've had a few disconnects, but am able to get back in quickly
- Mobs are kind of rinse & repeat, but that's more of a given in games like this, standard attacks etc...
- Slight con - I just wish more building options were available earlier on

All in all, I love the game. It feels like a fantasy world from a book and you're the main character, even when playing with friends.",1708635983,1708635983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First I download the game then spend over an hour in the tutorial portion alone due to many lag and crash issues. Hence 1 hr of game play indicated but no actual game play was played.

Yes, you guessed it once I shut down the game and log back in my new character is now in a dark realm not in my home realm and once again have no cards nothing to get out just black realm chased by 100's of creatures.

I've encountered some minor issues with the AI follower I have,such as bad pathing and a tendency for them to stand in my fireplace and engulf themselves in flames. Haha  And the UI could use some work, or some polish,at least.

But, with that being said, I am having fun with the game and I find the world and the premise to be interesting. The game looks beautiful,aside from an odd bit of artifacting I get with shadows that land on the surface of water, at times. I enjoy the melee combat so far. When in melee I primarily use my Hunting knife, and with the knife equipped RMB activates a very handy Dodge ability. Rather than just standing toe to toe with an enemy and smacking each other over and over, as you do in many other survival-type games, I can dodge an attack and then slash and stab the enemy,which has weak spots such as the head, or their back,which trigger a ""crit"" when you hit them. 

The system is not a huge departure from the standard button mash combat I usually see in these games, but it adds a little bit of nuance to it, at least. You could completely ignore it and just smack them over and over again, I suppose. But I like to make things interesting for myself, so I attempt to dodge the enemy attacks. 

The card system is very interesting, in my opinion. Cards can be used to change your biome completely, and their are lesser cards that change different aspects of the biome you're in. For example, you could use a card that makes plants yield more resources, but other resources yield less. Or a card that increases your Stamina and lets you jump higher,or a card to make it always Day time, or increase your carry capacity but lower your damage output,etc. There are many different cards with interesting effects on them. You can find the cards as loot, and some can be crafted. 

The game's crafting and building reminds a bit of ""Icarus"".  It reminds me a lot of ""Icarus"" in some regards,actually.   In conclusion, so far I am having fun in the game. Yes, it needs some polish and some bug fixes, and could use some refinement overall. But the game is in state where it is a very solid foundation for a game that could be truly exceptional. If you're a fan of survival-craft games like, Icarus, The Forest, Son of the Forest, Conan:Exiles, Green Hell, etc., then you would probably enjoy Nightingale. 

But if you're not willing to deal with a few rough edges and bugs, then you should wait for the game to get to a state closer to complete, rather than buying it now, in Early Access, and then being unhappy and leaving the game a negative review. That's unfair for a game that is still in active development, especially when you know,going into it, that's it's still being worked on.",1708635026,1708635508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really enjoy how you're able to map out the blueprint of your builds then you go collect resources (and your companion can too!) To add to build. It's a really fun way to design and play with your builds.

There are a few bugs and quirks, which are expected. I did have all of the characters I ran into dressed in dresses and I thought it was funny. I'm sure there will be plenty of updates soon to help with these issues.

The animals are much easier to kill once you upgrade your slingshot, also you can build and upgrade a backpack for more storage. The zombie guys are wicked and a fun creepy design.

I very much enjoy fae lore so the opening wasn't boring to me. Someone reviewed that it didn't make sense you'd trust a fae after they explained it was most likely the fae that destroyed your world. Well duh, fae are known tricksters. You're not supposed to trust them and they're probably lying to you real hard. But in situations like our character, what other choice do you have??

The game requires a permanent internet connection currently with a possible offline mode later, being online doesn't bother me even if I play solo. (Whiny babies cry about it but these are the day of online, so suck it up and stop being woke!)

I definitely would recommend this game if the above doesn't bother you, as it has so far been great fun, and for sure explore the biomes as they hold lots of stuff tucked away hidden if you search for it to aid you in an easier progression, also break chests once looted as that gives you high end tier crafting resources for later in the game.

Bad stuff:
I completely agree with everyone who said it is stupid to have solo players have to fool with servers... why tie up servers with people who don't need servers? When you get too tired or hungry you can't swing your weapon and just have to stand there and die... I hate that. When you fell a tree if it lands on your structures it does an insane amount of damage, so expansion is a pain.

Additionally, the absence of synchronization between storage boxes and crafting stations results in persistent encumbrance. For those who prefer offline options, such as during road trips, Nightingale may not be the best choice.

Moreover, the mandatory online connection for single-player mode is a significant drawback. I would consider playing once this requirement is resolved. The lack of loot sharing and guild/base sharing features further diminishes the game's appeal.

[b]Things I Love So Far:[/b]
[hr][/hr]
- The Realm Cards. Allows for amazing macro-level exploration, especially when you start crafting some of the more obscure card combinations.
- The Crafting System. Incredible, probably my favorite part of the game so far.
- The Building System. Could use a bit more QoL but currently has plenty of options, ghost blueprints are great.
- The Gathering System. Seems to be a wide variety of resources to discover, can hold F to pick up all after mining/chopping. Fishing exists and feels great.
- The Lore. Puck's VA is great and the NPCs/lore notes are all very well-written.
- Character Creation. People will complain about this one because they don't like the character models, but the character creator itself is amazing for this genre.
- The Small Details - The music and ambient audio are lovely, melee headshots feel oddly satisfying, AI predators hunt prey in the wild, fun sound effects on the crafting benches, the way the sun streams through the windows, etc.

[b]Things People Are Complaining About: [/b]
[hr][/hr]
- Repetitive POIs. This is the biggest one for me. I foresee many people getting bored at around the 20 hour mark if micro-exploration is their main thing. I find that it's decent enough when padded with other things like crafting, questing, and building.
- Always Online Model. I personally love the asynchronous multiplayer. If they add the option for local hosting in the future then it will be a win-win for everyone.
- Connectivity Issues. I'm in the US with a wired connection and have only had one disconnect.
- Performance Problems. Running on ultra and have noticed some frame drops at times but nowhere near unplayable. Much better than expected.
- Unintuitive UI. Again, not as bad as I thought it'd be. Could use some work but overall functional and fits the aesthetic nicely.
- Bad Inventory Management. I agree on this, inventory management needs a lot of help. However they have stated they're actively working on connected storage and other inventory QoL.
- Character Aesthetics. Plenty of people hate them, I find them quite charming.
- Dumb Enemy AI. Could definitely use some work, but about standard for the genre.
- Janky Animations. Not as bad as I thought they'd be, but some things need polishing.
- Combat Depth. Again, about standard for the genre, I don't really know what people are expecting. Ranged needs some work, but I find melee quite satisfying, especially the dashing around with dagger/climbing picks.

Keep in mind that this game has some depth to it and hasn't been out long enough for people to fully explore all of its systems. I will update this review as I continue to do so.",1708618283,1708632823,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Flat out, base characters are F**K-UGLY and off putting.

The short of it:
By the time I finished the tutorial and started playing in the actual world, I was so sick of Puck and reading through endless text and searching through UI and being assigned chores that I hardly wanted to keep going at all.  I did try, but by that point it had already lost me through a thousand cuts.  The plan is to refund and wait until this is out of Early Access and hopefully a fully polished and engaging experience because it has the bones to be exactly that.

What did I like in my first hour of play?
Very little, to be honest.
- The game world's visual and audio quality are on point.
- The concepts behind the game are interesting: constructing unique or interesting worlds to visit.  The implied steampunk style.  Building upon aspects of predecessor survival games to create a new approach.
- An actual pack of deer darting out from the foliage in the forest after I didn't notice them, then standing at a distance it seemed they were watching me.  It was a magical moment that captured something I had longed hoped from a game like this - passive creatures that felt like real creatures.

Now what did I have personal gripes with?
- The tutorial, or, the start.
It's slow, it's unmotivating, and it doesn't really give you a feel for anything.
  Conan drops you into the hostile desert, naked and with only one way forward to survive.  It gives you a set of goals that you may do to help you learn the process, but aren't necessary to heed.
  Valheim literally drops you into the world and shows you a set of goals you will overcome that are part of the world in front of you, urging you to prepare yourself for the coming trials, slowly revealing how to build and survive as you do new things.
  Ark drops you in some random location and you quickly discover you must build and learn on your own if you are to have any hope.

  Nightingale?  It just... tells you.  And forces you to listen.  I didn't feel anything starting out, no wonder, no urgency, no desire.  I was told, by an NPC who I was forced to talk to - find stuff to make food, find stuff to make shelter, find stuff to build tools - all in a way that made it feel like a list of chores.  Then it tells you there is hope, but like as little blog posts of text on the ground?

- The first encounter.
Of an enemy, that is.  It was a unique and interesting looking creature, certainly, but nothing I fought was fun to fight, or a challenge, or actually threatening at all.  I understand if there's a motivation to NOT kill the player in a survival game during the tutorial, but that sets a tone that the world isn't dangerous to survive in.
Side stepping enemies was more powerful than in Dark Souls, to the point encounters were trivial.

- The starting equipment.
Some shoddy hide stuff I got from an unknown creature is supposed to be superior to tailored clothing from an advanced civilization?  Don't make starting gear an option if it's going to be immediately outclassed by stuff that by all means looks worse than it.

- Using the tools.
The animations were decent, and swings felt substantial when they hit.  Somehow at the same time swinging tools felt off, like it is harder to judge the distance, speed, and where along the motion contact is actually going to happen.  Far more often than it should, it felt like something should hit a creature or resource but didn't.

- The UI
Nightingale struggles to understand what it is they want to accomplish with the UI.  What is important?  What should be in your direct sight?  What is important to see when different menus are open?  What information should be gleaned at a glance?  What is the goal of style within the context of each menu, dialog, etc?  What needs UI and how can that UI best be used?
It felt like I had to actively search for information each time.  My interactions with menus and elements in them often felt clunky or slow or unresponsive.  At other times, like with buildings, there was simply far too much stuff.  Maybe it would be okay later on when things become familiar but not at the start when tons of the UI means nothing to a new player.
The first time I interacted with the campfire I found myself wondering what the heck was going on, and then when I saw it doing stuff in the world I was entirely lost again a second time due to all the icons and text.
One particular moment of note was a screen with a huge and highly decorative border and little to no space for the actual text, so I had to scroll through what would have otherwise fit mostly if not entirely on-screen if screen space was managed better.
For such a colorful looking game, the way you interact with most of it is through a pretty dull, clunky, dense UI.

- Building
Was pretty unsatisfying.  It felt somewhat like The Forest, but without any of elements of theme and organization that made selecting your buildings in The Forest great and simple.  Then there were the blueprints you place, which is nice on its own, but you don't build the blueprints up like you would in The Forest, or Grounded.  Instead you shove all the material you can in at the push of a button and when there's enough it pops into existence.
You get neither the satisfaction of it clonking into the world, nor from slowly building it up piece by piece.
I wish I could have progressed more into later building as I'm a builder.

- The bed.
If I use a bed in a survival game, I'd like to actually use the bed please.  Anything.  An animation, a fade out, a sound effect, a UI effect, something to draw attention to the fact I did something and the fact that I gained something from it and in the case of this game a rest should pass time to a degree and I should be made aware of that.

- Gathering
There's just a bunch of little things that make this tedious, or annoying, or difficult, or awkward.  When I started out, I was told gather sticks.  So I saw a stick on the ground and tried, but that was an environment stick not a real one.  Then I looked around and was immediately disappointed that the real resource was an ugly copy-paste looking pile.  Same with the rocks.
Then later I was disappointed that I couldn't use by sickle to gather things like mushrooms, those are hand only.  Then you can only get stones from rocks, but rocks themselves were only able to be picked up by hand.  It seems arbitrary which rock-like things you are allowed to hit and what level those things are going to be.
Sometimes it felt like I was hitting a resource but nothing would happen, then other times it felt like I wouldn't or should be interacting with a resource but then I hit or gather it.  Certain piles and plants and items you have to directly look at very close by to even try to get them, but others you can just be standing nearby and accidentally collect it.
There's also the weight limit, which is far too hidden.  No indication and no easy visibility of it until suddenly you are slowed.

- The portals
There's just... so much text.  Stop trying to force these words and story ideas down my throat.  Give me the information I need, make it obvious, and then let ME look for the rest myself once I'm interested.
Without a proper introduction to the portals and cards, everything feels so forced and so not part of the world they are in.  Why cards?  Why these weird card combining boxes next to portals?  Why portals?  How do these cards even interact with the portals when they're clearly of such different origin?  Why do we need some mysterious guide to force us through?  Why SHOULD I go through?
Nightingale so desperately wants these to be interesting, but refuses to give me reason why they are interesting or why I should care about them or why I should go through them.  Being the crux of the game's design it really lacks the focus it deserves.

The look of the game is incredible and the weather effects are great. The environments are diverse and it seems there could be more as the game develops. I really enjoyed character creation, it really gave a Victorian Steampunk vibe and there were some surprises as well. The tutorial is good and does a great job taking you through the basics while giving you the freedom to ""play around"". I like the fast you can build pretty much anywhere and your not relegated to a particular base zone. 

There is a ton of resource gathering and there are different types of resources of the same type which can give different boosts to either food or your equipment. Speaking of equipment, You craft everything, the tutorial does help with that as well. Your stats are based around the equipment you wear and the food you eat. 

The combat is interesting, it can be really easy depending on what you use against what your fighting. It is fast paced and so far I haven't really felt overpowered. I like what they've done with melee weapons. Each hit feels solid and like ""daaaaaang, bet you felt that"".

Does the game have a few bugs and issues? Sure but it's been out for 2 seconds! lol - the game does have bug reporting which will take you to a forum for reporting bugs but also seeing if said bugs have already been reported. Nothing is perfect, however this early access game is way more polished than others I have purchased.

There is a quest system in place and the story is good. There are locations to discover, puzzles to solve, and exploration is key. The experience so far has been enjoyable and very unique.

I was a part of the closed alpha playtest and participated in the server stress test as well. The game has come a long way. The devs listened to feedback and have changed things the community voiced, which I feel is a great sign for the future of Nightingale. I plan on updating this review the more I play but here are my thoughts on the game. Buckle up it’s long (TLDR at bottom)

The Servers: Let’s get what a lot of people are complaining about out of the way. It’s an online only game. For now. I do believe, and hope, that Inflexion is working towards being able to run the game off a local machine as well as set up dedicated servers, but for the time being it is online only. I personally do not feel this game deserves a negative review based on that. It should be based on the gameplay, not how it’s accessed (unless you can’t access it at all). I understand why that makes some people upset but let’s be real here, a large number of people have a good internet connection, so it shouldn’t be that big of a deal. I don’t have that good of internet playing on WiFi (in NA) and have had 0 problems in all my time playing the alpha, server testing, and now EA release. This doesn’t mean that other people aren’t having issues and I’m bound to run into server problems eventually. As of 2/22/24, Inflexion put out a notice saying they hear people complaining about no offline play and will be “prioritizing and developing an offline mode that we plan to release as soon as feasible.”

The Tutorial/Character Creation: Character creation is great. Decently in-depth and the cool part is you can set up an ancestry and adjust your characters features based on family members. There are a few things that aren’t available on launch, which is to be expected for EA and isn’t a deal breaker by any means. One thing I would’ve liked to have seen is a HT/WT option, as every Realmwalker is the same in those regards. The tutorial doesn’t take too long and tells you just enough to get you started. Nothing super interesting to point out, it does what a tutorial should- shows you the bare bones of the gameplay and gives you an idea of how to navigate the menus. Nightingale gets more in-depth the more you play, so instead of showing everything in the tutorial, text boxes will pop up giving you a rundown when discovering new things. This was not in testing and is a welcome change. 

The Environment: This is THE reason I love Nightingale. It’s so beautiful. Each biome is unique and has its own intricacies. Yes, there are only three biomes for the time being (I believe Inflexion is planning on adding more), however different major cards change the difficulty and appearance of each biome, making it feel unique enough. The puzzles scattered around the Realms aren’t difficult and repeat frequently, but for anyone interested in loot (and a bit of lore), it is worth the extra minute or so to do them. These puzzles also can give to crafting schematics upon completion. There are some naturally generated structures as well, to include other NPC Realmwalkers that you can help for a reward.

The Cards: A nice twist to the typical survival tropes. Instead of having one big map, they use smaller, procedurally generated Realms. Using minor cards at a Transmuter to instantly change how you want to play your Realm is huge. Having to complete Sites of Power to unlock different major cards is an interesting touch, instead of buying the recipe from a trader like most everything. If you find the Sites too easy, your Abeyance Realm (starting Realm) level can be scaled on character creation to your liking. Having the option to go back to a previous Realm  or creating a new one after using the same combination of biome and major cards was a very welcome change, as it was not an option pre-EA launch. 

The Crafting: A major focus of the genre that some things are done well and others not so much. There are TONS of items, to the point that some things that seem like they should be the same aren’t, which means they take up another inventory slot. Buying crafting recipes from essence traders is kind of a strange game mechanic to me, but it’s a way Inflexion can lock recipes behind harder Realms. The nice part though is in the Guidebook tab you can see what traders sell in each type of Realm, removing the guesswork to see if they will have what you want. That being said, the crafting is pretty in depth which I enjoy. Plenty of different crafting stations with unique designs, especially when you buy higher tier stations. One thing that’s a huge help to me is using the search bar in the building/crafting/glossary tabs. The biggest downside is I REALLY wish there was a way for items to be pulled from storage containers when crafting (Enshrouded magic chests). Hint- extract stone marbles for easy essence early game ❤️

The Building: The building is very much reminiscent of The Forest. The building itself is super modular, but each small item you place is very free to go where you please. Modular isn’t a bad thing by any means. It keeps the builds more realistic and seamless in the environment, and the buildings themselves are pretty too. The one thing that I was confused about at first was the difference between the crafting and building tabs. Crafting creates an item while building creates a placeable object in a Realm.

The Combat: Here is where I feel Nightingale struggles the most. While the combat isn’t bad, it isn’t super engaging. The AI overall isn’t great. The early game is very basic- hitting enemies that lunge at you. As you progress, the enemies gradually become more varied and dynamic. You start learning how to use enchantments, which makes it feel better, but the harder enemies still feel like they’re just a big health bar. I haven’t gotten to mess around with the firearms too much, but during alpha testing the shotgun seemed way too close range to be worth it and the pistol’s dps was just not good. The rifle though had a good weight and damage, and was by far my favorite weapon. Some enemies are susceptible to specific damage types, so choosing the right weapon is important and adds a bit more depth to the combat

The NPCs: I haven’t had much experience yet on the story NPCs but will also update as I play. Puck’s VA is great though, he truly does feel like who he is meant to be. Much like combat, the follower AI is lackluster and needs some work. Unsurprisingly, they will hold items and you can equip them with different gear. To get them to do specific things in kind of annoying as they essentially mirror whatever the player is doing. Oh, you’re crafting or building items? Let me put more wood on the fire (if they have a fuel source in their inventory, otherwise they will pull from a chest if you check a box that allows them to) or put some materials on a schematic you put down (this part is actually pretty helpful imo). Oh, hey, you’re cutting down trees? Let me collect materials for which ever tool I have equipped. This means if your follower has both an axe and a pickaxe in their inventory, but has the axe equipped and you’re going around collecting stone, they will only cut down trees and probably leave some logs on the ground. Early game they’re ok for combat scenarios, but later down the road if you don’t give them better gear they’re not super helpful. Which I guess makes sense

TLDR: Nightingale in its current state is an 8.5/10. There are definitely things that need worked on and some things that are done well. Online only kinda sucks but that alone does not constitute a negative review. Yes there may be some things missing, but you are buying an early access game, and it’s only $30. AI isn’t great but the building/crafting is decent and the environments/lore is phenomenal. All in all, I can easily see myself putting 60+ hours into it, and trust me, I will probably hit that number pretty quick.",1708631270,1708631270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Critiques:
I've  had one crash so far, and the game has gotten choppy a few times on good fiber internet.  The UI is a little clunky, but I don't feel it is as bad as some people are making it out to be.  Some of the bugs and glitches are noticeable, with what feels like a half existent day/night cycle that flashes black and then starts up at midnight in the game.  The rain and hail mechanic is interesting the first time, but annoying when it seems to pop up every hour or so.  A few of the workbenches can be hard to click on occasionally.  Some of the mechanics are not entirely intuitive, and a number of items don't have real images currently in the inventory.

Positives:
The building system is really great.  Being able to blueprint out builds and then have a combined structure ingredient requirement that stores the ingredients in the build and lets you know how many you still need is pretty great.  While there is not an integrated base storage with workbenches and buildings, this is honestly a non-issue to me as the vast majority of the survival crafting games I have played in the past don't have a system like this.  The graphics themselves are really great, although character models are very stylized.  Combat feels fairly solid so far, although the dodge action you get with the hunting knife moves you just a bit too far.  Repairing equipment is incredibly simple, although right now there is a glitch where the essence you use to repair the items is not spent.

Overall, I would put the game at about a 7/10 ignoring minor bugs and glitches.  The game has a lot of potential though.  The game is currently online-only, but you are not forced to make your server public if you don't want to.  The game I would most closely compare this to is Valheim in terms of a lot of its mechanics, although it is first person.

The art direction is good, and being able to place blueprints for your house before building it is really nice to plan a build before committing. Realm cards giving players the freedom to choose a biome to go to and select modifiers (difficulty, creatures present, or even just never having night time) really opens up possibilities when exploring, especially since each new realm is randomly generated.

Crafting is pretty neat, with work stations getting buffs depending on what other work stations are near by. However, they can only get so many different buffs, so needing multiple work stations to craft everything will likely be necessary. Different materials will also grant different types of stat bonuses and resistances, which I feel could give players a lot of options when it comes to making their gear fit their play style or helping to beat a specific boss.

Combat, however, is pretty average. Third person animations are kind of jank (though the option for third person was added late, as the game was initially going to be first person only). The UI also needs a lot of work. They also have some serious bugs that need to be fixed (like people getting softlocked in the tutorial stages of the game and having to reroll a new character).

There's a lot of complaints about always needing an internet connection when playing solo as a single player, but that was advertised from the start. What was never mentioned I take issue with is that there's no pausing. Dogs want out? Kid needs something? Hope you're in a safe place, and won't be afk too long before you die. In this day and age, people shouldn't have to shut down their game simply because someone knocked at the door.

Nightingale might not be the next Valhiem or Subnautica, but if they do Early Access right, it could become like Grounded, and go on to be a solid survival game that offers players a unique experience.

If you enjoy survival/crafting games and don't mind going through the refinement process of EA, then I think it's worth getting now. If you want a completely refined, feature complete game, then you should probably hold off. 

     I've enjoyed my first 7 hrs in the game and feel like I am just getting going with what is on offer right now. The introduction to the game was slower than I'm used to, but I think that's because it is setting up a much larger narrative than most survival games have. Just in the last hour or so have I really felt like I'm starting to have an understanding of how the game as a whole functions (what am I supposed to be doing, where should I be going, what am I looking for?) Now that I have a better understanding of the realm mechanic along with other aspects of the game I'm starting to feel more oriented. I feel like the guidance the game gives is pretty good, it's just a lot to take in.

     There are definitely some rough edges in QoL/UI/certain systems (companions for example), but nothing egregious in my opinion. It is unfortunate that there is no offline mode as it seems like there is no reason that the game HAS to operate on a remote server. It's not a deal breaker for me, but I certainly think the devs ought to implement an offline mode for those playing alone.

     I've enjoyed the game so far and am hopeful for what the devs can do with the game so it's worth $30 for me. If you don't want to deal with EA refinement then it's probably better to wait until 1.0.

Absolutely no need for a survival crafting game to be online only. Once again we're all at the mercy of server stability and an inability to pause...  Fantastic

Why even have ""played solo or cooperatively"" or ""alone or with friends"" written anywhere, it's misleading to the point where I can only think it's intentional.

Edit: I'm not being entirely fair, I do enjoy the game (between the lag spikes in my solo world). Performance outside of server instability has been fine for me, better than Enshrouded. Portal mechanics are interesting and Estates are cool. Combat is simplistic but fine so far, but that may change. The stamina and hunger systems need adjustment, at least in the early game they feel far too limiting. All things considered, I'll probably flip this to positive if/when offline play is added.

The game looks great, and the concept for the worlds look cool. Building with the lighting makes for nice bases, although at my point there isn't much you can do to make your base too nice looking.

The combat is serviceable. attacks cost stamina which run out quickly. its kind of a walk backwards and swing game. AI is brain dead and they spawn the same zombieish characters at you. As you go deeper there are more enemy variety it doesn't require you to change your strat. Your gear either puts you way to strong and you just melee the shit out of stuff or your undergeared and get two shot. I just got to the point of the enchantments and its like minor buffs so far like 10% less damage or 10% stealth so can't speak to if this system is fun either. 

The Puzzles are pretty braindead as well, either combat shrines, or hit pylons in order. if they didnt call it a ""puzzle"" i'd be fine but its barely a puzzle, and its only challenging when its dark, there are 7 pylons behind destructible walls and you can't keep them all in your vision. You can skip them and just buy all the items so they really provide incentive to not do them.

There is alot of waiting as well. The game is always online, even single player. Opening a portal is a load, with a little fight that starts after 45 seconds, then you wait for another minute or two. Then you load as you literally load the map up which takes a few more minutes. The quests required us to go back to our base to upgrade or build something. You can either upgrade your base or give up 4-8 minutes every time you need to travel there and back. 

Procedural generation has its issues. There are points of interest with nothing there, areas where you can get stuck, and sometimes areas where like ceiling spawns too low  so statues are halfway through them. But the game makes up in graphics so if you like atmosphere this is a wash. 

Crafting is overwhelming, but not because you can make cool things like dwarf fortress. The game is a ""have items in your inventory, craft at table game"" but there are varietn of each item. Prey leather 1 is made from prey hide 1. gives a different perk than predator hide. There are a billion tables to make one item at a time, your inventory gets full, and items don't even have icons at times so when you are searching for whatever nameless widget you made theres no icon to tell either. 

Unfortunately this doesn't feel like a ""wait for an update kind of game to fix"". The core of the game is not good and won't be redone.

So if you're in the mood for a highly immersive true survival game set in a fantasy fae universe that actually has both first and third person perspective, you'd be scamming yourself by not trying out Nightingale.

[h2]Initial Observations[/h2]
Melee combat is actually quite satisfying in Nightingale because you can swing your weapon while moving to make for a much more agile experience.  Hitting enemies in melee can also knock them around a bit giving it a more impactful feeling.  In addition, if you are blocking, you can press the attack button while holding a block in order to shove an enemy.  This can sometimes knock them down making subsequent hits deal more damage.

The art of the cards is quite charming and a bit of a nice change from usual survival game UIs.

The ability to get significantly more essence from processed or crafted raw materials is a nice incentive to craft.  For example, 30 crude quality rocks can be turned into marble stones for more than 6x the essence of just extracting the crude rocks.

The fishing mini-game is probably the best I've seen in a while.  Essentially you just reel in and slowly deplete the fish's ""health bar"" and keep slack in the line by keeping the fishing rod tip pointed at the fish as it moves around.  Once caught the fish drops in range so you can just hold down the loot button to pick it up.

The ability to pretty much repair your gear at any time by using Essence Dust is a great feature.  Upgrading gear by simply applying the next tier of essence is also very nice instead of traditionally having to grind a new tier of raw materials to craft a new set of weapons/gear.

Perhaps there's a tool later in the game, but it's a little odd that you can't use a sickle to get a harvesting bonus on wild flowers and other plants that provide a consumable instead of just plant fibre.",1708452360,1708628850,True,46,2,0.59821707010269165,0,True,False,True

I think this game will be better to play in the coming months as they tweak and add features the community is asking for. The game is a grind, every turn, you looking at finding new materials to get to the next stage. It would certainly feel to have more purpose if there was more NPC engagement, the worlds feel otherwise empty so far. Just the odd, lonely NPCs randomly scattered throughout the realms. Id still recommend this game as it has so much promise and I hope that things to make the game play easier already exist and I just need to push to the next stage.

Puck is the only Character with emotion and that's only because he wears a mask, because everyone and I mean all NPCs have no movement head tracking or emotions except for the occasional blink...
NPC Traders, if you shop or read quests for a long time you automatically get a kicked of being AFK... lame in a solo online game...

 

Random disconnects also still happen, but there are only a few of them so it's not worth mentioning them. Now let's get to the elephant in the room

The world is beautiful and is littered with poi and things to do
but all you have to do is pretend you're not doing the same thing over and over again, just a little bit harder sometimes
Resources never respawn!! there are ways to make it happen, but most of what you cut or mine away is gone forever
although not the worst because it forces you to move more to find new resources, but it does leave a barren area after about 20-30 minutes of building a base because I can tell you that it takes a lot of materials to build a BASE and all your workbenches

and there we are building BASE. I haven't unlocked all the blocks yet, but I bet there aren't any Triangle foundations in the game. I do not understand. Does everyone just want to live in a square box all the time? look at ARK, Rust, Conan etc. so much better and so many more things to build and show your friends and get people to play your game just because of 1 single block and another awesome block not in the game, the half wall

its just a shame i had high hopes for this game and i hope they can turn it around 
cause it is one solid IP if they make it work but then again that is what early access is for

Update:  Servers seem a little more stable, now.  We are still at the mercy of the developers and when they decide to do maintenance etc. The game itself?  Still in very early access, or at least I hope it is.  Reminds me of Rust, but instead of wolves jumping out of rocks I have PIGS jumping out of rocks and attacking me.  The building is like 'The Forest' where you place part of a structure and fill it with materials to build.  If you place more than one item at a time then the game decides what part gets built first, it seems.  Traversing realms is a bit hit and miss on the actual time it takes to load.  Anything from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.(this is on a M.2 ssd).  The actual exploration and areas, what I've seen so far, are well designed.  Again, issues with clipping that hopefully will get fixed.  There are other small annoyances that you'd expect with an early access game, I just didn't expect it to be in such an early access state after other companies have decided to make early access games much more playable in recent times.

The game is a lot of fun, has a lot of refreshing improvements to the PvE Survival genre but needs some polish. That said, it has immense potential. They have laid enough foundation to build something truly incredible with how the systems are designed to be modular. There's too much to review for steam so here is my personal highlight.

[h3] Personal Highlight [/h3]
It has by far the best gear crafting system I've seen in the genre, allowing you to use dozens, if not hundreds of material permutations to tailor your gear. Want full elemental resistance, no problem. Want a set strictly for hauling loot, spec into stamina and weight and that's before you enchant it with the 3 different stacking methods and take into account crafting facility augments.

The idea itself is great (crafting and combining cards to get different realms with modifiers, ...) but the gameplay is far from being good in the current state (constant input delay when interacting with stuff, long loading times, weird hitboxes on enemies and objects, ...).
The UI is probably the worst I've seen in years. You can't even argue that it's made for controllers, because even with those it's total garbage. Every item constantly blinks whenever you open the menu, all tabs are always opened, interactable areas seem to be randomly placed in the menu, ...

That said, there are several things about the game that feel a bit clunky and could use some improvements. I've listed a few of them below, I look forward to Nightingale hopefully improving some of these.

Your first home will take several trips between gathering and building due to carrying weight limits. There is no deconstruction ability or moving option after building something, you have to smack it with something until it breaks. Not really a whole bunch of options with the building parts yet either, for example, no sloped roof, but I may just need to discover more blueprints. Second item bar has awkward key binds of 6-0.

  *Pros*
-Runs great with no lag or stutters

-Good graphics

- The Story is what gets you hooked , the farther in the quests you get the more you unlock with crafting.

-Playing with friends is easy.

- The Realm system is probably one of the coolest features in the game once you figure out everything. (objectives completed)

-The Character Puck who you meet early on is very cool.

-The base building and crafting is fun, some say its grindy, i would just say early on its a bit slower, but picks up real fast.

-there is no more network errors or memory leaks. they fixed that in under 24 hours.

-Cons

-I don't have a lot of cons, other then some minor bugs here and there ( some which have already been resolved), as expected in EA game.

The card system is nice and I can see the long term interest I could have playing this game. There are a few things we are accustomed to such as queued crafting that are not in the game. I suspect that is for balance reason and slowing down progress which I personally prefer. I really like the companion system, the lore scattered around. It was surprisingly easy to match up with my friends and return to the same world instances so far. We have travelled to the harder version of the forest and cranked up the difficulty to hard and I am personally please with the balanced challenge for gear durability and being ganged up by mob. Things look surprisingly easy in the first realm but prove to be an adequate challenge to gear level so far. One thing I really like is that they got the sense of exploration right. I want to go to other realms to find vendor, do stuff to acquire things and recipe. I find though that the prices may be too low for a game centered on grinding and killing things. Hopefully things balances out correctly. The water is well done with the waves during storms. I really hope we get more procedurally generated surprise realms with lots of beach and water.

~Crafting reminds me of Sons of the Forest somewhat, but crafting the next tier of item can be a slog with having to use higher tier items of what is essentially the same item(crude vs advanced). A universal storage for crafting to pull from could solve this, as many others have said.
-Always online, not a problem for me going in as I knew it would be but having to deal with lag when in combat singleplayer can be a death sentence and stinks. Not a deal breaker but be aware if going solo like I am.
+Game scenery looks great. I was honestly picking the spot for my base based on what cool vista I wanted(and there were many!
+Lot of bang for your buck. I'm just about to go into the second world after my starting base and I could have spent much more time on my original base(and will later). If you like getting the most out of your game for every dollar you spent, this is pretty good for 30 bucks.
-Dungeon bosses HP can be a spongey as a solo player, was a bit of a turn off. It's a small part of the game so far but be ready for it

Overall I'd recommend it and say to ignore the negative reviews based solely on the always online part. Yes it can stink, but it's also advertised as such and they have stated that they'll look into making available offline if the players want it.

The lags, the rubberbanding, connecting on a foreign server with High Ping, and if their server goes down for maintenance or any other reason you wont be able to play even solo.

On the other hand, I really like the game. The crafting mechanics where you can craft the same recipe but with different materials that have varying effects,  The realm mechanic where you can control some aspects of a procedurally generated world. You can adjust it to a way where enemies drop more materials but your max health and regeneration will be affected, adjust the difficulty so they can drop high tier loot. You can recruit NPCs to help you with building and gathering mats and even fighting, The art style in this game I love it, it has Dishonored vibes or those Arkane studio games.

But alas I really hope they remove that online only part or give us the the ability to host our own server like any other survival games out there. Or maybe even make it like a combination but wont affect gameplay like Monster Hunter World.

Final Verdict:
Wait for a year or maybe a few months til they sort their stuff out. Its a good game with technical issues.

I'm in NA so I have been fortunate not to run into any server related issues like other users... my issues with the game stem on a more mechanical level. GRANTED this is early access so my review can easily change with future updates.

The Good:
-One thing that stood out to me is the blueprint system. I LOVE being able to place down a layout for a house design without feeling required to have all the materials available at hand. However, this mechanic is a little tedious at times and I'll touch up on that later in the review.

-Even for early access, the environments are BEAUTIFUL! I was also surprisingly impressed by the weather effects... can honestly say that I don't think I've ever played a game with hail in it lol

The Bad:
-Touching up on the blueprint system. I think it's great that a system like this in place! However, WITH a system like this there NEEDS to be the option to use items from storage. Even for a small wooden build, I needed well over 300 wood based materials and having to run back to my chest to take out materials gets extremely tedious. Tbh, I think it needs to be an industry STANDARD at this point because there's nothing fun about running back and forward to snag items in need while on your home base and crafting. 

-The crafting system needs A TON of QoL changes. A lot of it could be helped by storage access while crafting, but most of it just seems intentional. You need several stations to craft one item and it took me roughly 10-15 mins to figure out how to make an address card for a friend. The game tells you exactly what you need, but I had to craft at least 4 stations to make said item. The whole process wasn't exactly... fun lol just tedious. 

-The combat is kinda... meh? I haven't felt challenged and I'm about 11 hours into the experience. Before I get into more detail with this, I'm not expecting some HIGH LEVEL combat to make even the sweaty gamers struggle, but I never feel in danger for a survival game. The only threat in the world... is literally my character lol. ANYWAY, maybe the difficulty was just scaled down for the first boss I fought, but it really just consisted with me running away, shooting the core, then start running again as soon as the boss moves. The boss was extremely limited on what it could actually do because it would just move a bit and shoot a frontal cone that is easily avoidable. Even when I ran out of ammo, I decided to melee the boss and the damage I took made me not bother doing the actual mechanic anymore. I just stood there holding left click until it died lol.

-Although the environment are BEAUTIFUL, the world feels dead. There's really no need to explore outside of material farming. It definitely could be an early access issue, but in my first world there were just boars and wolves with a handful of deer. Even the second world I went to, which btw... was another forest zone and that was a bit of a bummer since I picked the forest as my starting area lol just had deer but they were GREEN, wolves, and you guessed it... boars. I would love to see variety in these worlds, I want to feel encouraged to explore and rewarded. Most of the time it feels as though I'm punished for discovering something. I'd find a cool looking tower with spooky music only to find a blocked off door that's level restricted I assume. It really makes the game feel linear in a way since I can't do what I want when I want. 

-This one is on a more personal level... but the game does not have a toggle sprint option. There's autorun, but this feels WONKY, especially when you're running up hills. At first I thought, sure that makes sense since I'm GOING UP A HILL, but when I hold W instead of relying on autorun, my character moves faster. Having to hold down shift while running feels straining over time ESPECIALLY for a game that requires a ton of running. 

-While on the quick topic of movement and exploration, there's a cool little tool you can use to scale up mountains. It SOUNDS neat at first, but I don't think it fully works yet? I'm able to get it to function at times, but I'm having a hard time figuring out which surfaces it can stick to and when I do manage to attach myself to a surface, my stamina is instantly depleted. It's a bit disappointing since it was a new and unique way to scale up a mountain, but tbh, I'd rather just stick with other games where you just climb up a cliff like freaking Spider-Man LOL.

Anyway, this kind of turned into a mini rant but this is a game that I feel has A TON of potential. I love the aesthetic and I enjoy the fact that FOR A SURVIVAL GAME, I'm not starting off as your typical caveman. It's an interesting concept to play as a character that's used to city life and thrown into the wilderness and survive. A part of me wishes that the devs waited a bit longer to iron out quality of life changes before opening to early access. In a way, it feels as though they are setting themselves up for failure. I want to cheer for this game and I'd LOVE to see it succeed, but it has a lot of work cut out for it. I'll be keeping tabs on the game and it'll be a good test to see how the devs handle player feedback and also see how quickly they can act on it.",1708625552,1708625552,False,3,0,0.482149124145507813,0,True,False,True

People complaining about the game being online only clearly didn't pay any attention to the trailers. I don't understand where they are all getting this idea considering how the developers were talking about sharing home realms several times. Being online only was easily read between the lines in my opinion. Of course I do think that is something that should change, but seeing nearly every negative review being solely about that is silly.

In terms of the actual gameplay I think a few things needs some work.
Companions for sure. I'm constantly watching them teleport around to try and catch up to me. Their movements aren't smooth and having more control over how they act would be nice. I try to get a peaceful view of a lake and 2 seconds later my companion is chopping a tree which falls on my head...
Combat also needs some work as well. I struggle to follow the animations of enemies and figure out when they are actually making an attack or just flailing wildly. Along with the first boss just seeming like it had no animations at all.
Chopping down trees is also pretty strange. I've already seen several just phase through the ground once chopped and another where everything below the branches just disappeared but  the branches stayed floating.
At its core though I'm very much enjoying the game so far. I think its a very solid foundation and I look forward to where the devs take this.

Edit:
Having played for around 20 hours at this point I can say this game needs an incredible amount of work to be of any value. I'll start by saying online only really isn't an issue. I experienced no issues with the servers or connections and from having watched the trailers and listening to the Devs prior to this launch I already understood it was going to be online. Having offline singleplayer would be nice, but it wouldn't fix the issues with gameplay I've experienced.
To start combat needs an immense amount of work. The number of enemies in each encounter, the rooms that encounters happen in, and the actual combat system for the player I think all need major work. Having started out, made my tier 1 gear, followed instructions, upgraded it, and then gone exploring I was getting my ass handed to me simply due to the sheer number of enemies each encounter spawned. I'm essentially a lone person facing off against on average what was at the least 6 enemies sometimes going up to 12. Pair that with having extremely limited stamina and every single action in combat consuming stamina, I can't do anything but try to walk out of attacks and spam healing potions that I was lucky enough to find. To say the least, my experience with combat is extremely frustrating and that was even before I started finding combat rooms with traps in them. I understand the need for traps laid out through the puzzles in this game, but sticking them in combat rooms and having the traps not be triggered by enemies just makes it all the more frustrating. There's nothing creative to do with the traps and half of them are just a faint yellow glow on the ground that can be mistaken for reflections if your on top of a tower. Alongside all of that, your companion is just braindead useless. They will stand in one spot, not try to avoid anything, and just swing at the nearest thing. They clearly aren't constrained by the same stamina problems as you and their attacks can cleave while your own cannot yet they still somehow manage to be more of a hindrance than a help.
I dislike the split hotbar as well. Let me put all of my tools on the hotbar instead of only 5 of the 8 I need and let me use my scroll wheel to get to everything past 5. Its something that only limits what you can do for no reason that I can see.
Storage definitely needs some work as well. Either more space in chests or just some sort of automated system that you can get early on.
Progression is slow and tedious, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Maybe if expectations were a little clearer and well laid out that would help, but essentially after making your first set of gear and upgrading it you get absolutely no guidance. I managed to chance upon some tier 2 materials while exploring, but then using that I had to recraft the exact same armour and tools I had, upgrade them all again, only for a 5 or 6 point increase in power. Obviously I haven't made it far enough to tell whether those few points are big differences or not, but it certainly didn't feel like it when I went back to the same things and still struggled just as much as before.
The story is certainly interesting and Puck is a fantastic character/guide to pull you along. I had several instances where after a while of making little to no progress he would show up just to make fun of it. I can see where some people might find that irritating, but I loved it. The character and how the devs have portrayed him as a Fae are just splendid.
I encountered a fair few bugs as well, most of them based around chopping trees. They would either float, get caught on terrain, or just phase through the ground entirely. Had another instance of a hidden puzzle piece spawning halfway into the ground making it extra hidden.

Overall, I really want to like and enjoy the game, but when I'm playing it I feel frustrated more often than I'm having fun.",1708485106,1708624353,False,0,0,0.509999990463256836,0,True,False,True

First Person, OpenW (realm-based), exploration sandbox game with some survival mechanics.

This is nothing new, but they sprinkled a lot of interesting new little bits and bobs in it to distinguish it from other games. The graphics are up to par with other U4/U4 SCSGs, and the launch is not that bad for a gamedev of this size with overpromised features and a whole hypetrain behind it to crash any ambition to hustle all these day-one logins. Every hyped game has this, and everyone has failed, even huge companies. 

[h1]So, what's the issue? [/h1]

[h2]TL;DR[/h2]
The game has a decent story, a solid crafting base with some but not much upgrades and plays better than most early titles of this genre. Bad timing (Palworld/Enshrouded) leans heavily against the next-gen claims of this game. So it's as always: tell the devs (forums/discord/offical communications pipelines) what's wrong, and they may fix it. If they don't fix it, change your review and learn for the next time when you buy EA-Games from this company.

Heavily inspired by other SCSGs, this one has nothing new to bring to the table except a different flavor of fantasy setting and storytelling. It's fun; it scratches the itch for some new form of content in this genre without straying too far from the path. Imagine it as ice cream, while Ark is your sour-lemon sorbet that surprised you with a whole new world, while you were expecting vanilla ice cream. This sensation worn off with all this strawberry, apple, whatever sorbet-sellers trying to squeeze into this already tight marketspace and some of them thinking, well, e.g., ""pokemon""-styled sorbet will bring all the fans of other genres into this one (with more or less effect) or, let's make it, ""minecraft"" would make anyone care for that old ass flavor. Now this one comes also as sorbet but lets out one main mechanic (taming) and adds so effing much sprinkles and glitter that you would think this is something new, but soon realize it's the same thing again with less taste and more pizzazz. This game gets dull real soon without something to work to, so they added a goal to get to somewhere and to work toward getting ""stronger"" to make more of the thing you already needed to get to this point, artificially cutting of your progress by saying, ""You need more of this, but that you can only get if you leave behind everything and start the grind again with other colored resources!"" It's mediocre, but okay for the price, I guess.

[h3]System:[/h3]
The game runs fine if you play it on a halfway decent PC with modern DLSS capability and a wired connection over 5 mbit DSL. It's not Skyrim; I mean, why would it be? No one needs a FPARPG with a long-ass story and a crowded overworld, right? Right? But jokes aside, as always, expectation meets reality, bummer for every idiot that still thinks all the big titles from before 2010 were so much better and timeless classics as Skyrim haven't aged a bit and that no game before the great Addon-/Paid-content-/DLC-Cataclysm were perfect games with no patches needed, and you never needed to update your system, let alone your game, to play it on your potato-celeron inside clusterf'ck of a PC to get it to work: Welcome to the world of ""new games needing more space on your mini-ssd doesn't mean they must have more content: [b](UHD) Graphics > Sound-files > Rest (Shaders, Scripts, Frameworks[/b]""

[h3]Issues:[/h3]
Performance issues even with good setups (like every other SCSG), always online (shocking for a coop-focused amirite), less than average innovations for a saturated genre, and poor/unresponsive combat (like all others... No! Dodgerolls doesn't make it better, looking at you, Enshrouded), pisspoor reception because of too many prerenders and too little gameplay showing.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]
So why do I still recommend it? Because if this is what makes a game bad, prepare for the hell that is indie-mini/streamer-game/AAA-Cashgrab hell that's about to come. Indie/Short-Arcade games are fun, yes, but fundamentally flawed in that, in order to be unique, they need some massively good concept, and guess why most of the songs you hear consist of the same combination of tones and concepts of rhythm and flow? If you think this has nothing to do with each other, good for you. Just don't ask why there is no new cool, unique music (genre, concept, or idea) anymore and everything repeats itself after 5–10 years. 

That is all. Game's okay. Maybe it will get better; maybe nothing changes. Fundamentally playable experience with little to no innovation for SCSG enjoyers with fairy sprinkles and fancy clothes.",1708623357,1708623458,True,3,1,0.505882322788238525,0,True,False,True

The game seems to want you to have a very specific guided experience. Spent 2 days slogging through the 
 tutorial, and was finally able to open a portal, only to find there's more tutorials...

If you're into the crafting scheme in ARK/Rust/The Forest type games, you'll already be used to the menu/crafting hell this game uses. If you're into the smoother, intuitive crafting schemes in Valheim/Enshrouded, you will likely not like this game.

1. Long story based tutorial, killing your desire to explore the worlds.
Example: Farm the same 3 packs of wolves over and over until you have enough hide to craft the required armor to reach gear score 20, and advance the quest. It should take 3+ hours to engage with the main selling point of the game (cards and portals). The hand holding in this game is insane.

2. Buildings, and Crafting stations doesn't pull from chests, doesn't combine well with a limited inventory weight. 

3. The first boss, before you are allowed to craft cards to actually explore, just stands still, and sometimes AOE's..

4. Getting the umbrella makes you super excited to float along the long empty maps. Until you realize you forgot equip it in the offhand after jumping off a cliff. Double tapping ""SPACE"" to initiate the gliding mechanic is friggin STANDARD today, reaching over to the other side of your keyboard to manually equip your umbrella is what we did in the 90's.

5. Your companion sometimes chops down trees.. just...because..

6. Crafting stations only craft 1 set of things at a time, cannot queue several crafts.",1708623199,1708623199,False,2,0,0.471398711204528809,0,True,False,True

Pros:
Gorgeous scenery.  Different biomes to explore.  Many oddities on the world to check out.  There are chests with loot to find.  Captivating story line.   fun steampunk costumes.  Multiplayer.  Easy crafting along the lines of Sons of the forest, you plunk down the diagram then mass fill with the items needed.  Unique card system where you change the overall stats of the biome you are in, side effect it changes the color palette of the scenery which is nice.   Companion thrall that acts as extra inventory or fighter/gatherer (see below).   Outrageously detailed avatar creation (amt of veins in your eyes ?? lol there seems to be some sort of armor crafting with buffs implemented

Cons:
the gorgeous scenery after awhile pales, the interesting oddities just seem to procedurally generated becoming repetitive.   here a bathtub, there a statue, all seen before.   the lovely costumes are ridiculous out in the wilds.  Im chopping trees and hunting in full corset, stockings and top hat.  very out of place.   There is no way to hide gear to customize your  armor appearance outwardly.    Many QOL issues like the hotkeys for items you still need to hit another key to activate.   Jumping is practically nonexistent with a weird animation that you have to position correctly in order to climb.  Crafting menu is hard to get out of,requiring several clicks of keys in order to do.  combat is simplistic.  Companion cuts down trees or mines but doesnt gather.   they also do not do much combat.   There is no way to cordon off areas for them to work, so they will lay waste to your base trees, which do not regenerate .   Crafting stations are very tiny, ex.  a forge the size of a small suitcase.  it looks weird.


Im sure alot of these issues will be addressed later but I found myself bored.  Points of interest are just there,  with a chance for random mob encounter 'events'.    the constant irritations of lag for key inputs, low stamina, not being able to seamlessly climb or jump makes even just exploring a chore.  even using your companion as storage requires many key strokes to open his inventory, transfer items etc. 

When my game crashed  I realized i hadnt had much fun for the last few hours so just stopped. not sure if im going to log back on.  i might wait.  Its reasonably cheap so I still recommend the game, just dont expect an indepth  game.  its good for running around with friends and chilling out.

as for the always online aspect.    no one is mentioning the very intrusive data mining they make you agree to which requires always online in order to work.   did anyone even take the time to read the very detailed outlay of privacy consent that you have to agree to before playing?  they will capture all voice, all chat, and the usual location, game system blah blah blah.  the always online is where they are getting their funding by selling this information.  They have you agree that they can sell it to whomever even outside of regulatory agencies to china, singapore and other entities even if they go bankrupt or are acquired.  they supposedly have time limits that they will delete the voice and chat but really, do any of us believe that.  how easy would it be for a government to troll thru that data looking for certain keywords, gaining location areas of players with dissenting views.    please, take some time and do the requests for them to use your data only for personal storage, and the other rights that they say they will honor in the privacy agreement.   i have low hope they will honor them.",1708623097,1708623097,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is clear the devs have tried to make an incredibly deep game with deep mechanics / systems and that's cool and all, but with that comes a higher learning curve. Which is fine in general, but only really works if they nail how intuitive the UI and keybindings are for all of it.  Which is something IMO they have not gotten to that point yet. Worse, it's like they decided to toss out decades of experience and lessons learned from other games trying to find good UX for their games, for the sake of being different, or something. 

""Fresh and new"" for game itself - sure. But for keybindings? Tried and true is best practice. Which does not seem to be known to them at this time.

HONEST REVIEW:

The game does have potential, but i'm giving it a thumbs down for now. They should have done some private Alpha testing first to get feedback from lots of survival game enthusiasts. I The premise is great, the graphics are fantastic. Sound is top notch. But the delivery and core mechanics need a MAJOR overhaul and improvement on so many levels. I think it could be great if the developers listen to the community and work on improving the game in many areas. including but not limited to: 

1. Needs major QOL changes 
2. Inventory icons/management issues (currently it's extremely annoying and tedious, you'll spend most of your time trying to figure out what goes where, what is needed for this, etc. Honestly, it's more of a pretty inventory management sim at the moment.) 
3. HIGHLY needs inventory pull from boxes (currently you must have items in your inventory to craft which is a nightmare) 
4. Combat needs a overhaul. 
5. Portal seeds need to be more unique and be less repetitive.
6. Needs some sort of way to group with people as not everyone has friends to play with. So make a group finder when going into a new portal, have an option with a few minute timer that gives people of your skill level, etc. a chance to join you in your journey in a new realm. Have an option whereby you can select how many people you'd allow to join you. Maybe have a selector to let people know what you are seeking in the realm or trying to accomplish so if someone else needs something similar they would be more inclined to join you for an adventure in the new realm you are opening. People could make new friends this way and it would be unique to any survival game in the genre.  

Overall, you might have a little bit of fun here, but it currently is too grindy and repetitive to be a strong contender in the survival genre. I'm going to put it on the shelf and wait for the next big patch update and give it ago again then. 

 P.S. This was cool and the developers have some great ideas no doubt: I witnessed a walking TREE creature poop sticks! It was actually an entire pile of dirty slimy sticks. AND YES, don't judge me, as I then used them build a tent. That was my favorite part of the game so far! Pooping trees for the almost win.....",1708482470,1708621352,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I see a lot of ignorant reviews here that seem to underscore that the game does a very poor job of teaching you how its loop works in its first two hours.

I am having an absolute great time playing this with friends. After the day one patch, I've had very few FPS issues, the game looks beautiful on my 3080, and the worst bug I've experienced is DCing when returning to my home realm and my site of Respite unlinking.

I love the complexity of the crafting, the building mechanics, and feel the combat is better than your average survival game. You don't really get to see any of this in your first few hours, where you just have access to the most basic building pieces, crafting seems like every other survival game, and the enemies seem very cookie cutter. Once you get a few gear score in and start unlocking building pieces, spells, enhancements, and you get knocked off a Fae tower to your death by a 15 foot satyr swinging a cudgel that's bigger than you, things start to feel different.

Playing with friends is the way to go. The best way we've found is to all move into the same Abeyance realm. Just pick the one you like best. There are 3 of us, with more joining, and we've started to build a little neighborhood there. I find this more fun than just sharing one big base. It feels like we all prep and farm ourselves, then open up a portal and head through together to take on the challenges within.

You'll feel the progression. When you get to a new tier of portal, you'll be weak or about even with the challenges. You might step into a new forest realm and learn now there are purple bears that didn't exist on your last forest realm that will eat you like you're coated in honey and holding a sign that says ""Easy Prey"", but then you'll go around doing dungeons via fae portals and challenges that range in difficulty from easy to middling, get some essence, and buy new BPs from the trader. A quick trip home and you've suddenly jumped 10 gear score and you can crush anything you come across, only to learn the next Major card you've unlocked has jumped the challenge difficulty by 20 again. This feels good. A lot of games try to keep you constantly challenged, but I like the feeling of starting out challenged, outleveling those challenges to feel strong, and then moving on to the next one to feel challenged again.

There's a wordy story going on here that isn't voice acted. If you are a fan of story and worldbuilding, it is all there and you will have plenty to read and immerse yourself. That said, because of how it is presented, it makes it easy to ignore if you just aren't that type of player, and never insists itself upon you.

Play with friends, live on the same realm, farm and gear up, then go hunt essence together while playing with wacky minor cards to alter physics. It ends up being a ton of fun.

There are hallmarks of EA here, like placeholder art or some systems that seem unbalanced. But they are all minor hurdles. The bones of this game are strong ones. I'm having an experience I feel that is fleshed out enough that I want to see it through to the end. I can only imagine that in the future this game will be even more amazing once EA is done.

So if you are finding the starting experience a bit confusing or not sounding like the game I described above, just know that the game I am describing doesn't really get going until a few hours in. Some people may not be willing to give a game that much of a chance before they return it or write it off, which is totally understandable. The devs have to work on making it more obvious to the player how the game works without forcing them to read walls of text. 

But overall, this game is deep and fun.

I do see alot of negativity but almost all of it seems to be a lack of prior research into the game. For anyone reading this, i want to give a quick explanation on the basic mechanics and the pain points often mentioned, so:

 Always Online:
Every ""Realm"" is a server, every combination of cards is like a server code basically. So, yes, the game needs to be online even if your single player, I sure wouldnt want my PC running the 5 different servers im going between at my base currently lol I can understand that some people are bothered by it, but I have also had no server issues at all in my experience so far.

Crafting:
This isnt a ""Survival Lite"" game. It is not palworld or Enshrouded at all. This game is like an older style survival with many layers of in-depth crafting and building. For example, One Saw Table can have 5 or more modifying building pieces. These are usually a fun decoration to go with what its modifyng, like a saw horse or a saw stand and things. Building these gives new recipes for the saw stand. If the Saw Stand has lights you put up nearby, and a roof, it modifies the crafting time!  You also need to Realm-Travel for new recipes for the saw table, what wood you use on the table also changes the look of the outcome item, such as purple wood, or orange etc. Once you make a product, lets say its equippable, you then can make an augment for the product and also level up the product to increase its level. Augments have their own crafting station and there is tons of recipes to learn and make. These are like modifiers to increase damage, durability, weight, even playstyle on weapons and many other things. All of that to make one product your proud of on the Saw Table. Then, you can start going to even higher tier realms and find an even better table to do even more! So, with that small example, you see that there is a ton of depth to be had here that I have personally been looking for in a survival game for a while. 

The Exploring:
 It's fun and the environments are very pretty, there are dungeons to delve, Magical creatures to behold and even interact with, quests to follow, puzzles to solve, hidden caves to find, NPCs to aid and even recruit and bosses to find and defeat! As you get into higher tier realms, you start running into mobs with better ai and that are much more threatening than the grass hoppers trying to eat you in your desert starting realm. Mobs also take better damage from different damage types which can be a fun challenge when all you brought was a maul and this hippo could care less lol

Building:
The system I have also found quite enjoyable. It uses a blue-print system similar to Day-Z, so you can fully sketch out what you want to build first, and then you and your friends or even your NPC buddy can get the needed mats and just interact anywhere in the 3D blue-print. This will auto-take all those materials you carried and apply them. Rinse and Repeat and now your beautiful box, or family home, is complete :) You can find more detailed and better Tile-sets as you progress into harder realms. So yes, inverted roof pieces, pillars, railings, and triangle pieces exist for those builders who know the potential that means! There is also a farming system for my fellow players who get too caught up hand-watering 45 plots/flower pots and cooking things lol

Survival Jank:
 It is a survival game. If you have EVER played one, there is a special jank that they all have sometimes. Like your NPC follower will teleport to your roof for some alone time, or a boss yeeted you down a mountainside, or your NPC vanished when you dismissed him and you come home to him trying to harvest your decorative trees much to your horror, or a tree monster has opted into the new air travel program. Sometimes you travel to your home realms starting point instead of your assigned Respite. It happens, and honestly, the jank in this game is much much less obtrusive than other games in the genre that have been out for years now. 

The UI and Sorting:
It is a little different than other titles, which I like. We need more creativity and less copy-paste. It uses a folder system similar to current Ark's engram system when looking for blueprints, unfortunately, it defaults to some folders being open so it can get a little cluttered when trying to find the correct ""folder"". This is remedied by just using the search bar offered above the blueprints. The crafting table UI does have some quick buttons in the bottom, so I had no issue quickly making food or just quick inserting mats to make for a item I just needed in bulk. The quick buttons have a ""Fill All Slots"" and a button to make as many as you have mats for. You can take your time to put in higher quality or specific mats if you so choose for a higher quality or different looking item. The game does have a challenge system similar to Conan to follow for some simple goals but you do need to find it in the guidebook.The game wont tell you. For sorting, ive seen some pain-points about it but all chests have the ability to label them and when your in the chests inventory UI, or your own, you can change how you want to view the items as a sorting method. I.E ABC, Weight, Newest etc. 

The Tutorial:
 Its fine? Does it give you a good sense of the game? not really. It's a small lore intro to get you some context of the world and shows you the very basics of the game and as well as small bare-bones versions of 3 of the biomes. Magic was never really explained, nor how to use umbrellas, and the in depth crafting is up to the player to discover. This is very fine to me, but I see alot of people complaining about it. At least it even has a tutorial lol lots of Survival titles simply do not, especially in an early access launch. 

The Combat:
 Have you ever played Skyrim? pretty much that with a little extras. You can headshot, and heart shot for some extra interest, the knife has a built in dash/dodge, and guns can be pretty fun. The combat opens up once you get modifiers into your weapons. For example: An Augment can give you a dps boost after blocking, or the more you shoot with a gun on a crit spot, your dps stacks higher and higher, or your hammer now has a  big aoe ground slam. But the early game, its gonna be the ol classic, dodge left and hit enemy, rinse and repeat. Your early mobs have very simple ""jump at you angrily"" ai until you get into some of your dungeons and harder worlds. The mobs also don't seem to have a proximity spawn to the player, so you will encounter them just kind of appearing on top of you sometimes when they spawn in. For what this game wants to be, its pretty decent overall! If you really want a fun an in-depth combat focused Survival game, thats Conan Exiles. 

Followers:
 You can have one NPC that you recruit. They carry ALOT of supplies. They can be given different tasks determined by what you equip them with (this is very limited though, they are not that great at it) Pick=mine stuff as you travel, Axe= Harvest Wood, A Weapon=help me fight, and so on. They also put the mats from their inventory into a blue-print that you interact with. Thats about all. Their AI is pretty lackluster overall and they dont speak. They have a short tether range to you and will teleport to you when you are too far from each other. They don't always finish harvesting what they were working on either. If they go down in a fight, you can just help them up and they will help you when your down as well. Needs a bit of work still but im happy for the helping hand regardless and its a good start for the devs to build upon.

In Summary:
I'm enjoying my experience with the game, but the game style isnt for everyone and thats okay! The Survival genre has all kinds of games with their own specific focus.  I have already found the game worth the price and I haven't even gotten to Nightengale yet! haha

So sadly, I also have to downvote it to keep you from buying in at this moment, at the beginning of Early Access.

This game fell for what I'd like to call the ""the New World"" trap of game designing: Technically, there is a good looking game, you can do things in it like gathering, crafting, running around (lots of it)... but there is no substantial gameplay behind everything. It's only a grind to: Unlock the next gear type, unlock the next card type, unlock the next dungeon - all with ascending rarity rating (aka a different color and higher stats).

By itself, being grindy and gear/base upgrade simulator isn't a bad thing per se, but Nightingale also pairs it with other less than optimal features: There are no rewards for doing what you're doing, no satisfaction of having overcome something, no loot that makes you experience lucky moments - it's just moving from gear tier to gear tier. From one Essence drop location to the next. From (blueprint) vendor to vendor. And you got only one direction to go, there are no alternate solutions to things, you can not accidentally get lost in a high level zone, the primary enemy group is always the same... each Realm and the locations in it are very limited in size, you soon have seen everything already, and then it's just you on repeat.

On the technical side, everything runs perfectly for me. But for my friend, who I wanted to coop with, the game won't even load into the world. Seems there also is work to be done here.

Could Nightingale potentially become a really good survival game with one, two, three years more work put into it? Yeah, absolutely. But until then the dev team has a lot to do and it is questionable if they will continue doing so after a failed start.

I love survival games and can get sucked in for hours when the gameplay loop is promising. However, it's not without its issues. The game is still in early access, so maybe of these problems might be fixed eventually. If you're thinking about getting this game, a few things: [/h2]

This game is gonna make you crawl before you can run. The beginning is pretty slow. It eases you in to slowly learn all of the mechanics, but don't expect to look like a steampunk adventurer with fantastical equipment or firearms within the first several hours or so.

A minor complaint, but the UI is pretty clunky and took a little getting used to. The layout of elements such as button placement, tooltips as well as keyboard functions like splitting stacks could be improved. Certain inventories functions are also inconsistent. For example, you can split stacks in your main inventory, but you can't do so when removing fuel from a campfire or mortar back into your inventory.

This game currently can only be played with an internet connection. As someone who enjoys playing these types of games solo, this doesn't make much sense for me. Because the game is online only, Network disconnects happen more frequently than I would like them to. I loved the online-offline system Dark Souls had, so maybe if there was a more seamless integration with the online services that didn't feel as intrusive, I wouldn't mind. I've only experienced a network error once during my second gaming session with this game, so maybe the devs have been working on improving that aspect.

The BIGGEST frustration for me is that there are very glaring performance issues. This game gets SO CHOPPY at times. This happens sometimes when a group of enemies spawn in, there's a lot of enemies in the area, and EVERY time that there's heavy rain. The moment it rains like crazy, I can expect the game to drop to 15-20 fps. I'm playing on a 3080 TI, so even though my computer surpasses the minimum and recommended specs of the game, I'm getting insane performance drops. I've played games and mods that's had insane weather effects that hardly affected my computer, so very disappointed in this department.

These are all the biggest things that stood out to me. But this game is REALLY FUN. So far, if Inflexion is intent on fixing these issues, The game is very much worth the $27-$30 price point. A lot better than paying $60-70 for a soulless game.",1708618105,1708618105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's a little rough around the edges but i'm liking the different portal concepts and changing things with cards. It's a hardcore survival game meaning it's not going to hold your hand and simplify everything like Palworld did. It's meant to be grindy. You're not meant to unlock everything in a day. It has a complex crafting system which I like. Rain puts out camp fires so you have to build a roof. Objects in your house get boosts when placed near certain things like warmth and light. I'm liking the game so far. Having a blast playing with my wife. I don't get the negative reviews. The online thing doesn't bother me. Not having any network issues. Runs good most of the time. I'm assuming they are going to be adding things like seasonal and world evens to the mix which is why its online. One person said it was boring and outdated. i disagree. This survival game has a lot of new ideas that have never been tried before. The tutorial is long and it does take a few hours to get jump started but it picks up quickly and things get harder and harder as you go to more realms.It's a slow burn game but the grind is worth it.

Things that feel incomplete, awkward, and unfinished are to be expected. The point of Early Access is to find these weak points and fix them with the guidance of real players. However, I think most (if not all) gamers/players do expect a game to be in at least somewhat of a playable state at the Early Access phase.

So this review is based on exactly these points.

[olist]
[*]This game is 100% playable and in fact, enjoyable as long as you keep in mind that this is an unfinished game and you are helping to grow it into all that it can (and hopefully will) be.
[*]There are some things that feel very nice: the realm card system is unique and awesome, I love the theme, the building experience is fantastic, the world in beautiful.
[*] There are some things that need some work: the prey vs. predator meat/pelts makes item management a total mess, The UI/skill use is not intuitive at all and is uncomfortable at best. You cannot see the gear score & stats of a recipe until you have the required materials to make the item.
[/olist]

These are the main points off the top of my head for me thus far.

Overall, I'm very excited to be playing Nightingale. I will continue to play this game and cannot wait to see how this game continues to improve and develop over time.

One final note I'd like to comment on, however, is that I see a lot of people complaining that this is an online game. For me personally this was a HUGE selling point of the game as it affords my husband and I a means of playing together even when the other is not around. I get that this system might not be for everyone, but for me it was in fact something that I was extremely excited to see and fit my needs perfectly. Perhaps providing an offline world option for those who know they would never need this feature would be a great happy medium.

So don't take this as a review so much as initial impressions:
1. The environment is beautiful. Lots of thought went into the lore and writing and overall vibe of the game. It very much encourages you to look around and there is a definite sense of discovery which is nice
2. The character you play is a little wonky. It feels as those 2/3rd of the resources have been focused on lore and environment, with a fairly standard MMO character model and combat slotted into it after the fact

So my hopes here are that the early access is to refine the way players interact with this really great environment that's been created",1708615199,1708615199,True,0,0,0.498673737049102783,0,True,False,True

About 5 hours in, had a ton of issues w/ crashing yesterday after I got into my first big realm. They had a patch overnight, and I haven't had any crashes, but I did have some major visual bugs w/ DLSS frame gen on, so I turned it off and it's been pretty solid.

The game is nice looking, love the aesthetics of the game. In terms of the gameplay, tho, it's not great, especially for a 2024 game. Enshrouded's combat is way better - whereas the combat in this game is reminiscent of Minecraft, but slower. Also, the game doesn't do a great job of explaining certain things, and a lot of the menus could definitely use some added context / tooltips.

Seeing as it's still in early access, I'd say probably just wait until it's closer to full release unless you're really into Victorian / Fae-realm type shit and survival games. ",1708472759,1708615151,False,11,0,0.546799063682556152,0,True,False,True

So far during my game play I have spent much of my time wandering about what feels like aimlessly, exploring, gathering and killing creatures in my path.

[h3]For the elements of the game loop, here are my thoughts:[/h3]
[b]Combat:[/b] The combat isn't anything super great or glorious... but I don't actually think it detracts from the game any. Every enemy has a set of attacks it does, many seem to have exactly one set of behaviors. It appears the bigger they are, the more behaviors they end up getting. I've seen a tree thing that had at least two that I can recall, but quite possibly three. Many enemies, once you learn their behavior you can kill them quite simply. The guy with a big cleaver sword? Just keep rotating to his right, he swings towards his left. Where this falls apart is when they give you a second guy with two swords. Now you have to change up your plans. Simplistic AI? Absolutely. Any worse than most games I've played? Nope. WoW has this, RuneScape has this, MineCraft has this. Hell, even Valheim had this for where I'd place myself at in both games.

[b]Exploration:[/b] The procedural generation makes some really attractive worlds. I am not bothered by the structures that are canned and pre-generated. At 15 hours I haven't seen enough repeats to feel like its repetitive. There's definitely recurring themes and styles, but even in hand crafted games that seems to be true. I find the biggest beef here to actually be the inability to climb at where I'm at. You get climbing picks... but either I haven't figured out how they work or I don't have enough stamina to make them function well. I can't seem to get up cliffs I fall down and have to walk the long way around.

[b]Crafting:[/b] This is a can of worms. There's ""categories"" of materials, and each category has different materials in it. For example, with stone there is gneiss and sandstone. They both provide different stats to what you craft. That means at the end of the day the game will turn into a search for the exact right material to craft the exact piece of gear you want. Perhaps a speed crit damage build, perhaps a strength stamina build. Who knows. There's going to be a lot of options. I don't dislike this. I actually really like it. The gateway to getting the item you want is slim. The potential for it to have been better is incredibly high. But you have to put in the work to find what you need to get. And I think this is where a lot of people might burn out or be dissuaded... Because gathering was definitely tuned wrong.

[b]Gathering:[/b] I honestly feel like this is (at my point in the game) the biggest hassle. Each stone block weighs something like 1kg, you have a carrying capacity of 150kg. So you can carry 150 blocks. You need 87 to build some of these structures. Sounds reasonable right? Except you have 5 slots of equipment... Those weigh in at 2kg a piece. So there's 10. You carry food, so there's another few kg off. You then actually need another 4 pieces of equipment in your pack in case you find other resources (climbing picks, scythe, pickaxe, lumber axe, maul, crossbow/gun, hunting dagger). It almost feels designed to make you not have the piece of equipment you need to gather what you encounter. However, once I upgraded my pack, it immediately got MUCH better. It brought me from 50 carrying capacity or whatever up to that 150. Before 150 I felt intentionally crippled. This however... is going to be a core part of the game loop... Hopefully those packs continue to grow so I can satisfy my inner hoarder.

[b]Survival:[/b] not honestly super hard. You find plenty of food as long as you are paying attention. Food and potions can be brought in from your Abeyence realm (and carries over out of the realms) so you really should be good to go once you get started. There was plenty of potions as loot, plenty of animals to hunt. Oddly plenty of access to cooking stations. Once again, the biggest hassle is finding lumber to fuel the cooking station... Its everywhere, but you can only carry 12 logs...

[b]Gameplay loop:[/b] I haven't played Icarus, but I might draw some similarities there... Each realm feels like an extraction based mission to get resources out of it to return home. To get those resources you might need to make a small home, cooking fire, refining stations, crafting stations, bed. Depends on how fast, how thorough and how large the realm is. It is a little jarring at first, but honestly you can do some realms without ever dropping a single new structure in it for yourself. Those are my favorite realms. One realm I wasn't watching and night hit... That was a disaster as the house I was constructing for an NPC was getting raided the entire night by Bounded. I regretted not having a bed, I regretted not having a fairy ring. Many mistakes were made.

[b]Always online:[/b] I don't have any server side induced issues here. It seems odd given that it's a single player + co-op game... BUT, if you wanted to play the co-op aspect you had to be online anyways. They did say that private servers might be in the cards eventually once they get past their metric scraping phase to figure out what is working. Being able to drop in and out with my buddies will be valuable, because I prefer every game as multiplayer. If you want just the single player experience, it does suck... I'm actually most concerned about what this will do $ wise to the company. If the servers are expensive and they don't recoup costs.. good bye company?

[h3]Overall[/h3]:
I think its decently good game. But make sure you know what you are getting in to. This is NOT Enshrouded, this is NOT Valheim. I don't even think I'd place them in the same category. I enjoy this significantly more than Valheim, but I guarantee you that there will be plenty of people that hate it in comparison. The building is more Valheim than Enshrouded. Prefabbed components versus voxel building. The combat is pretty meh, but also doesn't seem to be where this game focused its efforts. I would definitely say that my game play loop has been more balanced around crafting/gathering/exploring than combat. I honestly feel more like I'm in RuneScape than the other survival games I've played. 1st person RuneScape with survival elements perhaps?",1708614930,1708614930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For an early access game, this is doing amazingly well.  The graphics are very good and have a more unique flavor.  The survival game/base builder content is there.  Plenty of crafting tables to unlock withing the first few hours of play.  The missions have been clear and simple.  To this point.  The realm cards are an interesting mechanic and provided added flavor to a realm when used.  My gear score in 2 days of play is at 42 and to unlock the next ""dungeon"" it needs to reach 60.  I have to travel to the desert herbrarium.  Although, I have 4 realms that I have not had time to visit bedsides the quest mission realm.  So there's lots more to discover.

Being almost 30 hours in I still feel like I just started the game, which means there's tons to discover and I've already received my money's worth from it.  For that I calculate one hour of game time = 1 dollar spent.  This looks very much like a game that hundreds of hours can be played.

In the time played I have upgraded or am in the middle of upgrading my gear.  Although, the upgrades are stats rather than visuals.  Using some of the more rare resources provides some slight differences, e.g. leopard spot boots with the same design.  I have yet to find tier 2 resources in any amount to be used, yet.  I expect some larger differences when that happens.  In addition, crafting table upgrades are just starting to be available which will add more and different things.

Enchantments and Infusions and Charms add other aspects to gear.  For example, one can cast a light spell after applying ""illumination"" to a piece of gear.  Others are buffs, helping staming, health, speed, etc.

Servers are still slow, but that's more than expected with a new release.  That will be fixed over time.

The lackey/recruit AI is a bit borked.  My follower doesn't sneak when I do and kept scaring off the deer I was hunting.  Whatever tool they have equipped will be used freely, resulting in many rocks, or trees being cut down.  Which is helpful...sometimes.  I usually keep my equipped with a knife still allowing an attack without attacking everything mob out there.  Plus their lack of carry weight is invaluable.  They seem to the same gear score as the player so I'm not sure if it's useful to kit them out or just upgrade their tools so they can keep harvesting/mining/foresting/etc..  As early access continues, I would like to see more options for the recruit, e.g. guard the house, harvest wood/mine/gather, even to specific items (berries, sticks, etc.).  Also, the lackey needs to learn manners in regard to personal space, and learn to not stand in fires.

The quests up to this point have been easy to understand, even if not always easy to complete, but the challenge level has been decent.

The starting storage is rough, but the upgrade storage has been nice.  Although, I would like to be able to stack the storage chests to save some floor space.  Crafting using items from the storage chests is janky; sometimes it seems to pull things in, sometimes not.  I believe it was items that I had in both inventory and storage that it counted them all.  While items not in inventory, were not brought in.  Hopefully, this will change.

Stamina is a bit on the rough side even after adding buffs to gear to improve it, but I assume it will improve.  However, the best stamina system I have seen is one in which stamina is not counted outside of combat, allowing the player to traverse the map faster until combat is entered, including being chased.  This would be my #1 improvement to the game, but that's just my opinion, which means little to anyone but me.

Overall, I would recommend Nightingale at this point and look forward to discovering what lies ahead.

I've changed this from a thumbs down to thumbs up, still has issues but it grows on you.

This games unique has unique setting for a game with this Steam Punk/Victorian Era/Fantasy setting is great visually and gives it something to stick out from the crowd of other survival games and draws you in with possibility once you understand the flow.

I will be putting what I like and don't like all in the same areas as there are good and bad with everything and want to be constructive and on destructive on my thoughts.

SETTING:
 like I said this game has some gorgeous views and unique visuals that have left me overlooking cliffs and even ocean sides at how pretty the worlds can be and when minor cards (realm altering effects) are played further change color pallets and effects on the current realm adding an even more in depth visual unlike any other games let alone other survival games.

CRAFTING:
On here is GREAT but also VERY CONFUSING at first. You do as you would on other survival games and go into collection mode but this game has 2-3 versions of the same item and these different but same versions have different effects on your player stats based on which one you decide to use. You kill a boar and get hide in game its called Hide (from prey) and gives health, stamina regen upgrade but if you kill a wolf you also get hide but (from predator) and this hide gives health, and health regen upgrades. Example Using boar hide in your crafted armor will give you stamina regen or you can use the predator and get health regen, and this is only 1 of the items needed to craft armor and most have 2 to 3 things needed to craft the armor but there are different types of these separate items and they too all have there own buffs. I love this system after getting used to finding the best version of whatever material I can get my hands on that best suits my personal build. BUT this was and even still can be confusing hours in.

BUILDING:
The building aspect is very good on here it allows you to pre-plan your house and other buildings to completion and then gives you the final tally of what you need to build it and is as easy as walking up with your inventory and at a click of a button add everything to it and watch it fill in as it gets completed and even with add ons you can just click anywhere on the building even completed spots and add to the new expansions hassle free. This however does come with a few short falls as you may think of something out of the box and the buildings snap points limit what you can put where sometimes. In my case I have an ouside stair case but the lip is just a little higher off the ground so I have to jump to get on to the staircase I try to add another that will go under ground to stop me from having to jump but it wont snap forcing  me to have to jump to get into my house.

ENEMIES:
While there are several enemies that you would find in other survival games like wolfs, boars, fish and humanoids this game also has many other fae creatures that not only look unique but even interact with the environment and even you differently and they come in all shapes and sizes this was very fun looking at a new creature and trying to see if it was hostile or even if I could maybe utilize it in some way wither it be from its resources or sometimes when some of the giant creatures walk around destroying the environment I could collect the resources left behind in the wake and get some stuff that would need me to have better gear to collect allowing for some extra growth in my current gear based on the advanced crafting system.

REALM CARDS:
 These are ABSOLUTELY one of the best things about this game and are really not a huge talking point even in the marketing it kind of gets over simplified or not really expanded on. Every world you go to is randomly generated based 2 cards (at first). At the portal you are able to use 2 cards, one will be the type of environment you want these are (currently) 3 of these in the game a Forest, Desert, Swamp. Then you add a 2nd card and these cards alter the biome even further increasing difficulty slight but allowing you to farm better and stronger materials and blueprints that can then but used to upgrade and keep the progression going. Finally when you do get into a new realm you can find a place to use a 3rd Card that radically change the world both visually and even how the realm works and operates and these are great to play around with. These minor cards can be found while looting or even crafted after learning the recipes along with the other Biome, and Major cards and these minor cards can have world changing events like making it eternally night time and enemies are harder but drop better and more loot and the combination of all these sytems can truly lead to some breathtaking sights as they change the look of the world itself and even exciting battles and resources that otherwise wouldn't happen. The negative is that they need crafting and I think they could just do away with the crafting of the cards and just have them ready to use when you need to (or want to) use them. Just have them sell at the merchant in the realm or finding them in chests and unlocking them that way.

Performance:
This will be one of the most critical parts, I have a 12900k CPU that on a water block and OC with a 3080 that also has a slight overclock with 32Gb of Ram running at 3200MHz of a M.2 NVMe and I only play at 1080p as I like high frame rates over pretty visuals but the 3080 should easily give me ultra settings at high frames. So a pretty beefy computer even by today standards and significantly above just regular spec... 

The game defaults to Ultra everything, no surprise BUT what did surprise me is that the game is only playing at about 65FPS and 60FPS is my MINIMUM frame rate if it dips and stays under 60 I no longer care its unacceptable my almost $3000 setup is dipping below BUT even further surprising is that the game uses up scaling (DLSS, Intel ARC, and basically AMDs FSR but they dont call it that) and cant be turned off which mean this game is struggling to keep above 60FPS even with upscaling. This is unacceptable the upscalling technology is no longer being utilized for struggling older hardware, but is now being used in unoptimized games to bridge performance and again this is unacceptable. Upscaling also comes with some nasty elements as well hurting the overall experience of the game shadows from grass and trees ""dance"" when being reconsturcted and make the game look ""pixelated"" both standing still and moving around and is worse in the latter.

I then find a good post on optimized settings and tune my settings in and see a jump to around 105FPS while the game still looks great but over the next hour I notice I go from 105PFS back down to sub 60FPS this is constant and happens in every play session and requires a restart to bring the FPS back up. I can only guess at what the issues are my guess is the NPC (animals include) destroy the environment the the resources don't despawn eventually having performance issues? Or maybe the textures don't properly offload and slowly collect until again performance issues get worse. IDK these are just guesses but performance is a real issue this game will need to get fixes ASAP.

LEFT OVERS:
I want chests to be pulled from when they are close enough to whatever crafting station/s I'm using.

Cards need infinite uses and should be bought off NPCs or found in chests and then unlocked for infinate uses. (at least the MAJOR cards) minor cards maybe can still be crafted.

Followers need to be retooled as they are nice but VERY annoying. they need the ability to swap tools but also I want the ability to tell them to harvest or not. They have zero issue using tools but then wont really collect the resources making me do it annoyingly.

Then NIGHTINGALE is for you!

Just take STARFIELDS procedural generated planets, but boil out almost all of the storyline, quests and NPCs and add in NO MANS SKY colour palette (actually that's a plus), serve it on a plate of mixed Fae and Steampunk infused foam. This delightfully repetitive series of POI are sure to please the most unimaginative of you with the joy of seeing the same randomly placed structures dozens of times. But joy of joys, we made it so that most of these POI are very tiny often consisting of nothing more than a few random objects stuck together. So no need to worry about any indepth explorations.

This delight will be followed by an insipid building system of only the most basic building pieces in the genre that also uses the essences of ENSROUDED/VALHEIMS/PALWORLD system of making pretty much the entire base content around just building a collection of workstations in order to build better workstations and equipment. Don't worry about decorating as the options are very very limited.

Also I hope you love loading screens because every time you want/need to shift realms prepare for a short wait while our server hamsters powerup your shard.  We will also be serving a complimentary soup of non respawning resources, but never fear just in case you thought we were doing this for immersive reasons all the creatures in the world respawn as soon as you are out of sight of them. The weeds may not regrow but that pack of wolves certainly will!

Finally enjoy our always ONLINE service with all the pleasures of downtimes, dropouts and the tantalising promise of future Micro transactions* and perhaps even a devilish little Battlepass*

You might think the game is just plain bad based on that stellar introductory paragraph, but it isn't a total mess. The dry tutorial definitely doesn't help capture new players, and many will stumble getting past that when its accompanied by rough melee combat, a crosshair that doesn't feel like it aligns with the character placement, and a crafting system that provides multiple menus and barriers with very little satisfying feedback to the creation of things.

That is a key component that's been overlooked in the design of this aesthetically gorgeous veil draped over shallow bones - feedback. Combat doesn't feel too weighty, mob ai would be bad by 2005's standards, and the crafting system just feels very distant from the character. You don't really feel a presence in this gorgeous world, and that's a shame.

I barely scraped past the tutorial, and perhaps there is more further down the road, but when the road is nothing more than a pretty facade of buildings held up by wooden poles and a clearly visible wind machine blowing plastic leaves in your face, you're not likely to want to walk much further down it.

I hope this is a redemption story like No Man's Sky, and maybe the devs will truly pull this out of the mire during its EA period, but it feels like this might just be a cautionary tale for other upcoming survival craft games - players want more than a pretty veneer over archaic systems, they want innovation, fun, and connection to the game world.

Tho I just started playing it yesterday when it released and only experienced a small part of the content, I still had a gut feeling that this’s gonna be a good game. It has so much potentials. With some further optimization it may actually live up the potentials and becomes a greaaaaat game : ) Still, there’re some flaws or inconveniences from my perspective. The beginner’s guide for example is kind of … well it sucks. The tutorial itself wasn’t clear enough about what this game’s about and u need to figure out how to survive on ur own. ( well… sort of) Not to mention that the tutorial was divided into three maps where the guide can be just included in one. This increased players’ time spent in just a beginner guide and cant fully enjoy the real game features as quickly as they want. Well, at least 4 me lol. (I thought tutorial is an important part for a game, the first glance, the intro or sth like that. anyway u know what I mean lol) I was hoping the tutorial can be more precise and straightforward. The character creation is of high freedom tho some features r still being developed. But it’s way complicated! What’s the point of choosing ur family tree if no actual use is made lol. And there’s the server problem lol. The good thing is, I saw they r having server maintainence timely so guess this wont be a problem <3 <3 Thx 4 the quick response <3 Highly appreciated. Yet, it’s still early to judge a game at early access. Those tiny flaws r not fatal and surely the game will keep evolving from EA version. (Sure yeahhhh!) The imaginary sceneries it created and the immersive OST combined together to bring me into a world full of wonder.

Game looks good, runs decently well, has a good building system and an original setting.

However I'm 5 hours in (have not come close to dying despite being on the hardest settings btw) and it's just not very fun to play. Just utterly boring. I have no incentive to play because the story is not compelling, the characters aren't interesting and just lore dump you constantly. Combat is acceptable but not challenging at all. The game is padded with dozens of worktables and random objects to craft and craft with just like every other survival game. It simply fails to be anything unique. Those things would be understandable if the game was in anyway challenging as A SURVIVAL GAME but it's not. You just pick stuff up and use a valheim style food system. It's a Steampunk/Victorian paint job on generic, easy, badly launched, early access survival game #76544842

Just because you have a hunger bar and a billion crafting stations doesn't mean you're a GOOD survival game. You're the minimum entry requirements for the genre.

I really like a lot of the aspects to the game. However, there are too many flat out bad elements for me to recommend. I only played around 2 hours before I decided to refund but, in that time...
The Good:
- Pretty to look at.
- The building styles look great!
- I like the portal system.
- Character creation shows a lot of promise.
The Bad:
- Always online (and has had server problems)
- It doesn't run as well as it should. My PC is very high end, and had several points where the game gets choppy, but it's not a huge deal.
-  Enemy AI is non-existent, just run in a circle and move out of AoE zones and you'll be fine.
- The introduction to the game doesn't do a good service. The tutorial feels very rushed and thrown together - ""Build a tent, build a bed, Great....now leave the zone"". When there are so many Early access games in this genre to choose from, you really have to put your best foot forward, to avoid refunds.

Overall, I don't think the game itself is terrible. However, I think the Devs have shot themselves in the foot by releasing it this early. A few years ago, the response may have been different, but there have been so many Early access survival games released in recent months that are much more fleshed out. I like the gimic for this, so I hope that this manages to improve greatly, as I do see the potential, but I'd recommend that everyone holds off for now!

3 different main biomes to ""discover"" and the game just goes and spoil them right in the tutorial. Some mobs display weird behavior that makes you curious for a second but that curiosity quickly goes away thanks to ""make a fire"", ""build a tent"" quests that eventually make you abandon these.
Food/rest bars go down fairly quickly to a point where you can't even swing an axe in the face of an attacking enemy - making preparing food a chore and you eventually end up just carrying a stack of cooked meat on yourself. it's not to say I'd have a better idea on how to implement hunger mechanics in the game.

Needs polish with animations and more content like biome and enemy types. Companions are wooden and mostly useless. NPCs except the one story Fae have no voice acting and minimal animations. Concept and story is really cool - finally an open world fantasy survival game that doesn't involve Zombies. it looks nice running on a laptop 4080 with max settings, though there is a downgrade if internet connection isn't perfect. By far the absolute worst aspect is the requirement to be always online - obviously was not intended as a single player game, which is a dumb choice for an open world survival craft game. Really hope they rethink some design choices by the end of EA.

*Would recommend with the caveat that it's only $30 which is a decent value as is, and will be a great value if they make smart decisions and additions throughout EA.

Is this a perfect game at this current stage? absolutely not, is the potential there for this to become something that really scratches that survival itch that I've been looking for, yes absolutely. 

The environment and the lore are compelling the graphics are excellent and all the key survival metrics are there. There's almost certainly room for improvement in quality of life but for an EA title there's lots of content to be getting on with.

I love the flexibility the portal system offers us and the different variations that are possible at the EA stage, i can't wait to see what biomes we get in the future and the thrill of exploration is all there. 

The modular nature of the fae ruins the game offers us really shows a lot of promise and you can see the devs have given themselves a lot of leg room in ensuring they can really diversify and expand on these in the future to give us even more interesting content. 

After playing with a friend I'm really looking forward to exploring together and experiencing the challenges/dungeons that Nightingale offers.

I like that the game doesn't hold my hand (that does come with some slight caveats, see below).

While i understand the common complaint around the ""always online"" aspect of the game, this really doesn't bother me personally. 

My main gripes so far are:

Storage doesn't link up to crafting, so you need to pull items out of storage and into your inventory to craft.

Upgrading buildings, having to demolish then rebuild your base is tedious, just give us the ability to upgrade existing structures with new materials/patterns.

Follower AI is frustrating and followers in general at the moment are lifeless automatons for carrying stuff and soaking up enemy blows. Also issuing them orders and telling them NOT to use my stored lumber for 

The UI could do with some significant quality of life upgrades as it's not entirely clear or easy to understand certain aspects of it (for example completing challenges rewards you with essences? who knew!?)

In general the enchantment, charm, infusion system isn't very well explained so i had to figure a lot of this out via trial and error. 

We are aware of different factions but they feel like placeholders at the moment, i'd hope for the future the devs are looking to expand this area significantly, with faction specific rewards etc to give us a reason to care about/interact with these different groups. 

A lack of voice acting, a minor gripe i know but it would just help breathe some life into the different realmwalkers/factions you meet.

Inventory management could be significantly improved, there has to be a better way of categorising resources so that different variations of the same type don't take up valuable storage slots.

Spicing up the enemy models also wouldn't go a miss.

All in these are minor gripes and I'm loving the time i'm spending in Nightingale, i cannot wait to see how this game develops over EA and i would absolutely recommend purchasing especially at its current price point.

The AI is atrocious and you can tell that the studio lacked somebody that knows what they are doing and ended up with enemies that run at you stop, swing, repeat. The animations are very crude. Doors literally have to static states open/closed and dont actually even have an animation for opening. (Yea I know seems weird to call out but it's just an easy example of where they cut corners.) Same issue for trees being cut down and you get this cheesy and low effort animations for something that you will spend a good amount of time doing.

You really can't form an opinion about such a lengthy, grindy survival game in only 2 hours of the refund window. The extensive ""tutorial"" segment, while lengthy, failed to impart meaningful knowledge or enhance the gaming experience in my opinion. To address this, I believe the developers should consider offering a condensed demo featuring a couple of biomes and select late-game blueprints. Such a demo would provide prospective players with a more accurate impression before committing to supporting the title's development.

One crucial aspect missing from the release is a basic roadmap outlining the vision for the finished product. Without it players are left in the dark regarding the game's future direction. The decision to adopt an online-only feature raises concerns, especially regarding the potential for the game to transition into a live service cash shop model. Transparency regarding the developers' intentions is paramount, particularly for those hesitant to invest their hard-earned money into what could become a financial sinkhole.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, several features appear heavily underdeveloped or poorly explained. For instance, the character creator offers the option to construct a family tree, yet its purpose remains unclear within the context of the game. Similarly, the mechanics surrounding portals lack sufficient detail. Are these portals gateways to randomly generated worlds, and can players revisit previously explored realms? Such questions linger unanswered, contributing to a sense of ambiguity and confusion.

Visually, the game boasts a commendable art style, although certain aspects, such as character models and armor textures, leave room for improvement. While the world itself is aesthetically pleasing, thanks in part to the environmental tools provided by it's engine, inconsistencies in armor textures detract from the overall visual experience. The initial armor set, in particular, appears lackluster, and the slow progression exacerbates the issue. It's disheartening to begin the game adorned in elegant Victorian attire, only to be swiftly relegated to less appealing garb of dubious protective value. Furthermore, it also seems pointless to choose your background and starting difficulty, since the items provided for the start seem equally useless. 

Furthermore, the AI implementation falls short, evident in both companion behavior and enemy interactions. Given these shortcomings, I would caution prospective buyers to exercise patience and await further development. The considerable hype surrounding the game's launch seems premature in retrospect, underscoring the importance of tempered expectations when evaluating early access titles.

In conclusion, while this early development survival game shows promise, significant refinements are needed to realize its full potential. Transparency regarding the game's future direction, improved tutorial elements, and refined gameplay mechanics are essential areas for the developers to address moving forward. Until then, prospective players would be wise to approach with caution and temper their expectations accordingly.",1708607654,1708607654,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

People have probably forgotten what ""early access game"" means and seem to expect a fully developed game in a perfectly playable state.

During my current playtime of 7 hours I had no issues whatsoever, neither crashes nor bugs.

[h3]Some of my personal pros:[/h3]

The GUI is pleasing to look at.

I play the game with balanced graphics settings and it still looks good. There are many breathtaking vistas throughout the game world.

The background music is excellent and paired with the mystic, ancient style of the environments it creates really satisfyingly weird scenes and moods.

The building system has some nice advantages compared to the ones in similar base building games, i.e. added materials are spread across all unfinished structures that are connected.

[h3]Issues I have encountered:[/h3]

Weird in-your-face alpha walls in places that shouldn't require them. I guess sometimes the procedural placement goes wild?

I understand that it is early access, but when the game has major obvious issues that developer should fix without players feedback than it is better to not be for sale at all. We have seen couple of great EA, and this is definitelly not one of them.

Many thing has been said here, so just in nutshell:

+ very good and original art and graphics
+ interesting card system (still very limited, but that I can accept in EA)
+ Pucks voiceover
- Game doesnt deliver trailer promises
- lacks of fun, quests all the same, seems very repetitive and empty
- NPC and enemy AI 
- movement of all living is a joke 
- overal handling far from polished
- apart from card system nothing really original
- lot of soft bugs, lack of detailed animation (again acceptable)

Verdict: This game was not ready for early access and is a disapointment at the moment. It was suppose to be a original one, but simply it is not, we have seen most of it already only in different coat.. I am looking forward to see it develop further and rooting for it. 

I will play couple of more hours to prove myself wrong, but I am sceptical big time. I rather wait for full realease and recommend other to do the same.

Remember that when you read the reviews.. this is Early Access still. 

If this is your first survival crafter, the learning curve is steep. 
If you've no idea about any fae lore, of any kind, you might miss just how terrifying Puk really is. (Seriously,.. just... Seriously!)

The game is beautiful and surreal and the explanation of the cards, the fact that even experienced realmwalkers don't exactly know for sure how everything works exactly, the story of the downfall of man and how it relates to your desperate attempt to flee for your life, all of this is well thought out and well delivered. 
The Lore Is Good. 

The UI is not the smoothest, figuring out how to do things may take a few moments, but it's not insurmountable. 
There are a few things that are severely lacking in information, such as which infusions work on which objects, etc, but I'm hoping this'll get addressed. 

Combat issues exist as well, with your aim being difficult to gauge meaning that at least early on you'll end up just flailing your axe in the general direction of the target. 

Stamina management is important and I actually appreciate how stamina drain on things we often take for granted is Costly. 

The lack of fast travel may be rough if you've grown overly accustomed to it, but to be able to just skip and hop your way through worlds feels a little immersion break-y for the setting. 

This isn't gonna be for everyone, that's for sure, and there are issues that will need to be fixed for it to really live up to it's potential. 
For the duration of early access the game requires internet connectivity, even when playing solo, but as far as I understand that's not the plan for the full release. 

Also, while the character models come in two main body shapes, you're free to mix and match shapes, faces, colours, voices etc, meaning it's not as heavily gendered as many games, which might explain some of the negative reviews... you know the ones. 

So far, the game is beautiful and fun and we're having a good time exploring the surreal environments looking for trinkets and awaiting the moment Puk deigns to come tell us again how very heavily we've apparently accidentally made a deal with a terrifyingly powerful fae. 
I do not trust him.

in short: go and get the game, but in a year.. or two :)


Pro:
- I love the card crafting idea that you are able to modify worlds and that you can build your own portal hub to connect everything, the idea is just so different from all the others
- I like the complex crafting system. Yes it is complex but it is a crafting game, ofc there is crafting
- the game looks beautiful and the setting is just so different from others - in a good way. Many games in this genre are free or almost free of NPCs and you are the only living human in there. This world feels much more alive. You find people all over the world(s) which makes the setting more reliable
- server structure in multiplayer is a great idea. Yes if you play in single player, it is annoying that you must be online and can experience lags but if you play in multiplayer you get your own server which is online by default so that your team mates are able to play when you are offline. Other games need a dedicated server which you have to pay for for this feature and here it's just a part of it - I really like that feature

Con:
- char movement: in general feels like you are a heavy bean sack. The char even stops while running when there is a tiny log on the ground and in worst case, you get a climbing animation on a tiny stairs step like stone on a path. Climbing and jumping is a pain and results in spaming your space bar, hoping to make it somehow. If you see a trap on the ground, you may be able to jump over it... well or not. It just doesn't feel natural at all but heavy and clanky.
- crafting system: you almost (yes there is a handbook) get no guidance on how to craft or build something. Additionally you get no info about the building system or building menus. I had to check on their discord server that you are able to move items (press X and you are in the menu btw). This again feels clanky and not natural, for example items like wall lights have one spot in which they fit and you cannot move it on the wall. Plus we didn't figure out yet why there are walls missing when we return to our base... it is weird
- item icons! There are so many icons missing and replaced with the same placeholder icon, even in early game. It is so annoying that you must hover over all those placeholder items to find the item you need for crafting and it is not just items, it is crafting stations too, which makes the already complex crafting system even more complex, in a bad way
- handling items needs work as well. You can't split stacks in your inventory. That combined with a backpack-weight-system is annoying because if your inventory is overweight and you are outside exploring, you have to decide which full stack of items to get rid of.

Neutral (for me a con but this is a personal pref):
- puzzles are boring and all the same. There are puzzle cores which either initiate a fight or you got to touch several things in a specific order and there are some you just need to reach while climbing/ jumping which is ok but it is just nothing new after you did it like 10 times. 
- it is _not_ open world. You must have a specific gear score to enter areas in which you unlock new cards for new and or harder worlds to progress. This is bound to a story line and your gear. If you don't have the needed gear score, you just can't enter the building. You have to grind every time before you are allowed to progress which is fine but it should be my decision when I want to grind... like learning by how painful and strong the new enemies are
- fights are boring, you have an attack and a block and that's it. If you use a knife, there is a weird jump as well which is unpredictable and therefore more dangerous than the thing you are fighting. Due to the bean sack movement, it just feels heavy",1708605253,1708605448,False,3,0,0.512173950672149658,0,True,False,True

I see a lot of complaining about the game always being online, I feel these review are barking at the moon. Let me explain why with me trying to keep spoilers to a min.

When you first complete the tutorial you end up in a realm that is meant and only for you. So being always online is only an issue unless you make it an issue. For example, when you do go to traverse other realms, you are met with options either too remain in a private realm or a public realm. I feel folks have been going into public realms without realising it, so take it from me if you want to remain solo, look in the bottom left corner for options, I recommend using them. Your making an issue out of something that is not really an issue unless you choose to make it an issue by inviting friends on steam. Alright that is it from me, Rant over.

Onto the lore.
Being a person from one of the celtic countries who got some understanding of Celtic folklore, I'm really enjoy the mixing of steam punk with the mixing the Fae and creatures of Celtic folklore. Iiked seeing the spirit animal of the large Elf like beast travel the forest and even made himself a guest for a time. 

The graphics give me a certain Bioshock feel and I'm here for it. 

The survival elements, the real thing that impressed me is the weather element. Whilst I was building the estate, A storm rolled in with thunder and lightning also hailstones which caused damage unless I found a way to mitigate the environment.

The AI companion, I hope we can get a variation of companions in the future. The companion can do silly things but that be AI for you. I like that your not handcuffed to the estate when your AI is giving you a hand, this worked in Sons of the forest and recently Palworld.

There are a few features like area loot and item lookup that are not explained at all when they should have been but again it seems more like an early access hiccup than a game problem.
 The systems so far have been pretty complicated witch makes me very happy. Those same systems may be too grindy for some but I find it quite satisfying to sort out what I need and where to get it and then do the next step and so on.
 I agree that the game in its current state lacks variety and that crafting, especially of armors and weapons needs work, but I dont feel like whats being offered is bad for a game that just released to Early Access a week ago. The content at the moment is serviceable and it should not be hard to add to whats already here as time goes on.
 Combat to me seems to need some work, its not too challenging but it gets pretty chaotic fast and I have yet to find any way to control the fights. not sure if that comes later but something to note.
 In regards to the always online aspect of the game I'm not sure where the controversy really comes from. It was my understanding since about a year ago that the game was a PVE only MMO. I dont know why or how that info went missing but I found the online requirement 100% not surprising. I know you can solo the game but there are lots of mmos that people play solo so I just dont get the issue. I guess a lot of people just didnt do any research.
 Regardless the game requires you to be always online and to connect to the server so if thats to big an ask then this is not yo game. Personally I love it because my friend and I can play co-op even if one of us is busy offline with no hosting issues.
 Overall I have been having a great time and enjoying the game tremendously and would recommend it to anyone who love building / crafting mmos.",1708602438,1708602438,True,0,0,0.497382223606109619,0,True,False,True

After putting in a few hours now there are some great points.
Animation/Graphics are amazing. Some true love and care as gone into making this game look fantastic. Even down to little things like the rainbows changing based on the angle you look at them. Amazing attention to detail. 
Story seems interesting enough but it's where some of the cracks start to show. 
The story itself is solid enough. But it is very linear. Go here, do a thing, come back. Go here, do a thing, come back. 
It feels more like a story driven RPG than an open world survival. 
Your just walking point to point all the time. 
Exploration also doesn't feel rewarding. You get points of interest with chests and some temporary buffs but none of it feels necessary or engaging. Half the time the temporary buffs take longer to get than they are worth and most of them are pretty useless that I've seen. 

Crafting and building system is excellent. But in multiplayer you are limited by how much you can place and it's a pretty strict limit, taking a lot of the fun and creativity out of it. 

The game is also VERY, VERY, VERY easy. It holds your hand A LOT and none of the enemies (including fabled and named bosses) have felt like they are a threat. I assume enemies will get harder as you progress but after 17 hours I still feel like I am in the tutorial. I am struggling to stay interested in continuing after this long because there is simply no challenge. Just walk here, kill a few mobs in no time flat and leave for 17 hours is really tiresome. 

There is a good game here. It's a BEAUTIFUL game with an excellent crafting/building system. But the hand holding, and lack of any real threat after so long is really making me lose interest rapidly. I am Trying to continue to see if it gets harder. But no game should take 20 hours+ to ""get to the good bit"" without being an MMORPG. 
I am recommending this game based on what it COULD be. Not on what it is now. Now it's a walking sim with crafting mechanics. Which if you like super chill, easy story games. You may have fun here. But survival crafter veterans will find very little to challenge them here. I know I am.

Seems like the game is setup for the long haul in that the game is very modular in how to develop it. I can see new cards being added as time goes on to expand the content in a really cool way. kinf og like No Mans Sky etc. I like a lot of the game but was hoping for it to be closer to a more finished state I suppose. Its strange combat feels ""jerky"" in a way not very smooth. Character models are off a bit. I get the look they are trying to go for but honestly just makes the characters a bit hard to look at. The game loop seems ok but the survival mechanics feel very bad to understand what is happening via the UI. 

I see a lot of reviews for it being always online being a bad thing but Im pretty sure the devs have said private servers are coming later not on launch. The way portals work etc is a lot of fun and a clever way of making server hosted realms as oppose to client side realms hosted by players.

I need to see more content though. The quests seem very basic and the NPC's just stand still with no voice acting like Puck its a bit jarring. Which all in all leads me to my biggest complaint overall. The AI is garbage. Enemy pathing is off because they colide with everything and allow me to literally just cheese anything if I needed to. The companions are god awful. I have to dismiss them to make them go away for a bit leaving me to go and find them. They just chop everything down if they have an axe whether you want them to or not and just overall annoyingly needed as an inventory mule who occasionally fights. 

Im assuming this is all going to be worked on and see the potential of this game for sure. They have the right recipe but need to get the ingredients in a higher quality.",1708601754,1708601754,True,0,0,0.497382223606109619,0,True,False,True

The latest review I've used a High end Gaming pc because you've earned the truth 🙌.

-----
Latest Play time was done on the date 📅 22-02-24

The game have been made by a publisher who's not willing to make this game payable in the offline mode this will break the game if they're not willing to change this.
----
The game has a good playable intro keep this in your mind because further than that you should expect mutch, Even on a high end pc the game is pretty laggy and you should turn the settings to a balanced game experience this may fix it a bit.

The game isn't enjoyable The review ""Early access fix"" will explain why.

☐The recourses on the ground look truly awful 😖 
☐And the animations aren't good aswell 😕  
☐The game feels empty without a soul

The sadness is quite real

I am hoping that the game has a good future ahead  🙏

Here is a early access review 
From Early Fix Days 
The game was reviewed on a 🥔 Pc.
----
- Nightingale Review -

The review is written in chapters 1-5.

The review will not go into detail about the development of the game, but it will cover the Early Stress Test and my experience with the gameplay.

The game will likely continue to be developed and my review will be updated in the future.

PC: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit Dual channel DDR4 16.0GB RX 580 Series - Screen resolution 1920x1080 “59HZ” The game has been installed on a 1TB SSD Samsung 980 And all drivers have been updated
The graphics aren’t great because the GPU is a potato

▣Chapter 1: 2021 The Game Awards

The game trailer was first seen in 2021 at the Game Awards. I’m not easily hyped “GTA 4 was the last time” But when I saw the trailer for Nightingale, my heart started beating faster.

The way the game mechanics work to the survival aspect, this was something completely new. The graphics look incredibly good “so good that I would put down 1400 euros for a new GPU for the game”

Also immediately amazed by the gameplay they also showed “Wow” but maybe too good to be true.

A year ago I signed up for the test days A year later, on 02/02 2024, I received an email (Stress test) Finally, I get to try out the game!

▣Chapter 2: The Beginning

I installed the game directly via Steam, The game starts… Reading some stories on the phone about the experiences of other players

Player One: “The game doesn’t start. Not enough Video Memory”
Player Two: “The game isn’t playable on a 4060 GPU”,
Now I’m a bit scared because I have a 580 GPU! (Starfield is a mess on my PC)

The game starts… The screen goes black … it’s taking a while now… And… a trailer! After the trailer, I’m introduced to create a character, the game looks incredibly beautiful! I made a neat character, and now to start the game… ""The game has not unlocked all attributes for character customization.
The game begins and I’m amazed… The game just works!
------------------------------------

▣Chapter 3: The Game

I see an overlay of the journal and I see a flying deer talking…
I’m attacked by 3 wolves, these are the first seconds what’s happening?

The game shocks quite a bit as soon as I close the journal Damn,
the game is too heavy! I need to change the settings… but first, kill those wolves.

The game stutters a bit less now. I swing around with an axe 3 wolves dead…
The goat tells me that I need to craft an item to claim a piece of land, he doesn’t say more,
There's no tutorial.

First change the game settings. I go to the settings and can’t adjust much, I select balanced gameplay and this works excellently.

The game works normally and the graphics look reasonably okay.
The game works reasonably well, but why do I see voxels/pixels in the trees?
The game doesn’t offer an extensive tutorial and what do I need to craft?.
------------------------------------

▣Chapter 3: It keeps raining

I look in the journal and now i clearly know what I need to craft, but the crafting menu is not very clear …
Is that the thing i need to craft? is it in the building category or in crafting catergory?
Four minutes later, I find what I need, unfortunately, this is what continuously happens.

""Search, search, and search again""
I have avoided all gameplays so that the game feels really new so I don’t know what happens when it starts to rain…
And fifteen minutes later in the game and it’s raining I see a wet meter appear and I have a feeling that it’s not good, quickly build a house! Not enough stones in my inventory How is that possible!

I take my pickaxe and look for stones “YES!” a rock, I hit it with my pickaxe but nothing happens… Next stone … it drops a stone but not what I need… I’m slowly dying from the rain, and it keeps raining. I’m just searching on the ground for loose stones
and… and found some on the ground, quickly back to my little house and I build a wall and a roof.
Now that I know that rain can kill me, I need to craft an umbrella done this quickly, and press on the interaction button ""Equip"" nothing happens… I see that I have a gun, press on the interaction “Equip” Again, nothing!
----------------------------------
▣Chapter 4: Weak

I can only equip the clothes and nothing else, the weapons I am currently using are -Axe / Pickaxe- I feel weak and according to the goat, I have to go to a location that is far away…
and it keeps raining!

I leave my house and run as fast as I can to a location that is on the map, I manage to do it but now I am being attacked by a Spooky Elder Ring monsters. Once I have killed three Spooky Elder Ring monsters, I walk to a fire and I have an interaction with it… Choose a card? and I do that.

The sky turns black and everywhere I see white Voxels appear, the game starts to stutter and out of nowhere again some Spooky Elder Ring monsters,
but this time they have red eyes and it’s still raining.

I run home, lock myself in, and rest by the fire “the wet meter is completely full” my HP is very low… I try to eat something and … The door of my house is destroyed by an Elder Ring monster. I am too weak, I am going to die! I hit the monster with an axe, I run away and I heal myself with a magic spell! The monsters are now dead and it stops raining.
----------------------------
▣Chapter 5:
Voxels

➞0:30 AM It’s night and I’m staring at the screen and thinking “What has happened?""

You start in the game on a small piece of land where you are immediately attacked, then it starts to rain and you lose health you have to quickly craft a house and you do that
& then you have to travel a bit to open a portal “With cards you can open realms or something?” I have no idea what I should do.

I’m a bit overwhelmed by the game I look at the map … No idea where to go… I walk through a forest near my house… I stare at my screen again and look closely at the graphics I see Voxels everywhere… the game doesn’t look ugly and it works reasonably in terms of FPS The plants look incredibly beautiful and so do the trees,

Voxels but not like Minecraft, white small voxels 1/2Pixels in the trees on the ground, on the buildings themselves.

It’s now 1:00 in the night and I’m really a bit sad
the game has good potential to be really special, the game offers a very unique gameplay ----->“Back 4 Blood card system”<-----

But it doesn’t work… In the meantime, I’ve looked at reviews from other gamers with a 4070^ GPU and many had the same problems “Discord/Steam” The Card System and the interaction with the world are just not well developed,the interface is just bad, the color palette of the interface is just very poor.

The online aspect didn’t work so there’s not much to say about that.

I will buy the game at Early Access and try the game again, and the new video card is also coming for this game and I don’t lose hope that this game will really be fun.",1708599321,1708600342,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The aesthetics, building, exploring to me is all fun. Sure there is quite a bit room for improvement, but it is in early access.

Things that need to be improved:

- Obvious problems on network/server side. I think this needs to be addressed first, as disconnects may happen every time you are switching realms.
- Removal of building pieces - If you are pointing up to remove a rooftile (in 3rd person view) there is a high chance that you might accidentally remove the floor underneath you instead.
- Obscure issues - yesterday I had some issues with my respite after coming back to my main realm. The respite point had been set to where my friends respite was in the past (he moved it), and I could not set it to my own respite point as it 'was already set to this point'
- Puzzles are quite easy. I would love to see more complex puzzles where it takes more time to figure out what is going on. But other than that, I love the idea of completing puzzles for rewards.
- NPC recuitment. I really hope that there will be options for this. Thus far, recruiting NPCs has little to no impact on the gameplay. Sure, they fight a little alongside you and here and there chop a tree, but it isn't adding as much.

That being said, I really enjoy my time in this game, and I'm keep being very aware that this is just Early Access. There is features currently not enabled that will be added later (possibly including QoL features). However, reading through the reviews, I feel like people have created expectations solely as some other games have implemented some QoL features that this game doesn't have.

For example:
- Add items to stack. Keep in mind that this is already implemented to a certain degree. If you add all items (and chest is full) it will automatically add to existing stacks. Sure, you cannot do this whilst the chest is not full, but plenty of other survivalcraft games do not have this either.
- Fast Travel. Thus far I haven't seen any fast travel other than your respite point. Personally, I do not find it that big of an issue, but would love to see it. However, we do not know if more fast travel is enabled later in the game. 
- Crafting from chests. I'm sorry but in my own opinion this is not a must-have. It's a QoL feature that some other games have (not all).
- Abilities to skip grinds for resources. Really...?

I'm seeing people leaving bad reviews and complaining about stuff above with next to no time spent in the game (if you are complaining about the network/servers, you have my blessing). Are these actual survival craft enjoyers, or just Palworld bandwagon jumpers? To me, a survivalcraft game shouldn't be jumping into fast paced action from the get-go, and grinding stuff is part of this category of games.

It's a survival game in Early Access...",1708474738,1708600007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game's concept is intriguing, but its execution leaves much to be desired. At this stage, playing Nightingale may not provide the experience the developers intended.

The game's world is rich with potential, but technical issues mar it. The game feels unpolished, laggy, and broken, which detracts from the immersive experience. The animation could be more problematic, making the game feel clunky and unfinished.

One suggestion for improvement is to implement separate profiles for single-player and online play. This would allow players to enjoy the game offline without the issues that arise from online play.

Despite these shortcomings, there is hope for Nightingale. The potential is evident, and with more patches and work, the game could become the experience the developers envisioned. For now, however, it may be best to wait for further updates before purchasing the game.

In conclusion, Nightingale has a promising concept but is hindered by technical issues. It is worth keeping an eye on for future improvements, but for now, it may not be worth playing in its current state.

The game is early access but more than playable at present state.

The pace and feel has a early fallout 76 vibe meaning that it's not like Ark and Rust, where the whole experience boils down to PVP. Has enough of a survival feel with feather light RPG, to make it feel different to other survival games. 

Lots of people will criticise the PvE aspect with it not being PvP. Those players will rant online till they once again noob kill in their game of choice.

It is by no means a perfect survival game, but what I've played so far, I've enjoyed far more than any of the other survival games recently. The environments, especially the forest biome, are very pretty, and ive had a good time just running around the game in co-op.

Some of the reviews on here are incredibly strange, and I wonder if the people writing them even tried looking things up or just playing the game before writing them.

- Yes, the game is always online. but there are definitely EU servers. I've played for 11 hours and I've not gotten any lag during that time. I've also had a grand total of two connection errors playing in that time. Would I have preferred for the game to be playable offline? yes, but the requirements quite literally state an internet connection is required to play the game. You knew what you were getting into when you bought the game.

- Ive seen complaints that there is no way to organize stuff, and that you always grab full stacks of items when taking them out of inventory. chests can be named, and you an use shift when grabbing to split stacks. That said, I'd LOVE for there to be a way to craft from chests directly and not have to get stuff out before doing so. 

- I've seen complaints that crafting is convoluted, and yeah, I can see that it might become so at higher level. but I saw someone make a huge step by step guide to cook berries. It's a truth with modification because while you can go through all those steps, you can also just use the autofill function in a crafting station. Don't care if you are roasting blueberries or raspberries? go into the cooking station, press cooked berries, press autofill, choose the amount of things you want it to cook. Don't care much about what type of fuel you use? go into fuel, press autofill, press ignite. enjoy oodles of berry flowers

- I've seen some complaints about the world being empty from people with very little time played, and I'm kinda wondering if they are mistaking the three small tutorial isles for how the rest of the game is. way it works is in the beginning, you go through three small biomes learning the basics, then the game sends you to the first ""real"" map, where after doing some gearing and setting up a base, you get the means to go to the first tier of more challenging worlds. the three tutorial maps are very small and basic, which I agree can be kinda boring, but they are also done very quickly. the only tip I can give for this is bring lots of fiber from the first forest tutorial area because you'll need it in the other two worlds, and they have a lot less available. 

All in all, I've had a good time so far. Maybe it will get worse as time goes on, but I wanted to give a positive review to reflect how I feel about it, and hopefully dispel some of the weirder complaints I've seen.

To the devs, should you read this: I think this game has a ton of potential in the card system, more biomes, more types of worlds, and some QOL in terms of building, crafting, and similar, and I think you guys may have a great game on your hands. one thing I want to complain about tho, is you let us pick some gorgeous starting gear just to replace it with horrible scrap gear real quickly. I bought this game in part because of the aesthetics of armor, and I'd like to not be wearing potato sacks if I can avoid it.

Despite all this, me and my friend have already sunk over 11 hours into the game, and are having a great time, constructing a base, heading out and collecting resources, heading into other biomes and finding whats there, collecting the resources there and then bringing them back, trying out the mini dungeons, and then upgrading our base as we unlock new parts. all in all, I am loving the game despite the issue above, as none of them are enough to ruin my enjoyment. 

Far too many of these reviews are saying the same thing, the start is too slow and it doesnt explain what to do, but I am glad to have a survival game that doesn't hold your hand. plus, if you open your journal, it explains what you need to do in regards to missions, so people blatantly aren't using their heads.

I've been waiting for this game to come out for quite some time. Of course, i too was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype... But, i am happy to say that it does! I have read many other reviews and that is why im writing my own... something i have, honestly, never done. This review is to address concerns from other reviews i read... 

First, understand it is an RPG style game... They ALWAYS start slow... Get over it... It has some things to teach you, learn them, blast past them and get on to the game...
 
Second... it gets harder... MUCH harder... Im 20 hours in and still dont have a gun... The early enemy mobs are simple to kill, but trust me they are just practice... The enemies that await you will absolutely make you realize this fact... You will be really happy you practiced landing your crits, this i promise...

Third,,, It is designed to let you do what you want... so do what you want... explore... make new card combinations, if you think its easy, its because youre making it easy on yourself... There are plenty of options to make it more difficult, outside of increasing the difficulty level... 

Fourth... this is an early access game... We are all aware of this... this game has an absolutely astonishing level of potential, and we get to help, while still enjoying a gorgeous game... Character creation will be beefed up, they literally tell you this... ALOT of this game is gonna get beefed up... But being 20 hours in, i have absolutely no regrets... There are still an incredible amount of things to do and ive barely scratched the surface... 

Lastly i would like to mention the grind complaints... Grinding is a part of gaming, all gamers know this... If you have a problem with grinding, then i dont know what to tell you... The grind in this game is nothing like rep grinding to oblivion like we did in WOW... It has tedious moments sure, but that is to be expected... Grinding is just a part of gaming... pick the plants, chop the trees, break the rocks... The grind in this game isnt bad at all... just do it!

No depending on connecting to a specific dedicated server, or needing to play in one specific player's world. It's a seamless experience from solo to multiplayer.

And the worlds you're exploring are [i]amazing[/i]. They're gorgeous and varied, with deep worldbuilding and interesting storytelling. I haven't even scratched the surface of all the different realms can travel to at this point, but there is an incredible attention to detail in things like the cards you play to modify realms. I've tried out a few, and each has an impact on gameplay that makes it fun to customize, and also affects the way the world looks in really interesting ways.

1. The game starts running good, but after a while you get very low FPS (lower settings seem to deteriorate this). Optimization complaints were made throughout the whole beta testing process, but no changes were made.

2. Inventory management seems like it was made by a child. You kill a wolf you get their skin, you craft Leather Level 1 (Predator). You kill a deer, you get their skin, you craft Leather Level 1 (Prey). Not only those need their own space on your inventory or on your storage boxes, but if a recipe needs two leather, you can't use both of those, since they are coming from different sources (Predator, Prey). Now add the multiple levels of those and you get the idea. It's exactly the same with food and almost every item in the game.

3. The off-hand mechanic is frustrating. Another issue that was stated in the beta testing with no changes at all. You wield an one-handed weapon/tool, you also have your off-hand visible holding something (unless if you leave your off-hand bar empty).

I would wait for a long time to see how this games develops before giving it a try.

The game itself is not bad, the crafting is decent, the worlds look pretty good, the creatures are interesting, the human characters look off but whatever that's probably a stylistic choice that just isn't my taste.

I've not played [i]Enshrouded[/i] nor [i]Valheim[/i] - and have no plans to play either - but I've played some survival games before, like [i]Palworld[/i], [i]Grounded[/i], and [i]Raft[/i]. There is a lot of criticism about how this game is just not ready compared to XYZ game, but since I've not played the more recent ones, I can't compare. All I know is that I've been waiting for a survival game with this kind of vibe for a long time.

I love the story, the lore, the magic, and the environment. The realms are so whimsical; they make you want to settle in under cozy blankets and just spend the afternoon exploring. It's clear the developers have put in a lot of time writing out each of the pieces of lore, crafting out a magical Victorian-era background of characters and places. Who doesn't want to float down a tall cliff like Mary Poppins? 

I'm still early in my game play, but I can't wait to explore other biomes. There's only three right now – forest, desert, swamp – but I'd imagine the developers will be adding even more down the road. Snowy biome, maybe? Either way, I love the card-playing mechanic and I can't wait to try out all the different combos.

I can confirm that there are a few glitches in the game, but considering this is Early Access, that's to be expected. I'm running on a GeForce 3070 graphics card with a Ryzen 7 5800X processor. Settings are mostly set to ""Quality"", and I haven't seen any graphic issues. Connectivity has been fine too. I am not bothered by the ""always online"" game play requirement either; I'm usually playing with Discord opened on my second monitor anyway. I've also not encountered any game-breaking bugs that would make the game crash; most bugs look like minor glitches on my end.

However, I can confirm that the user interface does take getting used to; though I kind of like it. I'd rather not see the same ol' user interface across various survival games. If the developers are considering changing it due to player feedback, I hope the changes are minor, as I like that it's different. It follows the current Victorian vibe really well.

Anyway, I'm loving the magical whimsical feel of this game so far. (Seeing the Large Magical Moose in person for the first time was an experience!) I can't wait to see this game more polished and more fleshed out. Kudos to the studio for developing a more creative concept in the survival game genre.

After reading reviews following the Stress Test, I had found my hype greatly reduced.  
I had come face to face with the realisation, Nightingale might not be ready to be played, and too flawed at time of release.

I've now played for a bit, and I have found my concerns mostly alleviated. 
There are still some placeholder things here and there (icons for some resources etc).  
But by and large, the gameplay has been enjoyable. 

I'm keen to see where it goes, and exploring realms and slowly getting my crafting stuff set up has been enjoyable. 

I am still early game, so I don't know what the long term situation will be.

I have noticed some slow loading times now and then, which given it is always online, and living in a country far away from the closest 'hosting' server, is going to be an ongoing problem.

The game has great background sounds, music and awesome!! graphics.  The character creation is over the top!!  It could easily take anywhere from 5 mins to an hour to make a character.  How much customization will you do?  (Do wish more customization on the body) At this time, it is addicting to play.  I don't know the repeatability yet.  I do know,  if you enjoy Conan Exiles;  you will most likely enjoy Nightingale that has a feel of the 1800 Victorian fantasy era.

There is a useful in-game guide to help.  Few keys I've learned while playing;  B=build, at the moment F=feed (holds the item in left hand), E=Interact/pickup items,  LM and RM=punch

Last information to share is; do not fret, there are a few features yet to be added and notes have been made in-game.  After all, it is early release and to be expected.

Always online for solo players is unacceptable, it's laggy and sticky. It also seems like a waste of resources to force players who will never play together with someone else to crowd a server with the ones who need and want it.

The UI is crowded and messy, navigating it with a controller is a chore and sometimes even seems impossible to navigate where you want to go without resorting to mouse anyway. Crafting without resources being pulled out of storage goes from annoying to new hights of tediousness with how fiddly using the controller is.

First of all, let's address the big subject, always online. No I do not like it, the game is connecting to server 3-4 minutes every time I start up the game, it's the source of lag and stutter. I've even had moments where I could move but not sprint, stamina wasn't recovering and couldn't jump. Took several minutes then my character teleported back... Typical server issue. It's honestly quite bad player experience and need to be addresses ASAP! This is one of those titles Ubisoft would have orgasms about, always online rented game, ""If we shut off servers you can't play the game you bought"".

Crafting is incredibly tedious and there's a lot of farming for materials involved. That's fine, if only stuff would actually grow back and if you could carry enough. The big issue comes when you have to build, you will find yourself running back and forth between blueprints and storage because you can't carry enough.
An easy fix for this would be to be able to build and craft with material in nearby storage, something other building/crafting games have done forever, but not this one...

Your followers (recruits) are dumb af, enough said.

The game is gorgeous though, no arguing there but that is not enough for a game that forces me to be online all the time. Game play so far seems quite repetitive but I don't really mind for $30 game. I will get enough hours out of this to justify the price.

However, I would recommend to hold off buying this until the devs address the always online crap. There is literally nothing in the game that requires an always online feature, anyone stating otherwise are either brain washed or simply don't know how servers work with games. For solo play, external servers are not required no matter what.

I'm honestly a bit surprised by how many reviews down voted the game due to lagging servers after just 30-60 minutes of playtime, only hours after release. Of course the servers are going to have some lag right at release as everyone rushed to play at once. Adding an offline option as for solo players as others have mentioned would be a good way to help this, but in all honesty playing online wasn't enough of an issue to really dampen my fun while playing Nightingale. It would be nice to be offline so that I could pause the game, but again, it feels very minor to me since everything else I love about the game out-ways my want for a pause feature.  There was a few bugs at launch but the Inflexion Team rushed to do a Hotfix to patch the bigger issues within less than 24 hours; which honestly, I applaud them for listening to audience feedback and addressing the bugs so quickly. As for the game itself, its absolutely gorgeous! The worlds are fun to explore and the building mechanics are engaging and simple. I love the structures around the different worlds that I can explore as well as the different creatures. I would love to see more fantasy styled fauna since we are in the Faewilds and maybe a bit more smaller fae creatures scurrying and flying around at the start of the game just so that it feels more populated and fantastical in the starting worlds. That's just me being nitpicky though, and I also know that with this being Early Access the devs are going to be adding to the game over time and changing things as well. All-in-all though, I'm LOVING this game and I'm excited to see how the build on what they already have!

It's about emptiness.

It is as generic a branch & rock gatherer game as it can get. I've done all of this multiple times in other games years, years ago, and nothing new has been added other than switching biomes via portal near you rather than sprinting for 6 minutes.

What brings this game down for me is the fact that it's designed to be played on your own - there's a ton of craft stations that you have to unlock via special currency, each crafting station has 5 modifiers it can take, none of it is thematically new and all of it is slapped down on your head in a single tutorial page.

Game map is also empty. It has trees in the forest biome, some random ruins with like a single piece of some kind of magical ore you can't mine, and little to no NPCs or animals - In the 10 minutes that I have spent getting wood for the house I've seen 2 deers and a boar. NPC count was 1 quest giver & 1 trader.

I have played a mere 2 hours, and this was enough for me to render a negative judgement - coming after hundreds of hours into games like Forest 1/2, 7 days to die, Night of the dead, Rust, ARK, Atlass etc. I am a very patient person, but I have none for this game, which had marketing support comparable to major AAA titles and spun the wheel of uniqueness, but it's just not unique at all.

Some great features I haven't seen mentioned (Even fixing some issues other have complained about) are the ability to rename storage containers, no need for signage like other survival games, interesting additions like comfort levels affecting your workstations, as well as your character, crafting backpacks for more carry weight, and splitting the hotbar for main and offhand items, as well as the whole card/variation system which offers so much customization and potential for the future!

Middle of the road survival game.  Dozens have done the same, better.  The appeal would have been in the setting, which is almost entirely wasted.

The ability to open a portal to a map you cook up yourself is both interesting and a huge QoL improvement over crawling an entire planet. Further, the roads it leaves open for the devs to expand the system will allow them to keep growing the game organically for as long as we keep playing it. The game has a great vibe, and the pure adventure feel might even transcend Valheim because there are so many things to *find* in the world. The sound is ok, the graphics are pretty good, but more than anything, the world and the game's concept are, for me anyway, enough to hold my interest through the Early Access issues.

What's not so great at the moment are combat, movement, and the ui. Combat is better than enshrouded but not as good as Valheim. Movement is almost fine, it's just a bit clunky and floaty and there is no proper roll maneuver. The UI and the build UI could use some more love. The lack of any sort of skill system, be it a live skill system or some sort of tree, is a very noticeable void. The servers aren't super stable for a permanently online game, but it's more annoying than problematic. A few crashes over several hours and you log in where the crash happened. 

There are rough spots to be sure, and Nightingale's success will depend on the devs ability to juggle adding new stuff with improving existing issues.

PORTAL MECHANIC

This game also runs a system from an old game called .hack//sign where you'd choose names to generate the type of field you wanted to go to, this game gives you the ability to do the same with cards, Personally this is amazing and I love it!

COMBAT

The combat isn't bad, though honestly it can feel clunking in third person,but the combat works a lot better in first person. the combat has different mechanics that you can do like long range dodges with dagger mixed with quick strikes, or blocking and shoves with two handed tools. Theirs also magic you earn later in the game that enhances these tools to do even more stuff.(i haven't got this far yet)Also well aimed head shot will you get a critical strike that staggers the enemies and ever cancels out some attacks like leaps or charges. I find it fun and challenging for the combat, But i won't deny its has its faults.

GRAPHICS

Overall the graphics are beautiful, the visuals are great and it just feels good to look around the world. There are some great moments, where my jaw dropped from the sheer beauty of it. But there do seem to be some optimizations issues but this games not finished, and this will likely be fixed before release, so I have a open mind!

CO-OP

Being able to drop in and out with your friends at any time honestly is a great feeling, also teleporting from realm to realm seeing the different realm combinations, and helping each other clear small arenas full of monsters or even wracking each others brains trying to solve a puzzle. Even fight bosses, that I've honestly been getting wrecked by. 

CHARACTER CREATION

Its good enough for now, there are some more sliders they need to add in, But i do find its completely possible to make a character you'll like, i do think more sliders for the eyes, and mouth and jawline, would be a good addition, but you can get around this currently by using their inheritance system. (You'll make a family tree and then be able to merge certain family members faces to get a nice facial structure) A tip, Grandparent 1, Grandparent 2, Parent 1, and Parent 2 are the family tree members you use for inheritance, the rest don't matter.

I RECOMMEND IT!

I personally recommend this game, at $30 I find this to be a steal, it is early access though, and you should keep a mind frame that the game won't run the best at all times.

All of that adds up, and sadly, there's only so much free time in my life to deal with all of this. I could be spending this time playing more polished survival experiences that don't throttle my GPU.

I know it's early access, but after playing Enshrouded and Palworld, I came to expect early access game to be at least in playable state and can't do anything about it; it is what it is. Maybe after a while, but for now, I wouldn't recommend buying it to anyone.

It's also always online for some insane reason? The servers as they are now kick you out when you're just playing single player. Even if this is fixed in the future it really has no reason to be online at all times.

[h2]7.5/10[/h2]

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Beautiful Graphics, Map Designs, & Sound Design
[*]Unique Setting & Concept
[*]Progressive STORY
[*] Reasonable Price
[*] Co-op & Multiplayer Included
[/list]

For the Pros, the game is beautiful all the way around. The time and effort into the graphics, design, creatures, and even the small sound effects really bring an amazing level of immersion. The ""survival"" and crafting aspects bring a refreshing, unique spin comparing to games like Minecraft or Valhiem.

Also, being ""online only"" is causing a lot of players to lose interest before even trying the game, but I think it is a core feature. The ability to have persistent worlds where you can play with friends is a solid point for myself and playing with friends. Not even Minecraft will let you run a server for free where your friends can connect without the host being online.
I think the ""online only bad"" mentality is choosing to disregard where gaming, as a whole, has come to in the past few years. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Slight Frame/Server Lag Issues (could be result of early release loads so keep that in mind)
[*]Basic AI (Friendly and Enemy NPCs)
[*]Difficulty & Enemies are two-dimesnional
[*]Combat Lacking Diversity
[*] Very Linear Open-World Survival Story
[/list]

For the Cons, 99% of my dissatisfaction comes from performance and AI. 

Performance issues haven't impacted me as much as others, but I can't overlook some of the models being prioritized over others. Some things will just POP and look fantastic, while others look half-rendered.

The AI, both enemy and friendly, is what is the ""deal breaker"" for me. Friendly AI can't be controlled and I have to constantly keep an eye on them to ensure I don't die to a falling tree. Past that, the friendly AI can easily solo any horde of enemy you reach up until level 30-40 with little issue and only their starting gear.
Enemy AI is very one dimensional as well, with most enemies being copy-paste patterns & attacks, choosing to swarm you.
There is a LOT of diversity in NPC/entity design, but VERY LITTLE, if any, diversity in AI interaction/combat. It is very immersion ruining, and possibly game ruining if it doesn't change in upcoming patches.

Small side note: The ""Open World"" aspect is very similar to Fallout 4's settlement concept. You can ""assist"" many NPC communicates to use their resources or recruit them to your party, but until the friendly AI gets fixed, there is really no point in doing so. It is very bland and repetitive (much like the Fallout 4 settlement grind - post game win)

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Overall, I think Nightingale is viable as a solid, reasonably priced, story driven survival title that brings a refreshing and unique outlook and playstyle to the genre. If this seems like your type of game, I would probably agree that it absolutely is.

I HATE ""Early Access"" games with a passion, but for all of the quirks and nuances that I'm finding in Nightingale, there are 20 more Triple A titles that release at x2 the price and that are x2 more poorly executed.

The AI and lack of enemy diversity, as well as the linearity of the story mode are the major 2 points that bring the game down out of the 8-10 range for me, BUT I do think there is hope for future updates to revitalize the friendly NPC performance, as well as add diversity or difficulty to existing enemies as well.

I KNOW Nightingale is worth its' price, I know that it is a fully fleshed out story driven, survival game, and I look forward to putting more time into this game and enjoying this hybrid between Minecraft/Destiny/Fallout/Bioshockesqe title.",1708583121,1708583273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has latency issues also, as it's a server base (always connected to the internet, and you can still play even if the host is offline). There are some delay between swinging my weapon and the actual hit.

(Review based on Early Access release version)
The game is certainly beautiful to look at, with some great design and textures, but you will quickly realize that it plays just like every other survival game that has been released in recent times.
Yes, it's Early Access, but it should at least be more fun. 
My first experience with the game was not a good one.  I sat down to play and was informed that the server was down.  In a single player game?   The store lists the game as single player but I couldn't even play the damned game by myself.
Other than forced online for solo play, there's a lot of elements that don't sit well with me.

- There's an odd screen with two options only.  Agree or Quit.   You MUST agree with ""Turn off VPNS, add Nightingale to firewalls, hardwired connection"" or quit to desktop.    Why??   This is so strange.   I have never seen this in a game before.

- The game demands an SSD for quick load times and yet loading screens can take several minutes to load because it's ""Waiting for server"".... in single player.   

- No pausing in solo

- ""Disconnection for inactivity"" while click buying items from an NPC vendor.  

- Companion NPC is brain dead and does things like cutting down trees in the middle of a boss fight.  Where's Kelvin when you need him.

- 100% owned by Tencent and gathers your personal data!

- The absolute WORST and UGLIEST character creator I've ever seen.    I know western games are all about making ugly characters of late, but damn....     At least make using a paper bag an option.

The biggest issue above all is....   I'm just not having much fun.    I'm used to the grind of these kinds of games, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone else right now.",1708582989,1708583035,False,6,0,0.58396613597869873,0,True,False,True

Cons: First we really need a term for games that are practically in a pre-early access state. The current state is very disappointing considering how many delays this game had. Basic game systems are non functioning or absent. The building/exploration/survival genre isn't new and I don't know why whoever is in charge thought you didnt have to meet minimum expectations with your game systems. Inventory and storage is about as crude and basic as they come. If you started a game and your friends started a game and you want to play with them, but you dont live together at the same base its an absolute nightmare of running to each other and long loading screens to do anything. Portals are like the big thing about this game and they are super annoying to use. long loading screens and while you can create outgoing portals anywhere you want, you cant portal to other non realm default portals. so get ready for a run... loading screen and another jog to link up with your friend... 

the UI is horrible.. someone definitely let an artist run wild with it because its all bells and whistles and zero functionality.

quest/gear progression is really poorly thought out. 

the sad part is you can see where time and effort was put into the game and its in a lot of the areas that are superficial and dont matter in the end. I had a ton of fun the first hour or so.. when you do the tutorial and you build your first shack with a bed and some crafting tables.. but after that the game just feels shallow and poorly thought out. honestly... boring and mildly aggravating. 

the TLDR: this type of game isnt new.... if your going to add your take to the genre you need to be as good or better. you cant be worse... This game as it stands now is a step back.

Skyrim puts this to shame how many years later?  Ark, WoW, Palworld, just about anything that came out in the last 15 years is better at movement and combat than this game.  I don't understand where any of the hype is coming from.  Every element of the crafting system has been done a million times in a million other games, nothing original here at all.  And they didn't even benefit from borrowing well established systems, they are poorly copied and uninspired.  There isn't even a leveling and talent system, just gear upgrading.  Very flat and boring system overall.  Base building is basic af, combat is cringe, collision and hitbox physics are atrocious.  And the icing on the cake?  If you realllllllly try, you can customize your character into looking about as attractive as a thumb toe that mated with a potato.  They intentionally made the characters quite ugly.

I just finished Enshrouded and loved Valheim with plenty of time in building/survival/exploration games from Ark, Conan, Forest, 7DtD, NMS, etc. but this game has really impressed me with visuals that are genuinely stunning and some really well thought out gameplay mechanics.  
The gorgeous atmospheric effects, the beautiful lapping water on shorelines (and the waves that actually toss you around while swimming), gives this game a lot of character.  

While there is the standard resource grind, it is not nearly as bad as some have made it out to be.  Its on par with other survival games.  Exploration is great and rewards you when you stumble on the many ruins, puzzles, structures, and other sources of hidden chests.

The combat feels a lot better than it appeared from gameplay videos.   Two-handed weapons are slow, but you can sidestep, and time your swings to meet rushing enemies that leads to some satisfying combat dynamics.  Battles were fun with a bit of challenge (I played on medium difficulty, cleared a couple of Fae towers, and havent died yet).

I also liked the way environmental effects were handled.  Things like cold and wet would build up and reduce stamina and health, but they could be slowly reversed with torches and umbrellas, which would add another strategic dimension to combat where you would switch to a torch for a bit to warm up and raise your health cap between enemy waves, or put your umbrella up or find cover in a fight to dry off.

Building is similar to games like the Forest. You use plans that you then fill in with the required resources, but once completed, there is no way to move or remove structures through the building interface (you have to destroy them manually to get rid of them and you do recover some resources from it).  

Overall I thought everything worked extremely well, with no connectivity issues, no bugs, fun combat, engaging exploration.  Great start, highly recommended.",1708579315,1708579315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Deep crafting systems with lots of intermediates
- Very nice graphics
- Interesting story, worldbuilding, and even some voice acting
- You can build ghost-buildings, to design your base, and bring the materials after you've got it all ready

Bad:
- Extremely grindy; it takes about 2h to get out of the tutorial and into the first real world
- Buildings take huge amounts of resources to make, even low-tier beginner buildings will have you clearing the entire forest you wanted to live near
- Combat isn't really skill based, and just based on whether or not your gear is high enough level; you can block attacks, but only about two (if they're higher level than you) before you just have to take the hits and die.  This is especially bad because all progression occurs through combat, and the main grind is finding and killing the same enemies, over and over - everything's combat based, but it has bad combat
- Very few (I think 4) possible 'puzzles' that can be at each point of interest, none of which are actual puzzles, and all of which are just annoying; such as find all of X hidden runes in the area, glowing runes that are on walls and only show up if you walk close enough to them, and X is a random number so you don't ever know when you're done except to run back and check after each one
- Bosses are uninteresting, spongy, and tedious, and best handled by finding some way to cheese their terrible AI
- Online-only, official servers only, most actions are delayed or janky as a result
- Lets you recruit NPCs to your party, but just one (despite max party size of 6), and their AI is terrible - they do things like harvest trees or rocks, and then leave the materials on the ground
- Tedious inventory management, when there are many different versions of the same material that don't stack with eachother because they offer slightly different stats if you craft with them
- Some items have placeholder inventory icons and descriptions
- Performance is relatively bad
- No way to deconstruct things except to break them

The on thing I hate about this is item  placement, specifically rotation, it's too rough, you can't properly allign things well due to the rotation of the building parts or objects. It is annoying. 

The world itself is very good looking a true testament to U5s abilities. Seriously, my compliments. It's top quality.

The characters however are not, they are quite the opposite. They went with this cartoon/realistic character art style and it's bad. Real bad. The characters are so ugly that there's not much to work with. I mean it. I'm not sure what they were hoping for, but we ended up with the enemies from Fallout 3's Point Lookout. I really hope they review the character creation options because right now to me, this is the biggest issue I have with the game. 

The story, can't say much cause I haven't done much.

The combat seems basic, basic is good, but I haven't gone into the good stuff, so far still using basic weapons and no magic effects.

All in all, it's looking good. But I remember many things looking good before they started looking bad. Still the game has a very reasonable price tag.",1708576212,1708576212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. You have be okay with playing online. There is no option to play offline as of yet (if there ever will be)

2. You have to be okay with bugs. Nothing game breaking as of yet but they are quite jarring. One I've come across is the day/night cycle doesn't have a transition period and doesn't seem to be tied to the clock on the map page either. Sometime around 4-5 ""am"" that big ol' light in the sky will turn off and it's like someone turned out the lights. Torches don't illuminate very far around you either, maybe a foot or two from your character so it's nearly impossible to play at night. 

3. Building is extremely tedious. It took me three hours of grinding wood, plant fibre and other basic materials to build a decent sized house because you're weight limit in early game is basically nothing. I highly recommend getting a companion as quickly as possible so you have a pack mule just for this reason. 

4. Be aware that trees and other resources magically replenish every so often so build you base AWAY from any forested areas or be prepared for random grasses and trees to suddenly sprout in the middle of your buildings or for your overly enthusiastic wood chopping companion to chop down a tree and have it fall right on top of your house, demolishing a good section of it. [i]*I'm looking at you ""Guy"". No more axes for you. >.>*[/i]

5. There's no pause feature. So when you're reading a beautiful letter than opens up in a potentially hazardous area be prepared to suddenly start losing health, panic, forget where the escape button is and then when you finally find it be confronted with [spoiler]fae horrors with lantern cages stuck to their heads[/spoiler]. Basically don't read anything unless you're in the safety of your base.

All of that said here are a few pros as well. 

1. The actual building mechanic itself is, for the most part quite intuitive. 

2. The worlds are stunning, wildlife is decently diverse [spoiler](I've come across packs of wild boar, herds of dear, little tiny turquoise lizard things and wolves in just my Forest Abeyance realm)[/spoiler] They spawn in the same regions so when I'm looking for more hide to make leather I know where to go. 

3. Combat isn't terribly difficult as long as you don't let yourself get swarmed or cornered but don't expect any help your companion. I don't know if I'm just missing something but I attempted to give my companion a simple sling bow in hopes he would help me in the dungeon and he just stood there with his fists up while I got absolutely pummelled. 

4. Character Creation is decently robust for what it is. You pick a base and then can fine tune things like their feature location and size as well as colour for skin, eyes, makeup and hair.

5. Puzzles and mini dungeons are dotted all over the map so it's easy to find something to do.


All in all I'm not sure I can 100% recommend this game at full price as it is right now. If you have some cash to burn and are looking for something to fill that survival crafting itch with a slight magical twist? Sure. Otherwise?

Having to connect to unreliable servers to play single player is a hassle. You'll occasionally get booted for whatever reason. Or at times, it can take a few minutes of connecting to server to just..load in to your abeyance realm.

Enemies can.. kind of teleport currently? I think this is related to the server connection. I have been sneaking up on a pack of swamp kangaroos when suddenly they went from 50 feet away to 6 of them in my face in the attack animation. I only had issues with this back in Ark.

Additionally - I can't unbind keys. I use caps lock as my Push to Talk on Discord. Caps Lock is also the auto run in the game. I changed the key bind for auto walk (because I can't unbind it) to some key I will never press. The auto run continues to activate whenever I push to caps lock despite the keybindings showing that should no longer be the case.

The Lore is a fun combo of Victorian and Low Fantasy that feels very good. The Mechanics are fairly unique and give a learning curve most survival games don't end up with. 

The game is built to be first person. Particularly combat. I prefer 3rd Person and at first did a fair bit of the combat in First Person. Once I got used to it I found that I could hit the weak points on mobs fairly easily in Third Person. 

The Realms, Realm Cards, and progression adds a really fun element to the game. I very much enjoy all of it. 

The game is highly grind oriented. Progression is heavily staggered. Which basically means the game play loop is Story Point, explore, fight, farm, craft, story point. I don't mind it but it could be an issue for some. 

I'm very much enjoying the game. I really hope that there will be an increase to the build limit though. The game is so neat I'd love to do some of the big builds we see in other games. However right now UE5 makes that difficult.

I like the fact that if a friend of mine decided to join i can give them an access card and they can be in my realm while i'm offline. I haven't had any of the lag issues everyone is bringing up. The loading time can be a bit annoying but other then that i don't mind it. I know this does bug a lot of people though so maybe introducing an option later could help. 

I dot have some qualms about the character creation but its very clear they are still working on it. The tutorial needs a little help as well. Which has been mentioned a lot. Also being a massive theater, mythology lore geek I personally do not mind the way Puck talks to interacts but I know a lot of people are going to struggle to understand him or listen to his rhyming and Shakespearean type talk constantly.  A little more personality to him wouldn't hurt either as Puck was a fae of mischief. 

I definitely think some balancing of the enemies would help as the normal enemies are a bit easy. The first boss i think was fine for a first boss encounter. I haven't gotten much past that yet.

I know its early access but holy moly there were a ton of bugs from the get go. I couldn't even accept the T.O.S. without the game crashing, because as it turns out, for me at least, I could scroll TOO far down on them and if I accepted then insta-crash to desktop. Took me 3 crashes to figure that out.

On the very first quest of collect so many items, I had collected more than what I needed, and tried to build a campfire as requested. Trying to navigate through the menus to figure out why I couldn't build a campfire only to find that this too was bugged, and once I destroyed the items and recollected them, then the quest progressed and I could build the campfire.

At one point the quick wheel of weapons switched the icons randomly to hand gestures or something?

Like other people pointed out the always online latency issues. The combat is super clunky. The menus and controller default mapping is non intuitive.

Really the only thing I did enjoy was exploring the world. The biomes are interesting and unique, the graphics are decent, the enemy designs also look good and interesting.

But for me that doesn't warrant a 30 dollar price tag. I've played a ton of early access survival games and I ultimately decide to keep playing based on what is there currently and if I feel like they could turn it into a viable product in a reasonable amount of time. This game I just don't think they will, there's just too much wrong.

What I Liked:

- building system is decent, place blueprints and auto build if you have the resources on hand
- minor realm cards provide some variation to each realm

What I Disliked:

- combat, too call it bad would be a massive understatement, hit mob, circle them, repeat until they die
- no crafting from storage, this should be a standard feature in every survival game at this point
- crafting system, overly complicated, some crafting times are way too long and multiple tiers of resources
- copy pasted content, yeah you'll see that first puzzle you solve in every biome, I saw it twice in the first biome and again in the next and enjoy fighting the same Automaton bosses over and over again but with more HP and maybe 1 additional attack
- time wasting mechanics galore, already mentioned long craft times and no crafting from storage, additionally the low starting carry weight means many trips back and forth with wood and stone to build a base, needing to harvest remains instead of mobs instantly dropping resources, RNG resource drops from mobs (need 1 more hide but have to kill 5 wolves to get it then next 5 each drop one), repairing items with essence instead of no durability or free repair at the workbench
- UI is slightly better but still pretty bad
- Online only, not much to say here other than if I'm playing solo let me play offline, performance was awful day 1 but better on day 2 but I'm on a 4090/I9-13900K/64GB RAM
- animations for enemies and harvested rocks/trees are terrible
- many things in game look like store bought assets

The game feels like it was made in 2015 and it has so many foundational problems I can't see it ever being worth investing any significant time into. Even if it was delayed another year or two I don't think it would have made much difference. Right now I cannot recommend Nightingale.

At the end of the tutorial you have to go kill 3 waves of enemies, super easy, but if you do so BEFORE the portal opens, the portal will never open, so you have to kite them until the portal opens, then kill them and or walk trough. I'm unsure if there are game breaking bugs beyond this, but so far I've only heard of minor bugs past this point that can be lived with. If the portal does not open due to this bug, the only other solution is to remake your character and start over. I'm honestly not trying to sway anyone one way or another, if you feel you can follow the steps and patiently wait to kill them until the portal opens, you will most likely enjoy what you find beyond it game wise. But if you would rather wait a week or so for a better fix for this and other bugs, that would also be a good idea. Mainly I'm just trying to provide this issue to people BEFORE they encounter the bug as currently I haven't seen any review mention this one in particular and as I stated, it is game breaking 100%.

I have been following this game for over a year, and was very excited for its release. I haven't had any server issues so far, but I see how that is a big negative for some people depending on where you live.

I love survival craft games, like Valheim, 7 Days to Die, Enshrouded etc. So if you enjoy those types of games, this one is REALLY cool. I've seen a lot of bad reviews with only an hour or so played, and it absolutely takes longer than that to really get into the game. Only about 29% of players have even passed the first ""Boss"" at the end of the starter tutorial at this point. So take those reviews with a grain of salt.
 The UI can use some work, it feels very similar to 7 Days in my opinion. I am sure with all the feedback, this is something that will be improved on. 6 Hours in, and in our two player server we have just started adding cards to our current realm (which can change the appearance of the realm its-self, SUPER cool!!) , upgrading gear, and preparing to really get into the realm-hopping aspect. The only thing that has bothered me enough to comment on at this point is when using the cross-bow type weapon you can craft at the start, the reloading feels a little clunky and the shots don't always seem to register as a hit when an enemy is right in front of you.  But again - VERY early access. This is only day 2, and I am overall blown away.

The game encourages you to take your time, explore, build and puzzle solve (BIG fan of the puzzle solving so far) and if that sounds like your kind of thing than this will be a very enjoyable experience for you. Easy 9/10 for someone who enjoys pretty survival craft games, and WELL worth the $40(canadian) price point.",1708566641,1708566641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Nightingale has so much going for it, a wonderful theme with charming art and style which can enrapture you for a while, but afterwards you'll start to question why you're playing.

Some of the common issues:
[list]
    [*]Enemies do gymnastics/aerobics so to make combat possible devs made melee combat not require aiming, taking any sense of satisfying hits out of it.
    [*]Enemy AI frequently tries to go walkabouts instead of attacking the player, very annoying on clear enemies task
    [*]""Intellect"" challenges are mostly just struggling to find where the plinths/pillars are for 10 minutes
    [*] The maps are big without enough interesting points of interest to justify it, which just results in travelling feeling like a chore
    [*]Alot of things have an arbitrary ""wait time"", possibly for some kind of server communication, but generally results in the player standing around doing nothing
    [*]Vendors don't really sell alot and hope echoes give rng stuff instead of the thing you might want, I spent so long trying to find a way to get a window blueprint to put in the window wall but ended up giving up trying to find one.
    [*]The ""always online"" aspect results in the player having to alt tab for two minutes to open a portal, then wait another 1-2 minutes to load the map, it also has sometimes resulted in me not being able to ""login"" to the game, as well as buy blueprints from vendors. I've been told there's some end game stuff that its used for but I honestly don't see the point.
    [*] There is a lot of quality of life issues, from crafting and inventory management, to simple things like being able to see the level/gear requirement to get into an area
    [*] It's a wondrous fae realm, yet I'm mostly fighting naked men with clubs, wolves, bears and boars with the occasional automaton, considering the setting this is insanely bland.

We were told ahead of time that it would require internet connectivity to play. Literally just go to Google, type ""nightingale offline"" and look at that nice list of articles / coverage (you don't even need to click on the links) explaining that it is not offline. WOW MAGIC! While the game does allow you to play solo (which you can do in pretty much any game including most MMOs nowadays), you are still being connected to the servers for various things such as the social hubs which exist outside of your instanced realm. Ever play Guild wars 1, Warframe, etc? Similar in a way to that. Sure you CAN play solo, but you still need to be connected because of those existing features whether you choose to use them or not. I also assume that they plan on eventually expanding a bit on the social aspects / features / content down the road, so this needs to be in place to lay the foundation for that.

Anyway, enough ranting about idiocy. On to the review so far:

Nightingale is off to a pretty good start. Is it the best game ever? No. Does it have the potential to be a really solid, possibly even great game? Definitely. 

The world / setting and design of the game are very interesting, and the card system for the biomes / realms is a nice twist that allows you to not only go to specific biomes with varying degrees of difficulty but also adds the ability to modify that realms in various ways for everyone in it. These modifications (minor cards) often come with both pros and cons and you can choose to get some cool / useful effects for how you want to play in exchange for giving up something else. A couple of examples of this are greatly increasing the loot drops from enemies but in exchange turning it to perpetual night with constant ticking damage being taken, or having much faster move speed, jump height, and reduced stamina cost at the expense of your tools losing durability faster. Its a nice way to shake things up a bit from the static worlds we typically see in survival games, while also not being a system where you just stack bonus on top of bonus until you become ridiculously OP and the game just feels too boring / easy.

For those planning to pick the game up, or who maybe haven't gotten quite that far yet, the start of the game (unfortunately) is a bit slow paced while learning the ropes. Things like the carry weight limitations can be frustrating, especially if you're like me and initially skip over 1) recruiting the follower right after you leave the tutorial area and 2) forget to craft the sewing bench that you unlock the recipe for which allows you to make a backpack and immediately double your carry weight. I spent a few hours slowly building up a little base which would have been much quicker if I had done those things right off the bat instead of constantly going back and forth with small amounts of materials. Also worth noting is that finishing the ""tutorial"" area, is more like finishing the 1st phase of the tutorial. After setting up your first estate claim, keep going with the quests pretty soon after and you'll learn about and unlock some more stuff (like enchanting / upgrades) pretty quickly.

Once you start getting a little further in and expand the things you are able to do it definitely gets more interesting / fun and you start to see some more of what sets the game apart from other survival games.

The game could use a bit of work / polishing in some areas, some of which theyve also already said they were working on. I play a lot of games with a controller, and while it works great for the most part there are some UI elements that are a pain to navigate with it, and even simply managing your hotbar and switching between your items is a bit annoying and slow / clunky. You have to use D-pad left and D-pad right to cycle through slots 1-5 of each hand / side, and the switching is a bit unresponsive and doesnt work well if you tap it quickly. SO like if you know you need to change 3 slots to switch to a specific tool, you cant just tap it 3 times real fast, you kind of have to delay your presses for it to respond. Alternatively with keyboard its just numbered slots, instant switching by pressing a number.

The combat is decent so far, havent even really gotten into spells / abilities yet, just standard melee combat mixed with the first ranged weapon so I expect it will get a bit more interesting now that I started getting to that point. Nothing groundbreaking, kind of reminds me a lot of playing Conan Exiles, with the same sort clunkiness I always felt playing that. Hopefully they smooth that out a bit with some patches.

The crafting and building I find quite enjoyable. I really wish this type of system of having various types and tiers of the same materials that have various effects existed in more survival games. It adds a whole lot of variety and really allows you to customize your loadout. Biggest downside is not being able to craft using materials in your storage (at least as far as I know so far, I thought the same of Enshrouded until I discovered the magic chests). Conveniences like that should be a pretty standard thing. I mean, it's already been done in plenty of games. You don't need to reinvent the wheel. It's just a QoL thing that should always exist.

So far, for what it's worth I have encountered just 1 actual bug where I got stuck while using my climbing picks. Quick relog fixed it. Haven't run into any major performance issues just running on a couple year old laptop with a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz   2.30 GHz, and only 16 GB of RAM. Have had only 3 or 4 disconnects with only 1 of those not occurring while I was also experiencing slowness with my ISP outside of the game. Not a single crash. Had absolutely no issue completing tutorial.

So if the game / world looks interesting to you, you enjoy survival games but are looking for something with a little bit of a different twist on some aspects, and understand that it is Early Access and some things will need a bit of polishing up (they already released 1 patch to address a few issues including crashes), and aren't on dial up, then disregard the negativity some people are posting and definitely pick it up.",1708566287,1708566287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The setting is refreshingly different, the graphics are cartoony-enough to fit the fey vibe, but beautiful enough to make you stop and stare, the tarot card/portal system has a lot of potential for future development, and I like that they've brought back a few elements that have been missing from survival games recently (like heat/shade mattering). Furthermore, we have some hints of a story (which is practically unheard of in survival games), and there are already some boss fights in the game too.

The game will obviously benefit from further development, but this is one of the most-complete early-access survival games I have seen to date. All of the basics work on day 1, and they are planning to add more from here.

My only real complaints so fare are: 1) enemy ai/pathing leaves something to be desired, 2) your companion is WAY too strong - they can carry too much, and are way too good in combat.

The building and crafting is deep, though as a result it is a bit un-intuitive. This is fine though, in my opinion, as the game very much sets itself up as mysterious, with a lot to discover, and the crafting plays into that.

That's one of the big pro's for me in this game. The atmosphere of mystery and intrigue that the world builds is very exciting.

I'm only a dozen or so hours in so it remains to be seen if they can deliver on these mysteries, but the opening has me intrigued if not invested.

I will say, the UI and navigation through menus and inventory could use a lot of polish, especially on controller. In particular:

- The fact that the location of buttons is context dependent, and thus inconsistent, is jarring (for example, the button to sort items is in one place when looking through your own items and then in a completely different spot when talking to your companion)
- There should be a hotkey to take all items from a container, maybe there is and I just haven't found it, but if there is, it should be more apparent. 
- There should also be a button to deposit additional stacks of items that are already in a container.

These are small quality of life improvements to inventory management that are pretty standard in modern survival games, so it's really noticeable that they aren't present. I'm sure it's on the roadmap to add.

That being said, I would absolutely recommend the game, with the caveat that it is clearly not finished. If you're looking for a well-polished and complete survival game, I advise you to look outside of early-access titles, but if you're interested in checking this game out while they're still working on it, there is absolutely enough here to take a bite of and come back to later once it's finished.

Palworld got all the hype and while fun and silly i got bored pretty fast once the gimmick had worn thin. Enshrouded just didn't appeal to me as an EA title and then we have Nightingale which while also very Early in EA is from some a high pedigree of developers and  looks unbelievably stunning with its Lumen based GI and fantastic art direction

I respect others complaints that they have been airing in the discussions and steam reviews. I understand why people are frustrated and disappointed that this is Online only and i agree that the developers need to rectify this asap and offer an offline option.

The game does feel very playable for an EA title. There is a little jank here and there but lets be hones  - what crafting game doesn't. ARK is almost a decade old and still has incredible amounts of jank and lets not talk about Ascended.

What Nightingale offers is a wonderfully whimsical and mysterious setting. The pace feels much slower than other titles i have played but in a welcome way. Once i got past the tutorial stages and into my first main biome i felt instantly relaxed as i set about building my first home. I cleared out some wolves living nearby and collected resources as the sunset on the horizon and showed the Lumen lighting system in its full glory. As dusk drew near and the temperature became too cold to work comfortably i retired into my newly built house, lit a fire and ate a small meal before resting.

While others complaints are valid - menus can be a bit cumbersome, online is a pain, there is a bit of jank here and there, more content is needed - i do think that people tend to focus too much on the negatives. Instead of posting constructive feedback in the provided forums they instead resort to unfairly negative reviews or worse attacking others who enjoy the game in the discussions. Expectations for this game were high and Gamers tend to be pretty reactive these days unfortunately. Given the callibre of the team and the support they have from investors it's pretty obvious that as this game develops and grows it will be something truly unique and special in the survival genre offering familiar tropes while presenting it in a new and interesting way.

First impressions for me are excitement and curiosity. I want to see what the rest of this world has to offer and i want to spend more time in this world. The building mechanics are really nice. I love how you can blueprint out the structure of your building and then set about gathering the necessary resources. Being able to visualise the structure before you commit is a really nice touch. The character creation while missing some features shows you that it is well thought out and will be pretty decent once they have a bit more time to fully flesh it out.

For me this is a recommend IF you are comfortable with Early Access games knowing that its not feature complete, knowing that there are things that need ironing out and understanding as with all EA games that there is a risk involved with jumping in early. 

While there are a flurry of new survival based games this is the one that has captured my attention because of its unique world,  style and story. If you have the right system to run it properly it looks stunning. It's a relaxing game to play that never feels like it's trying to put too much pressure on you and instead wants you to soak in its atmosphere and explore its world.",1708547409,1708563171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Maybe something like a resting position like sitting by a fire could reduce the speed which you lose energy and hunger. 

A lot of the server issues will be worked out as the game develops and more regional servers become available. It's early access and it shows signs of it but that's to be expected. It's not done yet and has lots of work to come. 

The combat feels pretty decent, weapons and armours are nice and varied, enchanting them with skills is unique and a nice addition. Realm generation is a really cool way of generating small worlds to explore and everything is incredibly beautiful. Creatures are super unique compared to the reused ideas from most other games.

I wish there was more control over the customisation of your character as well as a way to adjust your appearance afterwards.

This game really falls short, especially when compared to other Early Access games that have been released in the last few months. 
The number one problem, and it has been persistent since launch is disconnections from [b] ""network error""[/b].
[h3][h2] Number one reason to avoid: [/h2] [/h3]
 - The always online feature is baffling, it makes 0 sense for a survival game and even less sense for a game 
   that is single player as an option. 
   It has been a constant problem since release. You'll be mid boss fight, mid dungeon or mid farming and just 
   get kicked to the title screen. Its happened around 20 times in the last 24 hrs. 
   I have gig internet, and my network runs everything else fine. This isn't an issue anyone should be having 
   in a solo game. 

 [h3][h3] Game Play [/h3] 
 - The game play loop so far has been to stare at the ground, or a tree trunk gathering. 
 You're giving about a half dozen crafting and half dozen refining tables very early, but most items don't say 
 what they do, or how to use them. 

 [h3][b] Gathering [/b] [/h3]
 - You will spend almost ALL of your time gathering resources and walking back and fourth to your base to unload the resources you've gathered. 
I love the resource grind usually, but this feels terrible, low yield, low storage/carry weight and a burdensome amount to craft housing items. 

 [h3][b] Combat [/b] [/h3]
 - The combat is on par with Waldheim but worse. You swing until stuff is dead. 
The ""Dodge"" mechanic is a joke where you leap 20 yards in the direction you last moved. 
in level 10 armor, I killed multiple lvl 45 mobs using range and my follower and the poorly functioning AI of the mobs. 
 
 [h3] [b] Guidance/Direction [/b] [/h3]
 - There are no real directions/indicators for anything. 
I don't like games that hand hold too much, but there are almost no player ques to indicate when/where/what for items, enchantments, gear comparison, restricted areas, etc. Areas with high level mobs/restricted look identical to areas you can just walk into, and nothing tells you why you can't enter an area (gear score, story progress? idk) 
You'll end up on the internet asking ""how do you use X""

 [h3][b] Visuals [/b] [/h3]
 - Visually, the game is very good looking. I've had a few visual bugs but overall its been fine. 
I am running it on Ultra setting. With settings at ultra, It uses about 98% of my GPU memory, I average 30fps and it uses around 30% CPU. 
i-9990k

I am playing solo, and I know a lot of folks are having concerns with forced online play but I believe this is due to the endgame being an multiplayer hub. Do not know if that is fully implemented yet, but that it likely why it's entirely online.

I find the art to be lovely. The character designs stylistic and full of... well... character. Combat takes a little getting used to with the stamina being sucked away quickly having to be used for both attack and defense. Third person needs some work, but it's experimental so that's to be expected.

Really what has me most enthralled is the story. I love how there is just enough of a central thread to keep me moving in a direction but I can go at my own pace. Having that central line gives me something to keep pushing for, and personally I find most other survival games far too lacking in that regard.

Sadly, this game is just lacking in a lot of areas even for just the tutorial part. 
As someone who gets motion sick easily I prefer to play in third person mode, which this game has. But the running animation is the goofiest thing I've ever seen and I can't bear to stare at it for hours on end. (I did do extreme mode so my character was naked, maybe it just looked weird because of that).
I only visited the first two areas of which felt extremely empty. I get it's the tutorial but I haven't watched any game play so I can't judge on the later areas, only what I've encountered. 
A big no for me is when there are no animations for what I'm doing. Gathering herbs, wood, rock had no animation or sometimes a very weak hand swinging animation to grab them. The building has NO animations what so ever. You just place what you want to build down and then it instantly crafts when you put the resources into it. Feels a bit lazy. Even the cooking has no animations at all. 
The building felt lackluster, you're very limited to rotating which also felt like a weird rotate angle of about 40 degrees. No creativity to be had there. I even heard online the building limit is 300. That's way too little for a game based around building.
Lastly, the UI... The UI just bothers me and I believe it's the fact that it's overly basic and over complicated. Basic as in the way it appears; blank background, standard text writing, bland boarder. And over complicated with how everything is organised. It's hard to navigate and easy to get frustrated over.
The game looks great, it has cool and unique mechanics such as flying with an umbrella and teleporting to different lands. I'm hoping the game gets frequent updates and does get better. Hence why I'm listing the issues that I personally see in the game and believe should be fixed. I'd love to come back and sink a lot of hours into this game, I'm obsessed with survivals.

If this game has been on your radar for a while and if you're on the fence because of the negative reviews, give it a try yourself.
Btw awesome art style!!

Edit: After playing a few more hours my opinion I can comment more on the gameplay side. Combat feels sluggish and difficult in the wrong kind of way. I started in hard difficulty because I like a challenge and it feels like it just turns enemies into big hp sponges. AI is janky, in some cases I walked straight into their faces and they did not register me. They have pathing issues, which you can abuse by standing on some ramps or low-ceiling places that they cannot reach and spam your ranged weapon. Even the first boss was cheeseable this way, I just walked up the ramp which lead to the boss room. This could easily be solved by placing a traditional ""boss gate"" which locks you inside the arena.
It lacks many quality of life features that other survival games has. Another downside is very long stretches of walks, I had to do many corpse runs between my base and the first dungeon. It took 5 minutes each and it sucked because there's nothing interesting on the way there.
NPC companion is also pretty useless, other than reviving you sometimes. You cannot order them around and I couldn't even make them use the better weapon I crafted for them.

I still think this game has a good potential and I hope the devs take their time to listen to the community and iron out the kinks. In this state it feels unpolished to me and I cannot recommend it yet.",1708478764,1708560604,False,0,0,0.503058075904846191,0,True,False,True

It is indeed Early Access and I see lots of issues, bugs, and a few server disconnects. I'm not too worried about that provided the game gets a lot of developer love over time. Because the game itself is quite fun and addictive! I need to use F5 to go into 3rd-person mode since 1st person gives me a headache after a while.

Needs some help to make it better...
  ●  Hail and rain occur too often.
  ●  Need a cheap way to prevent shrub/sticks/plant re-spawn while building (no fun getting weeds popping up in your pristine home)
  ●  Needs balance in early game for the default medium setting
  ●  Better co-op with larger parties and persistent realms
  ●  Improve clunky UI
  ●  Resolve server disconnects (even if playing solo)
  ●  Fix the freezing when trying to add resources to many multiple placed building components at once
  ●  Don't let us accidentally destroy our home when we chop nearby trees
  ●  Performance setting for graphics is hideous, and the forced resolution upscaling is pretty ugly

Otherwise it's a fun game loop of exploring and crafting to progress. Just keep that in mind: you unlock things by exploring, crafting, and trading. There is no unlocking progression by just killing mobs alone. Personally I find that refreshing.

Also, for those in which this is important: Early Access right now has zero accessibility options, but the placeholder is there in options for future releases.",1708559814,1708559914,True,3,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,True

why the fuck does single player experience require a server?
couldn't you run one inside the client like singleplayer minecraft does or any other sane co-op like Valheim?
who did this to you, who made that choice? 


combat is very bad
progression is a disaster
gaslamp fantasy my ass - I'm still running with a stupid slingbow, not even a basic gun
you start wearing a cool costume and progress into crafting a hobo rags, which are ""better""
no real weapon - stone age victorianism, huh
much of the crafting is built in a very weird way, you have acces to many unexplained things which are given in order that makes no sense, and the things are useless anyways, for many hours
the game throws 10-12 laggy bound at you, which hit like a truck, fights are long, boring and very laborious - the only way to kill them is to simply kite and shoot - you can't progress to be on somewhat samish level
harvesting is grindy as hell, you spend minutes on dangerous mobs just to get resources worth 1 healing salve

you can be kiled while teleporting to respite

oh, did I mention you have to endure long connections to your home realm just to craft something now?

Your character can get stranded in the Tutorial if the portal at the the end of the Tutorial fails to open for your toon.  There is no work-a-round for this bug, you can only start a new character and hope that it does not happen a second time.  Well it happened to me 2 times in a row and past the 2 hour mark for a refund.  I should also note that this bug was known to the Devs well in advance of its early access release, so make of that what you will.  

Also, like many others, I don't understand the ""Always Connected"" requirement of this game while playing solo.  Consequently, I was experiencing numerous sever connection failures during my solo Tutorial game play.

Lore/world design is pretty good and has just enough flavor to be interesting but not overwhelm you like some clockwork/steampunk games. You see hints of it around but they don't slam airships into your face (at least initially) saying ""VICTORIAN ENGLAND EH MATE?"" 

The graphics are pretty good but not earth shattering, they have to be kinda malleable since a lot of your actions change the world (realm) around you so it kinda makes sense. It almost feels like Spore or No Man's Sky when it comes to the fauna/flora. Its a little offputting at first seeing a neon pink and green deer, but hey it works. 

The core gameplay loop takes a bit to get started and it can be a bit rough figuring out what exactly you're doing and how to make it most effective. I see a lot of people yelling about always online, but if you squint you can kinda see why. This game is basically no man's sky, victorian edition. 

In a perfect world, you link realms with a friend, go off to explore new ones and hop back to your respective places to stash things. The servers are a little slow so you get some kinda gnarly load times hopping back and forth so its not as smooth as it probably should be. (A simple out of the box fix would be some kinda storage that teleports your gains back home...or something like that). 

The social stuff is a little glitchy and sometimes you'll join a party member, sometimes not. There's some missing features that make it kinda feel half baked. 

Overall, it probably needed another 6 months in the oven, but its still fun to play if you enjoy pseudo survivals. You don't need to worry about hosting a server for your pals (just unlock the realm share card) and even solo it can be a fun exploration simulator in that same vein as NMS. If you didn't like NMS at all, and you're burnt out on early access survival games then move along.

In time, I am sure this will be a fantastic title however it suffers from extremely annoying bugs and server issues. 2024 should be the year of survival games and bugs it seems. So, if you want the short and sweet here's a list of pros and cons, however if you are on the fence about purchasing this game. GIVE IT TIME.

Pros
- The game is beautiful with few performance issues, yet my 4070 Ti was keeping at 60 fps with OBS running so that's pretty decent. This is also at max settings at 2k res.
- Having all of the different materials to making the best gear that you want is awesome! However, this runs in with a problem later!
- The story so far is really great the VA's did a great job, and as a person who doesn't really care about story I would say the story and atmosphere really carry this game.

Cons
- The first boss is a shambling mess. Granted I did play on extreme difficulty just the idea that the boss spams an instant attack with no tell or pause was super strange. I had to cheese this boss after dying 10 times. Which is just a starter on how early combat was.
- Getting gear is abysmal. I had my tier 1 simple gear for 10 hours. Only then to upgrade their stats later on. Still don't have any crafting recipes, yet I do have all the augmentations. Just gear progression in this game is not fun nor fulfilling. I basically had to cheese many enemies in order to get enough essence for a weapon. 
- You get spells without ever knowing how the hell to equip the spells until you finally upgrade. Then, once I had the spells I never used them, because I was already used to not having them. Just a whole lot of ambiguity even when the game has a whole how to section that is half filled out. 

Also, here's a bonus. I spent 30 minutes killing a rare deer only for the turd to spin uncontrollably on the ground and zip off into the sunset. 

Don't get me wrong this game will get better with time I am sure of it, but right now if you are hesitant on buying it. Wait.",1708556805,1708556805,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I realize its early access so some of these things might change and get better with time, So I am not gonna refund im just gonna lay it to the side for now. 

Just a few things that have irritated me so far. 
Quality of life:
 Coming from Palworld (which i also think has alot of improvement needed) this game had even less QoL then Palworld does. Not being able to craft from your storage when everything takes stone blocks/woodblocks is ridiculous, basically have to keep running back and forth and collecting 11 wood and throwing it into the building then running back out to grind instead of collecting a bunch and just going to town on building your base. Not to mention a basic house takes about 200 wood blocks. OOF. 

Gameplay: 
If you're more of an adventurer and not a crafter/builder like me you might like the game more. The world is very beautiful and interesting. One downside is the moment i decided to do some adventuring to get a crafting blueprint from a settlement they ended up dropping like 5-6 more crafting tables on my head. Everything requires like 2-3 crafting tables along with gathering to create an item which i feel is just a bit over the top. 

I wont go on to long because i know this game will change alot over the next year or so, but hopefully they fix some of these glaring issues and make the more of an enjoyable experience. Its hard coming from palworld where stuff barely costs anything to craft and build i was throwing up bases in an hour. This game took me 2 hours to build a 10 wall house. 

TLDR: Game is a bit behind its competition as of right now, and i wouldnt recommend buying into it just yet. Theres a great game here waying to flourish its just not there yet, and hopefully it will be with time. QoL issues and along with some lag and graphical issues plague this game.

While I love adventure-centric games with lighter survival elements, I think I had been missing a game that's willing to get crunchier with the crafting and the survival elements. Gaslamp fantasy matches that really well too imo. The tone for the narrative it sets is really good, and even just how much of that it has for a survival/craft game. And idk, Faewilds kind of works too well to embrace the weirdness of procedural generation into something that adds to the experience instead of something that should be masked from the players. QoL of crafting from chests has been announced as wip already, but idk, it was weird for a moment but setting up my containers in a way that makes sense for what I plan to use their contents at instead of just having a container area has been making some of my builds more interesting as usable spaces.

Problems I have with it are only that I can't fully disable upscalling or lumen, and that even though it has a great character creation system with options you can build pretty cool characters with for some reason it launched into EA with the most horrendous presets.

The portal system, while at first a bit confusing, is actually fantastic. It reminds me a lot of NMS in that way, being able to go from realm-to-realm and experience different things, different creatures, etc. I've been really enjoying obtaining the lore from wandering around the realms.

However I want to say what's true and what's not. As alot of people can't connect they could be further from the servers so take that with a grain of salt and im sure it's something they are working on. As far as  the offline players, I hate it for them, but you can't judge a game for you not having solid either net connection to wifi. As far as the game and it's performance I played for a solid 2-3 hours and did not crash once, I have a 3060, 5600x, 32gb ram, rocking 1440p and it ran around 60 fps with everything at medium settings. Of course the game does need some optimization fixes, but you can't expect a early access game to be perfect. I believe it's DLSS or Anti-Aniliasing but it makes the plants have. Weird black box spectacle around them. But while the game runs on unreal 5 the game still looks beautiful with my settings. As far as that the game ran great, I've not got real far but this review is subject to change. But from what I've played it's ran great and I was very intrigued by alot of the games mechanics. Game has a nice MMO feel with nice speed up mechanics that make the mundane simple survival game tactics and makes them seamless and fun. Im intrigued to keep play as I have followed this game since its been announced. So with that I say pick up the game and give it a try. I will come back and edit this on further playing.

Edit: They put out a update the next day of release to fix memory allocation and some crash fixes, pretty big step. Game is still holding good, overall still a good game from what ive seen.

After spending an hour with the game and encountering a common bug that blocks you from exiting the tutorial I decided to refund it. I can take general bugs and lack of polish from an early access game, but a game breaking bug that won't let you progress gave me enough info about the current state of the game to not want to continue for now. The general state of the UI and gameplay loop is also a bit underwhelming and there are many better options in the genre. 

The devs are definitely listening and trying to do their best to rapidly improve the game, but I think this needs another 6-12 months before taking a serious look at it.

Whilst I haven't played much of it so far, I would say the game is just.. okay. I can see what the devs were going for and later down the line, I can see this being a really good game, providing it gets the love and support it needs, but in it's current state, as I said, it's just okay. 

So, you might be asking, What are the pro's and cons of the game? Well, we will start with the pro's I guess..

+ Beautiful design, The style of the game is actually the main thing that drew me in.
+ Potential for the game is extremely high.
+ The music is quite fitting and relaxing, I've just stood there and watched time pass, whilst listening to the music. It's so chill.

Yeah, sadly so far from my experience, that is where the pro's end and the con's begin.

- Animations don't seem to be a thing when it comes to doors, again, another small thing.
- Map sizes are really small, It takes a few minutes to get from one side to the other, at least from what I have seen so far. I was expecting to do a lot of exploring of vast expanses, But all I have been able to do is scale a somewhat small mountain.
- No Biome diversity, I was kind of expecting loads of different biomes like snow, etc.. from what I can gather at the moment, we only have forest, swamp and desert? Also, why is it that we can't mix biomes? I would one day love to have an icy forest with a mountain region.. or a swamp with forest nearby.. 
- Online at all times? Really? As someone with not so stable internet, that's kind of a off putting factor for me. 
- There doesn't seem to be much separating it from other survival/craft games.. Even the realm travelling doesn't really capture me as it's just a loading screen, I could go back to ARK for kind of the same experience but much better time.
- The UI is all over the place and quite a pain to find stuff, when it comes to building.. I enjoy that I can add stuff to the entire build but storage is a nightmare.

Cons: Many bugs and quirks. Having to press E a million times while farming up mats in annoying. Love trees?

At $29.99 (even cheaper the first week of launch) I don't see how you could go wrong - deep crafting system, great base building system,  and once you start to figure out how the realms work and why to go to them, the more things start making sense.

I should have the option for both at least, a solo mode where im not connected to a server and have no lag and another option to go online to play with friends(not that any of them will get this prob, sadge). 

Think Ill thumbs this down because the lag actively hurts the experience of this game. Hoping the devs that these negative reviews to heart.

My game crashes pretty much constantly, especially when traveling between realms.  It will sometimes crash at startup with an error saying there isn't enough GPU memory (LOL).

I do realize this is EA, but I have a hard time excusing the seriousness of these issues with current-gen hardware.  Did they even do any quality control?

The TLDR: this game almost has some innovative systems, but doesn't commit to them, dumbing them down to the lowest common denominator. It also seems to lean into frustrating trends like relying on grind instead of content. As a result, it feels stale (already).

If you love this particular gas-punk reskin of this sort of game, Nightingale might be for you. If you love the grinding experience of diving into a (fairly bland) new survival crafting game and just need a new fix, this game might also be for you.

If you've been playing survival crafting games and are looking for something innovative or thoughtful, you're probably not going to find this game very satisfying. There are a couple new ideas here: some variety in crafting and the system of realm-hopping as a part of the gameplay loop. However, these ideas are minimized by dumbing them down, instead of emphasizing them to make a game with soul. At the same time, the game leans into grindy content for building or crafting--or spam clicking eating consumables every few minutes--as if THOSE are the fun parts of the game, rather than things players do in order to GET TO the fun parts of the game.

This feels like a game where someone had some interesting new ideas for the genre, but then those were stifled by a manager who wanted the gameplay to be more typical. When I see a developer shying away from what makes a game fun/interesting, and focusing on making it more average, I'm not hopeful for the trajectory of this early access project.

I was very excited for this one. I played solo on Medium difficulty and after about 6 network error crashes post-tutorial, I noticed the following things:

- The game is a work of art and some things are beautiful to look at. This is of course, overshadowed by clunky controls (I couldn't even walk up the steps of a wagon)

- Character creation has promise but some choices and graphs/grids are simply unintuitive and redundant. The ancestry tree is a cool gimmick but feels like a mundane chore when you could simply just customize your character's appearance.

- Stamina is incredibly punishing, even at Medium difficulty. I went through the trouble of getting an umbrella (which I was stoked for based on the trailers) and some climbing picks to test them out, only to find out that I could only use either of them for about 2 seconds at max stamina. Yes, even after eating. 

- The tutorial is painstakingly long. And you can't play multiplayer until you've cleared it. Yes, you have to be online for that as well.

- The graphics I can overlook, but the resource gathering did not look smooth at all and felt very unpolished. This game has the unfortunate timing of going live right after other successful crafting survival games and is comparable in price, but not quality.

TLDR: The game has promise but feels veeery unfinished in its current state.

So after a couple hours I think I'm in the middle for Nightingale. I'm having fun with it, but it's definitely an early access game. I'm still doing tutorial stuff so haven't ventured into other realms on my own yet, but the procedural generation for the tutorial and starting worlds was pretty good, I haven't encountered anything weird.

The NPCs can be a little uncanny though, as you can have some follow and help you but they're kind of emotionless and the AI for them isn't smart. I haven't run into any issues yet with connectivity though, but I've only played solo so far.

Aiming for interaction is really small though, I'm gonna look in settings next time to see if there's a way to make it a larger target. Technically the game seems to be 1st person, but I was getting a bit motion sick and thankfully they have an experimental 3rd person mode that works fine. (There's also an arachnophobia mode which I'm grateful for, although I haven't run into any spiders yet.)

Also as far as customization goes it's really only for the head/hair/face, the body is just one of 2 presets. I'm hoping they have body customization down the line, and if it's as detailed as for the head I'll be spending hours on it.

tl;dr: It's an early access game and feels it, but there's a lot of charm and promise. I'm used to alpha and beta testing games, so went in with that mindset.

if you are aware how things go and can look past potential issues, then Nightingale is basically exactly what it says in the trailers.
the survival aspects are as common as they get, but the real star of the show is the weird environments and the realm gates that let you explore all sorts of different worlds.
the visuals and sound are phantastic and so is the resulting atmosphere. 

and if you are in doubt: just wait. Nightingale has a lot of potential and a good basis. if you are patient then you will most likely get a good survival & crafting game with some unique elements to it.

After playing for an hour I realize why. In the first hour I created a big list of problems. Even after working through these little issues, I gave up playing because I just cant seem to figure our what i'm supposed to be doing.  There is no clear understanding how to do anything other than run around and collect things.  Below is the list of problems I saw.


Beginning ______FIRST WINDOW___
	-The arrow that pops up/ disappears when you click a tab means nothing, just remove it. When I click a tab switch to it, thats it. Dont add or remove an arrow. The tab is already highlighted with the border around it. 

	-I personally dont care about what my character looks like, but i know a lot of other people do. Instead of having a random assortment of character faces, create an interface that allows the user to use the already existing character creation generator. Allow the user to put in the variables that influence the tool. Kind of how the ""age feature"" works.
	
	-""Anestry tab"" / Story -  Reading the small interface is kind of difficult. you can only fit like 5 words across that interface. Instead of having a side pop out feature in the menu you can create an overhead with a description. You can keep the tab that comes out but keep it small and allow the user to cycle through the options. Each options will create a description above the character that is being created. So the sentences can be longer.

	-""Ancestry tab"" / Lineage - What does this even mean? I have parents? so what?

	-""Ancestry tab"" / Inheritance - This should be combines with the Basics tab. The modeling doesnt make any sense either. If choosing your parents means something, the model i create should be a child of them. I choose two character models that were the same person but got different results from the top and bottom when ""blending"" the inheritance. What do the sides of the inheritance window mean? Its just two random face portraits.

	- when scrolling through the tabs dont allow the user to hang between tabs. Auto-lock onto a tab while scrolling. Get nearest tab type of thing. Like when you click on the tab. It auto locks/ half the time.

	- gave up working through the rest of the character screen
___Next window______
cut scene
	- I couldnt really hear/ understand the narrator very well. I turned up my volume a lot too. I think to make the scene more dramatic there needs to be a few more pauses between the sentences with different/ more dramatic animations.

___Next window______
 
""unknown Realm"" 
	- This interface is amazing. Super simple, easy to understand and use.

"" on character first spawn""
	- I had to go to the bathroom, when I tap escape key / ""pause the game"" the game needs to pause lol. Animations behind the menu need to pause as well/ unless i am playing multiplayer. otherwise i dont know if the game is actually paused.

""Inventory menu""
	- The character scroll is all messed up. It works, but its not what you expect it to do. All the controls feel messed up. Copy the movement from the SIMS 4 character creation screen. That feels normal. 


Amazing environment. 
-      Great dialogue.

I feel like the conversations just keep going and going, I dont know when theyre supposed to end. Like i just keep clicking to advance them. - simple thing-

The game needs more tutorial when spawning into the forest the first time. I only know 'J' is the key to click because ive played games for a while. Some people haven't and they need more help to understand what they're doing. The journal entry text should have some notification on the main screen to let the player know why they're in the world and what they're supposed to be doing. Otherwise they will feel lost. 

The game graphics are amazing
          -The ocean is a little messed up though, it looks like there is some kind of ""film"" on top of it.

        - weird physics boundaries in starting region.

Ignore the negative reviews complaining about it being an online game. The company said more than once that it was an online game, it's not their fault that people don't listen and then complain about something that was pointed out Before launch. Yeah it's a bummer you can't solo play during server downtime but it's no different from playing an mmorpg, get used to it, it's not that big a deal. Take that time as a break from your computer.
 
It's a good game. Yes the enemy AI are pretty basic but the game does get harder as you progress so don't listen to reviews from people with next to no time in the game, they're no better than people who say an MMORPG is boring when they didn't get past level 20. People just like to complain.

To be frank this is a game that I've been waiting for and looking forward to for a long time. I knew there were gonna be issues at launch and I was prepared for as much. Though I don't think I've seen such a messy launch since M&B: Bannerlord.

Do keep in mind this is early access and I've only sunk about 4 hours into this game. However, my thoughts so far is that the game is frankly great. There's a lot to see and there's a lot to do, and the stuff you can do in this game is presented in managable bite-sized portions as to not overwhelm you. While I'm mostly positive to this approach, it does come with the issue that a TON of the cool feautures are locked behind a progression wall. Most of the things you see in the trailer is stuff you'll only be doing once you've sunk more than 2 hours into it. The game makes an attempt at showing you interesting areas and the way you can combine cards in order to shape the world to your liking. So far though this has been limited to selecting between a few different biomes (forest, desert, swamp that I've seen so far) that you're forced to experience during the tutorial. Point is, this game has a lot of depth which makes me wanna see more, but it takes a lot of time to get to a point where the game is *playable*. Which is an issue for a game that heavily advertises its online features.

Speaking of online. Why can't I play ACTUAL singleplayer. Why am I forced to connect to the servers depite having no intention of playing with others? I wasn't warned that this would be the case at all. Frankly, even if I was I wouldn't expect that I'd be forced to connect to servers across the continent?? The ping lag is insane sometimes, hippos suddenly learns how to fly just to turn you to mincemeat a second later. It's BAD unless you're close to wherever these servers are. I can't see any positives to this other than corners being cut and dollars saved. At the cost of alienating more than 70% of the global population.

Also the performance is garbage, and the mininum requirements are a lie. While I don't doubt you'd be able to start the game with those specs, I seriously doubt it'll be a good experience.

Last criticism I wanna make is that I just don't like the companion system this game has. My experience with this mechanic was definitely negatively impacted by the server issue mentioned before, However, this game could've done something so much more interesting than regular ol' companions following you around like a dog, just executing random orders like a pokemon. It's weird, like a robot wearing human skin following me around doing random tasks. This system could've been greatly improved if something other than humans were used. Like tiny fae creatures that help you out, like in stardew valley how the junimos will harvest crops for you. Having a random dude just follow me around feels weird and I don't like it.

If you've gotten this far you may wonder why I recommend this game. I'm gonna be honest and say I'm not sure about recommending it, but I'm going to because in spite of all this I think this game's positives outweigh the negatives. If any of the points above is gonna be deal-breaker then don't buy the game, but if you think you could deal with it then definitely buy it. Because underneath the heap of garbage there's a gem. A gem that needs polish, but a gem non-theless.

As mentioned before I like how the game is presented in bite-sizes. Although the tutorial is way too long. I like the magic in this game, I like the crafting, I like the building, I like the combat. All of these mechanics feel great to engage with. The atmosphere of the game is something I'd describe as cozy, even though the conversations you have with the weird Puck guy would make you think you're about to die. The game has charm, and I can't get enough of it. It's refreshing to play after a bunch of survival-crafters put out the same formula over and over again. And the mechanics work well together, they just need to be polished to a shine (and also take out the garbage laying on top).

Additionally any time I needed to go through a portal to a new realm (the main selling point of the game) I would wait for the portal to generate for 3-4 minutes, and then 100% of the time get disconnected when going through the portal.  After reloading trying again it would succeed.

Being forced to play on ""official servers"" in a game where I don't encounter anyone organically is an insane choice just to collect data for early access.  

There is no solo/offline option, and there is no private server option.

In addition to the server related issues there are a number of quality of life or gameplay decisions that just don't make sense at all.  Everything in the game feels like a chore, which is kind of a staple of this genre, but instead of the staple dopamine hit you get when completing the chore, I just feel aggravated it took as long as it did.

Chopping down a tree takes forever, then you have to wait for it to fall, and then wait for the server to catch up and generate the Wood bundles that are supposed to appear, then you have walk around and pick them each up.  It makes the most basic component of a survival crafting game a time-consuming, irritating experience.

The vibes of the game are very very cool though. I like that there is some story involved.  I like the conceit of the game (just wish it worked better).  I think this game is going to be a great game, eventually, when the devs allow us to have an offline or private server, and when some good QoL arrives.

Combat is also pretty rough.  A combination of it being very rough and basic, and server latency makes it pretty unfun.

The online only aspect has had no effect on actually playing the game at all for me, click start, play, same as every other game with or without online only and lets face it, its not a new thing, loads of games have online only but for some reason a lot of people seems to be having a meltdown on this quite frankly, common aspect of modern gaming.

The graphics aside (which honestly are really nice and from what I understand procedurally generated which is impressive considering, best I have seen and I have seen a lot) 
The gameplay is also pretty good, if you like crafting/building/exploring then this game does all 3 pretty well. As others have mentioned in these reviews, there is a card system that lets you tailor the realms you visit, so far I have only seen 2 options, a biome selection, and a sort of difficulty selection. I dont know if there are more options coming or how many types there are but for EA and the system that's used it looks like it could open up a lot and give a great deal of variety now or in the future.

If you like these kinds of games, this is certainly one to add to your library. It ticks all the right boxes, does everything well and its only in EA!

My only criticism so far is the AI and combat, both could do with some significant improvements, especially the companions who seem to have issues following you around (they start warping to you). Also better control over companions, they can be sort of directed by what type of tools you give them but for the most part they just do their own thing, quite erratically and have no commands (eg: don't chop down my scenic base centre piece -.-).",1708547248,1708547248,True,3,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,True

- Poorly optimised > ugly graphics at moments that look like you're drunk.
- Network error when you change realms and are unable to load the game directly after that..
- Workbenches that sometimes work and sometimes don't, for no reason?
- Looks like there are quite some server issues. Had a bit of lag, although I have a high speed and stable internet connection. Maybe the above problems are the result of shitty servers?

But hey, let's hope for the best. The game still has a lot of potential. And a lot of work that needs to be done to make it OK playable. I still will try to play the game because I'm that much in love with the concept, asthetics and type of gameplay.

edit: how can you do a server stress test, fix bugs, process feedback and release a game in EA a few weeks later and repeat the same process on day 2 of the release?

Within 24 hours they already patched two crashing bugs. So far haven't run into any performance issues. Frame rate has been very stable and the environment looks great.  But I'm playing on much older hardware. Hopefully its just a matter of driver updates or needing the offline servers for this to be resolved. 

Having a lot of fun so far but the game does take awhile to really get rolling. Lots of potential here and worth playing around with in its current state. They have a lot of attention to detail in places you wouldn't think there would be. This could be a curse and a blessing depending on how you look at it. It gives me a more relaxing building feel like from No Man's Sky. Just mellowing out and building in my own world is a blast. And I love the realm card system and different worlds to explore. Will be even more fun as they add more zones.

Game does need some work in areas but has plenty to do currently. I hate taking time away from it because I really want to play and build more.

-- Early Access Suggestions---
* Always online during EA - Honestly just best to let solo be offline at this point. Too many performance issues otherwise.

* Third person view mode - Widen the interaction area on crafting stations to help with using third person view as well as fix running/walking animations.

* Craft from chests - I hear down the grapevine this might be being worked on. The sooner the better. 

* Combat AI - Add a few more variety in attacks from enemies.

*Condense items - I love the depth of crafting in this game but some things could be condensed. I feel this most in making food items. Maybe have making two mushrooms make a roasted mushroom dish but mixing fruit just makes generic mixed fruit. This just helps for stacking items together.

I want to suggest more, but really want to dive even deeper in this game before I do. But didn't want to wait to leave a review as the game is getting a lot more hate than it deserves.",1708544380,1708544380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Having to manually click close on every container you open is soooooooo annoying, especially in combat. No dedicated dodge, except with a crappy dagger, is horrible, and the constant server errors and inability to log in are really aggravating. The game NEEDS to change from online-only. It's a horrible and outdated idea. It needs to switch to an offline mode and give people the ability to make dedicated servers of their own.

Combat and farming feel somewhat redundant, and the companion system feels very clunky and exploitative. I was able to defeat a level 70 boss with only level 20 gear by just running and resurrecting my companion constantly and letting them fight for me. Additionally, the companion AI is horrible. They will often just not attack at all, or they will start farming even though you don't want them to. You have no control over their actions and can't give commands (except for just removing their gear that allows them said actions, which is tedious at best). Companions lack any real depth in terms of realness and aren't very interesting. They are all just a cookie-cutter, copy-and-paste version of the character creation system (which is also very flawed), and unvoiced except for minor grunts and sounds. They just don't feel special.

The realm card system is very fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Cards being able to change the look of the realm you are in was very cool to see. My only problem is that there are currently only three biome cards (desert, swamp, and forest), so hopefully, this gets expanded on. I'd love to see ones for a tropical setting with beaches and islands, as well as a snow setting with mountains. I also feel the limitation of only two cards per realm could be changed, as well as only one realm adjustment could be increased. It's a very interesting system, but it feels limited.

The game also suffers from a lack of quests, the majority of which aren't very interesting. It's mostly just fetch quests or kill quests, and it doesn't feel like the NPC you are interacting with really needs your help or brings anything to the story. Many of the quests are redundant and annoying, like the gather material fetch quests to help build structures for NPCs.

Building is interesting but lacks luster. Even in late game when you get better building theme pieces, which does help, it feels kind of empty. Build limitation of area and piece amount is annoying and doesn't allow you to create grand structures. The building system isn't diverse at all. You can't build little details, and the lack of parts and decorations is boring. You are stuck mostly with just foundation, walls, floor, stairs, and roof pieces. There is nothing special about the building system. It's better than some I've seen before, but it isn't grand or anything. It just feels... lackluster.

It's a shame this game has so many problems. I really want to like it. I'll continue to play it for a bit and give feedback to the developers, but unless they make some major changes, I don't see it lasting in the long run.",1708544151,1708544151,False,17,1,0.607844769954681396,0,True,False,True

As the game is still in EARLY ACCESS there are bound to be issues but I've encountered none, other than quality-of-life grievances. More or less, due to the comparable nature of the game to other world-building MMOs. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay takes some getting used too, and the UI is basic but the quest/building/crafting overlay is slightly obnoxious due to its size. I understand there might be a desire to display all the artwork possible but it feels slightly overbearing. The combat doesn't feel tedious, nor the PvE of collecting items for building -- if anything I'd say it is easier than most other mmos.

First off lets start with the bad:
-Game is online only and the servers can be horrible at times for some people (However i didnt encounter this issue much)
-No underwater as far as i understand (will change in case im wrong with further testing)
-Due to the game being online only you also cant pause. Please devs, consider adding a pause at the very least for us in single player.

Now onto the good:
-Beautiful World (Even the tutorial areas are stunning even though they might feel a bit empty)
-Optimization is decent for an UE 5 game ruinning Lumen. On 1440p on a 3070 i was able to max everything without DLSS and got 56 fps, 80 with DLSS on.
-Combat feels surprisingly decent. First dagger you craft has a jump action that allows for some really quick play.
-Puck's voice actor is a literal God
-Presentation is great even if it isnt the best.
-Good tutorial to show you the basic seeds of the world as well as some very basics even though it lasts a while.
-I like that the game throws story bits.

Advice: Changing my review to ""negative"" as the game has some disconnection issues, but worst than that, developers stated on discord that no ""offline mode"" will happen at the moment, and they ""might"" consider it after early access.

Almost 3 hours after the bad reviews started dropping from various issues the devs addressed it and took action, that speaks volumes for what we should expect with future changes and updates.

The game has a beautiful UI for being early access but it feels like some of the depth is still missing.
I haven't had any crashes or crazy issues while playing like others have experienced.
There's some studders here and there but it runs perfectly fine for me.
I'm playing off a laptop with an RX6800M and a Ryzen 9 5850HM on balanced settings, CPU and GPU utilization fluctuates but does not stick at 100% like others have reported. 

The environments are beautiful and the exploration is rewarding yet... still not fully there.
Combat isn't anything to write home about but it's definitely not the worst i've experienced with an early access title that costs less than 30$ let alone 60$.
The portal cards and building fundamentals are very interesting, probably one of my favorite aspects of the game.

For anyone weary of facing bugs or studders here and there, i'd recommend holding off on buying this for another week or two. Me personally, the experience has been pleasant and I look forward to seeing what this Dev team will do in the next few weeks. 

I give it a solid 7/10

Giant turn off that it's always online, you play on hosted servers controlled by Inflexion.  So when they decide to drop support, games dead.  There will never be mods in this game.   

There's no opt-out of their data sharing either.  You either opt in or don't play the game.

I see this game either dying or forcing a subscription in order to play to support the servers.  It's just a basic survival game with some story.  It would be like Microsoft saying you can only play minecraft on their realms and no longer only on your computer.  It's fallout 76... actually it's really just the same.

To increase your skills, building, power, etc., requires running back and forth constantly over teeny, tiny realms. These things are 4X5 squares in size and you can cross one in a couple minutes. Sure, there are a bunch of them, but it gets very repetitive pretty fast. The biggest downside is the essence mechanic. You can't just upgrade once you have most essences. It requires traveling to certain spots and interacting with special devices. It's just a tedious task. Another tedium is that you'll need to climb or float almost everywhere important. This is fun about 5 times before it just gets monotonous. 

My advice, is to wait and see if they streamline this system. As it stands, you waste too much time standing around waiting for crafting, climbing vertical surfaces and/or floating around on a umbrella. It's cute the first time and boring the rest.

Since I'm past two hours...the tutorial is conveniently made to last longer than the refund time, I'll play this until I can't stand it anymore. I really hope that they fix the multitude of issues. BTW, many folks are having trouble connecting to the servers. It seems they skimped on spreading out the server locations and you'll get dropped a lot right now. I'm smack dab in the middle of USA and I get dropped/lose connection every so often and I have high speed internet.

i SOOOOOO WANTED TO LOVE THIS GAME, BUT...I just can't get behind it right now. Force Gaming review is an exact comprehensive reasoning I agree with. Watch his YT for his review.

THE GOOD: 
BEAUTIFUL and FANTASTICAL ENVIRONMENTAL GRAPHICS/concepts and brand new premise/gear/vibes....IMAGINATIVE wonderfully  looking mobs ...looking glass/tim burton kind of woah/wacky.....great! someone got into the TPB stash...lolz.. LOVE STEAM PUNK mixed in with Fantasy/Shakespeare. Very involved lore and interesting plot. Although I am not a big fan of schematic building the building was good in this game and overall well balance cost so far.. ..

It is magical

The BAD AND UGLY:
 Very Janky animations,,,,REALLY BAD combat (no context/connection in fighting...SWARMing Mobs: swing swing swing did i hit? they fell down....10 baddies dead and I couldn't tell you how....)  and this new (newish) concept of mat stacking to make items instead of tiered mats... GOD I HATE THIS CONCEPT!! a bunch of mats to make one ingredient to add to other ingredients made from multiple mats. And i am really beginning to hate procedural generated games...boring groundhog day rinse - repeat.  Even the postivies become negatives the lore becomes a readfest is a bit daunting...find a clue..lore book.. grab a cuppa you'll be awhile.. the very little voice acting is acceptable at this stage...EA and you may or may not be pulled into combat while this is happening)

but the magic fizzes

for 30 bucks USD I will get my money's worth... I so hope that these short comings are just EA and that they tighten up and flesh out this jankfest. I honestly thought I was going to love this game more than enshrouded when I watched the hype train last fall.. No where near as good as Enshrouded... game/mechanics/polish Great start!

Now, I have been anticipating this game's release for years. I thought the concept and art were absolutely revolutionary. Loved every trailer and snippet that came out. I counted down the hours until release.

Then it did. And I played it. There is a large incongruity between what was presented and what I played. I get that this is EA. Cool. But, what was shown should match closely to what can be played. I mean all the characters look like their faces were pancaked by a steamroller. Also, there are a lot of stills and video from 3rd person. Come to find out in the settings that is still in experimental phase. 

What absolutely floored me though was that I had to have a constant internet connection to play. Why? Why subject solo players to a server that will slow down their play? Valheim, Palworld, and Enshrouded don't force this. Why is it necessary? A few google searches and threads on Reddit did not elucidate why one bit. There is plenty of conjecture though.

After an hour and a half, I asked for a refund. This needs to cook a little longer and it might be great. I may purchase it again later, but not if it requires one to be online to do so. That is disrespectful to my bandwidth, enjoyment of play, and for being able to own the game in the future once they close their servers.

I am a conan exiles, ark, no man's sky, gamer and I played all for the building and exploring. Nightengale is a great addition to your library if you too love building and exploring with your friends in a pretty chill environment. 

[u]My breakdown[/u]
*The lore is very compelling, I hope that is expanded upon. 
*Being able to place down building pieces as an outline and then add resources to multiple blocks at a time, chefs kiss.
*Sure your AI recruit might be an idiot, and will definitely cut down your tress, but they will also carry your stuff, rezz you, and you can steal their cool hats. They'll also help you build your house. Don't want them to deforest anymore? Just take their axe away, give them pickaxe instead, watch them work like a doedicurus. 
*Getting mocked by Puck? Am here for it.
*Combinations of realm cards for more POIs to explore? All the dopamine. 
*Tracking down vendors to get those sweet furniture blueprints, I know that's right. 
*Ability to put every realm you visit on easy mode? Nightengale can we get married?

It's not without it's flaws, and the devs have plenty of work to do to really make this polish, but it's a fantastic start, worth your money and really fun to play. Plenty of reviews have talked about the things that this game needs, but if you're a chill gamer it really shouldn't turn you off of picking this one up. I expect this game to give me plenty of dopamine for a good long while, and I'm very excited what the finish product will look like.

It gives players choice, agency, and a sense of ownership in a world not their own to toil and strive to better their lot and experience with as they come to understand the rules and laws of the new land they find themselves in. If the survival game is very good, it gives players room to find meaning in the struggle by a crafted story that enhances the experience without detracting from said freedoms.

Nightingale is barbarous in its approach. The screen opens with far too many dials and numbers. The menus are unintuitive, non-hotkeyed, and monochromatic in their appearance. The look and feel of the game is very rough, even compared to similar titles like Enshrouded and Palworld. 

But the worst offender is the beginning narrative. The greatest thing you can do for a game's story is to show it, not to tell it, and the game breaks a lot of rules all at once. Having a opening cutscene is considered normal for most people, but it again, is more trying to make up for culture shock to tell players about the world without them experiencing it for themselves.

But then comes the big problem. The game hand holds the player through the introduction of a seemingly important story piece into the game-world, Puck. Puck, in all classic literature, is a trickster, who is now helping you, the player, escape a three part series of byway worlds in order to get to your early home. To say Puck and his narrative are boring undersells how pivotal Puck as a literal mainstay of faerie lore for hundreds of actual years has been reduced to a tutorial guide. 

The world seed generation system of realms that have to accessed through portals and portal generation devices is very reminiscent of Don't Starve, yet the portals were expertly used in that game as they weren't immediately told to the player what they did. It took the player time to figure out their point and purpose, as well as struggling how to use them. Nightingale shows their use without explaining or even detailing how or why these things function as they do.

To give some perspective, minecraft places an unknown entity that lives in a world with no explanation, guide, or tutorial. Good luck, figure it out. Minecraft is a children's game. Nightingale is marketed as a game for adults who want cosmic horror mixed with survival gameplay loops. Something is very wrong here.

TL;DR - The game is dull, hand-holdy, and with a janky tutorial experience compared to the wealth of other survival games developed in Q1 2023 and find it wanting, even in early access.

Only a few hours in and I can already tell this game needs a bit more time to cook. I have high hopes for Nightingale, and I believe in its potential! Survival Craft is my favorite genre, I've spent thousands of hours playing a variety of them and played most of them in EA. This is my early assessment of Nightingale, which IMO, the first few hours of a game like this will be make or break for a lot players. Its a very competitive genre atm, and unfortunately there isn't much to pull players away from Palword, Enshrouded, Smalland, and even players still playing Valheim. 

[u]Likes:[/u] 

1. The environment is visually pleasing, and flat out gorgeous in many areas. 

2. The option to swap to a third person perspective is a huge plus for me personally, I prefer this over first person in survival games. You can tell that the game is optimized better for first person, and the setting for third person even says that its experimental. I hope its received well and the devs can fine tune it because it would make the game standout among others in its genre that are exclusive to only one perspective.

3. Companion system (also a dislike). The idea of having a companion to help you fight, farm, and build seems like a great addition. I would love this option for when playing solo, unfortunately the AI has no idea what it is doing. They follow you around with no purpose most of the time. They share similar issues that Sons of The Forest had with their companion AI. I support this idea, and I hope they get it right because it would be a nice tool to have considering the amount of resources needing for building/crafting. 

4. Puck. He's cool.

5. I enjoy how many different elemental challenges there are and how they effect not only the player, but the quality of your crafting tables as well.

6. A variety of building options that get me excited to unlock the endgame decorations/walls/floors/roofs.

[u]Dislikes:[/u]

1. Combat is clunky, item swapping on hot bar is not smooth, and hit boxes need to be tuned better.

2. The crafting UI is unorganized. I like that there is a lot of options, but it is very difficult to navigate through recipes. Sometimes, less is more and I believe that will be the case for this game. 

3. This should be a standard for all survival games.. no one likes to constantly refill torches and campfires. Do us all a favor and let campfires burn forever. The trade off is that food can be burnt so you need to extinguish the fire after a use (which is currently in the game). There is already so many items to manage, adding sticks to a fire is just an annoyance that doesnt add any QOL to the game.

4. Having several tiers of the same item is overkill. It is going to make item mgmt a nightmare, especially we are not able to craft directly from storage boxes. It also doesn't help that the pictures are the same regardless of their tier. I am extremely OCD with item management in these games and this will turn myself, and a lot players like me away from doing more than the bare minimum. 

5. No skill tree or stat points: I can do without a skill tree, but also not having a stat system is kind of a letdown as well. I like the Gear Score idea, but I do believe it should be accompanied by another progression system other than just how high level your gear is. If someone has never swung a plastic katana in their lives, and you hand them steel katana.. they're not going to be able swing it better than the plastic just because its ""higher level"".

I will continue to progress in Nightingale, slowly. I am currently playing a couple other games that I will likely complete before revisiting this game exclusively. Cant wait to see where the devs go with this one!

Unless the devs do a 180 on A LOT of the systems in the game, im pretty sure its doomed.  There are so many better survival games out there.

It feels like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It combines so many elements of so many different games and genres and each one of those systems are mediocre at best. Its a mediocre survival game, mediocre building game, boring crafting game, awful action combat game, horrible rpg, terrible exploration game.
One of the main feature and interest in survival games is the freedom to explore and do whatever you want. But in this game you have no freedom, you are constantly gated behind arbitrary barrier like gear scores, crafting recipe unlock, cards etc. The game gives you a checklist of things to do and you have to do them in the exact order otherwise you cant progress

Also, it's less of a suvival game and more of a melee slasher/combat game. And let me tell you, for focusing SO heavily on combat and killing mobs, the combat is one of the weakest part of the game, its just so bad, janky and unsatisfying.

That said, if they can at least fix all the jank about it (mainly UI, combat, movement, crafting and inventory management) maybe it'll be ""playable"", not good, just playable. But even then, honestly, some of those systems need to be completely scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up.

Good
- Graphics look great
- Voice acting is good
- World is unique

Bad
- Always online on a server even for single player
- Performance is very mediocre (i played on a 4090 and got 60fps in 1440p, this is unacceptable, game looks good but not that good, cyberpunk looks better, is bigger and runs better)
- UI (one of the worst UI in gaming)
- Progression and pace of the game is extremely slow and tedious. Also you are constantly gated behind gear score requirements to do anything
- Combat is atrociously bad and janky
- Exploration is boring and meaningless, every POI (point of interest) is just placed senseless in the world, repetitive and useless, all you get is a generic chest or 2 with some generic loot inside, or some bad puzzle to solve to get a useless stat boost
- Movement is hyper clunky, you constantly get stuck on rocks and such.
- No QOL features for anything, inventory management is a joke and makes me want to end myself, stamina drain is insanely overtuned
- Even though the graphics look great, immersion is basically non existent because everything else in the game is so bad. Companions / loot mules are completely dumb looking and janky, they teleport all over the place and are super annoying to deal with.

It is currently in Early Access and has only been out for 1 day at the time of this review.

[h1]TL;DR: Wait for more updates before buying.[/h1]

While I am very excited to see more, I've also been following this game since it was first revealed.
I'm willing to take the risk that this game never develops further, because I adore the potential behind it so much.
[u]I do not recommend doing this to the average player.[/u]

[h2]First Warning:[/h2]
[b]The game is always online and run through their private servers.[/b]

The reasons for this being a bad design choice is obvious.
[olist]
    [*]It means the Single-player tag on the Steam page is a flat out lie. There is no personal single-player save you can have fun on. You are [b]always[/b] online and thus, never truly a single player.
    [*]If there is even a tiny hotfix update, no one can play. You just have to eat the hour or more downtime, which for some people, means half or their entire availability to play.
    [*]You don't have the freedom to make the game how you want it. Like in ARK:SE. You want faster harvesting? Change the setting. Do you want your game experience to move a little faster/slower? Change the setting. [b]You can't do that in Nightingale. You have no control over your game.[/b]
[/olist]

[h2]Second Warning:[/h2]
[b]There is no way to travel quickly.[/b]

There are no mounts, no vehicles: nothing. So a lot of the game just feels like walking simulator. An absolute slog to travel from one place to the next with next to nothing interesting to explore.
A few places piqued my interest to look into, but the time it takes to travel to those places makes the game feel pretty dull.

[h2]Third Warning:[/h2]
[b]Building is extremely and abnormally restrictive.[/b]

If you're buying this game because you like base building survival games, like myself, I do suggest not buying this game yet.
While there is some promise to the future, it's just not anywhere near offering a good, seamless base building experience. Of course not, it's in Early Access so there are bound to be limitations like that, right?

Well, not to this unusual extent...
You can't place walls on second floors without there being a wall directly below it.
So if you want to have a bedroom that's sectioned off on the second story, but an open plan on your ground floor: [b]You can't.[/b]
A wall can [i]only[/i] be placed if there is a wall below it.
This is, very possibly, the most insane and ridiculous building restriction I've ever seen.
I understand having a limitation on how far you can build floating floors without proper support, but this level of restriction is so egregious you can't help but think the devs were being purposefully malicious with the design.
It feels like the game doesn't want you to build anything other than a square box and it's [b]miserable.[/b]

The building pieces are very limited as well, but that's more excusable as it is Early Access.
[i]However, other games have released into [i]very[/i] Early Access with far, far better building systems...[/i]
[b]Valheim, Enshrouded, V Rising, ARK; to name a few.[/b]

[h2]Fourth Warning:[/h2]
[b]Combat is boring.[/b]

There are other reviews explaining it better, but the combat in this game is very bland.
Currently, AI is just [i]attack, pause, attack, pause.[/i] There's very little to it which is both frustrating and has lead me to avoid fighting anything because it's just not fun.
This is one of those things that is somewhat common in Early Access games. Mediocre AI, something that can be improved in time.

[h1]Overall: Do not buy unless you're willing to take a leap of faith that this game will develop into something amazing.[/h1]",1708537636,1708537685,False,5,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,True

Performance is good solid fps doesn't drop either.  No Crashes yet. However it does hit your CPU hard. Isn't too GPU or Ram hungry tho. So if you use other higher CPU apps it can cause stuttering or crashes. OBS for Example causes issues for friends.

Visuals look decent even on Performance mode which is nice. Sure you can tell some things are missing but it is EA for a reason.

The gameplay is quite good and easy to understand. Very Similar to other games being split into Tiers for progression.
The game does have a fair amount of Grind which won't suit everyone but this style of game is always grindy.

Crafting system is nice but it is complex for your average click and done crafter since Stats will vary based on what materials you use to craft your items. The Level of Customization is very nice can play the game how I want so it is the most enjoyable.

Building is simple but works very well. It is easy to understand which is helpful.  I hope to see more options in the future but at this stage you can still make nice looking bases.

The Card system is cool to experiment with making the world perfect for what I want which alot of the time is movement based.
Then for the Realms are a nice mechanic but very limited at this point.

The Core Story is nice so far alot of Oblivion vibes from it so far. But the Side Lore can be a little tough to read I hope they make it voiced too in the future.

Multiplayer just seems to make things faster but as you advance further it will serve more of a purpose with harder Realms and Dungeons. And with Endgame dungeon being designed for 6 players it will essentially for a good experience. 

The Network is surprisingly good. I'm in Australia on Satellite internet (Starlink) And when playing with UK/US friends you don't get noticeable lag. And for Local servers it seems solid. However loading in does seem to take a bit unsure if its the game or my connection. 

When you first start it does feel a little too slow which is common with these games too. 
For me it was the 5 hour mark it opened up but for the average player I'd say it is 5-10 hours to get into the game. Once you reach Tier 1 everything opens up. 


Overall with how much of the game I've seen or know exists Its a 7/10. 
Sure it has its problems but every game does. 

Will update as I get further into the game since Endgame does sound very interesting.",1708537453,1708537504,True,6,0,0.578813016414642334,0,True,False,True

The crafting is really interesting: the quality of the materials determines the quality of the end product. 
The menu is also really polished and very artistic, like an old book of some sorts. and the realm generation seems interesting so far. 

About the dungeons: I didn't do only one but found it really immersive and well designed on multiple levels and layers finishing with an elite or boss. 
It's nice that you can have a companion with you to come and help around. This makes single player game way more enjoyable. 
Also, I do love the open world exploration and puzzles it has to offer. 

Now the shelter: this is pretty simple/standard but the way you can influence the workbenches is what caught my eye! Placement is important! 
Also, it's worth to mention that you can set the base blueprints and then craft everything at once.

I've been waiting for this game to come out since I first heard about it's development in a video about upcoming survival games a long while ago. So far I am not disappointed! I wish people would keep in mind that this is in fact an EARLY ACCESS game which means it's not going to be fully functioning on day one let alone the first month. If you're someone who can't stand to play an unfinished early access game then don't buy it. Plain and simple. Just don't buy it and complain and expect it to be a smoothly running game when it's early access and still being developed. Everything shown in the trailers is all in the game and no it's not a scam. (Kids should stay off the internet) I personally can't wait to see what they add in next and obviously look forward to them fixing any lag or performance issues if they are able.

First playthrough:
I made it through the tutorial (I personally didn't see any options to skip it) which I recommend doing anyway because you get to keep any materials you find along the way when Puck finally allows you to go to a real realm which most likely will be your home realm and I recommend choosing the Forest biome your first play-through because it will make things a bit easier on you as you continue to learn your way through the game.

Character customization thoughts:
The character customization is a bit wonky to me, it felt really hard to get a half-decent looking character. I didn't like any of the noses or mouth options and most of the eyes looked the same nationality. I noticed there wasn't an option to widen or squint the eyes in any way so that was a bummer. I also wish there was more things I could change about the nose like make the bridge skinnier or wider. (not just taller or shorter) There really isn't much you can do with the mouth/lips either, they all look to be frowning even when smiling if that makes sense. I also wish there was more hair and eyebrow options, but again, the game is in early access so maybe they will come out with more options for us in the future, otherwise I'll have to mod which I really don't like doing. It took me like over an hour to finally make something I was happy with. ^ ^; I do however LOVE the make-up options and that was really fun to play around with different color combos and the glitter, so that gets an A+.

Combat:
I also did my first dungeon that the game recommends you do first, I did it solo with the help of the NPC that you can recruit and I almost died a few times so it's definitely somewhat challenging imo. (I'm on Normal difficulty setting) The combat feels pretty good imo and you can choose to try and land head-shots for extra damage so it's fun trying to see how many head-shots I can get in. XD The mummy-looking mobs scare the crap out of me and I hate them. haha There's one that throws bombs/fire at you and I almost died a few times just from that alone so the combat definitely makes you maneuver around and think about which mobs you should prioritize first which is always a fun concept for combat imo.
The sling-shot weapon is a bit hard to hit anything with but not impossible, I just wish the hit box on the shot was a bit wider so that so many didn't miss. I know it's probably a skill issue on my part but either way they should make it a bit easier on people like me who don't play FPSs for a living. lol

My thoughts so far:
I have yet to even go through a portal to another big biome and I've been having lots of fun gathering materials and crafting and building my first little home and fill it with all the crafting benches and figuring out what I can build/craft next. :)

Connectivity/Performance issues:
The whole 11 hours I played, I only disconnected once and it was after I chopped down my first tree, I was able to reconnect right back in pretty fast and I didn't lose any of my items so it wasn't even that big of a deal. (and I was able to chop a bunch of trees later with no issues) I did experience a bit of lag whenever I ran by a couple dungeon areas but I noticed the lag went away pretty quickly and it wasn't even that bad. Overall the game ran super smoothly and my PC isn't even top tier, I don't have the newest/latest graphics cards but I do have a SSD which probably helps and I also updated my drivers like the game recommended so that might have helped also so just make sure to update your drivers before playing because it might help. :p (I also live in Alaska so not sure if my location had anything to do with how well the game was running for me and I also have somewhat decent internet connection but it's not Fiber or anything)

Do I recommend this game?
Overall I personally recommend this game for people who are into survival/crafting/building games like me. I can't wait to explore more biomes and I have yet to fully explore the Forest biome that I'm in. If you think your PC won't allow you to enjoy this game properly then maybe don't buy it. I've been waiting so long for this game to finally come out so either way I knew I was going to buy it no matter what and I'm glad I did because I've been having a lot of fun on it and I have yet to play it with friends so I'm sure I'll have even more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game is still being worked on so you can expect certain things to get fixed, updated, and added later. You can either choose to wait longer to see if the game looks more to your liking later before you decide to purchase, or you can chance it and truly see just how bad or not bad the lag issues are on your machine. (For me personally they weren't bad at all) I personally think the price isn't bad either. I fully expected to pay $30 for this game only to see that it was on sale on launch so that was a pleasant surprise for me and made it even more worth it. ^ ^",1708537080,1708537080,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Sarcasm aside:

• The game is online only, if you're not in the same country as the server you're going to feel the latency, and bad.
• Combat is a boring mix of kite until stamina recharges enough to attack again.
• Resources have magic numbers blocking you from collecting them until you reach some form of progression that's never actually properly explained.
• Progression and crafting is unclear, I can't get far enough to see how it is actually supposed to work because their servers keep crashing.
• Lag feels *ROUGH*, almost no latency compensation.
• The game has a ""fuzziness"" to it (I suspect poorly implemented SSAO)

• Lack of clarity in mechanics - your health will fluctuate all by itself, going from like 80, to 20, then to 70, then down to 3, then up again - with no clarity on why.

The concept and vibe is amazing - I just wish I could stomach putting more hours into it to actually appreciate it more.

- Style is cool

Cons:

- always online? Is this true, honestly I was not home when maintance was, but seeing it in several comments... if true, its bullshit, same like Diablio even when you play 90% in ""Singleplayer""
- results in When Server offline, you cant play anmore... uhm sorry Maintaaiannce ok, but what will happen in future? Its not like a P2P via Steam where you can just join someone else game.

The core feature of the self-contained portal worlds are definitely a plus over a lot of other survival games in my opinion and you're probably not going to see anything anywhere near this fantasy setting for this kind of game elsewhere AFAIK.

That said, I'm mixed about a few things. The entire game infrastructure depending on their servers is definitely a minus, one which they are trying to justify as ""allowing you and your friends to be able to play on the same world together even if one of you isn't around to play"": I get where they're coming from and I appreciate the thought a lot, but I'm not sure I like that kind of sacrifice in the first place. Inventory cluttering is a real thing (especially since not everything has unique icons and some are still placeholders) and I imagine it might get worse at some point when you have a lot of in-practice redundant materials with different allocation of stats from final crafted items... Also, would be nice if the red-barrier'ed points of interest actually showed at what minimum equipment level you must be and what level the enemies inside are instead of playing ""will it shove me 10 feet away or let me through"" while you don't know.

As others pointed out, the UI is kind of a weak point. I'm also very much looking forward to the modifiers being usable for keybinds (ie, SHIFT + 3) to switch the off-hand equipment more effectively. There are definitely problems with the visual interface in menus though.

Pure negatives? So far, hard to point towards something specific, but I'd say that the climbing picks either require too much stamina to be used for climbing anything worthwhile and at the same time they won't register in some rocky locations where you could potentially get a use of them for the short height you'd be able to climb. Maybe when I get access to better picks and longer stamina bar it'll click, but absolutely not yet for me.

Conceptually, this one hit right on the mark for me. A strange, victorian-era fantasy game with unabashed gestures toward lore and wildly strange creatures. It seemed inspiring, different, and in some ways familiar by combining survival/craft mechanics with a fresh new look on Unreal's freshest engine. But it all fell short—and in some ways—flat on its face.

The closed beta felt stiff in ways that were hard to quantify. The world was pretty, but it wasn't alive. The building options were well-textured, but limited in architectural fluency. The enemies looked wild, fantastic, dark, but they stumbled aimlessly and their AI was poor. In the distance, I saw hulking, meandering creatures, one-of-a-kind, only to see them stumble on basic topography, and cheese out to uselessness. The menus were overly complex, the combat didn't pack a punch, none of the many complex systems, all filled with the same potential, delivered. And that's what's most frustrating: This game offered hoards of potential and it seemed to fail on account of every single opportunity to shine.

I'm sure that even those rating this game positively will realize, sooner rather than later, that this game needed more play testing, a later release date (even in Early Access, which has granted it so much grace due to this), and more consideration. It needed stronger developers, people who understand these systems better, are more organized, and can implement them in ways that feel fluid. The tutorial, the first introduction to the game, is convoluted, confusing, and fails to do what tutorials should: teach players, in process, how to play and enjoy the game. Instead, it teaches them what they will actually experience: cumbersome mechanics stumbled through with uncertainty.

I understand people wanting to hope for this game. I did, which is why I invested in it so early in the development process. But, as is with so many games these days, they jumped the gun, and drove a knife right into the back of all of their work, spending their hype currency way too early, and likely losing everything they worked hard to build. If this game comes out of Early Access, I will eat crow. I don't suspect I have much to worry about.",1708533661,1708534372,False,45,1,0.609468162059783936,0,True,False,True

Tired of playing by myself or having to pay someone to host a 24/7 server to play with others (or host my own).  Have to deal with network issues but thats the norm for any online multiplayer game.  Menus and UI have some work needed, the fact I can't just hit ESC to close any menu is frustrating, especially when near danger.  Crafting, building seems to be similar to other Survival games (Valheim).  Combat is meh, AI is normal but pathing isn't great.  Followers need to have a switch to stop them from cutting down trees... I've had to rebuild a tent multiple times because my first follower cuts down trees around it, destroying it.  Combat feels like its lacking feedback, hard if I've blocked an attack other looking at my HP, same with being hit, no shake or much noise, just suddenly my hp starts to go down.  Everything I've had issues with so far are fixable, and it seems they have already fixed a few.  

Going between this and Enshrouded, but honestly not having to organize with my buddies when everyone is getting on to make sure the server is running, or paying an additional fee to a third party hosting service makes a big difference to me.

If you play solo, or don't plan on playing with other players (random or otherwise) I can see this being a downside though.  personally my opinion I would rather deal with the (sadly) normal network issues of online games in order to freely play with other people.

I'm not a huge fan of the always online functionality, and there are definitely some performance issues, particularly during storms or when large packs of enemies appear. 

Nightingales gathering systems isn't as tedious as a lot of other survival games (atleast so far). You will be gathering a decent amount of resources, but its not like Palworld where you will need to mine Iron every 10 minutes. 

The base building mechanics seems pretty fleshed out and easy to use. I don't believe there is any terraforming and it isn't' quite as complex as say Enshrouded, but it's definitely more crisp and easier to use. 

While there are performance issues with the storms, it's a pretty neat mechanic. I hope this is expanded upon as the game continues. The umbrella and the spyglass items are fun to use. 

The melee combat is a bit jank, as with most survival games. The animations are average at best, and it's a fairly basic combat system. I'm hoping there is some more enemy variation and I believe firearms will help with this part of the game further on. 

The card and biome mechanics are really cool. The load times between zones can leave something to be desired, but the mechanic is unique and fun. 

I'm still fairly early on in the game so it's hard to tell how repetitive this will get. If it's just tiers of the same enemies, that will definitely get old. If we end up with more enemy variations and cool items to craft, I can see this being a very fun survival game.

-Created my character, I will admit the presets look a little backwoods lol. But anyone crying that you can’t make a good looking character is just crying as I took 10 minutes to whip one up that looked like main character material. Had a bunch of customization options with more to come.
-loaded in with no issues, running 4K at ultra on my 3060 with a solid 45-50 fps. (6 hours in hasn’t ever went under 35)
-got through the tutorial (rather long, not 2 hours by any means like some people are saying, closer to an hour so if you don’t like it you should have some time to refund after tutorial as long as your not smoothbrained. Puck was cool, held your hand just enough to get the crafting system across. 
- Upon entering my first real realm I was met with a overwhelmingly beautiful view of the land, with some exploration I found even more breathtaking areas. Akin to valheim for sure. 6 hours in and I have noticed a couple reused elements but not nearly to the extent of some negative reviews say. I’m sure we’ll see these get more fleshed out with updates to come. 
-the crafting is a bit intensive, can be overwhelming to some that may have little experience in this genre, but a blast for someone that has experience and isn’t afraid of a little grind to visually see your characters strength rise.
-the building! Wow I love the building in this game, from the types of structures they designed all the way to how dynamic they allow you to lay any and all of the decorations. Very reminiscent of valheim as well here, but it seems the overall “space box’s” of items you can place is much more fitting to how it looks on screen allowing you to get that cluttered Victorian look, you can also stack many different decorations to get a very rustic feel in your game. in 3 hours I had a home that felt more alive than anything I’ve ever built in any other survival crafter. Seriously a builders dream, can’t wait to see what else comes of this.
-combat early game, it’s not the most interesting, but if you like hack and slashy games at all, you’ll enjoy it at least a little. The enemy ai could use some work, the ranged enemies seem to be a bunch smarter than the melee ones. Hoping to see enemy ai get more flushed out.

I’ve been having a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes the rest of the time plying and In future updates. Is it perfect no! Is it fun yes!

Specs: i7-13700KF, 64 GB DDR5, 4070 Super, Samsung 989 PRO SSD

All settings maxed with DLSS on balanced. 

Chose the forest biome after tutorial and have a basic estate built. Only a 4x3 wood structure. Nothing crazy. Combat is decent. Stamina sucks but it’s the genre. Luckily running doesn’t drain stamina like crazy unless you’re wet/hungry/tired or have an affliction. Hopefully increased stamina later will help. Played co-op the entire time with 0 issues. No server issues or hardware crashes. 

As a huge survival game fan (Subnautica, Green Hell, Icarus, The Infected, Enshrouded, etc) this is a great game. The premise is excellent and the visuals are some of the best I’ve seen. I stared at the waves lapping onto the beach for 10 minutes because it’s so well done. Enemy design is great. Building feels good if a little grindy. Overall I am very satisfied.

Seriously having played long as most of the 30 minutes so far has been waiting on server and realm.  It's pretty though.  Looking forward to playing more to give a better review",1708532767,1708532767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It also, needs more time in the oven to sort itself out. The bigger issue is the game doesn't communicate much of one thing and too much of another. Is it worth the jump into an Early Access at this price point? Debatable. IMO? Best wait for a 1.0 on this one.

Almost 10 hours into the game and I'm not exactly getting the No Mans Sky infinite width and a foot of depth vibe. Nor am I getting the warm and fuzzy Palworld vibe. There's enough depth and similarity to Enshrouded to keep me interested. It's clear to me that the game wants us to spend time with it. I'm all for that, but is it worth it? Maybe. So, for now, my curiosity is tentatively peaked. If not for the visual art style of marketing. So far I've yet to see any Carnival Row outside the character creator.

It has enough variation in the ""Realms"" That I can find some uniqueness to each Biome. The card system sees to that. I really like this system, it has potential to define something new in an otherwise saturated Open-world Survival Crafting market. There are aspects of the building system I like. There are others that I find other games do better. The same can be said about every other aspect of this game! 

Each new realm has to be treated like an expedition. Rather than a new place to put down roots. The game doesn't tell you this, but its something you should know. This makes ""tech"" advancement and inventory management a pain. I either go back to my home realm when I or my back pack have had enough. Or spend hours collecting/gathering to make a one time use outpost. The dev's really need to find a happy median here. Otherwise it has the potential to be a detriment to its success with the player base.

Combat is lackluster and doesn't exactly inspire confidence. It really is Skyrim, but dumber and less exciting. The only reason combat is any challenge is enemies come at the player in mobs. One other thing that comes in droves at the player in Nightingale is numbers.

There are a lot of numbers in this game... If you're familiar with Cold Take's video ""Fatigued by the Numbers"" you'll know what I mean. My impression is the developers want to make a game with lots of numbers in it. I have to say, early on only Gear Score matters. You need a higher gear score to get through barriers. How much? It doesn't tell you. Frankly, why should it? The quest progression drives everything in Nightingale. 

The player really only needs to follow the quest line. Everything else is a distraction. Getting hung up on exploration is more of a detriment to the player's advancement than anything. Something else they don't tell you. Which seems kind of odd, since it is open-world. If there is an open world I want to go explore it. Unlike other open-world games there is something to be gained from exploration. Always something to find over the next hill. Here there's nothing but raw resources to reward the player. Character's don't level up. Character's don't have skill advancement. (That isn't a complaint/Complement by the way, just fact) Combat is just a means to resources. Spending time to fight everything is wasted effort, unless you need the resources or objective behind it. The realms only exists to be exploited. Put on your capitalism Top-hats, bois! Tally-ho!

So where was I? Numbers... If they don't mean anything early on, why have detailed numbers at all? Why should I care about how much of a health bonus Tier 1 Bones give? In the end game, if there is one. Sure! I can see why it would matter to the kind of player who wants to min-max their character for the best outcome. However, early on it feels like being on the receiving end of a fire hose of useless information. I mean come on... everything down to the rocks has stats. 

All-in-all If I had any sense i'd just delete the game now and wait for this game to cook a bit longer in the Oven. Maybe wait for 1.0 release on this one. But I'm still having some fun.",1708532756,1708532756,False,7,0,0.517605721950531006,0,True,False,True

This is Early Access.  Or, more realistically, ""You Paid Money to Gamma Test"" (Gamma Testing is after Beta Testing, if you didn't know)

Complaining and giving a negative review because the game isn't ""polished"" or ""Needs QOL Features"" doesn't make a lick of sense.  That is what Early Access is FOR.    Expecting a fully featured, fully functional game with no issues whatsoever is not only unrealistic, it isn't very fair to the developers.

Don't like it?  It's pretty simple:
Don't buy EA Games, wait until they're released.

As you will see, there are a lot of problems I've found in a mere 7 hours, and I will be critical of those problems because they were Missed...  I am not going to ""Ding them"" for the problem itself, but some of these shouldn't have been missed.

Moving on - 

I have tons of experience in Survival Crafting.  I've beta tested for the big companies for decades - not Inflection, tho... for some reason experience didn't matter much.   I guess social media influencers who would just play the game for advertising profit (and not actually Test much, if at all) are more important than people who would have worked to eliminate simple, menial bugs, duping, and exploits before EA/Gamma Testing, but I digress..  

Thus far (7 or so hours in) I can see this whole beta testing thing was a missed opportunity.   There are simply too many things overlooked.   Seems like people were focused on Server Stress Testing, Server Load, and Server Performance..   when the simple stuff was just glanced over.   Its like the Game Itself went straight thru the Beta Stage virtually untouched, and Beta was focused on the Server-Side.

Speaking of Server Testing;

Why do I need to connect to a server?   Why is there no Offline Option?    This makes no sense to me.    This isn't a Live Service (Skull-N-Bones) or a MMO (WoW).   Forcing a Server Connection opens up a plethora of issues..   Connectivity, Ping, Server Maintenance, Down-time, exploits, griefing...     I just don't get it.

If it was meant to be a MMO, then so be it..  but it isn't?   Its more like a ""Forced Co-Op with people you don't know"" - but not... MMO...  weird, but completely unnecessary.   If you're after a MMO, make a MMO.   If you're after Optional Co-Op, then make a Single Player game with a Co-Op Option..  don't make some messy, headache inducing hybrid.

The Ui needs work, and this is to be expected..  But Simple stuff was overlooked.     

You Can't easily read the descriptions in boxes due to too much text, and figuring out how to read that information is..  tasking..  if you even can.

You have ""Options"" under those description boxes, but they're un-clickable since moving the mouse off the item makes the box go away..  So, why is Options even there?

Weight?   Why is it hidden until it becomes a problem?  Can you modify it?  How?  

Who forgot to mention that HOLDING E was Area Loot? 

Who missed the re-opening of portals is hit and miss - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work?   (Hint: Relog)

You can't split stacks, which is mind-boggling, so there must be a way, right?   Well, I sure can't figure it out.

Why is it when you Place Something, the environment affects (eg. Rain) immediately makes the item ""Soggy"" even tho it isn't ""created"" it is just placed..    Create it, and it has negative environmental attributes instantly.    It ""exists"" to the world, and the world affects the item, but doesn't ""exist"" to the player.

The ""Teaching of the game mechanics"" needs work, but this is to be expected..

The Character Creation was..  perplexing.    Why is there Lineage?  (Parents, Grandparents..) - is it to make the already comically ugly choices even... more ugly?  I can't figure out if I made a Male Character or a Female Character...   Did someone there get caught up in this Woke Multi Gender crap?

The Combat isn't... Fluid.   Of course, this is probably due to being unnecessarily connected to some server somewhere, but whatever...  its ""clunky and choppy"" and most of all, there is no collision, so a mob will walk right ""into you"" and stand there hitting you, and you are unable to hit them until either you or the mob moves...  but the trick here is, you can't see if that happened or not.   Literally.   If a mob comes up behind you, and you don't see it (you're in 1st person) and you start getting smacked, you turn around, and there is nothing there.    Where am I getting smacked from?   Move a little, the mob ""pops out of you"".   Great.  

Speaking of combat.   I hit something for 40, great..   I crit for 80..  okay.    Oh, I just crit for 1,200.  Insta-kill.  Seems legit.

and I have found a LOT more in this mere 7 or so hours..  

I understand this is the ""Starting point"" - I don't mind the concept of the game, nor the idea/theory behind it.   While it isn't original, It is unique.

However, now is the time to make good choices or bad choices.   It will be interesting to see how this game develops.

For real though games really good but lacking some polish for sure, and still has a few notable major bugs. If you jump at EA titles and have an understanding what problems you might encounter then +1 

Otherwise if you going to review bomb it when you hit these issues. Just let it cook for a bit more and check back later. This very much hits the definition of an EA title. But the game has amazing potential.

The story is a bit shallow but the settings are very interesting. crafting has a mechanic where different materials will yield different stats, but im still in the erlie game using rocks and sticks. crafting base components is a little slow, specifically the amount of needed materials, and as far as i can tell you cant get materials back if you need to move something, but there are a ton of different things to make and a bunch of different styles to find. 
fixing things does not take the same crafting mats, in part due to the varied materials you can use to craft them, but rather it takes essence. that is basically a currency, you can use it to trade as well, but can be extracted from like every item you pick up and shoved into anything to fix it with varied costs. there is also a repair all button, an inventory sorting button, and while you cant pull from storage at a crafting bench you do have quick stacking.

One of my few complaints, other then the amont of material it takes to build a base feeling a little disproportionate and the server instability, is that the UI can be a little strange with menu close buttons not alwase in the same place. due to being alwase online, the game does not pause when you are opening a chest or in a menu, and without the ability to click off and close a menu quickly, it can be very confusing to be attacked while sorting inventory. While Puk is fully voiced, the other NPCs iv seen so far are not, but this isnt the worst. most of my disconnections have been during zone loading and iv only been locked out of the server due to capacity once (witch isn't too bad for day one). I will admit I do not know when or how the game saves, or what happens when you die. 

all in all, I like it, but it def needs some more work to shine. it might be better with a group of people to help offset the crafting mat requirements for building. you can stage all of your buildings and donate materials to them over time, however I don't know how to cancel a build yet...

some minor tips- cards are consumables and you find them semi often / can buy or craft them so don't be too worried about using them, even more so for the realm cards that change the rules of the world your in. it also seems to change the session and color pallet of the zone should you be interested in that. it seems like there are crafting recipes scattered throughout the map, and if you bought it already it just gives you essence. ammo crafting for the simple sling also seems to craft a fair amount of ammo per crafting pretty cheaply, and can do a fair amount of damage. while you can auto fill the crafting requirements, there is also a # to craft option if you have materials for multiple crafts at a time, and so far crafting stations are based on time but do things automatically. crafting in a fire wont work in the rain, but you can build it under a tent. some crafting things also have conditions that make them better, such as being on a foundation or close to a fire, as does your bed. you can sleep through a night if its dark, but otherwise you just rest a bit and time does not pass. there is also magic, but iv yet to get to it, and things to find on the map that have varied sizes from small statues to large palaces, some with hidden rewards.

Play with a mouse/keyboard! Controller support is scant and mind numbingly annoying. I was able to select a different background, rotate my second character, and access parts of the creation menu with the mouse that is just not feasible with a controller.

Also, the Red Knight is ridiculously overpowered for how we're geared and how off the cursor is in relation to hitboxes. I let my follower sacrifice herself over and over to beat him because there's just no way Mountain Man armor is going to take on a world boss.

DAY ONE REVIEW BELOW!
At its current state, and despite it being Day One, I have played almost three hours and feel like I've accomplished little. While I love the *idea* of the game, there are several things already bothering me about it.

CHARACTER CREATION
The menu is clunky and unfinished. I only had one option for background and that was Academic. It seems backwards to the choose a character face and *then* heritage as the option to customize your character further is based on your grandparents. Speaking of grandparents, you can build a family tree which is a nice touch but has no point beyond adding grandparents. Mom and Dad's, as well as that of your great grandparents', genetics don't factor into the heritage portion of customizing. Outside of face shape, genetics have no factor on how your character looks as far as hair color, eye color, skintone, etc.

There are quite a few customization options including how detailed your eyes are - right down to the amount of veins of the sclera and the texture of the iris. For a game spent either in First Person or Third Person, this seems like a silly option. The standard features for faces - nose depth, chin depth, cheeks, et al. - are there; however, there is no option to rotate or move your character to see their profile. Perhaps this is a feature meant for down the line, but for now good luck in not making an Ugly! In terms of tweaking these settings, it is very subtle. This goes for color of makeup and skin details. The changes are either minuscule or drastic. Unfortunately, despite my best effort poor Philomena Bramble came out looking like a lady of the night with bright red cheeks and a raccoon eyes.

TUTORIAL
If there is one, I wasn't sure I was in it! I died, yes, literally died! before even entering the first portal in the cave you find yourself in. I spoke to Puck, found out there IS a Third Person POV, and slipped into the menu to toggle it because I don't honestly know if there's a way to do it in game with keyboard/mouse or on controller (which I am using). While in the menu, I was immediately KO'd by some random spawns before I'd even touched the portal. That is, without out a doubt, one of the WORST mechanics I have encountered outside of the dumb dinosaur game where you play as dinos, which is sort of what this feels like. After that, I spawned into the first biome and then it was a battle for life and death trying to figure what the hell was a berry bush and not just a bush as I was already starving! Your first quest is to build a campfire, but it does not tell you how to do that, nor does it tell you how to cook those berries. It took a bit to discover that the round clumps of pellets on the ground are the rocks you need (unlike Conan Exiles where you see a stone and you just grab it). 

The building is a bit confusing. The position of the cursor in Third Person is so far off to the side and just bad, I had to momentarily switch to keyboard/mouse just to figure how to add said berries to the fire. The overall crafting menu is weird and needs to be streamlined. The building menu needs to be remapped as rotating items, placing them (good luck trying to figure out what is the front and what is the back), does not align with other survival game standards (ie this has too many buttons to do simple things). 

Navigating the HUD on controller is wonky. On an MMO mouse, pressing 1-9 on the side would be fine, but the way they've set up navigation hurts my brain. The D-Pad controls two different sides of the HUD and you have to scroll through each item to get to the one you want instead of just making it one single line like most any game. I also can't tell you what's the pick ax and what's the hatchet as they look the same, with no overlay text to tell you otherwise when selecting them from your HUD.

You need to eventually get your ilvl up (at this point I was madge and just wanted to stop playing so I've forgotten what it's called) to 20 but, again, it does not tell you how to do that. You also need to build a Respite (beacon) using stone blocks that are not, in fact, crafted as one might think. They are *mined* from larger rocks if you can find one that your lowly pick ax can handle. 

Again, if I was in a tutorial, I'm not sure I was there as there is very little guidance on how to navigate menus, craft, etc. and I think that was something a game like this really needs.

COMBAT AND THE MAP
Combat, harvesting, and just basically doing anything that requires more than one arm is odd. Your left arm is more or less paralyzed as you have to mechanically move it with the LB button. I didn't bother seeing if I could remap it, but that feels weird to me. The block button is neither LB/RB but a completely separate third button which makes no sense. Blocking should be both at the same time (or, you know, LT/RT).

Fighting a beast is a bit of a gamble. The cursor as I mentioned above is wildly to the side and not center. This means while in combat, your swings are not determined by the direction your character is facing but by the wonky placement of the cursor. This holds true for harvesting dead creatures - each item falls individually and is a pain to pick up in this fashion - as you can't simply 'look down' but have to literally hunch over and find the hit box just right. The feature to harvest everything from a creature menu (like WoW or Conan) is sorely needed.

When I was finally told about the map, I was already on the Home Realm, as it were. That is three realms later and not where one should learn about its existence (meaning, as soon as you land in the first!). Upon pulling it up, I wasn't able to zoom. I actually couldn't stand to look at it very long as IT IS NOT STATIONARY. I was unable to place a waypoint where I wanted because of this. Attempting to do so sent the map cursor moving on its own without input from me. What a terrible feature! People with motion sickness may find it a bit troublesome. 

MINOR THINGS
There are A LOT of missing text fields with 'Add Text' or 'ABC'. A LOT. I understand this is an early access game, and realize this review is a bit harsh, but menus without text just exacerbate the many other issues this game has so far. I am playing solo and did not encounter lag spikes or disconnects. However, I am running an Nvidia 1080 and the screen tearing, even with V-Sync on, is awful. 

Overall, this game looks like it will be fun, but not today and not for a while. I'd wait to purchase as the trailer and in-depth video that just came out make Nightengale sound like it's far more finished than it is. I'm disappointed, but hopefully that will change.",1708467143,1708531349,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Pros:  
-The portal system makes for a nice way to present a bunch of procedural generated worlds
-The gathering and crafting is pretty high up on the totem poll
-The building is right up my alley, it's like The Forest.  Place blueprints; friends can haul over materials and add them to complete the build
-Graphics look great, lighting on ultra is beautiful, sky effects really add a nice level to ""lost in space"" vibes
-Story driven; this is a huge pro for some people, and it pushes you pretty well **without** the feeling of, ""I need to B-line this story every second of the game or else I'm wrong"" like Baldur's Gate 3 feels like sometimes.
-Neat grapple-tool climbing system is decently smooth
-Fishing and other aspects are well done

Cons:
-The portal system suffers from the same issue NMS has, while there are infinite possibilities, it's just the same 3 biomes with different shapes.
-The interface is god awful. An improvement since some of the alpha tests, but some of the worst I've seen in a long time.  (still not as bad as MKB on vanilla Skyrim) not only is the layout horrible, it's jank; clicks sometimes don't click, fields get highlighted as if you were using HTML; it's bad
-The companion AI is ... bad.  Just to throw Skyrim under the bus here, it's that bad.  Except, I'd say worse because: they said they can gather for you, they don't... they will cut trees.  -sometimes- pick up loot.  Sometimes.  And when I say cut trees, I mean they will cut trees randomly.  Sometimes run over to one to whack it once, stand there for 3 minutes, then whack it again, other times they'll cut 5 trees back to back; this has zero bearing on if YOU are cutting trees or gathering.  This was tested by me and my friends trying to solve a jump puzzle and talking to a NPC.  The companions, EVEN MID COMBAT, will start cutting trees.  Spoiler: trees hurt when they fall on you.  This is BETTER than Skyrim because: they don't block doorways.  You can walk through them.  Which is cool until you try to build and they just spend most of their time walking in your way so you click and miss place something.  N E A T.
-Optimization isn't there.  On ""nVidia Performance"" shadows are off and textures look like 2010 era and it sits around 90fps with a 3070ti (albeit a dated CPU), still stutters with loading and moving around, but playable.  Similar to my Enshrouded experience.
-Grouping really breaks the concept of the portals.  You need cards to visit other realms, then someone can just invite you and you travel instantly from where you are to their realm.  What's the point of portals?  It all feels very rigid and doesn't flow together.  You give estate cards to a player so they can visit your house at anytime, even when you're offline, but they can go and give that card to someone else and ransack your property.  
-Overall QOL: From what I can tell there is no ""combine inventory with container"" button except ""transfer all"" which obviously isn't great unless the container is full.  There is no crafting from container, labeling from what I've seen, etc... definitely a hot mess if you want to have a 4-6 player world/server style community like ARK/Conan/Valheim.

Overall I'm a diehard fan of the genre, but I'm sad so many obvious things were overlooked (I'm running on zero sleep and forgetting stuff, I know it) People in other regions getting 200+ latency, server issues, the extremely raggedy respite restrictions and such, letting you build in any realm but can only ""save"" the location if it's an Abeyance realm... it's sloppy.  

In the end if anybody is enjoying this game (or any systems that I may have listed as a con) then that's all that matters.  Video games should be about having fun, don't tear someone down for enjoying them, no matter how bad you feel they are. <3

- Mining is pretty satisfying
- Farming feels rewarding 
- EXPLORING feels rewarding (one of the key necessities for survival)

- The game is always online, even in solo: this is already causing huge issues, with server maintenance happening in the first day meaning all players were completely unable to play for a duration of time, there's also a hell of a lot of rubber-banding and lag, which I assume is due to the servers which is pretty unacceptable in singleplayer lobbies, why not have an offline mode?? It makes no sense. 

- The game runs pretty poorly: Whilst having great visuals the performance is really inconsistent, the shader compilation stuttering is prominent in this game which is a common issue with UE titles. Even on lowest settings on a 4090 I still had regular annoying stutters.

- The UI and User Experience is a nightmare: It's so hard to navigate the inventory and crafting menus a lot of the time, and often just makes me scratch my head and wonder why the developers decided to design these menus in such an un-intuitive manner. It's like they actively tried to make it as hard as possible to use. The HUD is also very cluttered, and when I'm trying to take in the breathtaking world and art design, I am inundated with constant pop-ups of status effects and other various elements that should be moved or made smaller. 

Despite all of the negatives I mentioned above, the game is fun, and I am finding myself wanting to play more, I think there is a lot of promise here and with a good few updates that address the main issues, the game could potentially be a top contender in the survival-craft genre.

Booting the game up to receive multiple pop-ups about my drivers and the minimum specs to *exceed* is not a good start to the game.

I spent an hour playing through a tutorial that could have lasted ten minutes. The only thing not synonymous with other survival games was the world-hopping mechanic. Which while neat, isn't a great way to sell the game.

(I know some of these will come out in updates over time but it still seems undercooked even for EA).

Here is a quick list of my personal problems/issues/complaints:
- No quick stack items
- Recruit AI is the worst I have ever seen (they provide literally nothing other than bag space reliably)
- Why can Puck not let me fast travel to the top of the dungeon I just painfully climbed all the way down (as if the magic don't exist or whatever?)
- The UI and menus is cluttered as hell and clunky to interact with in general
- Why are there 2 build modes? (no build mode tutorial, hard to naturally find the way to dismantle/move objects
- No quick pulling from chests for crafting (ah yes let me crawl around with all the raw wood and stone I need to craft things)
- Terrible traversal; ledge grabbing is inconsistent and clunky, climbing picks are jank and buggy as hell, the picks and parasol DRAIN stamina like a mf
- Puzzles that are based on said terrible traversal and other kinda bland mechanics for almost 0 reward
- Why do buffs from rewards literally last like 2 minutes? What is the point?
- The player icon/pointer on the map blocks the POI you are near or standing on, so you cannot see what it is
- With the way menus and UI exist in this game a search function should be implemented
- My main gripe with no offline play is being unable to actually tune the world settings to my liking (if I dont like the grind they decide on well tough luck)
- Feeling like you need to build bases in each world/realm but they quickly become meaningless, making hopping realms feel a bit tedious
- Game loses its cool aesthetics and vibes when you are stuck in rags and shacks for god knows how long...

Anyhow thats enough complaining, things like quick pull from chests for crafting and quick stack have been hinted to be some of the first things devs will add to the game but releasing without these in 2024 after solid competition released isn't exactly a great start.

Much of what can set it apart isn't apparent right away but needs a few hours to unlock and experience. It isn't Valheim, nor is it Enshrouded, and it isn't trying to be. I played in 2 closed alpha tests and have been further than the 7.3hrs I have as of this review.

A lot of what will set Nightingale apart from others in the genre is aesthetic - the Victorian, gaslamp-punk theme - but a few mechanics are a welcome addition. It is online-only with company-hosted servers (at least during Early Access) which is something to keep in mind. Nightingale is it's own thing - but there are enough similarities between it and other heavy hitters in the genre that you may find yourself comparing it to them. If you've played a lot of crafting-survival games, you know what you're in for. It's Crafting-heavy, Survival-lite. 

For me, it's some of the best elements in the genre. Here are some key differences and points to consider:

[h1]Survival[/h1]
[*] Food - You can have 3 different foods active at a time, a la Valheim or Enshrouded. They provide various buffs
[*] There is no detrimental hunger or thirst to worry about, other than not having their associated buffs
[*] Every single food provides different buffs - even ""mixed vegetables"" can stack differently depending on which vegetables you mixed, so inventory management is a thing with foods (even if there is only one icon for mixed vegetables, they may not be the same combo and are thus different stacks)
[*] If you die, you keep what is in your hotbar, but you drop what is in your inventory. You will respawn at your Estate cairn or the nearest Faerie Ring, and can retrieve your dropped items where you died.
[*] 1-5 are your main hand and mousewheel will scroll between them. 6-0 are your offhand, and whatever you have equipped there can be used with 'F' (such as your umbrella, or food). Q is reserved for health potions in addition to the offhand.

[h1]Crafting[/h1]
[*] You right-click anything in your inventory and have the option to ""Extract"" it into Essence. Essence is both the currency of the game, as well as what you use to repair items. It is important to always have essence on hand for these reasons.
[*] Once you progress a bit into the story, crafting stations can be augmented with additional, non-functional items (Examples include a coat rack, glass jug, training dummy, teapot, etc). These affect what recipes can be made at various crafting benches. It is important to note that you may need more than 1 of a certain crafting bench as each kind has a maximum number of augments. There are a lot of augment recipes available as you play. This, imo, adds to the pleasure of base-building and managing the look, rather than purely the functionality, of it all.
[*] Benches and Augments are ""unlocked"" by purchasing them from vendors in exchange for essence. This means you will need to visit a variety of Realms in order to find different vendors from different factions to buy different crafting stations and augments. Augments unlock the ability for the bench to craft certain items, but does not unlock those items themselves
[*] You purchase Recipes for items to craft from merchants, so again, traveling to other Realms is very important
[*] You can blueprint out entire buildings at a time. They will remain like holographic representations of the floors, walls, etc. Then you can add materials as you acquire them, and it will build-out in the order of the pieces you laid. This makes planning out a building quite enjoyable. 
[*] Much like with food, every material used in crafting imparts it's own stats to gear. This means the type of leather depends on the beast it was harvested from, different metals have different effects, etc. This makes the crafting system quite deep once you're further in to the game and have access to more materials - I enjoy this, some may find it cumbersome, but it really lends to being able to tweak the gear to what you want it to be. This applies to just about everything you craft - even bullets. 

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
[*] You play through a required single-player tutorial to learn the basics, then start your own Private realm to place your Estate cairn (Estate cairns will only work correctly in realms with the Abeyance card played, which you do as the last part of the tutorial).
[*] From there, you can hit P, create a Party with friends on Steam and invite them to your realm. If they place THEIR Estate carins there, then any of you can log in and access that realm at any time. If they don't, they will only be able to access your realm if you invite them, each play session that you're online.
[*] Players in your Realm can build, destroy, etc
[*] When you use cards to create NEW realms, you can set them to Private (Party-only), or Public. Keep in mind the construction/demolition capabilities of all players if you set it to Public
[*] You can only fast-travel to your 1 Estate Cairn stone, so be sure to put it in the same realm as a friend if you want to share a base and be able to play without the other online

[h1]Gripes/Negatives[/h1]
[*] While melee combat feels decent, it isn't good enough to hold this game on its own. It's okay as a part of the bigger picture, but some evolution in combat capabilities would be nice to see through Early Access.
[*] Rest - Your Rested stat plays a big role in your maximum stamina, and the duration before your stamina drops noticeably is a bit short. Not game breaking, but I have to be cognizant of it a bit more than I want to be.
[*] Some game-play elements, such as figuring out how Augments work and how to get them, aren't incredibly clear in-game. Googling or official-discord-visits may be necessary.

At the end of the day, it's Early Access. If this period continues with updates and they listen to the community, I think this is a really solid foundation to build out a game that stands among the heavy hitters of the genre.",1708527755,1708528809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 - Average performance / optimisation

It's an Indie Studio just trying to use Early Access to help with funding and development of their project, and of course to deliver us something tangible after the wait.

AAA companies today abuse Early Access releases and ship unfinished games to vacuum money from players with the ""fix it later"" attitude, so I understand frustration, but I mean come on.

[b]General[/b]

+ Beautiful game and the premise is fun
- The game starts out extremely slow, and can feel very grindy at the beginning, especially if you're not used to the survival genre or expect to be handed everything on a silver platter.
- Movement can feel really slow and unresponsive at times, like when ""climbing"" up or over an obstacle and the animation for that makes it feel like your speed is suddenly dropped to 0.
- I personally don't like dividing the quickbar to main and offhand, I want to have all my tools in quickslots, not 5 tools and 5 random consumables.
- The fact that your companion, when equipped with a chopping axe, will cut down all trees in your vicinity and while doing so destroys half your buildings (with falling trees) in your base is absolutely bonkers. You should be able to either tell the companion to go to a specific area to farm or to block them from farming in a built area. Trying to remember to go to their inventory to equip or unequip stuff whenever you enter or leave a base is not the optimal solution. 

[b]Survival and Exploration[/b]

+ The world is beautiful and vibrant
+ The portal card system with different combinations of worlds is a fun way to discover different places and environments, though you need to play quite a bit before you actually can explore the other realms.
+ Survival aspects are somewhat fleshed out so there's hunger and fatigue, injuries, temperature and other environmental factors besides just ""food buffs""
- While there's plenty of options for environments through different card combinations, the complexity of each realm itself could use some love, specifically in terms of creatures having more variety. 

[b]Combat [/b]

- The enemy AI and movement is horrible, as many others have also noted. This needs a lot of attention from the devs to make combat fun.
- At the beginning of the game you're forced to essentially fight with your tools and it feels super clunky
- It takes you FOREVER to get an actual weapon. Forever. I have almost 10 hours in and still no actual melee weapon. Please just give me a sword.

[b]Building and crafting[/b]

+ Using different types of materials to craft your items with different stats is a great way to add variety
+/- Crafting system is somewhat complex and requires a bit of dabbling to make sense of, and the UI needs some serious quality of life improvements
- While having recipes blocked behind npc vendors is not a bad thing by itself, it definitely feels like at the beginning you have nothing available to actually make building and crafting enjoyable or to look good. You should NOT have to buy basic roofs separately, upgraded looks are a different thing.

In general, as long as this isn't abandoned it has all the building blocks to become a great game, but the current early access release is still ages away from that.",1708528172,1708528225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Went through the first few areas in the tutorial and got the hang of the game. Starts out kind of slow but once you can be Mary Poppins and stab monsters it starts to get interesting.

Making a small house will take you an hour at the rate of material aquisition vs consumtion. Placement on house structures is also dated, like back to ark building placement limits. Zero skill customization other than enchantments, your umbrella glider is uncontrolled and hard to use and you have to scroll to the item and then equip it and then use it while your falling....just not a fun mechanic. 

While i realllly like the victorian aesthetic and the graphics got a killer vibe, as well as the card system is pretty freaking cool, the games in way to early stage to be fun. And if i havent played this enough for the fun to kick in then the early game is killing it so it should definitely be looked into asap.

Nightingale is a perfectly decent game but exists in a world where we have access to great games like the aforementioned and some of the classics like Conan, Ark and 7 Days to Die. If you're a die-hard fan of the Survival genre, like I am, Nightingale is potentially still worth a pickup if you're in the mood for a new game to play but know that it'll be a fairly standard experience.

Instead of doing something innovative, Nightingale plays it fairly safe. It presents itself to you with a Victorian look, which is instantly negated when you craft your first set of hide gear and build your first wood hut. I could show you a screenshot from the early game and you probably couldn't pick it out of a lineup of other generic survival games. To get any of the cool looking stuff you need to progress way further into the game than I am - it's fine to have me work towards something but the early game ends up feeling a lot like any other survival game. The one unique mechanic that Nightingale features - the realm cards - has a lot of potential but as of right now the amount of biomes are limited and the cards aren't as game changing as they potentially could be. Once again, it ends up feeling bland in this department too.

When in a new realm, you'd at least hope the exploration aspect delivers but even that just ends up feeling bland. Sprinkled around the map are various sites of interest that end up being very uninteresting. Kill a handful of enemies to get a chest or a random buff... yeah, it's just as boring as it sounds. This would've been the perfect place to reward players with cool Victorian-esque cosmetics or some cool new building piece. Speaking of enemies, the combat is pretty boring, too. Swing your weapon of choice around a few times, run out of stamina, wait for your stamina to recover and swing some more. The AI is very bad, too, as enemies just rush you.

All of the above is honestly not that bad; I'll take a generic survival game any day since I love the genre. The worst crime Nightingale commits is having an always-online requirement. I get needing to be online to play with my friends but why do I need to connect to a server to play single player? And, totally not surprising to anyone, of course there are server issues that prevent you from playing the game. 

I'll give the game some credit, the building mechanic itself is solid. You can queue up building pieces without having all the materials so you can see exactly what your build looks like before committing resources. You're also free to move placed objects around - including full chests - which ends up making a building mistake less punishing than in some other games. 

I think Nightingale has potential - there's something there that's worth exploring and I hope they use the early access period and player feedback to hone in on the game's strengths - but right now there are better survival games you can get for your 30 bucks. Games that don't bar you from playing them because the servers are down.

NVIDIA GeForce FTX 4070 Ti SUPER

Now with that said - I kept getting crashes stating not enough memory, CPU cannot keep up.  I even adjusted the settings down to high instead of ultra and I couldnt keep the bleed from happening - I think this game has potential but it needs to be optimized - seems older gaming rigs have no issues, but newer ones do? 

I know its beta and I know there are other issues with the game, but for the brief hour i was able to play, combat was boring, gathering seem to be a challenge where you needed to look down ALOT and hope you got the option to hit E, laggy, due to them requiring you to log into a server not on your own device.

I am going to mirror another players post as I agreed with most of what they said.

The combat though seems like it has potential consists of enemies that don't have much going on except health bars and lame leaps and auto attacks.

Puzzles. The game has ""Unique locations"" that contain puzzles to access upgrades, Bonuses, and Recipes. Sadly, the puzzles are super simple, a 5 year old child could solve them and doesn't feel super engaging.
You can only play with 5 friends right now, and the quests are host locked.

Speaking of tutorials, the tutorial takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on how quickly you catch on to mechanics with limited inventory management and material efficiency, all of which you have to complete before being able to join someone else's world/host one - Ui is interesting but confusing to navigate.

I'm impressed! I bought this for myself the minute it came out and I've played for four hours so far. These are my impressions:
[list]
[*]The language is sophisticated - the vocabulary is advanced and literary, which might be off-putting to non-native English speakers. Add to that the fantastic Fae names that are bizarre and unfamiliar (Humababa? What's that?) and I can imagine a few negative reviews just for that reason, unfortunately. Otherwise this gives a Shakespear's Midsummer Night's Dream vibe and I love it!

[*]Puck's voice acting is top notch!

[*]The core game mechanics : players coming from other survival/builders like Valheim or Enshrouded might be a little confused at first because this game doesn't do the building like that. You [i]can[/i] move things, but you have to hit ""x"" to go into a sort of 'build editing mode' where you can remove or move certain items like your bed etc.

[*]They know it's Early Access and accept that responsibility : I've never seen a game that actually has a ""Help! I'm stuck!"" button, but these people did that, and I think it's fantastic. If you get stuck inside a texture or something bizarre, click that and you will be instantly reset at the nearest 'viable' environment. However, from what I saw, your Quest log and craft ingredients 'tracking' will disappear, as well as the interaction cues from the HUD so [b]use with caution[/b].

[*]""The Card system"" isn't a card [i]system[/i] so this is not a TCG nor is this Gwent or anything annoying like that. It's a means of storytelling, or even just a conceptual model. For example, the entries in your journal (lore, codex, glossary) are visible as though they were 'cards' you had unlocked or received. There is a bit of a 'mix and match' system for the realm portals where you combine two 'card types' in order to activate the portal to take you to that new realm, but so far as I've seen, that's as 'system-like' as it gets. Otherwise they may as well have been 'pages torn from a book' or another type of object that you collect which allows you to 'piece together' your progressive knowledge gained about this game. 
[/list]

(i7. AMD RX 580, Windows 10.)

The game is very gorgeous, the gameplay feels nice, and I so far am enjoying the progression and story. The lack of certain elements are not really a bother as it's EA and really, when I think about this compared to Enshrouded, Atlas, Palworld, Ark, etc. I think it brings a new flavor and style to the genre. I am almost exclusively a fan of survival craft games these days, and while I see room for growth, I do not feel it is fair to judge this particular game (Nightingale) on these very jaded reviews.

The future of this game is full of potential in my eyes. I love the aesthetic. I guess if we're gonna make gripes, I could say I wish I had more pirate themed options because that's my favorite genre of anything, but that's just me. 

I haven't played with anyone else yet, so I don't have much to say on the co-op/party system, but I do know that the starting world is pretty standard. I say, for $30 it's worth it.

So far the game really lacks a true identity. This is the No Mans Sky of survival games so far. The attempt is to do something large and impactful in the space of survival and it's scratching the surface, but only that. The combat is no better than Conan. The building is no better than Valheim. The world aesthetic is no better than enshrouded. The point is, everything you get in Nightingale you have pretty much seen before, the one thing that we are looking forward to is the card system, yet somehow that isn't quite diverse enough to really push the boundaries of the genre. It just becomes a situation where we are re-using way too many assets and re coloring them, I am not sure how far you can push the limits of design with a game of this magnitude, but to be truly special you have to do something REALLY WELL. Combat is not done really well, AI interactions are not done really well, the best part of the game for me so far has simply been getting a sweet screenshot of the sky with the sun hitting just right... but yet while playing the game I never feel like the moment to moment gameplay is breathtaking, in fact its rather clunky. When a tree falls you just think Valheim did that better. The biggest one for me so far is the lack of pulse on the genre, no quick sort to chests?! Like these are the day 1 QOL things you would expect from this genre that has been a tried and true testament to the nature of the game. We are here with hundreds of materials and we have to drag drop everything or else it randomly throws items into a bag. I think that there's just something really draining about this game that I cannot put my finger on yet, but it feels very very undelivered for a game that screams at you with potential. 

I have no problem admitting on my review that I have in no way completed my journey, but there has to be a reason to.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

[list]
    [*]The combat is clunky, boring, and repetitive, regardless of enemy type. 
    [*]You have to be online, constantly, resulting in lag for players who live far from the servers (despite being advertised as a singleplayer and co-op game).
    [*]The build limit is woefully unsuitable for players who are dreaming of big creative builds (like me).
    [*]Realm areas, while beautiful, lack diversity and feels unpolished in some areas (like areas with water).
    [*]AI lacks the I.

Very good world graphics
In depth UI (ignore what people say it really isn't that complicated)
Good story and background
Unique theme and world
Lots of character customization
Lots of content for being Early Access

AI is a little too predictable but still can be difficult if underestimated
Character models in comparison to the world aren't as great

The connectivity has been no issue here in the scandinavian region and the server maintenances have gone down without a hitch so far. The devs are running a tight ship and outside of a few nitpicks and small adjustments needed in AI and some other small systems, I would say the game is well worth the purchase and supporting the devs. Alot of the negative reviews seem to focus around issues that most new releases suffer (regardless of early access or big AAA studios) from and others being dissappointement brought on by their own due to overhyping themselves.

The theme, music, graphics, sound FX and general design is all there. ALot of quality of life features are included in the game that alot of other crafting survival games suffer from a lack of.

This is an early access game, and has early access issues. But it ain't one of the million AAA games shipped recently that flat out don't work and just want to scam a season pass out of you. If you don't want to take part in early access and make the game better, go away, play your imaginary perfect game, and leave feedback to people with an iota of sense.

Review TL;DR: 7/10, with a great deal of potential.
Devs: please keep this game up - seeing mixed must be crushing but honestly this game is great and I want to see it grow and shine. I love the idea that a single card can represent a total shake up of the biomes and world map, and I think this could be one of the survival greats.

(+) Nightingale, above all, is really pretty. I've only played 2 hours but I want to see more of the world. That's a good start for this kind of game. I don't have a massively beefy computer and it still looks and runs fine.

(-) Always online: that sucks, and I really hope they add an offline mode, BUT I can see why they did it - you want as many people on the servers and online as possible during early access to fill out the world, find the bugs and errors, test the load. I'm playing from the UK via wired internet and haven't noticed a single tick of lag. And I play this with friends so honestly I would have been online anyway.

(+) Crafting is pretty good for the first 2 hours - being able to repair using the generic currency means I can comfortably use my best gear without carrying around 5 rocks, two diamons, a Ford F150 engine and a turtle to get the exact resources I need for a repair. Each tier feels like a noticeable increase in power/efficiency and that's the real hook of games like this for me - especially early doors. Nothing worse than crafting a 2% better pick to get the chance to make it 4% better next level. 

(+/-) Item storage and weight: plus and minus because there are some really good ideas in here: weight mattering for your character but not for storage containers is a great idea. I get that I can't carry 500 logs, but being able to sort all my wood into one box without having to worry about reaching the mythical 501st pound and running out of space is nice. Containers have a slot limit which - presumably - will increase as you get better at crafting or make them from rarer materials. Down side to all this is that weight can feel quite restrictive because a lot of the crafting requires maybe 1/5th your inventory to do so you end up running back and forth a LOT. You also don't really know what materials you need until after you need them, which makes gathering a bit hit and miss. 

Nice to have update: auto-transfer contents of boxes to nearby crafting tables: absolutely amazing QoL improvement. Hope this comes soon (maybe it's already there for higher tier containers, I dunno)

Nice to have update 2: make it so auto-fill can't use certain rarity of items or ""flag for non-crafting"" - I very nearly broke down some good quality hides while trying to use my tier one prey hides to make straps. Not game breaking but just a risk that could be super frustrating down the line.

(+/-) Combat: combat is fine, but could do with better AI. It's not particularly challenging early on (maybe it changes later but the AI formula seems fairly basic at this time) and it seems quite open to cheesing (a few friends with knives could probably run rings around most enemies). Again, it's early access and it's far from BAD, just overly simplistic (enemies run towards you, do attack, rinse, repeat). They'll also do pretty dumb stuff like if a lower tier creature is fleeing a predator, it will 100% run into a fire and cook itself if that fire is in the straight line path away from the enemy. Again, I've only played 2 hours so maybe some of the boss monsters and biggest threats have a more nuanced game plan - if so, and the basic enemies being basic is deliberate, that's kinda cool. We'll see.

(+) Character customisation: Love it. My guy looks like a manic depressive bulldog inexplicably got promoted to Sergeant Major of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. 100% would make a melty toff again.

(+) Eating animations: Your character is part snake. All food is inserted whole into the mouth in a single smooth pushing motion. This is invariably hilarious. 0/10 gag reflex.

(+/-) Tutorial: the tutorial is great for teasing a story and giving the VERY basics, but it is missing a few key points: how do I repair a built structure, what are the ""basic"" building materials I should be aware of when planning a base, foraging for and cooking vegetables is super important to avoid starvation, why my health is set at 5 when I am starving. These things are loosely touched on but inclusion in the narrative would be great. ALSO, I really hope there's a skip option added - it's fine once (interesting even), but if I make a second character because I decide my moustache isn't bushy enough, I don't really want to spend 90 minutes faffing before I can join another realm.",1708522437,1708522437,True,3,1,0.504895925521850586,0,True,False,True

All the reviews regarding stability or little bugs need to realise this is the very first public release of the game and these will be fixed. Some giving negative reviews before they have even played the damn thing.

The unlimited combination of PC hardware devs need to accommodate for all working slightly different and people have a fit over the tiniest thing. Did you see the state of the Skull and bones game after 10 years of dev from a huge publisher? Get over yourself jeez.

Anyway!

The concept is unique and something that will really give this game longevity. The combat is fun with loads of little elements people don't seem to notice, knives having increased back stab damage for example paired with the dodge ability makes for a great little agility build.

The weather and sound effects are incredibly immersive, to the point where they really make you want to seek shelter. Did you know it hails in some biomes? And hurts??

Every realm is unique and fairly large, the monsters you gain materials from influence the perks of gear, building is intuitive, I could just keep listing the positives. These devs have genuinely hit the ground running in my eyes with all the mechanics, creativity and quality of life elements of the game and this is just Day 1.

The game is still in early access, and in some aspects it shows - however, at this early stage of development I must say it's grand already. The story made me more than curious, and keeps me going, as I want to learn more, the world is beautiful and well put together, the amount of customisation and attention to detail is astounding (for example: fireplace doesn't work when its raining right on it).

The positive things first:
- rich open worlds, with high levels of detail, that feel alive
- very detailed crafting system, that actually makes a whole lot of sense
- beautiful graphics
- overall runs very well for an early access title
- good story (as I can tell so far)
- survival elements never feel tedious
- combat is fun and engaging, with various fighting styles
- building is peak
- countless activities already available
- countless ways to customise the way and world you play in
- encourages exploration, because no world setting ever feels the same
- multiplayer

the negative:
- always online is kinda sucky tbh
- the character editor, as of right now, needs serious help
- as far as i can tell right now, no possibility to really swim/dive or utilise the waterspace
- some things could get explained a lot better by toturials

All in all I can say I can personally recommend this game already, as of right now, It has a lot of potential, and I'm very much looking forward to what is to come for this title.

+ you can build quite nicely and due to the plethora of crafting tables and improvements you can really dedicate entire rooms/ houses to certain crafting processes
+ world building seems great so far

+- player costimization is a lil tricky as the characters have a certain style aking to caricatures. You can still achieve beauty by ancestry which may or may not require your parents and grandparents to be gay for certain looks... very strange mechanic indeed


- poorly optimised still (there appears to be a memory leak somewhere as performance suffers over time

A unique take on the Fae realm, branching portals and endless worlds full of danger and loot! This games focus is survival and exploration. With thriving biomes, challenging dungeons, puzzles, quests and more, it certainly aims to keep you busy too. While some concern lies over the always online issue, this is quite literally a feature that makes the game what it is. You can share a base with your friends and anyone can enter at anytime. 

Building is easy, has lots of styles and decoration, and best of all, the decor has function! Clutter not only makes your home unique but provides bonuses to crafting. 

You’ll find many cool creatures and locations on your journey. Alongside some friendly faces and stake your claim on the land. 

Do your self a favor, become a Realm Walker. 

My only issue has been some a bug where in co/op, entering portals makes me disconnect, but 9 out of 10 times, I can just reconnect. I assume this is something patchable so I have faith.

It's a great concept, just needs some polish. The building aspect is fun, but unnecessarily limiting (can only place lights in certain places, etc.). The enemy variety is wanting, but I expect that will change as the game progresses. There does not seem to be a way to ""move"" already constructed objects, which is kinda stupid, so you have to destroy them and rebuild them at a loss. So yeah, those things aren't great.

But the game is BEAUTIFUL, and has me wanting to come back and explore every nook and cranny. Combat is fun so far, and I image will only get better as new weapons and mechanics are introduced. The survival aspects aren't intrusive and are relatively smooth.

First off, what most of the negative reviews are about: it's online only. This hasn't bothered me much - my only concern is that as it's online only and since they are paying for the infrastructure costs it's hard to tell how long this game will last. It's not an issue for me because I rarely play games for longer than 2 years unless I love them but most games like this do not shell out additional money to transform online only into local before dying, so be warned.

With that out of the way, overall Nightinggale is a charming survival crafting game with a (seemingly) deep crafting system. I'm not extremely far in the game yet as I haven't figured out a good cadence to progression (like, do I build new buildings in every realm or keep going back, how do I get back to where I was before, etc). The different realms so far haven't been ""wow amazing exploration"" but they're neat. I have no idea how multiplayer works yet.

The combat is ""fine"". It's a little more complex than unmodded vanilla skyrim. However, hitting enemies with melee weapons results in a visible impact and a nice crack that feels pretty good.

The soundtrack is the weakest part of the game. It's neither charming nor interesting, and it's very mutable. The music you hear in the trailer is pretty much the entire game's soundtrack so far as far as I can tell.

Building is fun for me. I haven't unlocked many decorative parts but the crafting system is nice and encourages building homes for a purpose rather than purely decoration (different stations affect other stations, lighting has a purpose, et cetera).",1708521137,1708521232,True,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

-The combat is bland and is just smacking enemies that do a simple charge attack. The first bow you get is beyond useless as it's inaccurate and takes a month to load.

-The building is a system designed around wasting your time with un-fun activities. The usual chop a tree/smash a rock only gets you so far as most of the building is Locked behind a npc that sells blueprints. So instead of a level up progression, you're trying to extract currency from random items to save up for your next progression (More time-waste grinding). 

-The connectivity is also an issue with random spikes of lag and choppiness. I also found myself needing to use the ""I'm stuck"" feature quite often as I clipped through landscapes and monuments. (At least that feature is in the game)

If the game eventually gets good I'll most likely never know as I don't think I'll be booting this game up again.",1708520892,1708520892,False,4,0,0.502618074417114258,0,True,False,True

I decided to start building but I think I made a mistake as there are so many beautiful places in this game and I just started to build the first space I saw lol. Can you tell one of my first video games was the Sims?

 I see a lot of people complaining about things but it is an early access game and most of the complaints make sense for an early access game. I feel like if little things bother you, you should wait it out but if you don't mind some imperfections that are getting buffed out join the menagerie and help make the game better.

Also for those looking for a split item button when in the inventory you want to split the item from, select the item. Go to the bottom of that inventories menu, it should say something like move from inventory. If you click it, it will bring up a menu where you can select the quantity and how much it will way, a nice touch in my opinion.

Sound effects, music and voice acting are superb. Combat is fairly simplistic but feels nice and fun IMO. Crafting has quite a bit of depth to it that is enjoyable to explore. The lore with its victorian age art style is really interesting and quite fresh.

All this game needs to become outstanding are some of the already announced expansions on its core mechanic (the realms), and some QOL features that should be considered standard in 2024. Particularly the inventory management needs work. There needs to be at least one type of storage that can be used as estate-wide in- and output for crafting stations. Games like Palworld and Enshrouded show why this is a must have. Without it, managing inventories and crafting in general becomes a needlessly complicated and annoying ordeal that is only emphasized by the carry weight limit of your character.

Quest progression is not shared for parties, which is either blessing or a curse depending on personal preference. You can build bases together. Crafting benches are shared. But in order to use all the recipes for a given crafting station you need to individually unlock them first.
Personally, I think this is fine, because I don't like it when my progression in the game is interfered by others. I feel that it shortens the game too much when friends keep playing while you're offline.  The way unlocks currently work in Nightingale however, can definitely be improved in some ways, but it's far from being a deal breaker to me.
Meanwhile I see a lot of people whine their butts off about progression not being shared. Well... if you look at a game like Enshrouded, people are whining and complaining that it *is* being shared. So it seems like this really mostly boils down to personal preference. Lots of people love shared progress, lots of them hate it. So no matter what the devs do here, someone is going to whine about it. In a game with shared realms, they're going to have to make a choice. It is what it is.

Lastly, this is an always on game. Another blessing or curse, depending on what type of player you are. I am never offline, thus I belong to the former camp.
While it's true that you can't play this game offline, the one massive advantage its online realm system brings is that you don't need a (dedicated) server host for co-op multplayer. It's a really cool thing to populate a realm with your friends and be able to invite and play with whomever you want regardless of whether your friends are online or not. You can build and play with others without them having to be online whenever you are, and without having to pay and manage some dedicated server host to share a realm with friends.
So while I can definitely sympathize with people who don't like the system, I personally think it's a pretty cool concept that can and most likely will elevate this game to something that is not only a survival co-op game but also really good MMOG. 
Of course it all hinges on how stable and low latency Inflexion Games can maintain their server infrastructure and how far they'll take the realm system as a whole. So I guess we'll see whether this approach works out for them or not. If it's not stable enough and doesn't provide very good ping for all regions, it's going to be its downfall. If it runs well, Nightingale might just be the first game to really blend the survival and MMOG genres into someting very, *very* cool.

Overall I give Nightingale a solid 7 out of 10 survivals. If the devs introduce some desperately needed QOL and hurry up with more interesting and challenging realm cards, Nightingale just might jump up to a 10/10, simply because the way it's core loop around realms works lends itself to producing an absolutely amazing and ever expanding endgame, which is something very few, if any, survival games have.

Mike biggest gripe is the fact my mouse doesn't stay locked to the game so when in combat my mouse thinks its outside of the game and becomes unusable. The long loading times to get into the server is ridiculous. This should have been implemented in a better way probably similar to how Valheim. Not saying the game needs to have gameplay like Valheim either. Just the backend framework should have been designed in a way for an offline connection and if you want to play multiplayer then you can host a local session on you world or get a dedicated server.

The price point for all that you are getting makes it absolutely worth it, bugs and all. The product is not yet finished and they have not pretended that it is like so many other game developers have. They openly ask for our input and have given an easy way to report bugs so that they can fix it. LOVE IT! 

Some things that aren't great at the moment: 

Character customisation, very grainy, needs lots of work. But the ideas that they are trying to use in it are very clever and once they polish it up then it will look really good. 

The tutorial is crap, could be a lot better. Especially with Puck, who just floats there. 
I was seriously worried about the game during the tutorial but once I had gotten into my chosen realm that when I started to see the magic. 

I found first person mode to crash way less than third person mode but that is understandable because the Devs added this after we requested it.

You have to connect to a server in order to play, I don't like it because then you are at the mercy of server queues and crashes etc. but I have faith they will fix this in the future. 

Should you get this game? Absolutely! for 30 $ you get almost quadruple the amount of content and fun than what you would get for an allegedly finished 'AAAA game '. Also you get to be part of the development of this game and shape how it will turn out in the future - Which is great.

I play a lot of these survival crafting games, and several EA games (7 Days to Die alone is several years of EA now), so some things here are fine, and the bugs I encountered weren't that big of a deal, but there are a myriad of other problems.

The good:
-Gorgeous game that ran well on my rig at ultra settings (I have a beefy rig and live in the midwest of the US so my connections is good which helps).
-The blueprint system for building is great. I love being able to plan out something and then fill it in over time.
-Cards affecting the worlds you visit is a neat idea with lots of possibilities.
-Being able to join worlds without the host having to be on is a nice bonus.

The bad:
-Mob AI is brain-dead. When you can solo 3-4 mobs (of a couple different types) with the most bare bones knife you can make and take no damage, that's not a great sign for things to come.
-Besides the aforementioned AI, the combat in general is boring and simplistic. 
-The starting weight limit is frustrating to the point that it partially negates the blueprint advantage I mentioned above.
-Character customization is better than most, but not as robust as it appears.
-The grind is already dull this early on, so it must be mind-numbing later on. (And I'm used to grind from other similar games and MMOs)
-It's a plus and a minus really, but the idea that different types of similar components give different stats and ability bonuses is a great idea, but it's a mess to to keep track of and actually do in game.
-No drawing from containers for crafting stations bothers me less than some, but in a game like this, with so many variations of sub-components, it's terrible.
-Victorian aesthetic is largely absent this early on as I live in a neolithic box of rocks with a crude wooden door. Watching people much further on, I have no idea when we get to actually build things that look remotely like what they advertised.
-Exploration isn't very exciting, which is a huge downer for me.

If you ignore that and push through the awful hitching you're greeted with rubber banding trying to do the most basic things. At that point it was clear that this game was NOT ready for early access and needed more time in development to fix basic issues.

Get this game. If you're on the fence, get this game. Yes, it's online only (this has already been addressed by the Devs and won't be forever), but I'm based middle of nowhere UK with acceptable internet speeds at best and have had no issues. The fact that this game has mixed reviews is mind boggling to me, I don't know if these people haven't played Survival Craft games, early access games or a game on day 1 of release before, but realistically Nightingale has met, if not dramatically exceeded, expectations on all of these fronts.  

For sure there will be improvements to be made between now and full release, but from updates and discussions created by the Devs, it seems that not only are they taking onboard player feedback as it comes in, but they were prepared for potential issues that may occur - the fact that I was easily able to find info about the 1 error code I encountered from a Dev Discussion post, and not digging through several Reddit threads gave me legit big feelings (it was server maintenance). 

Character creation is phenomenal, the sheer amount of customisation that is already implemented is verging on overwhelming but in the best way (and you don't have to do it all if you don't want to, but I wanna be a badass steampunk fairy so I'm here for it). I spent more time on my make up in this game than in real life. 

The world design is gorgeous, each realm I've seen so far feel well populated and meaningful - nothing that feels like it's been added as an afterthought or just to bulk out the gameplay. They have all been noteably different from the last, but still maintaining a balanced accessibility to the basic materials.

Combat is simplistic (which I prefer in general), but very smooth and nice to engage with. So far enemies haven't just fully bum rushed me at any point and instead take a moment to re-engage in combat after taking a hit. Animations have been pretty clear in telegraphing attacks, damage amounts feel balanced and attacks are well timed.

I'm not a big survival craft builder, so I leave that to my partner (minecraft wood hut vs Conan Exiles Strahds castle replica skill levels) but both the building and crafting menus are good, nothing stupid complex or difficult to navigate. They're crafting menus, so IMO if they aren't actively bad, I don't have a problem with them.

Cons First,

Network: The game never advertised as fully offline and while I haven't seen anything yet that requires network connection, I don't presume to know until I havev reached endgame its not necessary. If you have good internet and live in the US, you'll be fine though. If you live elsewhere or have bad internet see other reviews.

Character Creation: Not pretty, but adequate and above average for a $30.00 early access game.

Combat: Don't presume to know for more advanced enemies. Thus far no challenge but some enemy diversity. Doesn't seem to be the focus.

Pros:

Survival: This game doesnt seem tedious in my opinion in its survival mechanics but early on shows more diversity than many other games. Environments that expect you to shield yourself from the sun, avoiding hailstorms by taking cover, a valheim like food and stamina system, equipment repair that is relevant but not tedious since its exported to a universal material that can be extracted from any resource, swamps that give diseases if you wade through the water too long, wetness that effects gear and stamina and health long term. I like this, if you don't actually like survival, put this in the con category. We'll see if they front loaded mechanics or if there are more in a followup review.

World/Atmosphere: Very pretty worlds, and extremely relaxing which is what I like from my survival crafting games. I've seen a few reviews complaining about world diversity, I noted their time in game, and that they complained the tutorial took them nearly an hour, I would take those reviews with a grain of salt. Anyone who says ""there are only three maps"" is talking about starting areas, the whole idea being you collect cards thay allow you to unlock new realms. Now, I'm not to the realms extending outside the starting area but these ones are gorgeous thus far, and it seems to me that to be at the same point I'm at like most of these people are and claim there's only three maps likely requires braindead comprehension of the mechanics the game painstakingly tried to teach you during the ""long tutorial"" that clearly didn't sink in...

Tutorial: I feel its the right mix of freedom and explanation for me personally, but, can understand how those who just dont understand exploring buttons, finding menus, picking up objecfs, or basic survival craft mechanics could be confused. If this is your first ever video game period, the tutorial will leave much to be desired, if you enjoy the survival craft genre, you'll find nothing unintuitive about the tutorial.

Crafting/Building: Complex and layered mechanics for considering effects augmentations and synergies that make the game more interesting then many. Inspired by the upgrade system of adding elements from Valheim, but extending it to universals like all objects benefitting from warmth and cover and being on a foundation early on, but with far more indications of modifiers from the practical to the mystic as you progress (Seemingly more universal and less item by item niche). This level of advancement and augmentation seems to extend to items themselves, so the whole system seems reasonably deep.

Voice Acting/Story: This is the most subjective category but it seems mystical intriguing mysterious and drawing to me. The voice acting is definitely good quality, and I like it, but it is stylistically niche enough that I would understand some not liking it. I think its good. What it isnt is a cutscene heavy action adventure game with linear handholdy plot with perpetual compass icons telling you where to go, I suspect this is where critiques come from but would personally be a con for me so I suppose I revel in their disappointment.",1708518275,1708518275,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

I played it until 12:30 AM, and had to force myself to stop by reminding myself I have an important meeting this morning. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things that can be fixed/improved in the game.

1. Melee combat depth could be improved. It is ok vs. bosses by otherwise is basically block, mash attack, aim for weakpoints.
2. The companion AI is in this strange middle ground, where they try to be useful but they aren't useful enough. But they aren't annoying either. I'd love to see the companion system expanded. Let me assign them to tasks around camp and such. (Palworld/Conan Exiles)
3. Lot and lots of QOL. Make the spyglass its own hotkey for example.

But the core game, which I normally don't enjoy, I absolutely love it in Nightingale. I spent a bunch of time last night doing a jump puzzle. It was great fun and a nice break from the survival aspect. I spent some more time helping to build somebody's else house. Love it!

Is it a buy now? Well, maybe. As I said it is in this grey area where you might love it, you might not. The issues it has, which are very fixable, might drive you nuts.

This was the game I was anticipating the most for the 2024, unfortunately I have to say I am quite disappointed with it.
WHEN you can actually play the game, it is quite decent, nothing spectacular mind you, but after playing Enshrouded, this game feels mediocre at best.
I am not gonna bother describing the good things about this game, which is mainly the card system and the art style. I am sure you can read about that in other reviews.

These are the main issues:

1) THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE. I don't understand why developers keep doing this.
The game requires you to be ALWAYS online even in Single Player mode, so if you have a bad connection or bad ping because you live far from the servers you will get frequent disconnections.
I don't get ping lag, but I do get disconnected from time to time, not often but enough to be very annoying. It also takes a long time to be able to reconnect giving you various connection errors, which add to the frustration.
And let's not forget sometimes their own servers fail.
So, if you play Single Player, forget a smooth game session, it will be filled with disconnections and re-connection problems.

2) This game feels very grindy, everything takes ages to do. In Enshroud the grind is so well balanced you hardly feel it. In Nightingale you feel every bit of it.

3) The Maps are soulless. The procedurally generated content is beautiful and fun at first but gets really boring after a while. Exploration gets repetitive very fast, and you will find yourself walking a lot before finding something interesting to do, which is a problem for a survival game.

4) Combat is basic and clunky, not fun at all. You CAN'T even Dodge or Parry in this game, and considering you will melee most of the time, this makes fighting mobs annoying rather than fun.

5) Crafting and Building in general is really interesting. However there is a major issue with structure building which makes it tedious and grindy which is the fact that you cannot move Work Stations, Building Blocks or Furniture, you need to destroy them with a weapon and rebuild it. It takes ages to build a nice and comfy looking home base. Enshrouded does it much better again.

CONCLUSION
Not an awful game, with some cool innovative ideas, but if you are on a restricted budget or have a bad internet connection I suggest you buy Enshrouded instead. Better game overall, less grindy, fun combat, better Base building, and most importantly, you won't get disconnection problems playing in SINGLE PLAYER mode.",1708517537,1708517537,False,9,1,0.518826663494110107,0,True,False,True

- a dozen and then some workbenches
- building and crafting system like it's 2012 (really, you can't make crafting out of storage?!)
- UI is not worth mentioning
- bags have weight and slot limits... how unique
- I know it's early-access so I'm not going to whine about the lags and FPS drops

So that's for being generic. They say it'll be unique, it isn't.

Other cons:
- Always Online
- No community servers
- No modding
- Live-service plans with even further monetisation

While in early access I can handle servers going down and having to wait a bit... If this goes into the full release this will effect this review.
Does always online have any place in a single player game. Hell no, and it never will. BUT I will wait to throw shit until after the full release on that one.

OK, ignore the elephant for a bit.

Game is good! The loop so far is fun. Graphics are nice, style is great (think myst meets valheim), bit of polish needs to be done on the crafting systems but I am sure that will happen. It seems randomly generated but in a way that makes it feel more intentional, with landmarks, ""quests"" (build my house for me!) and such.

The aesthetic is great, the lore, the setting, all of that. It starts off very much like every other survival craft game, but the realm hopping and card system is great. I also enjoy the dungeons, the enemy variety, the weather (hail hurting is surprising!) and the building system is nice and works well. (I like to make house because this is the millennial dream.)

There are issues, of course. Tree physics is weird when they fall, AI doesn't seem great, and there are QoL bits missing - like many mention, you can't pull from chests which is a big issue. Made weirder by the fact that a structure in progress (as in, a series of blueprints for walls, foundations, etc) is treated like one big object, so you can just add resources to any part of the structure and they'll end up where they're needed. Which I don't think I've seen before in a game like this, and seems great, but...it makes other lacking QoL stuff seem stranger.

I recommend it wholeheartedly if you can tolerate these rough edges. The core of the game is great, and I imagine it'll only get better.

1.) You saw the ratings on steam and immediately checked the negative reviews
2.) You're looking at buying an Early Access survival game so I'm going to assume you've played a few before and are looking for something new

Let me start off by saying what this game isn't.

It is not an offline game.  If you are looking for a game that you can alter server settings and mod like crazy, this is not it.
It is not a finished product that is being billed out as a AAA game that is feature complete.
It is not $60

If any of those things are a deal breaker for you then you should consider delaying your purchase until whichever of those things that is bothering you changes.

On to what the game is.

It is a UE5 game, so it is gorgeous with the right rig.  I have basically played every survival crafting game I can find and this one is right up there with Icarus as being absolutely beautiful.
It is in a much better state than any other survival crafting game I have played at Early Access.  I would go so far as to say it is probably better than most games in the genre after months of updates.  Which isn't to say it is perfect but ultimately if you told me it was a finished product that was getting some tweaks I would believe you.

In the 11.1 hrs that I played since launch I have not had a single issue with performance, crashes, or networking.  I am sure that under certain hardware configurations it is buggy since I also read a lot of the reviews but since I never found any of those problems I can't tell you if you're going to have such a smooth ride.

Combat is better than almost every game in the genre with perhaps the exception of Valheim but its a close second.  NPCs move around and actually make the fights a little interesting rather than just going face all the time.  AI pathing will get stuck on things and get confused but the core idea is solid.

Building is of The Forest variety so if you don't like that style its going to be a rough start.  I have some issues with the way it works but I've been playing a lot of 7 days recently and its pretty much the opposite of that.  Ultimately I built the base I wanted and it wasn't painful so take that for what its worth.

Resource gathering is pretty intuitive but the animations for trees falling makes me upset most of the time.  Honestly the biggest issue with it is that everything else in the game looks so good that when something isn't quite right it sticks out and I am excited for the day the trees fall over like they should.

Exploration is 100% best in the business right now.  Only game I have played where the exploration feels this rewarding and interesting is The Forest but since that is a linear game, the fact that they pulled off this much engagement in an open world scenario is pretty great.

Character customization is...well its a lot.  For a game without a skill system like Valheim, or a level up system like Ark/7 Days, it has a surprising amount of choices that you make about how you navigate the world.  It is an overwhelming start when you start looking in depth at the amount of item optimization you can do.  With that said, I am having a great time with it.  While the system has a lot of options, actually getting what I want is pretty straight forward its the selection that is a bit overwhelming.

Finally, I played for 11.1 hours and never had to google anything.  That is absurd in today's game market and I actually can't think of the last time I was able to find all the information I wanted without ever alt+tabing to a new window to look it up.  It's actually sad that I'm impressed by that because it really should be standard.  I shouldn't have to look at a 3rd party site to know how to play the game but it's the norm these days.  Out of everything this game does well I think that for me was the most impressive part.

The game itself is very pretty.  Personally hoping the character models get a bit of love through the development cycles, but overall, I love the aesthetic of the game.

The building system is a little involved at first, as it requires a decent number of resources to build a small base.  I really like the ability to put out my building pieces and kinda make a blueprint, and have the ability to fill it in with the collected resources instead of just having to cart around 1000s of resources just to build a house.
To further elaborate, you basically get to put down a blueprint of what you want to build, and it adds up what you need resource-wise and you just ""fill it in"".

Honestly people complaining about the resource costs of building seems kinda silly to me.  Ark, Conan Exiles, Palworld, etc all have huge resource grinds for building and crafting, why would that be different for this game?  A basic floor tile costs 6 stone blocks to make, you get that from breaking a single rock usually.  its not that bad.

The combat feels really good.  I haven't gotten a real weapon per se, but was using the hunting knife/ax you craft as part of the tutorial to kill the basic enemies to get through the tutorial and it is very fluid for such an early stage in the game.  Honestly I think I like it better than most of the combat I've played in survival games, minus maybe Enshrouded.

I can't speak on the variance of enemies or Biomes yet as I haven't really explored much, and am currently starting over because I rushed through some tutorial stuff and would like to re-do it, but so far what I have seen has looked really nice, and hasn't been just color swaps of stuff, but a pretty decent variety of flaura/fauna and terrain.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that you can recruit NPCs to help you build, craft and fight.

If there is a way to pick up/move chests, estate stones, etc I have not found it yet.

I can't really speak on keybinding as I use a controller, so far the controls have been pretty smooth.  I do not like the current crafting/building menu as you have to press a button to pull up the book, another button to go into it, and then select your choice, place it etc, but I'm hoping that it is more of an ""Im not really used to it yet"" issue.

Yes, there are server stability issues, yes, there are issues with keybinds, memory leaks probably, optimization issues.  the game is Early Access for a reason, and isn't anywhere near a complete release title.  Does it feel worth $26.99?  So far to me, yes.

If you want to be an influence on the evolution of a game as it is completed, Early Access is a fun thing to play.  If you want a complete gaming experience that you can play, finish, and put down, you should probably stay away.",1708516025,1708516025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

* All enemies will hunt you to the ends of the earth. They do not stop chasing! They spawn so frequent you barely get a chance to just look around and admire the view.

* Not to mention in multiplayer the first gate is broken at least it is for my friend and me. For example we got attacked by the wave that came out, however we both died. Upon returning, the gate doesn't activate, and the cards had to be reset and after replacing the cards; the gate would still not activate. We can not advance because of this. Even after my friend left the game, when I was playing by myself I could not open the portal either. I made multiple cards and none of which worked. the combination was a forest card and antiquarian card.

* I hate the hot bar layout, where it is divided into half scroll wheel like the weapons and the other require numbers. 
12345 SCROLL WHEEL 67890 NUMBER PAD

* I also dislike the dodge/block requirements in the game. For instance if you have a dagger you can dodge but if you have nothing you have to block, or if you have an axe you have to block or if you have basically anything two handed you have to block; but if you have a one handed you can dodge. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A ONE HANDED WEAPON or you can't dodge, only block.

* When building you can't dissemble already built buildings, so make sure what you are building is where you want it to be; otherwise you will be there destroying your own buildings. You can however dissemble blue print buildings. In my play through so far with my friend, our fire place got glitched inside and we had to destroy it and rebuild it. you can double click on the crafting blueprints to put down a 3D blue print that is nice.

* I wish there was a way to Auto sort things in chests. If you want to split items the only way I know how is to drag while shift  clicking to your inventory.

* Also when it came to the starting clothing I LOVED THEM, and was so sad when I could not even have them to wear anymore. Not a fan of the desert look but that is my own personal thing. just wish there was a way I could just wear the starter cloths still and have my armour underneath.

* It would be nice to add some VA to the other NPC's in the game that you run across. I was just kind of disappointed where you have Puck with his great VA but then nothing with the others at the start but maybe there is more if I can just get past this portal. Gonna be restarting the game to find out if I can to be honest.

* Kind of sad I can't seem to find or maybe it is not some where in the game menu; the HOPE  you collect with the letters would love to reread it aka the LORE!

* I do have an issue with the very start of the game but this is my own personal issue. At the start of the game I had no idea I would die lol. Puck said go in the portal and I was like ""ok"" when I am done looking around and the music never changed or anything but [BAM] died LOL. I was like ok then xD. I guess usually you get some sort of something other than a hey get in the portal, with that voice being so chill I thought I was fine lol.

* I tried to change my key binds to a run toggle but no matter what I did would not work. SOMTHING ELSE TO keep in mind that is broken on my end at least.

* Having the game only be for connection is such a bummer YOU HAVE NO IDEA! I would love to be able to just, if the internet was out be able to continue in the fae wilds but that is such a game killer! hopefully this can be changed. Otherwise this is on me and I will never buy a game like this again! connection only feels really bad.

so far that is what I have encountered in the game and I just know this game has a lot of potential but for me personally It is not done and needs a lot more cooking.

At a time when multiple Open World Survival Crafting games have released recently, all of which are far more polished, Nightingale in its current form was always going to struggle. 

*** Early Access note ***
I never count early access related bugs as a negative unless it's game breaking. Occasional crashes, not being optimised, quirky NPC behaviour or game mechanics, clipping issues, misspellings in menus or subtitles, missing customisation or cosmetics, etc, are expected and forgiven. 

*** PROS ***
- It is a stunning game and the concept is very cool.

- Building feels very smooth.

- The NPC guide is very cryptic and mysterious.

- Soundtrack is simple but decent.

*** CONS ***
- The user experience is very lacking. Some examples being: no reload button, you just press mouse 1 to reload when empty, which feels horrible. Not being able to easily compare equipped items to ones in the craft menu. Not seeing craft items stats without putting at least one ingredient in. Having to press E on EVERY resource you harvest, rather than it automatically going into your inventory - This would have made more sense if you were actually carrying the resource but you aren't. 

- The UI feels a bit janky. Also I don't feel like it explains anything well. It would feel a lot better if they used visuals (like highlight the food and sleep bars with a short note coming off them) rather than a big walls of text. This may change since it's in early access though.

- The puzzles are not challenging, but again this may change since it's in early access. 

- For a survival game it feels like there's very little threat. The vibe feels very relaxed, which I wouldn't expect from this genre. 

- (Going on from the above point) Strangely, the crafting/base building aspect doesn't feel like it adds much substance to the game. They could outright remove it and just making it an Open World RPG, with unlocks/a progression system, and I don't feel it would be missed.

*** CONCLUSION ***
It has great potential and you can kind of see what they're trying to achieve. For that reason, I recommend it BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.",1708513816,1708513816,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Of course it's not absolutely perfect and if you've followed their videos or read their news you'd understand how much these devs are about creating a game for the players. They are basically giving us a game that is a build as they go and asking the player base to directly tell them what we want from the game. Even with flaws and issues as it is for some, this game is one of the most unique and beautiful with potential unlike I have seen in a long time. I can't wait to watch it grow into something continuously amazing AND be able to be apart of that growth.
I would expect bad reviews of triple A game maker like Bethesda for say when fallout 76 came out, they know better and have the resources to not release something broken. That said, this is inflexions first game and the uniqueness and potential is exciting to know it's there. 
My advice is either be apart of helping make this game better by playing and being a fan and developing it along with the devs, or if you can't not be humble and give them the benefit of the doubt for again an EARLY ACCESS game, take a break and give them and their fans a chance to build it into something even more amazing. Personally I'm very happy to take the hard road and be apart of this game, a chance most game maker's don't give, and inflexion has literally asked for us to be apart.

The Game is currently unplayable.

I am 105 minutes into a game that I want to see succeed. However the game has not yet worked properly for a single minute - Mostly due to Server Lag. What do I do then? What should any of us do? Would you like us to not request a refund and wait? Do you promise to implement single player offline mapping soon enough?

The graphics have no effect on the lag/delay, I tried all the settings.
The system requirements have no effect on the lag/delay, I have a proper setup.
But even when I scroll the mouse wheel to switch to another equipped weapon/item there is a delay. When I open my inventory there is a delay. When I am attacked there is a delay. When I chop a tree there is a delay. When I open the crafting menu there is a delay. When I press a button there is a delay.

So what is the purpose of an ""Online ONLY"" game to you then? This is a red line I had never crossed before and I was willing to cross if for this game. Why are we not starting in our own maps/worlds and then joining a mutual lobby or another's map later on? This has been done successfully many times before in countless games.

Now to also mention my internet connection since I recently moved out of US: I moved into a high end residence with a fiber connection and have the best internet possible. If I am not fast enough then nobody outside the US is fast enough for your servers to work as intended.

The graphics are acceptable.
The story is acceptable.
The concept is new and it is inspiring.
But you click a button to do anything in the game and you loose all hope about the game and its prospects.
There is no playability.
If the game was playable: so many of us would be mining and chopping trees and making baskets and chests and hoarding new items right now for days to come, while at the same time waiting for the game to improve on its vices. This game is simply unplayable in its current state and the only truly deal breaking problem is the lag.

I do not know of your status quo or your intentions for the future on this matter or the direction you will take. I hope your intention is to fix this instead of doubling down.
I wish you the best.

For recent reference points Sunkenland, The Front, Encased and Palworld all open world survival games with varying graphics all ran really well on my pc. 

I do absolutely love the design, I think it brings in some really interesting and unique ideas to the survival genre. I'm reminded a bit of Portal Knights because yes, you travel through portals to different world types.

I also love the idea of npcs that help you build and gather resources. In Palworld this was seemeless and an absolute joy because it was very hands off. In Nightingale you cannot give any commands to an npc. It depends on what item they have equipped so there I was in a forest biome, made a nice stone hut in the woods. Found an npc with an axe, brought them over to my base and they started automatically chopping down trees in the area which was great for about 3 seconds till every tree hit my house and constantly broke the stone walls and roof before I could repair them. I literally went over to them and took the damn axe away. Gave them a mining pick instead thinking they would simply wonder till they find something to mine as your only interaction with them is either to have them follow you or to stop following you. Instead, the npc just stood there, unable to figure out what to do. They did make a really good guard though when my base got attacked but that's the only part I felt they were really useful for.

If I could give it 50% I would as I can see some people really enjoying it but for plenty of others this is just a really cool idea at least for now.

This is early access, so lets call this To do list:
1. Interface (menus) was made by brother in law? Something is tiny, something big. Big doesn't mean it's self explanatory quick readable here. From left to right probably doesn't matter. Response sluggish. Constant scrolling, many pages, doesn't feel intuitive or responsive. Some stuff still has no icons but placeholders. Some stuff from the same tree has same icons, some has unique. Confusing point and read. Sorting is crazy. Moving stuff around, distributing to chests painful.
2. Amount of stuff. Game is about diversity. Cool. You can have prey hide, predator and ""insect"" one. Or you can have leather. And they have Tier1, Tier 2... You can have Rare drop of Tier1 one hide. Nothing stacks of course. See where I'm going? It multiplies the issues under number (1). Make some system. I'm drowning in garage sale inventory. 
3. Combat. You feel like the Academics survivor fighting first fight in your life even though you may choose military background as well. It's neither hard nor fluent. Clumsy, repetitive, not so entertaining. Go academics, role play from there.
4. Launch day had server issues. Around 3h mark my server crashed. Then again roughly the same time later. Memory leaks or something? A guy on stream had many DC issues. May be a problem elsewhere. Or not. Probably they had to do ""always online"" for multiplayer part so someone doesn't appear there with cheated assets. Doesn't make it better.

Other than that, a lot of things work fine. Looking forward for game to unfold with all the different worlds and updates.

The biggest downside is that it's an ""always online"" type game meaning that if you want to play it you MUST have an online connection. As a survival crafting game, to me that is a massive downside. Plenty of other games, even recent ones have shown you can have an online experience with survival craft and not need an always online service i.e. Minecraft, ARK, Sons of the Forest, Terraria, Valheim, Astroneer, Starbound, Palworld, etc can all be played either P2P (Peer to Peer) requiring no server software at all or can have individually hosted servers and all are great games in their own rights. My opinion, but making the game one that requires an online connection limits its lifespan and its playability massively which is not exactly great especially for an indie studio.
Second, and far less concerning is the somewhat clunky nature of the UI and crafting system. It's not terrible, just a bit wonky compared to other survival crafting games which all have usually pretty similar systems in place. Once you figure out how to navigate it then it's really not too bad.

Now for the pros.
Its gorgeous. The game world I have seen so far, which just consists of the three starting biomes (A forest, desert, and marshland), look absolutely stunning. Detail is phenomenal and the lighting is wonderful, built in support for DLSS definitely helps and sitting on Balanced I can hold a decent framerate even without Frame Gen turned on, with it on I sit comfortably at my monitors max refresh rate of 100fps on a 1440 Ultrawide monitor on the Quality (high) settings. Could probably do with some optimization, but its by far not one of the worst offenders of game optimization that ive seen. Havnt seen many enemy types yet really, but of the ones ive seen I would like there to be a bit more variety in their attacks. Some Hippo looking animals are a bit overly aggressive and constantly charge at you and past you making them very annoying to fight if theres more than one of them. The grey goblin-like creatures arnt too bad to manage so far, but really only have two distinct attacks.

Overall, I'd honestly say maybe wait a little to get the game. Its not bad. Crafting isnt too hard to figure out, combat is maybe a little overly simple but I am just in the beginning, and some features are missing in the customization area like tattoos and scars and more fine control over character facial features, unless thats what the ancestry thing was about which seems like a bit too much effort to put in for what should be otherwise simple character customization. It has potential and it certainly looks beautiful. Just be aware that it does have that early access feel and limitation.

Message to the devs, if they read this: Please, please, please, give this game an offline feature that doesnt require an internet connection and allow for either P2P hosting to third party dedicated servers. To me, and likely to many others who play this genre of game, that is the largest hindrance to the game. The very last thing I and many other want is to have server connection go down in the middle of a major fight or building project. Do remember, this game is currently ENTIRELY dependent on your servers and them remaining active. If they fail, or even if people have a poor connection to your servers it will ruin the experience for many people. This issue alone is the reason why I won't recommend the game since many people I play with are from halfway around the world so latency from ping or server load will cause issues for them playing.",1708513329,1708513329,False,9,0,0.546812832355499268,0,True,False,True

from the 5 hours i put into this game so far it feels like a solid game for the survival crafting enjoyers.

The game has a lot of familiar features but also lot of interesting new systems like the realm cards that let you create your own adventures to your needs and i would assume this also makes it easy for the Devs to add new biomes / realms later into the game.

Performance could be better, but its not too bad and we have seen lot worse.

The biggest negative to me is the Always online as i really do not see why this needs to be a feature in this style of game. Having a constant ping of 90ms to 120ms makes the combat sometimes feel off and just adds a layer of issues not to mention unable to play the game if the servers are offline.

There are a lot of mechanics in this game that are very player unfriendly. Here are a few things I didn't see anyone else mentioning:

First, my group is stuck. To progress, I'm 99% sure we need to finish a quest where we get ""2 heartshots and 3 headshots"" but no one has managed to get a single ""heartshot."" Not one. We've tried shooting all manner of enemies in the heart. No luck. If this really is a requirement to progress, maybe tell us what we need to do, explicitly. Everything feels vague in this game, and the quality of life is very low.

The game's biggest problem is that the start sucks. It's just not all that interesting and, more than most games, you're not going to know what to do. The character creation feels extreme, in a good way. Let's say you design a relatively stylish character.  The game is going to force you to almost immediately throw away your armor and put on the ugliest yellow clothes I've ever seen in a game like this and you're going to keep those clothes on for.... I don't know. I'm 15.5 hours in and still haven't upgraded. Just why? Seriously, I'd prefer to wear trash bags.

Inventory management? How about 6 different stacks of slightly different plant fiber? Oh and everything in your inventory moves FOR you. You can't put something in the slot you want... in a survival game. It might drive you mad.

Want to progress in a group? Great!... well, until one or more of you falls behind. They can still progress, they just have to go to take time out of their day to run to several big empty towers, climb to the top, and click on something to progress. This happens a lot.

Movement is okay, but climbing feels awful. This isn't BotW. This isn't even Assassin's Creed. Be prepared. It's janky, but climbing seems to work a LOT better when you don't running start and you constantly mash the jump button (unless you have a parasol in hand, then you can't climb at all).

Speaking of parasols... you can equip a parasol to glide down slowly, right? Cool. Unfortunately, the parasol has to be equipped, in a hotbar slot, and it takes up a lot of the screen. You can even add movement speed buffs to your parasol and it will shield you from rain/sun, so the devs EXPECT you to be running around with this thing taking up a lot of screen space like 90% of the time. The parasol engages when you hit it's use key - ""F"" or when you hit jump... but only when its equipped. Thing is, this game has a LOT of climbing up very tall towers, slowly. And pretty much every boss has a way to knock you all the way down. Some of the weapons have a very fast dash attached (which is fine, don't change that). When you fly off of a tower, you should be able to panic press your parasol button (it already annihilates your piddly stamina bar, which you might not have very much of during a fight). Instead, you have to switch to the parasol mid-air then use it, and for all of that work sometimes the game doesn't even seem to register that you've activated it and you still die.

Puzzles. Look, I like puzzles, and I like doing them with a group. The puzzles in this game are fine, but you'll be repeating content by your third or fourth one. The variety is lacking to an insane degree.

I still have a lot to talk about, but I need to sleep, so let's cut straight to the twist ending: I think this game can and might end up being great. Combat is basic but can be a surprising treat. Very few games make the 2-handed maul feel like you're hitting someone with a giant hammer, but a lot of the enemies crumple from one swing, then when they try to get up, you down them again with a jumping swing to follow up.

I'm only about 15 hours in at this point and I think its just an under-cooked, grind-heavy crafter with misleading and deceptive marketing materials.

Coming from other EA indie survival titles (Palworld then Enshrouded) I had far less fun in the first 15 or so hours on Nightingale than the others.

The combat in Enshrouded EMBARRASSES the other two indie survival games. 

The puzzles in Enshrouded EMBARRASS Nightynight.

Also (last comparison) in EA state at launch, Nightingale was by large margin the least polished of these titles.

The UI in Nightingale is simply horrible. Click small part of crafting station, click bits to load being careful not to misuse your rarer bits, click other part of crafting station, set fuel, set quantity and let her rip (and go make a sandwich, cuz ish gonna be a while). 
WTF? Just let me put a ""don't use rare"" on my AUTO-FILL and click once for the entire station. I don't need the realism of a distinct FUEL CONTAINER and certainly not when navigating such poor UI.

The constant loot window (+ 10 WOOD) looks straight out of ultima online circa 1991, Just use your flashy font in big letters and fade that crap in the center of the screen like everyone else does it. Rework your entire menu system as well. It looks like there were 3 people who rushed this UI together independently without consulting each other or referencing any modern crafters UI/Menus.

You might wonder ... How does bad UI/menu system work with a controller? 
Unable to fully play the game. Comparing ""controller functionality"" on Nightynight vs the others it falls short. I got 100% of Enshrouded achievements all on my trusty dualshock. I didn't make it out of character creation without k/m on Nightynight.

Built my estate on what appeared to be a nice flat area, now when I step out my front door there is a mystery hole that I have to friggin climb out of every time I leave the house.

The online only requirement is not something I can really get behind. There is absolutely nothing so groundbreaking in this game that only the devs servers are powerful enough to run it. Quite the contrary actually ... it was taking me 10 minutes of load screen to finally get in the game on launch day. Give us the ability to run our own servers.

The online requirement is the only thing I complain about here, since I live in a relatively ""worse connected"" place, so I don't appreciate that the game removes me from my world now and then.

- The UI is a disaster. Bad fonts and confusing design. Yeah, you might say i'm going too far, but take your time with that UI and you'll realize what I mean.

Don't ask me about combat, the worlds I've been feel very empty and the few aggressive creatures I've come across are very basic in their movement sets.

- Buying an early access game immediately on first day of release
- playing 30 mins
- complaining about server issues and bugs (some of them appear to be not bugs but rather failed understanding of what to do)
- writing a bad comment and leave

I wonder, what would have happened if they had delayed the release.. but surely no complaints *irony off*

I don't really know what people expected, it is an ea title for a reason, to find out what works and what doesn't, together with players which is the best case and up until now, it appears the developers are listening (which is not really all that usual).
And in comparison to some so called AAA full releases on day 1, the game works pretty well and and I had  few server issues (I am not from NA but from Germany).

- Does it have bugs? Yes of course, but up until now, nothing game breaking happened to me
- Does it sometimes feel clunky and unpolished? Absolutely, but that may be changing
- Does it feel more early accesss than other recent titles? Yes, but comparing early access titles for the state they are in 
  might not be the best idea, not sure.

In my opinion, the game is pretty promising and if players and devs manage to interact with each other in early access, i believe Nightingale has the potential to become a great game.

People who get angry about bugs/performance issues and want a top game in peak condition are probably better off waiting a few months before taking a look, though.

I'm enjoying the art style, the realm system, and attention to detail. The gameplay feels VERY similar to ""Valheim,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, and I didn't run into any major bugs or glitches.

Now, having said that, the main issue I have with the game are its performance and graphics. My PC specs are as follows:
Windows 11
i9-13900KF 3.00 GHz
32 GB RAM
GeForce 4070 (Most recent drivers)
NVMe SSD M.2 drive

Running at 3440x1440, on ""High"" setting with DLSS on ""Quality,"" I'm averaging 70 to 75 FPS. It can get as high as 90 FPS, and as low as 62 FPS. The textures are passable, but rough, at these settings and bumping the detail up to ""Ultra High"" creates a massive hit to the FPS.

All of this is eerily similar to when ""Valheim"" launched on Early Access, with solid gameplay, minimal bugs, but noticeable performance/graphical issues. However, I played the hell out of that game and enjoyed every minute of it, which is why I'm giving ""Nightingale"" a positive review.

     With 9 hours in, the game performs well in the abeyance area.  The graphics are really nice and the NPC AI -well- sucks.

The game itself is absolutely stunning and I find myself just standing on vantage points taking in the views at times, but the character creation design choice is... questionable? where most variations of males end up as giga-chads unless you spend a bit of time tweaking it, which I personally can't be bothered to do.

The building system has some strong points and has potential for example being able to place your entire structure as a blueprint piece by piece and rework it without committing resources is a fantastic idea. 
But the finer details could use some work. Placement of workbenches etc is frustration and there is no grid/snapping feature for quick, accurate placement for the OCD building types like myself, so it takes some frustrating movements to get things placed right.

So far combat is ok, but nothing to really write home about, it's a bit clunky and the AI is just 'attack target' but has room for improvement. I'm hoping late game weapon types etc open up more fluid movement and attack skills.

In terms of stability, I've seen absolutely zero issues excluding the odd visual glitch here and there with foliage flickering, no hitching, no rubber-banding, no crashes. That's not to say other people aren't experiencing these issues, but I expect they will be ironed out fairly quickly in the coming weeks.

As a final note, I do agree with some negative reviewers that the always-online choice by the developers seems outrageous for a game like this and they should absolutely back-track on that and open the option for players. However upon reading some other negative reviews there are some people complaining about things just for the sake of complaining.

I do recommend but can only hope you don't experience the instability other players are experiencing, and the 'mixed' response is misleading. It should be higher in my opinion somewhere in the 70%+ area.",1708510134,1708510134,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

55% Positive reviews - up from 44% on last check 20.02.2024. 

Most negative review are based on: 
1. The game being online only, even if you want to play singleplayer. 
2. The servers only being NA causing alot of players to have high ping. Some experience rubber banding, connection issues. 
3. People who do not understand some of the machanisms in the game, like the effect crafting with different ore types has on the gear you create. I.E. one reviewer said ""why have different ore types if you can use all types to craft the same item?"" The person clearly has not understood the concept. 
4. The Enemy AI being bad compared to other games. 

My thoughts are on the positive side: 
1. Game is fun, runs smooth for me here in Norway. 
2. Crafting and figuring out what effects different resources produce is fun. 
3. Exploring the realms and finding hidden blueprints and other stuff is fun. 
4. Combat and Enemy AI is no worse than it is in other similar games, like Enshrouded. Alot complain and refer to Enshrouded as being better. But in Enshrouded all you need to do is stand on a slightly elevated rock and spam with you wand and the AI can't figure out how to attack you. simply attacks the rock or wall with no effect. No different. 
5. Augmenting the realms with the cards to see the effects is fun. As time progresses they will add more cards with more variety. 
6. The fact that you can customise the difficulty level of the realm you create is nice. 
7. Playing with a friend is fun. And I like the fact that progression isn't shared. I like to get and figure out things on my own, rather than gain everything as soon as a friend has unlocked it. 

It's fun so far, and promising.

If you move the error to a second screen you can continue playing.

I have played almost every crafting survival game there is and this one does everything wrong.
Game looks OK in the Graphics department. Still the world is very static, very small, no weather, no movement of trees in the wind. 
AI is abysmal, animations of enemies are very bad.
Everything feel like a pointless grind.
Other Survival games have a natural progression of crafting, leveling and exploration.
This game puts you in a realm (small map) and you are capped by gearstat. You must craft your way up to a specific gearstat, move to a dungeon, finish the dungeon, get realm cards, go to different realm to get better resources, and rinse and repeat to the next gearstat. very Linear Hard limited not natural. Pretty boring gameplay, very clunky actions.
The companion you get is stupid, give it an axe and it will keep axing away at trees even destroying your house you build if the tree is to close. you need to unequip an item and equip another to make it stop. Everytime go to your companion, press interact, go to a menu, equip or unequip. There is not point and go do this button.

This game is not ready and I do not think the scope will change very much, idea was cool, execution very bad.

Then the performance.....
On a RTX 4090 at native 4k resolution without any DLSS or upscaling, I get most of the time below 60FPS (35-55) that is for the mediocre graphics very very bad.

2. Extremely boring Grind:
 Gameplay is highly grindy, I get that most games in this genre are grindy by nature but the grind in this game is 20 times worse, you basically do the same thing over and over just in different worlds with no variety.

3. GRAPHICS:
The game looks awful. Character creation is definitely not it either, hair texture, the way your characters look, the world texture.

because its online only its can get a bit laggy, dont get why they didn't let us do our own servers.... Both Enshrouded and Palworld had private and singleplayer support...

BTW, the building is great, but having to go through a menu every time I want to build something... and having to click ""place"" instead of just double-clicking or something on the thing I want to put down, is just bad game design. Hopefully the devs will work a bit on that. I actually found the Enshrouded building to be quite enjoyable, and of course there's a plethora of other survival-esque games out there with building that they could draw some inspiration from.

A game/team come along and finally fix this and guess what people are moaning about that. Only 4 hours in really enjoying the game beautifully made had no performance issues. They have really done a good job on making the atmosphere and feel of the game. For an early access game to look and feel this good 10/10 from me.
I really like the levelling system or lack of it there is no traditional leveling system ie get to a certain lvl to be able to do things ie dungeons etc this all depends on the gear and weapons you have this for me is a winner as your mates who have more time than you won't get to far ahead or not be able to beat a certain boss coz all your going to need is there same armour.

Ps... I do agree thoe if you are playing solo you shouldn't need to be online. I'm sure thoe if the team are committed to there game they will hear people's cries for this.

** let me tell you about how fucked this company is... these Twitch Drops you all farmed? You can't use them till you get transmute table. You get the transmute table at the very end of the games story. GG Get fucked. **

I haven't seen a character creation so horrid. they spent so much time on eyes they forgot to do anything else till last minute. And, I could look past that but literally everything else is hot garbage, too. 
Combat stance is a hunchbacked troll, movement animations follow suit. No class system, which is fine, but no leveling either so literally everything is gear dependent and if an item breaks your char is gimped. How so? all your stat improvements are from gear, lose your +hp/stam items and you're back to brand new char hp/stam
""Action combat"" but no dodge. The left-hand/right-hand equip function is neat but clunky.
UI is horrendous, crafting system is just so bad with everything being in separate windows and drop down menus. Bound mobs point blank bomb you because they take no dmg from friendly fire. to use your garbage ass umbrella glider you have to 1) waste a hotbar slot for it, 2) equip it to be able to use it, and 3) hold F while in air to use it. stupid as shit design made to make game more complicated than necessary. 
Touching water diseases you which then kills you, food bar is 1/3rd full but you starve to death. 
Game looks better on ""performance"" than ""quality"" for some weird reason.

I knew it was EA, and that's fine, just my opinion that this game has 1 redeeming factor... no cash shop! I will be avoiding it until much later in development. 

As such, I highly recommend not buying it. Save your money. Game will be in EA probably forever, like 7days, and maybe some day in 5 years it'll be decent enough but, I imagine they'll take our money and run within 1 year. 

It just gets worse the longer you play...

There's a really cool premise and foundation that separates this survival game from every other survival game on the market with the portal and cards system. However, once you get into it, you'll find that it's really shallow. There's really not much to do in each biome besides... the same thing that you would do in each biome. The sellers sell the same things, and the recruitable NPCs don't seem to have any differentiating features. Also, you can only have 1 follower at a time, and considering their AI is absolute garbage and they really don't help you with gathering/crafting at all, it's super disappointing. 

After 4 hours I had built all of my crafting machines and a pretty OK base and I was just left with a task to ""raise my hope."" I thought traveling to different biomes might have been the way to go about it, but that didn't seem to actually accomplish anything. I felt sort of stunted not knowing what to do to progress besides trying to make a gigantic base since that gives you more ""hope."" That just wasn't really desirable for me to do though.

The actual base building is extremely bland. It's obvious they want you to unlock base building pieces/designs as you progress, but what you start out with compared to other games (Enshrouded, Valheim) pretty much immediately removes any sort of fun you can have with that mechanic. Which for me was a huge blow, because I'll spend hours building bases, but you're blocked from having any creativity in this game.

The enemy AI is not challenging. Combat ends up being flat. Some of the set pieces and enemy designs are unique, even interesting to see, but it all ends up taking place in only 3 generic locales that we have seen done better: forests, swamps, and deserts. Within that 2 hours, I've already witnessed copy+paste set pieces very close to one another, a redundancy that should only creep in after many more hours have been sunk.

The crafting system is just arrogant. There are myriad survival craft games that nail this aspect, and all they needed to do was borrow their favorite iterations from those titles. Instead, they invent a convoluted, confusing, clunky, disorienting, and frustrating crafting experience that hearkens back to the infancy of the genre when developers were still figuring it out.

I'm sure a ton of love & effort went into this title, and the game director even mentioned keeping the price point reasonable despite the experience behind this. I have a ton of respect for that. However, there are so many other titles out, new & old, with teams much smaller that have crafted superior experiences in every facet. Valheim, Terraria, Grounded, Don't Starve, Subnautica, Sons of the Forest, Zomboid, Starbound. Hell, Palworld just came out, I've heard good things about that. Enshrouded is wonderful and the same price as this.

I watched the developer diaries; of how the game opens up once you 'beat' it and man, did that excite me. The overall feeling of the world, the realm card system that generates procedural worlds, the sound design and the overall bespoke nature of the world really speaks to me.

Now, the game progresses in a similar way to other survival games: you need to keep building a better base to meet the demands of your new job (Realmwalker). In order to do this, you need to visit realms and harvest better materials. You take these materials back to your main base in order to perform upgrades; so on, and so forth. What this game has that other games don't is a proper storyline.

This game was made by ex-Bioware developers; the same Bioware who made Mass Effect and Knights of the Old Republic. In terms of lore, this game does not falter either. It is truly a unique and interesting world. It is interesting enough to cause me to explore buildings in order to find more snippets of lore.

You might be wondering: what's the point of advancing in the game? What awaits me once I've done everything? Well, the game then becomes an MMO. As is in the title; the whole point of the game is to get to the city of Nightingale. The city acts as a social hub where you can meet other players and take on quests/raids together. These quests have unique rewards that can only be obtained by completing them. You can take these trophies back to your base and display them for future visitors, so they can see how skilled of a realmwalker you are.

Overall, the game gets a 9/10 from me; it has breathed new life into the survival genre. Although I experienced no network issues, some people have complained about it and I can sympathise with them. For that reason, it gets a 1 point deduction in its score. I just hope they're able to fix the network issues before the weekend. I'd hate to see this game get undeserved hate -- it truly is a good game.

THERE IS NO BASE HEALTH OR STAMINA IN THE GAME. You read that right. If you don't eat or sleep constantly, your health and stamina go down to 1, making the game almost literally unplayable. 

But it gets even worse than that. When stamina reaches 1, YOU ARE UNABLE TO ATTACK. This means that the vast majority of your playtime is going to spent not playing the game, but simply trying to babysit these broken features just so the game will allow you to play.

The next issue that others have but I didn't is the always online aspect. They're actually working to fix this mistake, but until then if you are not in North America this is something to consider whether or not it's a deal breaker. For me, the core survival aspects of the game are fundamentally broken, and without a rework of the hunger and stamina mechanics, I absolutely do not recommend Nightingale, even if they resolve the always online issue.

There are a lot of great things I can say about the game, but I'm not going to because they don't matter until these features are thoroughly reworked. 

There is no excuse for this kind of total failure of game design. Dozens of survival games get this right, all of the major ones probably going through your head right now know how to navigate these basic aspects of the survival genre, but not Nightingale.

Stepping into the campfire burns, falling trees you cut down can damage you, the graphics are superb, and jumping back into co-op play is seamless. While some of the animations are rough around the edges such as skinning and sprinting/jumping, the basic game loop is enjoyable and provides a solid foundation to build from. That said, some of its current simplicity is part of its charm, and adding too complex of systems around that could take away rather than add to the experience. The forest environment thus far was personally the most breathtaking biome, and made me want to build a house and settle down.

This brings me to things to be aware of. It should be noted that Essence is a currency used for many valuable recipes, and currently, this resource is very quickly accumulated by creating marble ammo in bulk, then extracting it en masse for massive amounts of Essence. While this is not necessarily game breaking, it is a method far exceeding others I've discovered thus far to acquire Essence. From the few NPC encounters I've had, the AI behaves well and feels responsive. The concept of gaining access to travel to different worlds and build bases has great potential, and from what I see, this game is heading in the right direction to eventually deliver on that potential.

I'm VERY picky about these types of games and most don't do it for me. So many are just tedious maintenance chores. Some work for me to various levels (like The Forest) but most others just feel like a waste of my time. I tried Enshrouded earlier this week and it was definitely too....childish (?) for me. This feels way more polished and less aimed at kids than things like Enshrouded and Craftopia.

[b]What I like[/b]: 
- Crafting is a simple process. THANK GOD. Place the blueprint where you want, rotate it with the wheel mouse. Add the items to it through quick add. Crafting complete. I don't have tons of menus to slog through or ingredients to manually select and add. It's just very straightforward and I'm so happy about that.
- The realm card system is pretty damn clever. Collect cards and pair them together to make a new biome to adventure to, with new resources and stuff to explore. Someone will do a way better job of explaining it in detail but I think it's one of the more clever things I've seen in games in quite some time. 
- I don't need to constantly be eating food to avoid hunger. In the tutorial you do but beyond that it's not this nagging thing to deal with like many other games. Shelter is important but you can make a tent and sleeping bag to protect you from hail/rail in about 10 seconds with nothing more than sicks and leaves. Again, making things simple and accessible is a huge positive for me. 

[b]What I don't like:[/b]
- There isn't much I outright dislike in the game but I will say that the performance is really rough. With a 3080ti amd 32gb of ram I can barely crack 60fps at 4k resolution and DLSS at Performance. None of the settings make more than a 1 FPS difference when I change them with the exception of DLSS and/or the Raytraced lighting. If I take off the lighting I get a pretty solid 20 FPS boot up to about 86 FPS but the game looks *significantly* less impressive at that point. My point in mentioning this is that mid/lower end cards will probably struggle mightily here unless you are running at like 1080p or something. 

I've seen a few complaints about the combat and so far I don't really have any issues with it. I'm just mainly fighting off boars, wolves, and some undead guys but it's completely serviceable combat. Nothing really wrong with it in my estimation, just mainly unremarkable.

So as someone who usually sees these type of open-world crafting games as nothing more than ""chores,"" I can say that this is something much more enjoyable and I'm just really excited to sit down and EXPLORE. Already doing just a tiny bit of it in a forest biome I found run-down and destroyed altars that have rare items and new blueprints, unlocking new items and weapons to make. I wanted a game that makes me feel like I'm on a type of adventure and uncovering secrets as I go and so far this absolutely does that.

The developers have been transparent about existing bugs, so the intense negativity is a bit surprising. Perhaps some overlooked the communication.

In my first four hours, I was captivated by the stunning graphics. While I encountered some bugs, unlike others, I'm confident the developers are aware and actively working on fixes. The gaming community has seen its share of disappointing releases, but among those showing potential, Enshrouded and Nightingale stand out with promising features.

Once the major issues are addressed, I believe this game has the potential to be truly great.

What I enjoyed:

    Visually stunning graphics: The high-setting visuals are truly breathtaking.
    Engaging gameplay: The movement of animals and enemy combat are immersive.

Areas for improvement:

Water physics: While visually pleasing, the water movement could benefit from a touch more fluidity.

Performance optimization: Occasional frame rate drops, even on lower settings, need to be addressed.

Tree felling mechanics: While enjoyable, the felling animation and physics could be further refined.

Lootable item behavior: The tendency of dropped items to scatter feels unrealistic and disrupts gameplay.

Environmental details: The lack of movement in certain elements like air balloon fabric detracts from the immersion (in my opinion).",1708453511,1708503787,True,1,0,0.344442903995513916,0,True,False,True

Nightingale has some of the best building systems I've seen in an open world survival game in a long time. The card mechanic is also INCREDIBLY refreshing and the game does definitely seem like a more chill survival game with optional difficulty. I'm not mad about it, honestly. There's so many survival games out there that do realism and try to be the Dark Souls of survivalcrafts.

There are some existing issues at the time of posting. Some clunkiness in trees not registering contact with axes, accidentally being able to destroy things that are 2pxs into the way of your tools, and the load times are not great between realms but the general core base of this game? It looks very promising and it feels it. The character creator was surprisingly robust in a way that felt very Dragon Age: Inquisition vs traditional sliders. 

Personally, I'm hoping for offline mode capabilities. I wish there were crude stairs that could slot into a corner so there isn't a weird gap in my builds but maybe I'll find that schematic later. Trading with party members would also be nice so I don't throw them at them and have my recruited follower pick them back up. Minor complaints.

That said. This IS an Unreal Engine 5 game and it does require a bit of a higher specs than that. Read the min vs recommended specs before you buy.

I think the plot is fantastic so far and has me really intrigued, the crafting is interesting enough that I want to keep exploring and getting more and the survival mechanics have been great so far. 

 [b]Pros: [/b]
- Great Story hints so far
- Interesting crafting system and progression
- Incredible customization and detail level. Though I do wish the lineage setting had more of an effect of the look of your character beyond features that can at times make presets look a bit messed up, but nothing you can't fix later.
- Great way to split difficulty between how you want to start out and how easy the start is
- Combat feels so smooth, with different weapons/tools having different ""abilities"" (don't take that too literally, I mean different options when it comes to dodge or block mainly atm)
- Bears will leave you alone as long as you leave their cave...don't find it out the hard way like me.
- I appreciate that when you die you don't lose everything and there is a marker on your screen to guide you back
- The weather feels super realistic, and I am glad they didn't go SUPER realistic with it. For example, if you have a torch in your hand in the rain it won't go out, and you can stop getting wet so quickly. 
- The gear (especially the gear you can start with if you want to) is so unique and fits the setting so well. I can't wait to get more.

 [b]Cons: [/b]
- The fact that accessibility features weren't there at launch, barely the basics (subtitles are there for example)
- The game goes from holding your handing to just throwing you into a realm and leaving it at that. Which was fine for me as I tend to be quite chaotic in playing, but for people newer to the genre or who prefer a more in depth tutorial beyond the very basics, this might be a con for you.
- Failing puzzles results in combat and not even an easy on straight away. And the puzzle I encounter I think was even and easy one so...not sure what that means for harder ones
- Some of the more unique enemies do at time just react if you died to them and return to pick up your things

Also, the game is always alone and besides having some issues at launch with loading in (which I imagine was too many people) I've not had any lag spike issues or issues at all. But I do have a good internet connection (at least most of the time) and I was playing alone.

To start off at the positiv things:

This game will offer you a lot of freedom of what you can do. The card system is intricate and offers you a lot of potential unique worlds once you unlock them. The realms look beautiful and have a lot of landmarks you can explore, solve puzzles and loot. 
As of right now next to these things it is a standard survival game in its core.

Now to some of the bad things:

The performance is bad. Playing on Balanced with DLSS on I get around 90 FPS depending on the area.
The combat system is as barebones as it can get. You left click you swing/fire your weapon. 
Enemies don't pose a big challenge as of right now. I haven't fought one of the bosses yet so I might update this Review later down the line.

Things I am neutral about:

Servers might be a bit whacky as of right now. 
Also people complaining about having high ping or not connecting to the right server and leaving a negativ review might need to learn how to Google because Inflexion already posted something about this issue and how to fix it. 
Puzzles might be a bit to easy as of right now but I don't really care about it that much.
The amount of people that can play together in one world is 6 as of right now. Might be a bit too low for some but remember that in the future this game wants to have boss fights that resembles raids so they have to balance that somehow and it's easier with fewer players without expanding too many resources.

Tell her to get in the kitchen and make you a sandwich because you're going to put on your big boy knickers and fight the forces of evil in every plane of existence!

You want a challenge you're gonna get it as long as you don't play on some wimpy difficulty level. The dark is dark you're gonna need a torch or lights, the monsters and critters make weird noises that make your butthole pucker. Flickering lights and dancing flames, beautiful scenery, moons in the sky and magical creatures that glow and sparkle will beguile you. Small children will cry in delight and be amazed as you float through the sky with your umbrella, only to gasp in horror as you run out of stamina and crash to the rocks below!

You can recruit a helper NPC pretty early in the game that can revive you and be your pack mule. Lots of gear lots of stats you can get into if you want.

- Not a fan of survival mechanics such as eating, sleeping, and weather effects as game mechanics
- Enthusiastic about exploration and base building
- Do not play surival games usually
- Mostly played games: Souls Like & Ego-shooter Games (R6 Siege)

Pros:
- The game world is exceptionally beautiful (Rating: 10/10)
- The monsters are very cool (Rating: 10/10)
- So far, the game offers very extensive building options
- The character creation is comprehensive

Cons:
- Base building is tied to game progress. This means that despite having knowledge of the ingredients, you cannot plan everything from the beginning. Unlocking is not based on experience points or the discovery of materials but is predetermined by the game. New building elements are only unlocked after reaching a new area or fulfilling certain quest conditions.
- The building menu is cumbersome to use. You have to open the menu, click on the desired element, select the location, place the element, deselect it, and then ""fill"" it with materials. Why not build directly if all materials are in the inventory, or otherwise not build at all?

Personal Improvement Suggestions:
- Incorporate the option to disable the guided tutorial phase so that everything is buildable from the beginning as soon as one has the materials
- Objects should be built or not built depending on the inventory

The price-performance ratio is outstanding. I can recommend the game to any enthusiast of the survival genre.",1708500262,1708500393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's pretty unique, got a lot of crafting options and the realm system is very cool. The building is pretty, you can easily make a good looking building very quickly. I enjoy the combat, I could see some people not liking it, it's got some depth to it.

It's got a bit of jank, nothing too crazy. I haven't come across any game breaking bugs myself, I do see some people having some major bug issues which is a real shame.

My performance has been good with all the settings on Balanced, running a smooth 60fps on my mid-rig. But I think getting fps higher than that might become a problem. The game definitely needs some optimization updates.

One major concern is that it's always online. Which means no dedicated singleplayer, which also means we're at the whims of the server in a (unless you play co-op) singleplayer experience. Unfortunately you will notice it sometimes, small bits of lag rarely when jumping and doing other things.
You also can't just Pause the game, which can be frustrating in a survival game if you need to go AFK for a bit.

I hope to be able to edit this to something more positive in the future, but for now I say wait until major patches come. 

My SO and I were so excited to play this game and have been anticipating it for over a year. I spent hours in character creator exploring all the customization options, making a character I really liked...only to find out that at the end of the tutorial there is a current game-breaking bug hitting a number of players that prevents the portal from ever opening. You cannot progress past the tutorial, restarting doesn't fix it, and your character is locked into that play through. The only current solution in the bug reporting is to create a new character from scratch and just ""try again"" while this is under investigation. So I guess luck of the draw on whether your entire playthrough bugs out permanently (as of current writing) on the creation of a portal - the entire point of the game.

I'm really not sure how bugs this critical would get through a game that from what I thought had prior closed beta testing and now costs ~30 USD for early access. I play plenty of early access games and expect some issues. In fact I at first thought people giving mixed-negative reviews on this game were so harsh of a really awesome, innovative, uniquely themed, crafting-survival type game in its early access phase. But I get it now, unfortunately. Truly disappointed I can't even get past the tutorial after being so incredibly excited to play and support this game.

if youre looking for a quick comparison its a mix between enshrouded. valheim, but neither of those quite describe it either. 
it almost feels like you put valheim through a bioshock filter and we landed here. its very very interesting and you never quite know what you're finding youre getting into. if its not too late id say not to watch trailers and and just go for it, for under $30 its a steal if you like this genre. 

pros
- it is gorgeous and runs pretty well for me, im on a 13700k and 4080 so you'd expect good performance but it does deliver i average around 110 fps on ultra with dlss on quality. very unique creature designs even for ones that would be otherwise familiar creatures. sorta think of no mans sky but before we realized those were just weird procedural miss matches where this feels curated. 

- to that end i actually cant tell if the game is procedural ive only been through three portals but i still feel like im going through tutorials, very good and long ones but tutorials as the main mission filtered in allowing me to still do pretty much whatever i feel like on each map. but they do feel structured at least so far. 

-crafting system is very very robust, similar in a way to valheim where you add different things to each table to increase them and synergies tables together. though i will say some of it is cumbersome to go through but ill touch on some of that in the negatives.

- animations are all pretty good i generally do just love the look of the game it has an excellent atmosphere and tone overall.

- creating houses and making structures is really easy and well thought out, you can pick up and move anything built. once you layout a plan similar to say grounded, it all connects and shows the total of items needed and you can just start adding things to it as a whole and it just slots where it needs too.  

-weapons all feel really good, crit spots have a super satisfying sound and chime to let you know, swings have a good weight, one thing this game does thats amazing its taken this long to get too is that all gathering tools are the weapons in the game, their are proper weapons as well shotguns and the like but the crafting ones are fully usable as weapons and they all have proper move sets and abilities with them. it frees up inventory and your bar it just is a good system that again is crazy its taken so long to see. 

- card system is great it adds a lot of flexibility and unique mechanics to change the dynamic of the worlds youre in and ive barley scratched the surface 

- There is hail in the game and it does hurt you, again never have i seen that before 

-there are a handful of other things i could comment on but i think alot of it is best found on your own, it adds to the overall game. 

CONS 
- It is always online, that can be a bummer for some but it does allow friends to kind of come and go as they please while keeping your own server and have people come in while you're offline not needing secondary servers or having to rent them so on one hand its very beneficial, if you are a solo player though i do understand the upset. 

-with always online servers sometimes loading portals to transfer does take a while for them to ""boot up"" but i think this will get further ironed out with time. 

-performance while good does have some dips and on some systems i imagine it might tank it, i haven't tried it on steam deck just yet but i will be shortly though they say its playable they recommend not purchasing it just for the deck. 

-crafting is great but it is all over the place the inventory management is pretty bad, chests don't really sort well or at all, you have like different fibers from the different sources that don't sort together further convolution of storing items. like i think i have 6 different fibers and they're all the same fiber it really doesn't make sense yet, maybe their is a reason but i cant find it yet. 

- furthering that you cannot craft out of stored inventory in the house, so it further frustrates the previous point. hopefully this changes it really needs to quickly as it can be a pain to them. 


overall i think it has a solid foundation its got probably the most production value of any survival crafting game to date and some of the most unique systems as well. i'm excited to see where it goes, no early access games a guarantee but i think there's something pretty substantial here if they stick with it. but for $30 i think you can already get more than your moneys worth.",1708496924,1708496924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

2. Combat needs work

3. Ambiance is incredible 

4. Has a lot of potential 

5.10000000% worth 26$, don't pirate this, we need devs to use our money to make it even better, this could become the next no mans sky, hopefully it wont 20 years to become epic like NMS 

6. The music, sound, weather, night and day system etc is amazing, I could sit all day just listening to the sounds of the rain and wind in my little hut, the howls of wolves or some alien creatures, run through the night with a torch then see glowing red eyes and run away immediately lol, it feels like something is always about to happen and I want to find portals and new places to explore, it gives me this sense of nostalgia, like it made me feel like the first time I played world of warcraft vanilla, where you can tell overtime this is going to be really special and I really hope it stay updated and patched for years to come, I love it.

7.  It has some bugs, nothing major, graphics are great, but there are some minecraft blocks, textures etc where it looks like minecraft, but no major issues like game breaking

8. The story and lore and everything seem mysterious, it remind me of stargate and sliders and every game thats out now but its own uniqueness added to the genre. It makes me want to explore and see and do more

9. It has a lot to do already, ive played a few hours and it seems like i havent even started yet, yes it needs a patch quickly, I think they are putting out on tomorrow, so thats cool, 

10. Remember its early access, people seem to forget that, I would much rather put games out early so we can play, and fix and update along the way. 26$ is nothing, most of you pirate anyway so dont be cheap on this one! Support it so it can be even more amazing. Its just cool, simply cool.

11. Dont review bomb because you cant figure out how to do something, if your 4090rtx is crashing and doesnt work or has 20fps THATS USER ERROR, ITS ON YOU LOL, F-ing morons saying it wont run on a 4090 lol come on...

12. It needs some work, yes, but they arent charging you 75$ like a new ps5 game, it has had stress tests and many betas and this definitely not the day before, this game has so much potential but seems already like a full game, I would rather have the story and coolness factor and lore than have it be graphically phenominal and have nothing to do. 

Devs, I would say, look at enshrouded combat, look at valheim for certain things, it definitely needs more animations for portal travel, loading screen etc and for sleeping and building etc, but nothing is so bad that its not worth playing.

The only thing i would 1000000% add asap is portal travel animations or a cool loading screen and or make it seamless somehow, that will make it absolutely epic, make it like the tv show Sliders or stargate where you are flying though with hyperspeed, please add somethign like that, even a cut scene each time of going through a portal, but if you could pull of a seamless entering from a portal to whatever workd is next, this game would be perfect, thanks and I hope everyone contineus to play, I love it so far",1708494948,1708496135,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,True

Combat is nice! It's nice to see different animations for finishers and harvesting depending on the state of the enemy.

On the second attempt I was able to start with no issues at all. I then noticed there is a small learning curve to the mechanics because you don't have access to crafting right away. The tutorial introduces the three different biomes and the quest on the right will let you know how to progress. The first biome is for creating the cooking pot, gathering berries/stones/sticks, cooking berries, and opening the gate to the next biome. The second biome is desert and you craft the tent and bed roll along with getting the instruction on the elements and resting the tools are either this biome or the next and final biome. The third and final biome swamp, teaches you about crafting healing items, armor, essence, and combat. After that is complete then you can build your estate.

Inside the settings you have to choose types of video settings like (performance, balanced, or quality) instead of high, medium, low. Ultimately I chose between balanced and performance in hopes to keep my CPU temperature below 100 degrees Celsius.

I went into the game knowing this, and had no issues. So far, I absolutely love the game! The developers are very transparent about this being an Early Access game and some menus state that the section is currently in development (i.e. tattoos and scars in the character customization), but overall the game seems to already have a lot of the mechanics and customization worked out. 

Character Customization - This has to be the most in-depth character customization I have seen in a long time, especially for early access. There are currently almost 80 presents to choose from. You can then further customize your character by choosing the looks of your ancestors and using a grid-like slider to set your base features before launching into more customization selections (most with sliders) that allow you to adjust everything from the standard features (eye size, eye height, etc) to very in-depth features (inner, mid, and outer iris color, eye patterns, eye veins, eyelash root and tip color, mascara root and tip color, etc). As someone who has been annoyed by customization options in other games, this absolutely blew me away. 

Crafting - I'm still in the early game, but the crafting system seems decently in-depth and has been fun so far. I enjoy that several of the options make you collect an array of different materials to be crafted and there seems to be a lot of different workbenches and refinement stations to unlock. The requirements appear well thought out, make sense, and help make my actions in the game feel like that have more impact. It doesn't feel like a grind (at least so far), but rather feels rewarding as I find, progress, and unlock both items and crafting stations. Crafting items also have a good amount of customization. For example, the type of leather you use for the simple shirt directly affects the attributes of that shirt (i.e. Tier I prey leather has different buffs than Tier I or Tier II predator leather, etc). This seems to be an essential mechanic of the game and I look forward to discovering more.

Connectivity - I've had no issues with connectivity so far. I'm in NA and playing on wi-fi. There were a few lags here and there but nothing that affected my gameplay. 

Graphics - I can't say much here as I'm playing with a 4090 so my experience may be better than others, but the game is gorgeous. There are occasional graphic glitches (odd lighting, fog) but the world is beautiful, lush, and generally very atmospheric. 

Progression - So far, the progression seems balanced. The tutorial is nice without being too handholding, and each new thing that is unlocked feels like I truly earned it rather than it just being given to me. There were a few things I needed to look up in my character's guidebook, but overall there is a nice balance between ""how to play"" and ""letting you explore"" as well as the game progression itself. 

Bugs - I've not encountered any bugs so far, but I'm sure there will be some since it's early access. 

Issues/Cons - This is early access, so I expect things to be addressed as development continues. Animations need a lot of refinement, some graphics and textures look odd or smeared, some buffs/debuffs apply oddly (why do I get ""diseased"" even when floating over the swamp?), and combat could be improved as it generally feels a bit ""off"". I always suggest watching videos of unedited gameplay before purchasing a game and that is still true here - some quick research on YouTube should give you a decent idea of if this game is for you or if you want to wait. For me, at $30 and in a genre I greatly enjoy, it was worth it to jump in (and I'm glad I did). 

Overall, the base mechanics and gameplay seem to be something I've been looking for in a crafting-survival game for a long time. It looks like a lot of thought went into both the storyline and the mechanics to create something that is in-depth and unique while remaining enjoyable. I look forward to playing more and discovering more of the game mechanics as I progress, but so far the game is wonderful and I'm excited to see how it progresses throughout development!",1708495086,1708495086,True,0,0,0.46948358416557312,0,True,False,True

As a survival crafting game it falls far down QoL wise. Inventory is limited size, which quickly with how many variations of crafting materials there is gets to the limit. Carrying weight is tiny compared to how heavy some common materials are. Building a basic house felt like a chore. Cuppled with no easy stacking with storage or even crafting from storage, managing materials is a nightmare.
I built 10 different  basic crafting stations and got easy overwhelming so annoying especially with no crafting from storage.

One, it's got a ""solo"" mode but that doesn't mean anything since your world and everything in it seems to be run by their servers. Which if you are in Australia, New Zealand or other parts of Oceania welp you might be out of luck. Here in the great ol' US of A server ping is still atrocious. I can't imagine what to Oceania players are going through.

Two most of the game seems to have the same mechanic, go here, collect materials, craft some stuff, fight a few enemies, go home. Rinse and repeat. The world is incredibly empty and there are few actual enemies in the world. That's ok, but it makes it feel incredibly dead and boring.

Three, the game's community so far (I checked out the Discord) seems to be divided between people like me who want an offline game with optional online elements, and people who are boot licking both Inflexion and Denuvo (I don't think this game uses that bastardization of a DRM scheme). Some people are trying to keep the peace in the community but I can see this getting really toxic really fast.

The idea that you have to stop because:
- Server Maintenance
- Server Outtage
- Servers going down for patches
- Too many people connecting to servers preventing you from playing
- DDOS etc
- End of Service

All these are problems that absolutely has the possibility of happening.

Having an option that says
""I want to play offline"" or ""I want to play online"" should be a thing. That way you can do both.
Not having the option, is bad. 


That said, I do like the game. I'm not going to say its a bad game due to this feature because it isn't. It's great.
I recommend you get it, then voice your opinion as loudly as you can on the forums and social media until they implement a change.

Combat has no punch, in melee it feels like I'm waving pool noddles and ranged combat is a casino to see if your bullet phases through the target
All the enemies have 2 different attacks and even then 95% of the time that only use 1, even the bosses
The UI is slightly an absolute nightmare 
You can't tell if your follower is alive or not when you need reviving
It's very difficult to tell if you've been hit or not until you're at 20%, then you get a slight red screen
The ""puzzles"" are trivial but sometimes they just don't work
The fact that singleplayer gameplay NEEDS an online connection
Every time you boot the game you are shown several screens that require you to hit agree every time
BONUS: If you spam escape to try and skip those screens, It closes the game.
Sometimes when getting resources, they just disappear into the ether 
The lighting can become your worse enemy in lit caves, and not because its too dark
The trees falling animation....

I could keep going and I will update this review as I get further into the game.
I know that the game is in EA, but it definitely needed a good year and a half back in the oven.
I hope the devs see this review and take what is written here to heart. I don't not like the core of the game, but all the little things are ruining what could be a very impressive romp across dimensions a-la No Mans Sky

This is one of those games where it's really hard to give it either an thumbs up or down. I've just finished the tutorial ""realms"" and it does give you the fundamentals, barely. It reminds me of Ark, it seems simple enough, but it doesn't hold your hand in any shape or form. I'm in my starting realm and I have no idea other then building a shelter what to do next.

So far, there's zero quests or quest givers other than this Puck dude, and as he left me here he gave me a cryptic warning about surviving the night. That's it. As well I'm still at the most basic level of crafting, have no idea how to get new recipes, and I would love to have a storage trunk, considering how limited I am by the weight mechanic. So I guess I'll just wander and see what happens.

It's like the developers went all in on atmosphere and paid less attention to the basics. For example it's gorgeous, like jaw dropping gorgeous. And how the tutorial was presented just dripped with fantasy steam punk tropes. Even the crafting system has that same feel to it. Meaning a bit overly complicated for complication's sake. I'm still struggling with it, but I think I'll get it figured out.

At this point the game could go either way. A total mess that I soon drop out of frustration, or a gem that'll I'll lose myself in. Again kind of like Ark. But it is EA, so I'll just cross my fingers and hope. In the end, after coming off of finishing Enshrouded (great EA title BTW) it just seems less finished. I guess overall  it's worth buying in at the current price if for no other reason to see where it goes.

As a fan of franchises like The Room and MYST, this was definitely something I figured would be up my alley. New World, but Victorian era Fae antics with 6 player co-op? Sure I'm down!

But good grief do the graphics hold this game back. I am certain everything you see in the trailers was pre-rendered in engine because my 3090 cannot break 25 FPS to save its life. Something is really wrong with the optimization because this thing runs like a flip book. Brace your eyes. Mining a rock? time to watch it jitter uncontrollably until the game finalizes its resting physics location. Fighting a wolf or boar? You're going to want to learn how to feel more than you watch for the timings because these things will rubber almost as bad as the police cars in DRIV3R. 

Gameplay-wise as well this game has an uphill battle. The combat is the very definition of hit or miss; ultimately nothing feels satisfying when you do land a hit and when you miss it doesn't make much sense how or why. The first ""Abeyance"" I've completed felt remarkably empty and uninteresting, and the boss you have to beat didn't seem appropriately scaled to what little equipment you have access to. Sure, I geared up to score 20 lickity split through a few exploits I discovered early on, but that implies that the boss should be a moderate challenge when properly equipped, not a nightmare requiring cheese tactics. And this wouldn't be an issue except for that fact that better gear is gatekept behind plot progression. So either you just manage to get good enough or you cheese it with an NPC and some bad pathing. Doesn't help that the lair you fight it in is dark and the game's lighting doesn't offer much. If you were to ask me what the construct looks like with a gun to my head, I could vouch it has a purple core... and after that I'd being offering epitaph suggestions.

The way crafting works and how materials have their own stats and qualities that result in the finished product is awesome. The card system to go to different realms is awesome.

Out of all the problems first and foremost important. 
Devs, if your reading this, please allow people to make local servers on their PC. For every player who bought this to play with their friends there is five players who don't have any, so all this is going to do is kill your game. Plus, it'll be cheaper and easier on you to do server maintenance in the long run.

secondly, storage in a game like this is going to get out of hand quickly. It would be ever so lovely if there was some sort of Fae cloud storage system as a advanced storage item that holds items based on weight rather than slots and have a way to expand the storage compacity along with permissions for other players and access points. Just to clean up a base a bit and be convenient to the player.

And lastly, I would like to be able to tell a follower holding a axe, but to chop trees, or to only chop trees. The dude I hired has carved a path of destruction through the forest and left nothing but stumps around my house. Sometimes he'll prioritize it over fighting, so I took his axe away.

It's a slower moving game, but I also think the gaming community, as in us players, for a long time have suffered from a disgusting illness that is ""we want hard and fast now!!"" I think we need to grow up...

Nightingale doesn't set itself apart from most crafting games in terms of how you go about surviving and crafting. You have to collect mats, mats have a weight, and there is a progression ladder.

But the game is absolutely stunning to look at. I also find that our narrative companion Puck is well thought out with a voice that resembles that old guy from back in the 90s narrating fairy tale episodes of that tv show I can't remember.... anyways :D

The style is very unique, and the idea that you can shape your encounters has been taken a step further than what others have previously done.

Ironically, this being an Early access game, it completely shames Starfield by lifting the Early Access level up to their height.

There's no acceptably justifiable reason and it makes me very distrustful of the devs. It was also only playable at minimum settings, despite my (admittedly old) machine still comfortably beating the min reqs. (1080ti, Ryzen 1700X, 32gb ram, NVME M.2 drive) It also has graphics up-scaling that can't be turned off, which is a bit of a head scratcher, considering common opinions about up-scaling. So the graphics were fuzzy as all hell and had constant artifacts at the borders of moving objects. Speaking of moving objects, a lot of the motion in the game felt very unnatural and square within the uncanny valley. 

The UI's are very awkward and click heavy; basically everything is done out of your journal with endless tabs and pages. I get the feel they designed it this way to try and increase immersion, but it has the exact opposite effect, on top of being annoying. Also, the entire game feels incredibly ripped off of Valheim. Granted, most games are clones of something else on one level or another, but there's a fine line between drawing inspiration and flat out cribbing. This definitely feels more like the latter.

I've seen others complain about server stability issues. I seem to have dodged this, so maybe things improved as the day went on? My play session went uninterrupted and load times were all satisfactory. 

At this time I see no reason to not recommend the title. It is below average price for this sort of game, but it checks all of the boxes that I require. It is also in an interesting setting with lore that sets it apart from similar titles.

Even when I want to play solo, it seems I have to also be connected to some server somewhere which makes no sense to me.   Why shoudl I be feeling lag or get disconnected from my solo play through?

This is however minor to me.  And mainly only feeling it because of day oneness.  I am however having fun so far 8 hours in and getting used to it.  Def needs some time cooking as the rough edges are everywhere.  However this is a good foundation for a very good game.

Some things I'd like to see the developers improve on:
1) Followers.  Need to be able to command these people to stop, maybe just hang around the respite area or something.  At the very least, just get them to stop mindlessly chopping, mining or whatever tool they have ion their hands.
2) Interface.  Despite the bugs, I feel the arrangement of elements needs a look at.  On the character page there is nothing easy for my eyes to settle on and it gets distracting. 
3) Multi-hot bar.  Must need for the amount of tools, trinkets and other hot bar type items in this game.  Need to be able to switch between configurations of items.

The always online aspect of this coupled with what feels like 300 - 700ms ping when building structures, gathering resources, fighting monsters, or even just exploring, leaves much to be desired. 

Building feels very stiff and there is no flow with how to navigate through the UI. At one point all my items were displaying weight, but not their quantity. Shift clicking items did not split it because I did not complete the tutorial. Third person (experimental) is a nightmare, impossible to interact with anything due to the objects already not really standing out in-game, being even further from the camera in third person.

Mousewheel does nothing, rebinding keys does nothing, indications on your hotbar are almost imperceptible to know what is highlighted and what is not, unless you intensely stare at the hotbar. Durability is not always displayed, sometimes durability is hidden until you break it.

Foliage grow too fast sometimes, a tree grew through my foundation while I was waiting through the lag to finish building my foundation, hitting the said tree left a stump, hitting the said stump, broke the foundation and eventually the stump.

There seems to be no rhyme or reason to a lot of the pacing, other than to pad out the refund window. When you are forced down a hard single track for a tutorial that does not respect the player and the point of the genre (curiosity, discovery, etc). You are left with a hollow nothingness that is also frustrating to play.

Optimizations are poor as well, there seems to be a massive memory leak coupled with the fact that if you ""sequence break"" the tutorial, you can be essentially left in a perpetual infinite ""death loop"". The exit from the tutorial is also a coin toss, if the server lags enough it will bug out the exit and you will be forced to recreate your game (alt + f4 does not work) from scratch and speedrun the poorly done tutorial all the way to the end again.

I'll refund it for now. If the game is coming out after a year in Early Access, this game is not worth your time.",1708468010,1708489252,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

This is more like No Man's Sky meets Folklore on the PS3.  It's hard to describe because it does so many new things.

The artwork is brilliant minus the facial anatomy which is some of the worst I have ever seen.  But it's EA.  I feel immersed in surreal worlds, with gorgeous landscapes and POI's I've never seen in the genre.  There are puzzles, NPC encounters, story all laced throughout.  I built my first settlement on top of a hill and looking around me there are at least 20 massive structures I am excited to explore.  AND most of the exploration has been rewarding, unlike every single other game in this genre.  Tiny spoilers, but you progress through various worlds that YOU create with a card system.  

Combat is more intelligent than competing games.  I feel like it's balanced and I'm actually doing things to enemies instead of watching damage numbers without feedback.

My only complaints are that the introduction could use better pacing and more story, and the interface is just absolutely horrible as it is right now.  You are given a very nebulous summary of the world, then just pop into existence.  There are more elements of the lore in the trailers than in the game right now I suspect.  I also get that the UI was stylized for the game but the usability is just awful and takes too long to do simple things.  Having to constantly tap 'h' then another number to put my torch off-hand away is annoying.  Cooking is awkward.

First impressions, right from the beginning....70+ ping to server, stutters as soon as I begin to move. Alright, just started I thought, maybe it is still...loading?

No. Never stopped. Then, I started to notice all the little things...Poor graphics, despite having everything set to Extreme. DLSS, still nothing. Tried playing over 60 frames...wouldn't go over. Ok, so poor performance, server lag, poor controls (I am playing with a controller), terrible combat, player creation is just...not quite right. My person did not quite look right....I do not get the hype surrounding this game at all. Early access, I know, but come on now. In a very saturated field you need to come out of the gate much better than this. I ended the game just after getting through the tutorial when the server lag went to an unplayable 150ms and I starting running in slow motion. Thought it was just a quick spike. Nope. Played for a couple minutes more and decided a refund is the best option. No, just no.

I can see the potential though, and perhaps I will revisit once everything is hashed out and it runs better, among too many other improvements just upon initial impressions.

Nightingale is a beautiful game with some really interesting and fun components.  I think Combat is interesting and on par or better than most other survival games.  I also like how the building/crafting system has traits and enhancements that really flush out those systems.  The realm cards are also really nice and a very unique system that seems well thought out.

All of that said this game is not very well put together.   Each system itself is fairly well designed but the glue that puts all these systems together is slapped together in a very rough manner.  The Realms are nicely generated but resource nodes are pasted on with ""Rocks"" being a specific shape and any other rock looking scenery is not a rock.   Due to this issue Rock is only a little more common than most Ore and Crystals and to get any amount of any resource that is not wood requires a lot of running around.  The lack of destructible and mine-able terrain really comes out and is a major backslide from games like Valheim and Enshourded.  

The 'tech tree' is mostly on a purchased bases.  With all the crafting focused around the types of resources this feels like it doesn't really fit.  I feel like the Valheim tree flow (find components and you can make it) would work better, though I think a research table version (like in Raft) would smooth this out nicly.  

On top of all these design choices this game has a heavy online requirement.   Even the Tutorial levels take time to communicate online to change realms.   There is almost no reason for this to be online (other than anti-cheat).  I could somewhat ignore the online problem if I though this game was solid in its design.  However without an offline option I worry this game will not make enough money long term and one day will be the next news article about an online game closing and leaving its fans abandoned.  

There is a lot to like about Nightingale but at this time I don't think the overall design is going in a direction that will bring these awesome systems in a cohesive game that will entice people to keep playing and if people don't play then the game will not gain enough money to stay open and anyone backing this game will likely end up with a dead game that will not be usable in a few years.  I hope some of these core issues will get addressed in EA.  However these seem to be core and not unfinished options.  I hope I'm wrong becasue I really would like to see the unique systems in a game I enjoy playing.",1708489008,1708489008,False,5,0,0.551249384880065918,0,True,False,True

In the few hours I've played so far, I've been impressed with the small quality of life things like being able to leave things to craft on their own (so I can explore instead of sitting at the station), AoE picking up materials, the companions helping speed things up by harvesting and grabbing things from chests, and being able to do multiplayer relatively easily. I can empathize with being disheartened by the ""always online"" but for some other games you're put onto a large server with PvP or have to find a way to host your own / pay to have it hosted. I enjoyed how pick-up-and-play the multiplayer was, no playing with pubs, no griefing, and no extra cost. I'm so excited to explore it more as a solo and with other players. 

The UI needs a little love (especially as I'm hoping to pick this up as a console pleb one day...), but this isn't the final product. The most important thing about an early access, in my opinion (as someone who has done a handful of EAs and/or Kickstarters), is the foundation. There is some jank here and there and some ideas (at least this early in the game) aren't presented well or fleshed out entirely. However, I'm sure most of it is being or will be worked on. The cards and realms seem to have a lot of potential, especially as we get to a year, two, and beyond.

It's difficult to be immersed when there's so much technical stuff on my screen and the number of menus that shouldn't have ""burger menus"". The art is beautiful for example on the crafting and could have depended on it on the menu, instead focusing on a giant wall of text. The player is not dumb, it doesn't need so much to explain things, a simple hover on items to explain what it does or small text menu would be better. There's so much potential for the beauty of the art work to be used. The entire UI feels like I'm looking at the developer menu of the game. 

There are a lot of questionable design decisions because it is way too tedious, basic quality of life (dropping items, weight???, low stamina, and splitting items), and the progression loop is slow. I think the most important part about implementing elements into survival games are, is it fun? or is it just more work for players? because the building in this game is great but something like the weight, there's just not a lot of stamina in addition to the weight on items, making it extremely not fun exploring in the beginning. There's so much potential and content that it just feels like a lot of game design choices mentioned above put up a giant wall on an otherwise immersive world to play in. I just want to have fun in the playground you made, but it won't let me. 

There are a lot of focus on dungeons and combat, I expected more diverse set of creatures in the dungeons. I was worried watching the stress test we will only get the vampire-ghoul creatures in the dungeons and I was sadly right. There is a stiffness to the combat due to the lack of weight on the tools that results to misjudging hits. I hope that some of the bosses get more distinct play styles.

I know people will look at my play time and cry foul, but hear me out. I deeply enjoy survival games. At this point in my life, they are my favorite genre. Jank, less than stellar combat, missing QOL; these are all standard for the genre, unfortunately. As gamers, we call these things ""quirks"" and we persist. 

A lot of people have been waiting for this game for a few years. Upon first seeing the game a while back, I wrote it off because of the card/world system. One of the reasons I enjoy these games is because of large, persistent worlds, and I figured Nightingale would have small world after small world. So I quickly moved on and stopped paying attention.

Until January 2024. As the game neared its release, I decided to pay attention again, to see if my initial reaction was haste. Maybe I was being harsh. To my surprise, I liked what I saw. I joined the Discord and followed the game and it's previews for the last month and change. It felt like each day, I grew more and more excited. 

I was working when the game released this morning, so I bought it on the app, and went right back to work. I took a lunch break, and looked at YouTube reviews for the game. Reception wasn't the greatest. I listened to the complaints, and figured the judgement was unwarranted. I like survival games, after all, and jank/poorly implemented gameplay mechanics is something I expect. 

Still working, I'm not checking Steam reviews. ""Oh boy. This isn't looking too good,"" I thought. I figured people were jumping on a trend of hating on the game. This happens quite a bit in this community, especially to crafting games, as well as open world games. I also saw lots of complaints about the ""always online"" component, and while I don't like the requirements, I accepted it as a staple of the times we are currently in. 

I get off work. Reviews keep coming in. Very mixed. Steam seems to be the only place where I see level headed people recommending the game, but with some heavy caveats. I convince myself they must somehow be wrong. 

So I finally boot the game up.

On paper, the game sounds like a winner. It's also unique in this space, which goes a long way toward giving us a reason to play this game, instead of others in the genre. The amount of thought that went into crafting, and the tier system is actually great imo. It goes right in line with how, ON PAPER, this game is a winner. It's well thought out. The world building and semblance of a story was even something I found myself ok with. 

But then you play the video game. And this is where they messed up.

It's almost as though they forgot that video games are supposed to feel good to play. The forest world is designed to provide you with plenty of resources to get you up and going. That's fine, but what that means is the world is cluttered. As I darted across the map to prove to myself how small the game world was, I'm constantly receiving prompts to tap ""E"" like nobody's business. I wish I was exaggerating. It honestly felt like the worse parts of Ark. It was unsettling.

Third person is absolutely not worth it atm. Wait for later down the line when they have less critical issues to fix and can work on third person. It's uncomfortable to witness. It was however, the easiest way to perform during combat, because enemies are jumping about and popping up behind you constantly. I like that the enemy is flanking me, don't get me wrong. But as so many others have pointed out, the AI is absolutely atrocious. 

I didn't believe it as I read through/watched reviews. But the moment I entered the first world of the tutorial, a family of five deer spawned right in front of Puck and I. They panicked, and began to run circles around me. I started punching the doe, and after the second punch, she stood still and let me punch her to death. That was the first of three deer that let me do this before I shut the game down for good. 

Blocking is too powerful atm. You have a ton of stamina, and it regenerates far too fast. This makes combat, on top of the silly AI, brain dead. I mash LMB and side step any time an enemy shows their tell. They attack and miss. I kill. Occasionally I block when all enemy attacks sync up, and I can't dodge them all at once. Then I mash LMB. It's not good. 

Contrary to what some others are saying, I like how combat feels. There is something deep in the combat system that they got right. But as it stands right now, it is not good. This is due, in large part, to the lag experienced by the always online component. It didn't bother me much when watching preview/review videos, but upon playing it, you can feel it. It doesn't necessarily throw the timing off. It just makes the weight of combat feel unresponsive. There is something solid in there that can be improved, however.

And, to my initial reaction upon learning about the game, the worlds are small. Exploration is sort of pointless. POI's are meaningless. There isn't really a substantial way to interact with the environment atm. It took me a minute to realize some of the larger stones weren't breakable (yet?). The UI, which was revamped right before launch, feels cumbersome. The tutorial prompts in the upper right hand of the screen go on for a long while, and don't give a good first impression. 

Why did I spend that time talking about my reactions leading up to playing the game? To illustrate that I was a skeptic. Then I was a supporter. Then I was a defender. Now I'm offended. I think my review hinges on my experience with the game pre-release and post EA release. 

A lot of time was put into the wrong aspects of this game. A game has to either feel good to play, or be rewarding to play. This game has neither. It hurts me, because the preview footage looks great. And the team seems very excited and passionate. But the in depth systems can't make up for the fact that the game doesn't feel good. And it's boring. It feels like gameplay and player engagement was the last thing addressed during development. 

The biggest sin here is why play this over any other survival/crafting game? The question every designer and developer must ask. Enshrouded has a great building system. Palworld has Pals. Valheim has it's building system, as well as its sense of adventure (I also appreciate the exp/leveling in the game). Sons Of The Forest has great production value that is felt through all of that game's gameplay systems. Grounded has good combat, and its setting is very refreshing. I could obviously go on. I would recommend anyone play any of those games before this one. 

All of this can be boiled down to how this game feels. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't play well. It has some graphical issues that pop up, especially when using an upscaler, which is part of why they removed FSR3 right before launch. 

The game is in Early Access, so a lot of this stuff comes with the territory. But it doesn't change the fact that money is being spent on the product, and I felt compelled enough to not only refund, but review it. 

Oh. And bad enemy AI also extends to companions. Whew. Do they need work.

Ok. That was a lot. Now, for the 



TLDR


The game isn't ready. The systems and mechanics are great on paper, but implementation feels half baked. The game feels like gameplay and user experience was an afterthought. The always online component create an undesirable combat experience. Combat was already lacking due to CPU AI and frantic feeling player attacks. The game feels like Ark and its forgotten younger sibling Atlas. Play through or replay through any of the genre greats before checking in with this game at some point in the future, when it will hopefully be in a more complete state.",1708488157,1708488157,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The voice acting for Puck is amazing & the visuals are stunning (minus something I will talk about soon) every UI & menu in game is embellished & looks very pretty.

Cons: This games character editor is honestly the worst I've seen in a very long time, I spend a tonne of time using editors & making a character is often a feature I look for in a game before purchase but this game has failed in every way shape and form for editing characters

-Presets are all terrible abominations 

-Hair often has clipping issues or outright has balding or patchy sections

-Facial hair is EXTREMELY limited especially for a game with the Victorian era style

-I think at no point did anyone on the development team look at a human face when making the editor

-Eyes are the hardest part to make look even remotely human

-GTAs weird parent selector is widely regarded as one of the worst character creator options in any character creation game and you've went and stepped it up by making it so you (pointlessly) must pick not only your parents, not only their parents but their parents as well & from what I can see this has no value in the editor at all 

Other than these cons for the editor you also have the pointless step 1 & step 2 tabs that serve no purpose, a scars and tattoos tab that are empty because ""early access"" which is fine I didn't want either anyway but why have the tabs there now if you're adding them later

In game performance is fine but the animations are abysmal the running animation is similar to lethal company however with the up-scaled graphics you don't get the same funny ha ha effect it has instead you have an abomination running around like a titan from AoT, the melee animation when using your fists look like they haven't worked out to swing at the hips yet & look very awkward and lanky

All in all this game looks pretty when you don't look at the character or the animations, scenery wise it's beautiful & the worlds creatures & immersion are insanely good, for the price & accounting for the fact it's early access I'd recommend this to anyone that isn't super invested in character editors",1708486668,1708486668,True,2,1,0.511627912521362305,0,True,False,True

Inflexion Games are really shooting themselves in the foot for this decision. This isn't an MMO, it's not a competitive shooter, there is NO REASON to force you online.
I understand that maybe this tech will help with players that want to play together without creating a dedicated server, but at the cost of alienating the single player player base AND THE REST OF THE WORLD? (Servers are in the US). 
Not to mention that they just announced they're taking the servers offline to add a hot-patch.....

Inflexion Games is also a very interesting studio as it feels like they put more money into marketing than into the game itself. 
The game UI is ugly, and you'll be looking at it A LOT. As most of the crafting will be through the UI. 
The animation of your character also look stiff, and the proportions seem wrong.... 
It just seems really weird because it looks like a AAA game but everything that a AAA company will get right looks.... very indie.
Don't get me wrong. I love indie games and companies but something just feels a bit off about Inflexion Games.

This game has familiar characteristics of survival games- the gathering, the crafting a home, the killing of animals and gathering their meat, the weight limits, etc. I find these are good things, as these are some of what I enjoy doing in survival games in the first place. But this also has unique concepts to it, such as people having the ability to change aspects of their environment, to being able to jump to other people's servers (realms) without having to make a brand new character like you'd have to do in other games (and even live with them in that realm, if you so choose). 

This also has strong RPG elements, so if you're one who's been wanting a survival game with an actual story and voice acted NPCs in them, then I feel that Nightingale actually delivers on this pretty well. I've enjoyed exploring and finding little notes left by travelers, or points of interests with a variety in style ranging from radio towers to pirate shipwrecks, to floating cubes. And this is just from me exploring the tutorial areas and a very limited part of my starting biome. 

Lastly, I find it both exciting and relaxing. The music helps with that latter part, and probably aided by the fact I had a forest spirit that wanders around my home, regrowing any plants and trees that have been cut down. And it's exciting because there's real dangers around. My partner who started in a different realm, is consistently hearing screams and whispers whenever nightfall comes lol So there's mystery, there's a story to follow, and the survival-craft aspects are pretty solid.

Improvements: 
-Third Person is an added feature, and it does show it being experimental. I'd definitely like to see them continue to improve on this, and it looks like they will, so that's that.
-I think tooltips (or more of them?) would be helpful. For instance, I see that I need to craft some materials in order to build a thing. It would help if those materials had tooltips when you hovered over them that gave information on where to get them, how to craft them (which skills/benches they're associated with), etc. Nothing too fancy, just basic info.
-Combat is a bit clunky, but still better than others. Still though, it does need improvement, which will probably come alongside the work they're doing for third person.
-Our faces look like wet clay.

I'll most likely add to this review as I continue on. For an EA game, my gameplay has been smooth, probably only hitched twice when I had loaded something in my 4 hours of playing. I joined my partner's game in a quick and simple manner (party up, invite to realm/accept invite). The story and world has been intriguing. The building has been nice. It's in a pretty good state, in my opinion. 
*Quick note: to people confused as to why it says ""waiting for server"" as you wait to load... have you ever played any online game? And if so, have you not experienced any loading screens, you know the ones with the bars filling up at the bottom of the screen or when something says ""loading""? Because that's essentially what that is.",1708486195,1708486405,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

==================

Going to break this down into things I liked and things that can be improved.

LIKES
-----------
1. Graphics- Them biomes, art direction, and visual presentation of all things in the game are really top tier. 
Each constructed ""Realm gives a unique vibe with lush colors and a unique feel and come to life with vegetation wildlife and weather effects. 

2.  Deep RPG Systems- If building different stats from your gear and customizing your playstyle there's plenty to do here as you can craft different gear sets which give you different skills/stats.

3 . Building Blue Print- Being able to lay out your base design completely without having the materials let you preview your base before grinding and is a nice feature not present in many survival games. 

4. Online Servers- This is a plus for me because it allows you and friends to interact with the same space even if one of you is offline. Meaning you don't have to wait for a friend to host your shared game. 

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT-
-----------------------------
1. COMBAT- Combat feels snappy however there isn't much strategy/thinking to the AI. Everything seems to lunge at you and you just block/heal/deal damage without much thought. Different unit types/attacks and varied AI could easily solve this. 

2. CRAFTING QUALITY OF LIFE- Crafting higher tier crafting stations is a slog and inventory can get very messy. Crafting stations currently don't pull resources from chests so finding and carrying everything around is a chore. 

3. OPTIMIZATION- Game graphics are a bit laggy for me on a pretty nice rig. There are some frame rate dips and graphical display errors.

4. PACING- Early game as of right now is a slog. You can barely carry any resources which leads to alot of back and forth with your companion. It seems like an unnecessary chore to move items to your companion then have to sort everything into chests and crafting stations This is a major point which will turn people off to the game I believe. 
=============================

Overall the good outweighs the bad for me. Hoping to see lots of updates to bring the game to it's full potential.   

If you're expecting a polished game I'd say to hold off for now. If the game looks interesting and you don't mind waiting for optimization and/or want to be a part of the feedback and updates i'd say to go for it.

This one is hard for me to 'thumbs up / down' because its mid tier, which is okay since its early access. I could just as easily give it a thumbs up. But I cant... But! I'm very willing to change the review as the game progresses. I also play on the hardest difficulty. I also played 'stress test' too.

EvErYtHiNg is mid but two things which make it a soft thumbs down. 

-> Combat is bad... <-

1) There are no dodge rolls or shields. No stealth. So there are exceedingly limited 'out plays'. 2) Mobs come in packs of 5+ and just bum rush mob you. So there is no strategy to combat. 3) As of yet, there are NO combat weapons. You have to fight with your 'gathering tools'. Being said, axe is best hands down and if you dont use an axe its bad. Skinning knife deals no damage and has no range. Pick axe has a chopping motion and since monsters bum rush 'rag doll' all over the place its hard to hit. 4) So there is no combat diversity. 5) There is supposed to be magic... but... I havent found it yet. 

-> I'm six hours in and *still* on neo-lithic stone tools... <-

...even though I have all the base (~8) crafting stations unlocked. After you unlock the basic set up progression essentially stops. I have a feeling I will be in the stone age until I get off the first map. And since I'm playing on super hard mode this could easily be 10+ hours into the game. Since combat is linear and nonstrategic there are very few ways -if any- to outplay, out grind, out exp, out craft, out combat, out cheeze... monsters and the boss. 

These can be easy fixes and expect it to change in pre release

Minor gripes:

No mounts so travel/exploration can be a bit tedious.
No convenient storage organizational system. 
No real monster animal diversity per map. I hear there is overall, though.
No challenge to 'puzzles'. Essentially just click a crystal.
No exciting dungeons or temples. Just another place to fight monsters in tight quarters *bleh*
No real reward to 'wandering exploration'. Just a ham-sandwitch every so often. 
Your companion's ai cant keep up with you so it will just teleport around. Doesnt bother me too too much. 

But! On positive notes!

-> The card system is kinda cool and can be really powerful. It will change the color palate of your terrain, the sky (which can be very beautiful), and glow/particle effects. The bonuses and penalties can be significant enough to change gameplay a lot! I've got one which tripples my food buff timers and adds a slow regen to health. Once, I had one which made me float which, in combination to my dagger's dash, essentially made exploration and travel super fast. Theres another which absolutely tanks your hp but gives monsters a chance to drop special loot. 

-> It *seems* as though getting into higher tiers of crafting can be very complex and rewarding - based on the complexity of the crafting stations. There are tons of 'enchantments' that have a wide variety of effects. So it seems like there may be combat diversity later. 

-> Building buildings is easy. Its kinda cool! You can completely build your 'ghost' house and it will compile all the building materials for the entire house all in one 'click'. 

All in all.

Visuals: They look great. The environments that you go through look fantastic. In terms of survival games, this is one of the better looking ones out there. I don't really have much to say, just watch the trailers and judge for yourself.

Performance: Runs better than I thought it would, however there are still hitches and (infrequent) FPS drops. They don't happen often enough to be a big deal, but it is still noticeable. After playing 5 hours straight, I didn't experience a single crash, however your mileage may vary.

Network: It's always online, despite whether you play by yourself or not. No idea why this is, maybe there is a mechanic that they need it online at all times, but I have no idea what it is. No disconnects after a straight 5 hours, but again, mileage may vary.

Character Creation: Some options, not alot. I don't really care about this portion tbh but was plenty enough for me.

Gameplay: So I will break this into chunks.
1. Combat - This feels weird, no lie. It legitimately feels like there is lag when hitting or shooting anything. A delay that just throws you off. Its not that big of deal when engaging in melee but it feels SUPER weird when doing anything with range. The pebble shooter legit feels terrible to use, and it isn't worth using anything ranged until you get a gun or just sticking with melee.

2. Exploration - The environments look fantastic, and there are alot of landmarks that you can see from any point in the map. The downside is that there isn't a quick way back home. In games like Enshrouded and Palworld, you can quicktravel to waypoints, and in games like 7daysdodie, you have vehicles to get to where you want to go quickly. This game (as far as I can see) has neither of those. Its possible there is a card that does it for you, but I haven't found a way to do this yet. So traveling far feels discouraged, however it feels like there is more to find than the other games.

3. Building - The building in the game feels pretty good, and with the bonuses you earn makes you feel like placement somewhat matter more than other games. Its not THAT big of deal, but it gives it a tiny bit of depth missing from other games. It also has a QOL feature that lets you place the blueprints down, and you can build it all in 1 go rather than having to go to each piece. This means you don't have to walk around encumbered building piece by piece.

4. Crafting - The UI makes this so clunky to do. Its the same for building but its worse when crafting. The menu's don't show enough, the sub menus are confusing to navigate, and some of the benches have to be aimed at weirdly for the prompt to pull up. There is so much wasted screen space that could be used to show more to make it a bit easier, and the benches need bigger hit boxes so you don't have to aim right on the legs to craft. Lastly, and this goes for ALL survival games, I'm sick of my storage not counting towards my inventory when I'm at base. Its such a huge QOL and its so stupid that not every builder/survival game does this automatically at this point.

5. Quests/content - Again, only 5 hours in so far, but it looks like there is plenty to do. Along with the plenty of POIs in the environment, there are quests that can be earned. They are simplistic, but give the game more than just mining for materials and crafting to go do more mining.

So far, the issues with this game are mostly fixable, but it really does need the QOL updates, a UI revamp, and a fix for that ""lag"" so combat doesn't feel weird to do. However the fantastic visuals, the card system, and interesting lore and world, make this my go-to over enshrouded and palworld.",1708484867,1708484867,True,24,0,0.697597801685333252,0,True,False,True

10/10 for nailing the style of crafting the game provides - Velhiem style mixed with blue print finding.
8/10 Graphics DLSS - Quality reason i state this so low is due to shadow issues in some cases mainly shadows from trees
10/10 for price point
7/10 For AI movements and attacks also some animals spawn in the same areas over again IE good for farming but sometimes its a little annoying.
10/10 for the world density and size Realms don't feel too big nor too small an has tons an tons of resources.

I've only simply crack the surface of this game with my 3hrs of playtime an i can tell ya i feel i haven't got very far at all. That is all great things specially for the price point of this game. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun enjoyable but aggressive style survival that mixes tons of survival games into 1 game.

Minutes after the tutorial, you are told to make new armor that is the typical survival game medieval-esque leather armor. I'm sure the game will return to the Victorian style later on, but it's quite disappointing to have to struggle through another paint by the numbers survival experience to get to the unique stuff.

Regardless, that was just a nitpick of mine. Aside from that, I saw no problems so far. Combat is a bit simplistic, but then again, all survival game combat is.

The game has a ton of polish and pizzazz. Lots of potential here. My only gripe thusfar is that the combat hasn't been great. ""Wait for the enemy to charge, because that's all it can do, side step and smack."" Maybe things get more varied later on, but we'll see. 

If I had to nitpick another thing, it would have to be the different varieties of the same item. Many items come in different ""flavors"" depending on how they were obtained. So, you could end up with several stacks of a simple bone because each one came from a different enemy type. This creates needless clutter and Craftopia got chewed TF out for doing something similar.

Game is absolutely beautiful and if it played like a true survival game would be simply fantastic.

But as things stand, it plays too much like an unrewarding RPG.

Anyone can say whatever they want and I don't care; the ""survival"" games that force questing fail miserably in the long-term.

That's why ARK, Rust, Conan Exiles and Minecraft stay at the top of the genre: you don't HAVE to quest to improve.

No matter how beautiful Nightingale is, when improvement is locked behind quests that are neither engaging nor rewarding, players looking for a survival game are going to be incredibly disappointed.

Remember: unique is not synonymous with good.

TLDR;

Cons - 

- Too many forced quests (gear/weapons/building locked behind questing)
- Too many screens
- Too many hits for basic nodes with few resources
- Character doesn't actually interact with work tables
- No custom inventory management
- Destroy five trees and be overweight but only build two lowest-tier walls (only a SLIGHT exaggeration)
- Mentions NPC followers as part of the game but they're hardly any better than Skyrim followers

Yes, there are some server hiccups when transitioning between realms and I've had to sit through a couple more loading screens than I might have if the game had an offline mode.  That just isn't a problem; it doesn't happen enough to be more than a mild annoyance and presumably has to do with the sheer number of people playing the game on launch day.

If you look beyond these petty complaints you'll find an original approach to solving the problem of allowing a player to build a glorious home base without requiring them to travel ever further in search of adventure. The portal system allows you to dial up the biome and difficulty you need to progress, get your loot, and easily find your way straight back to your base.  You actually get to *explore* in this game.  Movement mechanics are interesting, enemy design and environmental design are on point, and the bits of story you get- written or delivered through Puck's excellent vocal performance - are unique and well-written.

Definitely well worth a look if you enjoy survival, exploration, and base building.

When you first launch the game you are greeted with a very limited interaction in which they state the game is in early access and to please keep it in mind, then with nothing else after this you go into creating your character and right in to a required tutorial that is... not the most informative about the key binds and how to play the game the way it was ment to be played. I have several thousands of hours played on many different other survival games out there and this one took some getting use to. for starters you are gonna be doing a LOT of back and forth with your storage as it will be a while before you can increase your carrying weight, I did more running back and forth trying to build my first little starting house then actual farming, and the building system is similar to many other you plot out your build then deliver the mats to start the construction. Once an structure is down you better be happy with it, as there is no way to dismantle or pick it up. The only way I have found to remove something is by attacking it and destroying it and your weapons  making you go out and gather more. I cannot honestly recommend the game in it's current state BUT, the game is in early access and I will keep an eye on it and hope that one day it will be in a better state that will actually want to devote a couple hundred hours or so playing but for now I can only muster up the enthusiasm to play for a few hours and get tired of the constant running back and forth after hitting a few rocks and having a total of about 12 stone in my inventory and I'm over weight.",1708482664,1708482664,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's interesting how you can create your lineage running all the way back to your great grandparents. I believe it's just in favor of helping to grab traits from multiple npcs in order to add little nuances to your character's facial archetype, but I could be wrong. Maybe it will serve some other purpose in future updates, or maybe I just missed the description.

Nightingale so far is....good, honestly. I took my sweet time going through the tutorial so I could become efficient with navigating the menus and hotbar. I would definitely like a way to scroll my off hand items, such as Alt+Scroll. My hands aren't huge, so reaching all the way over to zero is a bit of a nuisance. Also, you can holster your off hand, but not [really] your primary. By pushing H to holster your primary, your off hand will come back out. I'm a gamer who likes to be able to holster all his tools, mainly for the immersion. 

The game controls pretty smooth, with combat actually being the highlight for me. The enemies so far react to my hits, deal a decent but fair amount of damage, and your weapons seem to hold together long enough that you don't have to worry about constant repair. Not to mention, repairing, for now, is as easy as clicking repair all in your inventory. The item needed for repair comes from breaking down (extracting) literally everything, which can also be done from the inventory. 

Gathering feels like it's going to be pretty basic going forward. I've hit quite a few trees, rocks, and bushes, while also skinning a number of animals. The speed at which stuff breaks is actually quite nice. I hit a tree twice and it came down. Granted it was small, so maybe bigger trees will take more hits.

Things I like:
*It's visually stunning 
*I like that you can craft your home, etc before having the mats, and then add your mats as you get them
*Weather, they have HAIL which I thought was really cool

The current Issues
*The fighting mechanics are REAL clunky, hard to have any type of strategy to deal with foes.
*The crafting system.  Having many games before it that have a good streamlined crafting system this one seems overly complicated for what it needs to be.  LOTS of clicking on things that should be a bit more automated.
*The environment visuals are slow and glitchy, for instance harvesting trees, etc, the visual changes are really slow and laggy to happen.

The game feels more like an alpha.  It's really hard not to compare it to Enshrouded because they were released so close together.  While Enshrouded isn't as beautiful in graphics terrain etc, all of the base elements of building, harvesting, etc are solid and easy to navigate.  I worry that they won't be able to adjust / change the inherently clunky combat system or the crafting portion of the game.  

I played it for a good 2 hours, and found myself frustrated by the combat, and logging off to log back into Enshrouded.  My hope is that they are able to overcome the current issues and have an amazing game.",1708482097,1708482097,False,10,0,0.559236764907836914,1,True,False,True

First off, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Fully fleshed out biomes with unique creatures and plants. Points of interest, ruins, and nooks to explore and find loot. 

The crafting and building system is pretty standard and I think it's well done and not overly complicated. I like that you can ghost place things down and add resources to complete. Gathering resources is satisfying, but not a slog. There are different tiers of the same resource which add benefits when used for crafting.

Combat is a little lacking for right now. The basics are there, but the AI is a little wonky and not hard to kite. Still, it's challenging enough to feel the accomplishment of defeating things without being overpowered.

The card/portal system is brilliant. Not locked into the same recycled biomes over and over. Changing out the cards adds  a little tweak each time and the combinations are plenty.

It's worth checking out for sure. It's $26 right now. It's a steal. People are agonizing over this due to not being a finished game, then turn around and spend $20 on a shitty skin dlc for another game(you know who you are).",1708481868,1708481868,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Character creator is detailed but... none of the faces look good. I think it's the aesthetic the game is trying to go for (old European? exaggerate caricatures?) but this definitely missed the mark for me.

The controls feel clunky. The running looks awkward and stiff. I had trouble picking up things off the ground; like I had to walk 2 feet away from the loot in order for the prompt to even come up.

I, unfortunately, had the game breaking bug of not being able to leave the tutorial zone (quest stated ""Venture into an Abeyance Realm""). Come to learn that this was a notable, known issue during the early betas, that has not been fixed prior to release. The game launching into early access with the same issues as beta doesn't invoke any confidence into the development management of this game. What other major bugs did they ignore? Are they just going to add on top without addressing our concerns?

Now where this game shines is the narration, story telling, world building, and general ambience. It feels magical in what little I have experienced [and seen on Twitch] thus far. The realm system with cards is a very unique take on generated worlds; you can really customize what you're looking for.

Seems to be a common trend these days... ""if the game works, it's great!"". As it stands though, I cannot recommend this game with confidence. We'll see if the bugs are fixed when the game is fully released.",1708481181,1708481181,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

The aesthetic and atmosphere works really well for me. I'm a bit sad that the clothing style is thrown out the window the second you get your first ""new"" item. It's a staple, I know, to start the players out as hobos and then grow into the cool looking gear, but in a game so heavily carried by aesthetics it is a little grating. It's greatly prefer an ""impoverished settler"" look over the ""neolithic caveman"" we have here. It's a minor gripe, since you'll soon enough move on to better looking gear, but a gripe nonetheless. 

The faces need some serious work. It reminds me of struggling with the character creator in Oblivion, trying to make something that doesn't look like it is 82% toad. Except Oblivion gives you more control over the process. The foundation of the character creation is great. I love what they're doing with it and how they approach it. But it is definitely not finished.

The combat and controls are what you would expect from a survival builder. Clunky but passable. Same with the UI. It works, if you're willing to meet it halfway. There's around fifty million ways it could be improved and time will tell if that happens. It's not a big deal to me, since this is what I expect to get from a game in this genre, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved.

The realm system and exploration is wonderful. No caveats. I love the concept and I love the implementation. Along with the general aesthetic it is what carries the game.

It's very much early access and I feel like a lot of the other reviews are expecting something else. It is far more functional than Conan Exiles was day one of early access, so if you have some experience with the genre then you'll be just fine. But if you think you're getting a polished and problem free experience then stay clear. Survival builders are notoriously janky, even when fully released, and this is day one early access. There is tech issues, unfinished systems, janks, and bugs galore. I had to remake my character because the tutorial bugged out and I was stuck fighting endless waves of enemies from a portal that never finished opening. 

This is a survival builder game in early access. It is rough. That's what it says on the label. Read the label. Don't be the guy throwing a hysterical tantrum because you bought a box labelled ""Mixed lego bricks"" and it turned out to indeed contain mixed lego bricks rather than whatever cool pre-assembled set you imagined in your mind.

Absolutely beautiful game
Solid combat system
Solid building design
True to the survival/crafting genre
Realm Transmutations are so fun
Surprisingly optimized (for me and my low budget PC)
Very unique character creation 
LOVE the Realm Generating
10/10 voice acting 

Cons:
Navigating the hot bar is slow and inefficient, here I would like to see it be just 1 singular hot bar with faster mouse wheel scrolling. The mouse wheel scrolls way too slow and only works for half of the hot bar anyways (by design). Hot bars are fairly standard across all survival games, why complicate it?
The day to night transition is very sudden.
Game progress is very slow and boring, progression is based on your gear level, which on paper seems fine, but the only way to get gear is from looting/traders/crafting/stealing from recruits and the game has very little anything to loot. It feels like the game should be designed to be a looter but there’s nothing to really loot. Whereas resource gathering just takes too long to even get your average power to its requirement to even progress in the game. I understand the game is meant to be dependent on crafting to progress but the effort to put into that is so slow. Needs to be a healthy balance here.
There is no sense of reward from any task in the game. Being able to unlock and grind (heavily) for the next goal at hand leaves you feeling more burnt out than driven for what’s next.

Overall I think this game has SO MUCH potential, especially if you can play with others. But for now I see it sitting at a 6/10. I’m excited for what’s to come, so don’t think this is a once and done for me.",1708480971,1708480971,False,3,1,0.515999972820281982,0,True,False,True

They promised to turn the game into an offline experience, and the online-only feature will only last for a while during Early Access. Personally, I haven't experienced any issues from Macedonia (well, not yet).

The performance is WACK tho! Not having a stable 60FPS on a rig like mine, even on the lowest possible settings + DLSS Balanced, is unheard of!

Like seriously do you want us to be frustrated every time we load up the game and the keys arent the same as all of our other 1st/3rd person games?

I love making the A button the select/use/pickup, then mapping the Y to jump and using the ""ring ringer"" buttons under my controller for jump, weapon cycle, block and so forth.

The character creator was pretty decent, but 2 minutes on to the game and i cant jump, move and look around at the same time because I only have two thumbs, meanwhile four unused and bored fingers....

Okay played for about 6-7 hours.

Its simply not ready to be playable. Crashes or kicks you  offline, you lose progress, many things simply just dont work and bugs showing up everywhere.

I filled in a few bugs but the last ""server error"" took away about two hours of progress, so.. its not worth playing now.

The environment is so nice, ambient sounds are good, really pretty. 

The combat I’ve only wacked a few things and idk it feels fine to me, feels like any other survival game tbh. But I’ve only got Neanderthal weapons rn

I haven’t encountered any fps/ping or network errors. Only bug I’ve encountered is when I get bone from animals the bone crawls away from me so I have to chase it to pick it up. 

I like the building also. My only issue is that you can’t freely place a wall foundation unless there is already one underneath so if you want to make separate rooms you can’t kind of but it’s not much of a bother to me. 

There’s also a follower/companion system you have kind of, they help you fight and farm mats but it’s a bit eh and I think needs some more work on.

Being always online, even when playing solo, is absolute nonsense. There is no reason a game like this has to be online at all times.

Which is only compounded by the servers being a trash fire currently. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand that server management is a difficult especially at launch when you don't know how many people will be playing at one time, and the servers get a giant wave of activity. Even giant AAA companies fall victim to this issue. I normally wouldn't hold it against a game.

But it being always online means that even playing SINGLE PLAYER I get massive lag spikes and complete freezes as the servers chug.

If they add an offline option I will HAPPILY change this review to a positive as I love a lot of what this game is doing, the art design, and where it's headed.

- Some quests (or maybe all of them, I didn't have time to check) have no general progression, and each player has to fulfill them separately. For example, a quest to build an Estate cairn appears at the beginning. If one player builds it, the other player still has to build it too to fulfill the quest. Why? What is the purpose of this?

I didn't find a single positive thing, compared to other games in the genre. No new mechanics, nothing. Unfortunately, the game did not live up to expectations, and gives the impression of a scam project, the purpose of which is to suck money and leave the game in early access forever.",1708477173,1708478581,False,11,1,0.530109822750091553,2,True,False,True

I am running at Quality graphics across the board.

My ""survival"" game background:
50+ hours(completed) Enshrouded - I played archer and farmed sticks, I know the grind, trust.
50+ hours(completed) Valheim
50+ hours The Forest
50+ hours Green Hell
50+ hours Sons of the Forest
100+ hours Stardew Valley
50+ hours Moonstone Island

I have completed the first 'dungeon/boss' at the starter realm after tutorial - fight was fun.

****First and foremost RUSH the lvl 20 armor - increases your carry limit to about 90. HELPS SO MUCH.****

Pros:
1) It is new, it is exciting, the combat doesn't really feel THAT bad, but it doesn't feel amazing. Mediocre.
2) First/Third person: Having the option is a pro, first person feels immersive - skyrim-esque.
3) The character creation is FREAKING AMAZING - just have faith and progress through it, yes it is scary to see 20+ fetal alcohol syndrome faces looking back at you at first, but it does get better as you customize more, I promise.
4) Dash on dagger is best movement(in my opinion), 15 stamina for a far leap, backstab(knife) and headshot damage with ALL weapons is a nice touch.
5) Building is fine. lay down all pieces and then gather all required materials - The Forest and Sons of the Forest - esque.
6) Storage is easy with plant fibers gathered en-masse.
7) Turn rocks into stone marbles(ammunition for 'Slingbow') and convert to Essence = easy essence farm.

Cons:
1) No split stacking of items(that I've discovered) makes moving materials or using fires quite irksome. I would recommend using plant fibers as fuel for all fires to save wood and prevent encumbered moving wood around.
2) Items are dependent on what drops them. Example: prey animals drop Prey Meat and predators drop Predator meat. Barely any difference in the stats of cooked food BUT forces another inventory/storage slot to be used for EVERY SINGLE variation of each item. Frankly, this f***ing sucks and forces your abode to become a storage shed.
3) Third person run animation is Hunchback of Notre Dame - esque and it is ROUGH to look at - would recommend first person.
4) Gliding is trash. Having to equip the umbrella AND initiate gliding with spacebar again is awful. In my opinion the Umbrella should auto equip like the glider in Enshrouded.
5) UI is convoluted BUT you will get used to it - frankly you have to if you want to play.
6) Slingbow and most likely firearm firing animation causes a GIANT puff of dust/smoke when fired that blocks your screen and hides projectiles unless you shoot them way over the range and therefore most likely missing every shot. Reloading is NOT automatic and requires ANOTHER input - rough.

Conclusion: it is day FREAKING ONE PEOPLE. Relax. Yes, this game is lacking in some CRITICAL departments. Yes, it is not as PERFECT as you expected. That being said, the game is fun, worthwhile, and will certainly get my 50+ hours.

I play on Linux (Kubuntu) so the first thing I encountered was Steam authentication issues and login failure.
To get around this I had to add the following to the launch options,

-ignore-windows-system-certs

Once that was in I was able to login and create my character. (Hopefully this will be useful to other Linux players and those on Steam Deck)

The character creator is simple enough and once complete I was dropped into a tutorial of sorts where a character called Puck runs me through a few side realms, called byways, to complete some tasks and gain some crude tools. Puck does appear from time to time and gives you other tips as you play. I like the puck character, but I think he needs more animation to match the great voice acting.

Performance doesn't appear to be an issue, for me at least, and my machine is getting long in the tooth now, but I'm getting smooth and very playable frames rates. (I'll fiddle with the settings too at some point)

Stamina runs out very quickly which makes combat a strategic affair to make sure you can block and dodge when the AI decides to take a swipe at you.
Combat does seem a little basic at the moment and the AI isn't very smart or interesting. They all just seem to move towards you and you just bash them. No interesting patterns or the like just yet.

Building bases feels reasonable although I really don't like not being able to pick anything up. You have to smash it with a tool which to me needs to be fixed in the first QoL patch run.

There are a lot of mechanics in the game which do appear to tie in nicely and adds some purpose and depth to the various crafting stations, buildings and so on, although I haven't quite wrapped my head around it all yet as there is a bit of a learning curve.
I'm sure once I have more time to play I'll pick up the finer details.

Positives:

The core of the game is beautiful, slightly dated graphics but more than passable for a smaller studio.

For early access the crafting is in a good place, building is in a good place, the inventory management needs some love (but that is to be expected in a survival game), and exploration is really good.

I love the overall decreased development speed. You can tell even from just a few hours that progression will take time. (which is good, me and my playgroup completed Enshrouded in just under two weeks. We felt that was way to fast!)

Negatives:

Inventory management needs a couple of quick fixes (like splitting stacks as it creates play-ability issues being unable to pick up stacks of items from chests without becoming over-encumbered).

The parkour is a bit on the weak side and needs some attention.

The umbrellas are mandatory. Yeah, seriously... this studio spent like 200 man sprints on character customization and nobody realized that flying around like Marry Poppins might not fit the preferred aesthetic of some of their player base. (this is a personal preference and may not apply to you but I am not the only one in my playgroup that assumed there would be other mobility options for different demographics)

The combat is the worst attempt at in-game combat I have ever experienced. A lubed up midget tossing competition is more elegant and graceful than this. It is based on some bizarre concept where you run in circles around each other randomly left clicking (yes, the video showing blocking, pushing, timed attacks, parrying, etc was all just a bullshit). Enemies are terribly designed, redundant, and easily defeated using the aforementioned elite ""run in circles, click attack"" maneuver, hitbox's are non-sense, stamina use in combat is laborious, even going to just hunt some deer for food is a deeply frustrating experience that overwhelmingly ruins all the positives this game has. 

Releasing the game with so little thought and effort put into the combat system really demonstrates that as a company Inflexion Games have no intention of making this a successful title. No product manager that cares about their project would have approved launching with the combat system and enemies in this state. There are a lot of good survival games released so far this year and more on the horizon. Spend your dollars on another title with a company who wants to be successful because that isn't Inflexion Games, this will be abandonware in 6 months.",1708477781,1708477781,False,12,3,0.516529202461242676,2,True,False,True

As for the game itself, it's extremely addicting once you get past the initial two-three hours, and realize what you're supposed to do to get stronger. The art style and aesthetic is the best I've seen in the genre, and the lore runs deep for those interested in seeking it out and talking to the various NPCs that inhabit the Fae Realms. The Realm Card system is quite frankly ingenious, and provides a satisfying and intriguing gameplay backdrop for the survival-crafting loop. Co-op works seemlessly and without needing a host, meaning your realm stays playable even when everyone is offline, so no need to wait for your mates to hop on. Enemies hit hard, making combat considerably more difficult than the average survival game. There's also tons of different options once you start reaching the mid-to-endgame (lots of different weapons, magic spells, elemental combinations and enemy weakness exploitation). Gear progression is slow, but very rewarding, and each power spike is satisfying and has a measurable impact on your gameplay experience.

There's also a super-robust building system that allows you to build some insane bases in a wide variety of styles, a surprisingly well-animated and engaging fishing system, NPC vendors and settlements, and various world bosses and dungeon bosses to be fought, as well as an overarching main story that has you seeking out a legendary Realmwalker settlement, which acts as the game's social hub.

Tldr: It's very early-Early Access, and there's no real criticism that's new that hasn't been circulating pre-release already. Hard sideways thumb on day one. For me, it's about a 7/10, but it's...already a bit polarizing. 

The Bad - to get this out of the way. 

1. Inflexion chose to have the whole game - including single player - to be online-only. If you live outside of NA - you're going to have a bad time. If you live in NA and aren't with an ideal ISP (like me - I'm on high orbit satellite) - your mileage is going to correlate with how well you can manage your expectations. 

I was hopeful that their system would be more like No Man's Sky - polling the servers to generate the worlds/realms, then only pinging periodically. That's not the case. For me, with solidly ""ok,"" for satellite internet, I lag and rubberband and I get stuttering, no matter what I do with my settings (and I can play virtually anything not needing internet on Ultra - for context). 

This early in the dev process (it's Day One, writing this) the devs haven't really talked about their long term plans, but the *possibility* of having local hosting (which would be drastically preferable) has been talked about. If that's important to you - sideways thumb. Wishlist it for now. Because unless you're on a fully-wired connection (and especially if you're into co-op at all), it'll be difficult for you, if not unplayable. 

2. Polarizing Design Decisions. The character designs are stylized in a way that's very love/hate them. They're not photorealistic - if you come into this wanting that? You're going to have a bad time. I personally like what they did with the art direction, but plenty hate it. Either way, the process is interesting (it's not all bad). My beef is with the UI - it's actually the worst UI I have seen in the genre that's not from ""basement devs."" If you remember the sheer jank that was early Conan Exiles and Valheim, before the UI overhauls and streamlining - yeah, it's that. Bars everywhere. Tiny timer icons (what are these? Icons for ANTS?!) for a frankly huge variety of buffs and debuffs (also not all bad). Very stock-looking health bars taking up a huge part of the screen real estate, etc. This extends somewhat to the crafting and inventory menus. They remind me of OG Skyrim - a separate button for everything, and difficult to intuitively move through the menu. It doesn't help that the in-game tutorial is very barebones at the moment. For example. 

You get a mission to craft a thing. The game doesn't really tell you how. 

So, you'd press I, maybe? Ok, that opens your inventory. You can see your stuff to craft with. But you can't craft. 

Ok, so you hit C for Craft? You're SOL there too, because you have to close the inventory menu first. Then you can press C. 

Then it gives you groups of stuff - Cooking, Survival, Building, etc. Ok, you click through them and get blueprints for your tools and crafting stations, and more opens up as you go. Great, so you place your campfire - get it where you want to, press E to assemble it, press E on the bottom half to load your campfire with fuel, click ""ignite"" to light-switch it on, close that menu, press E on the top half to load it with food. and then you can finally  craft food. 

^ This is not, as you can tell, a very intuitive or fully-sensical process. These kinds of systems are very clearly not designed with UX in mind. Inflexion really screwed the pooch by not having more extended playtesting vs. server stress tests (though...given how well the servers have performed on Day One, I can absolutely understand why they were more worried with that side - despite the decision to release a few days early). 

A lot in the game is like that. It feels like very different teams pulled different things out of a hat to work on - and then didn't talk to each other at all about them until the very end of development, and then they were told ""it's fine, we'll just release in EA and fix it as we go -"" which seems to be the plan. 

But aside from general Day One in EA jank - the controls are a little clunky/floaty, there are some balancing issues (stamina costs to swing a knife are absolutely insane, the material costs of structures and stations vs. your encombrance - and my god, it's 2024. Can we go back to not having encumbrance systems for games where the core loop centers around carrying a whole bunch of stuff from one place to another? That's not realism - that's just straight up an anti-fun system for extending playtime, and difficulty, artificially). There are obvious Day One performance creaks (there have been some dropped connections, unnecessary lag, some CTD on AMD cards and chipsets - at least from what I've seen of them), but from an Intel/Nvidia box, mine's handling that part fine. 

That said. 

Honestly one of the most innovative, gorgeous setups I've seen in the genre, and it's one of my fave genres. 

The whole concept? 

The year is 1880-something. 
A long time ago, the Fae gave humans magic with a contract (as they do). Humans got greedy (as they do) and unleashed a magical plague-storm that led to the Faepocalypse. There's one human city left standing (Nightingale - the Zion of the Faewilds), and you, a Realmwalker are guided by Puck (You know, Robin Goodfellow. The merry wanderer of the night) for reasons that seem to very much be his own, and play steampunk stargate-meets-Quantum Leap trying to find your way back home to Nightingale with magical Stargate tarot cards. 

Neat stuff - and the voice acting and writing, while not exactly high literature, are actually a high watermark for the genre. Puck's VA's performance is stellar. And the writing is nicely 'period,' without a lot of the bloat that comes with that. Think more of a steampunk Firefly than Jonathan Strange. Nice lovecraftian undertones while still being very steampunk fantasy. 

And speaking of eldrich horrors beyond our comprehension - again with the art direction. The creature designs are to die for (you prob won't much until later in the game. AI is simple in the early game at least, and again - day one jank), they're oozing character and absolutely nail the vibe of the Faewilds being a very alien place just below the surface. Tinkerbell, this ain't. 

Music is solidly ok - though somewhat forgettable and bland so far. Nothing really jarring, it's balanced well, it's a workhorse of a score. Does what it needs to do, when it needs to do it, then goes back to the barn. Not the kind of score you're likely to get stuck in your head. It's one that's so fitting - that it just blends into the background all the time. Which is kinda tragic. The composer is obviously very good, it just doesn't have a lot of soul and spice to it. 

Online stuff - I'm a solo gamer myself, but for those of y'all listening to me ramble might be wondering about how multi works and if there's safe zones. Yes. You get a safe zone that's all yours, to build a base (here, an Estate) in. The rest is in instanced realms (procedurally generated, hosts up to 6 players), until you hit endgame with the big social hub. Til that time, you can play drop in/out co-op - and it is very much co-op. It's not designed to be more MMO-lite in the sense of grouping, raiding, etc., for the bulk of the game as it is. If you're looking for that for PvP - you're going to be sad. 

If you obsess over period correctness (esp in terms of gender, race, etc) you're going have a bad time, and try dying mad about it for me, please and thank you. 

As it is - very ""what are you willing to deal with,"" at the moment. Feels very early access (frankly feels pre-beta, maybe early-early beta for me), and there are the connectivity concerns and polarizing design choices, but it's mostly all here. If internet is a non-issue for you, and your box can run it - def worth at least a try at a little over $20. For everyone else - I'd really wishlist it and give it a little more time in the oven.",1708477084,1708477084,True,91,4,0.81804269552230835,0,True,False,True

Wait 3-6 months for the game to come out of early access. 

Game has potential, but needs to be optimized. Persistent lag and low fps despite being well above recommended specs. 

Controls are clunky. Interface with crafting tables is sloppy. You have move cursor over crafting station multiple times to get the proper inputs - craft/ignite/collect etc.  

Slingbows are useless. Range is abysmal. Prey animals run too fast.

I'm sure that later in the game, it'll be more interesting and have a lot more to do. But running around collecting sticks felt like deja vu rather than a fresh take on survival gaming.

Edit: I played through the rest of the tutorial. I built my first house that looks exactly like the first house you'd build in Conan. The only real improvement here was that I could plan it all out then feed the mats into the layout I designed. That was cool.

But the clunkiness, the absurd impact the environment has, the clothes and models looking so terrible, the menus and interface...yes, this is Early Access. But I wouldn't even know where to begin to help them fix what's wrong.

Negatives:
- Alot of systems in this game and not all of them work well together yet
- Needs some real work in Polish, Companion character is teleporting which is annoying me, sometimes enemies get stuck in an animation
- Controller support is meh atm
- Performance needs some work, although its not terrible by any means.
- Combat is not very good at the moment
- To much emphasis on the crafting, which is kind of meh atm
- Needs many Quality of life aspects (No auto stack, no crafting with things that are in your chests, boring combat,etc..)
- Progression is not done very well, needs some fine tuning

At the moment its not to bad and has some wonderful ideas, but it also needs alot of work and isn't in as good of shape on day 1 as say something like Enshrouded and Valheim. Still, keep an eye on this game as it gets updated, its already fun and with more improvements and things added, I can see this one day being near the top of the Survival rpg genre. But as it stands I would put Valheim, Enshrouded and Grounded all above Nightingale atm, some great ideas but needs more time in the oven so to speak.

The game is far from bad but of late we have been spoiled with the likes of Valheim and Enshrouded for this type of rpg/survival game, that also does basebuilding very well.

If you can only get one of these style games I would suggest atm to check out Enshrouded, Valheim or Grounded before this game. But down the road, def pick it up and see how things have improved. Its already in decent shape but just compared to some of the other games at the top of this genre, its a tad behind atm.

It's a bit of a letdown because it feels like the game's accessibility and performance are being compromised for a portion of the gaming community.

Have dropped a few hours in now and want to give some honest feedback.

The Good
First, the graphics are damn good, I mean their in the holy hell look at that category of good. The building mechanics are nice though early game your options do limit your creativity a little. The soundtrack similarly is very nice. Character outfits are great with the capacity for a lot of customisation.

The Okay
The harvesting mechanics though grindy are fairly easy to grasp. The weight of the melee weapons/tools feels good. It feels like your hitting stuff when you use it. The stamina system is not to punishing and makes you approach fights slightly carefully.

The Character creator is ok, but needs some more customisation options. In particular in designing the players eyes and jawline. It also needs a wider variety of voice options.

The Bad
The start of the game is dull, very frigging dull. This is very concerning as I can picture many players refunding the game before the time limit simply because of how dull the opening is. I hope the Dev's add some spectacle or drama to the start. I'm not talking Michael Bay levels of spectacle,but something that will grab a new player like say a Christopher Nolan movie ;P.

Tying into this, is the whole Puck as a guide thing. He is far from a likeable or interesting character. A central character such as this needs personality alot of personality. This again may put players off of the game. Though I get this is the aesthetic and style the Dev's are trying to imbue the game with, I would be concerned it may appeal to a limited audience.

The enemy AI is weak, very weak which is a shame as they look amazing.
I urge people to get past the opening stages of the game and give it a good try, though this does remove the refund option. Perhaps Steam should look at extended refund windows for survival crafters.......",1708476008,1708476008,True,532,8,0.918745040893554688,17,True,False,True

So far I'm enjoying myself. It's been a long time since I played a game like this... like, original 360 Minecraft long time, but the game feels accessible to someone who hasn't played a game like this in forever. The graphics are interesting and while the character models look a bit wonky, the world graphics are really quite pretty. I'm fascinated by the world they've crafted, at least as far as I've gotten, and I immediately picked up on the Shakespearean references that made me quite happy. 

The Realm Card system is a neat way to create longevity with the potential to introduce new biomes and cards either in free updates or paid DLC, so we'll have to see where that goes.

Besides the obvious glaring issues many have pointed out about the online only and graphics crashing, I would like to point out how poor the user experience is for this game. 

The style of the menus and game is nice, but the menus themselves are needlessly cumbersome. Crafting anything is a tedious task and needs to be simplified significantly. When you go to ""collect"" any item in the world, you don't have any text prompt showing you what item you are collecting. 

Every single item has a weight. If you like games where you can be encumbered by carrying too many items then you will love this game. Survival games that restrict carrying by slots instead of weight are much better. In addition I can already see that there are multiple fun-sucking elements to this game; namely food. You have to eat to not starve, which is realistic except in real life you don't have to eat every five minutes to not starve. Games food enhances your stats instead of being required is a much more fun mechanic. Not to mention, when you cook something as simple as ""meat"" it takes way too long. like 30 seconds. Just let me sit in front of a fire and cook it in 5 seconds so I can get on with my adventure. 

The building feels clunky and unintuitive.

I want to like this game. It has stunning visuals, great dialogue, and a unique style. It suffers from falling into every pitfall of tedium that every forgotten survival game seems to fall into. Games should have that ""fun"" factor pretty shortly after starting, or at least right after the tutorial. This game just doesn't have it.

The tutorial area feels underwhelming, This is not necessarily a bad thing and you should try to not let it dissuade you from continuing through the tutorial zone. While there are some additions I feel would make the tutorial zone far more appealing and involving - such migrating the shelter and bedroll, and basic tools crafting portions to the tutorial island in order to compliment the campfire and cooked berries quest.

I have two main gripes that prevent me from wanting to play for extended periods of time:

The first is the lack of a target tooltip for harvestable resources. While there is a floating list of what is being actively collected, actually knowing what is available for collection before harvesting would be a dramatic improvement. Better yet, if the developers make harvesting a discovery system, that would make things enjoyable, also.

My second gripe is that I have never been a fan of UI panels sporting a bright background with dark text. In an era of accessibility options becoming more prevalent in modern games, not having the option to change UI panel colours and offer higher contrast settings is an unfortunate thing to see not presently being an active feature. I hope to see such changes made available in the future.

The ancestry system is a fun idea that I genuinely like, but which I find unnecessary for character creation. I hope to see a randomiser option, potentially a pre-defined set of ancestry options and the continued manual option.

This UI and whoever designed this crafting setup needs to be let go, and whoever signed off on it needs to be let go as well. It's probably hands down one of the worst crafting systems I've seen, and I'm just starting into the game, I was watching videos of people with storage boxes stacked with the same materials same icons but hover over and they imbue diff stats.

The crafting system I think will be the downfall of this game, its definitely giving me significant pause, this was supposed to be a team out of bioware? They are making these noob mistakes? people can say ""It's early access bro"" yes true, but first impressions count, the ratings will go down and this game will be a hard sell when it gets into negative territory reviews are already mixed, not a good look.

They had to have known the UI was bad, They had to have known if they wanted to have 250 diff types of the same material but gives diff stat buffs they'd have AOE style craft containers. The oversight slight on these simple things are just insane to me that point to a larger problem of incompetence within the teams structure.


So far loop seems pretty generic, ui and sub menus seem cluttered and annoying, im hoping this plays well with a controller because i mainly bought this to coop with the wife (she loves Victorian era and steampunk) and I don't want to waste money on copy #2

Gameplay wise i think the whole meeting puck and the starting area theatrics in the beginning  was a bad move it created high expectations, then you're dropped in the game and....its like the f is this?

ill edit my review as i sink more time into it, but I'm hoping the UI and crafting  doesn't make me quit.

Also I feel like they need more slider options in character creator you know the ones that count (.)(.)

standard unreal engine 5 graphics stuff nothing mindblowing, but certainly beautiful. I keep thinking of enshrouded while I play though and I think thats a bad sign.

It's a no for me rn. hopefully my mind changes.

*Edit*

welp i just sent in for refund cant even split a stack in my inventory, storage is already a joke but this was the cherry on top. Also cant drop a certain amount of something its all or none. oh also sorting is nowhere its all manual, with the amount of crafting materials you need with their system what a joke.",1708453716,1708474744,False,29,0,0.529044091701507568,4,True,False,True

It doesn't hold you hand too much through the tutorial but its refreshing to me, IE no map markers etc.

The controls etc are standard, mouse look wasd to move. I saw a couple of reviews saying you need cursor keys to look???......... you definitely don't.

If you are going to launch a game in early access where people pay money for it I would recommend making sure the first 10 hours or so play relatively smooth without MAJOR bugs that brick the game.

 With that said the game is seriously lacking in controls. I tried keyboard and mouse as well as controller. Both are clunky but the controller was REALLY bad. The elements of a survival game are also pushed a bit too far. IE if you run out of food you have like 2 HP... of if you are not rested you cant build stamina, at all!!  um that seams a little extreme. Combat also felt clunky at best. you are often times clicking the button only to have the attack whiff in front of you missing the target all together.

The only feature I don't care for so far is the character creation system. I won't harp on it too much, but it is jarring to say the least. I'm going to give the developers the benefit of the doubt and presume this was not their intention, but what appears to be an attempt at a whimsical aesthetic has resulted in most of the character presets looking like neanderthals; and what's worse, the garish makeup on some of the racially diverse presets looks cartoonishly unnatural to the point where it comes off as... I don't know if Steam will even let my say it... The word for how old cartoons tended to depict black folks. Although the customization options are fairly extensive (at least for the face; very minimal editing is available for the rest of the body), I found it frustratingly difficult to design a character that didn't look like a culturally insensitive neanderthal.

The gameplay itself is intriguing enough so far. The tutorial is very streamlined and helpful, the mechanics are easy enough to get the hang of, and artistically the worldbuilding is excellent. I especially like the creature design, although maybe I'm missing something but I wish there was more to do with the wildlife but kill them; I'm thinking tamable mounts, pets, and livestock.

Survival in Nightingale is thrilling, with arcane portals leading into treacherous Fae Realms, each presenting unique challenges. Crafting tools and advanced weaponry imbued with mystical properties adds depth to the experience.

Building grand estates and forming communities in the midst of adversity is rewarding, while exploration unveils breathtaking landscapes and otherworldly life. Nightingale seamlessly integrates cooperative and solo gameplay, inviting players to collaborate and conquer together.

I should noted that I do classify the participants of a game into two categories. Gamers and Players. Gamers are die hard fans of games as a whole and you can see that in how they review and talk about games. Players are enjoyers of games but stand distinctly in the consumer side of it. Gamers crave better worlds, stories, and interesting Mechanics. Players want high fidelity graphics and other superficial elements. Players opinions should be discredited in many regards but we can't because they tend to hold the most monetary power and thus are the reason we get things like Cyberpunk 2077 releasing well before it should. Gamers are willing to wait for a GREAT game, Players will accept an OK game.

Online Only - This is a big point of contention with Gamers and Players alike. I would be remiss to say that they are wrong. I am not a fan of a single player game having to be online... and for Nightingale I think there should be a STRICTLY offline mode so that those who unlike myself have no plan of playing with friends can do so without being at the whim of servers. That said, having the format they do allows me and my friends to work on the same world without being on a public server, and none of us have to host. This is an issue in games like Valheim, V Rising, Palworld, and others. If the host of the world isn't on, you can't play the game you've been putting time into. Nightingales setup resolves this issue. So while I don't want to see the current state of the game go away, I do think that the Devs need to add in a strictly solo offline mode.

Graphics - I have seen people say the graphics are 'low' or 'ps2' in one review... and this comes from the mentality of the Player. The Graphics (for the most part) are stylized. I personally prefer games that don't go for needless 'hyper realism' cause then every game looks exactly the same I like the wonky long necks/torsos I enjoy the less than real looking models in a stylized and unique style. The game is not low fidelity, it just isn't hyper realistic. There is a DRASTIC difference between those two concepts. The issue I have is with the HUD scale and particle effects. I would LOVE a feature to increase the hud scale, their font is hard to read on my monitor and the feature would be nice. Particle effects are an issue with UE5... UE5 particle systems SUCK... the pricepoint of UE5 and the lack of this feature are baffling to me... so unless you want to do a HUGE overall to the lack luster system Epic shoved into the engine your particles are going to be very bland and boring.

Now that's all I feel comfortable talking about right now... but these are two of the biggest issues I see being talked about so for now that's where I will leave this.",1708472101,1708472101,True,3,0,0.514836370944976807,0,True,False,True

first the negatives 
1. its like you are mining a bitcoin when  you are running this game it really is, i  mean i can run most all games smoothly but this game takes your pc to very loud levels, i think this may be because when u first start they say we sell all your information to 3rd parties which is very uncool but hey i already bought the game so ur kind of forced to let them.
2. there is only 25 achievements thats very low for a new game, seems like it must not be content rich but ok...
3. character selection all the premade characters look like mongoloids  , and its pretty annoying they assume we want the caveman woman look ...
positives 
1. the tutorial was quite good i found it easy to learn all the new mechanics 
2. graphics are quite good no lagging no issues with game performance for me
3. reminds me of enshouded but with better monsters , seems like ai is more intelligent in this game.

From its captivating narrative to its immersive gameplay mechanics, this atmospheric adventure delivers an unforgettable experience that will leave players enthralled from start to finish.

At the heart of Nightingale lies its gripping narrative, which unfolds like a dark and twisted tapestry of secrets waiting to be unraveled. Set in a gothic-inspired cityscape teeming with hidden alleyways and shadowed corners, players step into the role of a seasoned detective tasked with solving a series of unsolved mysteries. As the night deepens and the city's secrets begin to surface, players must navigate a web of intrigue, betrayal, and deception, piecing together clues, interrogating suspects, and unraveling the truth behind a larger conspiracy that threatens to tear the city apart.

The gameplay mechanics of Nightingale are equally captivating, blending elements of traditional point-and-click adventure games with modern storytelling techniques and innovative puzzle-solving mechanics. From deciphering cryptic messages and analyzing forensic evidence to engaging in tense confrontations with shadowy adversaries, every challenge feels both challenging and rewarding, keeping players on the edge of their seats and their minds sharp.

Visually stunning and sonically immersive, Nightingale transports players to a world of atmospheric beauty and haunting melancholy. The meticulously crafted environments are brought to life with stunning detail, from rain-slicked cobblestone streets to dimly lit taverns and opulent mansions. The haunting soundtrack, composed by acclaimed artists, sets the mood and heightens the tension, enveloping players in an atmosphere of foreboding and suspense.

But what truly sets Nightingale apart is its emphasis on player agency and meaningful choice. Throughout the game, players are presented with moral dilemmas, ethical quandaries, and choices with far-reaching consequences that force them to confront the darkness within themselves. Whether forging alliances with unlikely allies, uncovering the truth behind the city's darkest secrets, or deciding the fate of key characters, every decision shapes the course of the narrative and the fate of the protagonist, adding depth and replayability to an already rich and compelling experience.

In conclusion, Nightingale: Echoes of Darkness is a must-play for fans of mystery, adventure, and immersive storytelling. With its captivating narrative, immersive gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals, it stands as a shining example of the power of interactive entertainment to transport players to worlds beyond their imagination.

It is an early access title and obviously, many things don't feel polished. 

When crafting, sometimes whatever structure you build instantly goes up, sometimes it lags and it takes up to 10 seconds. 

Many items in your guidebook do not have descriptions or images yet. 

AI behaviour is horrendous. Fights feel like from a game 15 years ago right now. Really bad, clunky movements of all AI (wolfs, monsters, deer, etc.).

The crafting loop isn't refined at all right now. You can just (CAREFUL A BIT OF A SPOILER COMING) harvest plant fibers, extract essence dust from them and then trade them for anything you need at the essence trader and basically unlock 50 item or so at once (all craftbenches, higher grade weapons, gear, etc.) and therefore skipping chopping wood, hunting wild game, mining ores, etc. A bit stupid and unrewarding. 

Not being able to scroll through your offhand items (could have been as easy as just adding a combination like alt + mousewheel) is also a weird decision. Having to press the buttons 6,7,8,9 and 0 is massively immersion breaking imo.

Oh and there are heavy fps leaks after a 30 minutes or so. 
I start on around 100 with a 3090ti and get down to 40 after 1 hour of playtime with most of the settings on performance. Not nice at all.

Other than that, after 5 hours, I got to say there is potential there. 

I am excited to unlock weapons and magic for now. 

With this one, we have to trust that the devs will grind and polish a lot of mechanics, etc.

Also to the people who said the ""Character creator"" is ""too much"".... Then just choose a basic prefab character and load in... Stop whining about things that you can bypass... Maybe others like in depth character creators. 

So many people are whining about things that the devs have already stated will be added later in EA development. This is the curse of EA Steam reviews...

Original impressions:

30 minutes in - great graphics and art that is juxtaposed by somewhat janky animations.  I don't like that this game is currently always online, but I haven't experienced server issues yet (but seriously, if there are server issues when the game launches at noon Eastern US time on a work day after a major holiday, then that would not be good...).

Obviously I haven't gotten far into the game given that I only have 30 minutes played at initial review, but from just initial impressions the gameplay mechanics seem deeper than I would've expected for a survival game.

It's definitely worth a try at this time given that the tutorial section can be finished well within the Steam refund time limit.

For some reason when i punch my hand loses fingers and out comes a jab with a large gloved sausage. The disclaimer at the intro ""want to have the game run better, have better than minimum spec requirements"" lol, no S***??? Is that how that works lol. The crafting system feels clunky and drawn out to make you feel like youre doing something important but in reality you just roasted berries and that has way to many point and clicks to make happen.

To top of this lovely cake as well the first launch was a lost connection as its always online, to have that wonder in the back of your mind loading into a realm of ""am i going to be booted?"" no thanks. Sucks as the trailer seemed pretty sweet but as most things this is a let down as of right now. I played 20 minutes, thats how long this took in the initial starter area to realize this is a dumpster fire currently, grab your refund while you can and hope for updates.",1708468892,1708468892,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

Overall the game seems like a great concept that was executed poorly. Game gets boring fast and gets repetitive. The crafting system is mediocre and hard to figure out. The UI is just really weird to learn as well. Building seems to be ok but not as crazy as they made it look like. Big issue is playing requires you to be connected to a server. Even in single player. So you get the experience ping, lag, and server issues playing alone. Which makes combat a nightmare when hits don't register or enemies Teleport around. The character customization is ridiculous. Open up the game and see people that look like sloth from the Goonies. Took me 20 minutes just to attempt to make someone who actually looks like a human, and it still doesn't. Features are ok, and newer survival games are better. The current state it's in makes it look like it was rushed and made within 6 months, not 3 years. This game should of went another year before being released in EA. A huge plus is the graphics, they really used unreal engine well in that point. It looks amazing (minus character customization) if you have the hardware to run it. I've noticed if you're running rtx 3000 series or lower, you're not going to have a good time with performance. Which with it being EA that should be fixed soon (hopefully).

Overall this game needs more work and hopefully it gets the love it needs to get to that point we've all been waiting for. For those who haven't bought it.

- Pretty game
- Decent building system
- Cool design

Cons:
- Always online. I've refunded it and want to see this requirement removed before I will even decide if I want to buy this at V1.0
- UI needs a lot of work. Lots of it seems like placeholder. An example would be the menus you're constantly shuffling through to build or craft anything. 
- I couldn't build in one of my sessions. Had to restart the game to get it to work, which means going through the intro, logging back into the servers and waiting for the level to load.
- There's not many interesting things to explore. Visually there's cool stuff, but ultimately it's just cosmetic when you get up close. There might be a chest.
- Combat is pretty bad. Animations are clunky and the stamina system needs to be revamped.

I think Nightingale should take a leaf out of Conan Exiles' book, which allows you to play locally as well as multiplayer.
In the meantime, this problem is having too much of an impact. I hope the developers will listen to player's feedbacks and do what's necessary.

Launch state is terrible.

I don't have the connectivity issues some people have, but honestly I like these sorts of games so I can explore. Nightingale feels oversaturated with copy pasted random structures that I can't actually do anything with, and even if I can get past the UI the character models still look awful.

The developers are highly dedicated and took a massive amount of feedback they received before EA release and implemented it. I was surprised at how the visuals received a lot of polish and the optimizations done between the last test and EA release.

I love the way that realm cards work and how you can design a new realm to explore. It's fun to combine major and minor cards to create some realms with unique characteristics. Looking forward to seeing what the developers do moving forward.

I see quite a few negative reviews already being posted. While there are some, very good, constructive negative reviews there are a lot that are written by people that do not understand the game, and the way it is built.

Always Online - Yes, this game has been designed from the ground up to be always online. This is due to the architecture of the game... each realm exists globally to all players. This allows people to invite others to their realms, or allow others to publicly join their realms based on preferred game settings. This also solves the issue of having a multiplayer group playing on different, interconnected realms, at the same time. There are many other global aspects to the design of this game, it was never marketed as an offline experience and as you progress further into Nightingale, it becomes more apparent why this is an online game.

Various claims of being broken - This is an early access title, however many of the issues complained about in negative reviews are occurring because of server load. If a portal does not open, the server was unable to complete the operation at the time you attempted to open it. Log off (not to desktop, just to the character select screen) then load up and try again. I've had to do this twice in 2.5 hours... it happens and will smooth out as the developers work on updates and optimizations.

Not understanding the card/realm system - You learn as you play the game, you start with nothing and have to learn a bout portals and cards in order to progress... follow the quests and you will start to understand how it all works (the information is spoon-fed a bit which I don't love, but it will add onto your knowledge as you play).

Cannot drop items - You cannot drop items right now, I don't know if that will change. However you can convert them to essence which is used to repair equipment. Is that stack of 1000 rocks weighing you down, convert it to essence (which is 0 weight) and keep moving forward. You will learn how to make simple storage bags very soon after the Tutorial finishes, they are cheap and easy to make and will store a decent amount of materials.

Can't split items - Right click on the stack in your inventory and select split (this is not called out in the game and the Devs should mention it somewhere).

No servers outside NA - I'm not surprised about the server locations for the initial EA release. It's difficult to understand how the demand will be distributed over the globe, and how the servers will react to players in the EU and Oceanic regions. With the persistence and connected nature of the game, it may take some time for the developers to come up with a solid multi-region solution. I understand and acknowledge the complaints about this, the only thing we can do is give it time.",1708464301,1708464301,True,3,0,0.565646588802337646,0,True,False,True

The game does not deserve to be knocked down because a few bad experiences here and there i read some of these bad reviews and i haven't had that issue yet its luck of the draw but instead of being understanding its an early access game and like many early access games they are buggy but people jump straight into a negative review because they couldn't load the game up on their 4090.",1708464142,1708464142,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Secondly, the fact that it is based solely on servers is not something I consider positive. The game takes up about 53 GB and, honestly, I would prefer to enjoy it in offline mode. If the servers are under maintenance, if they close or if I am without internet, I cannot play.

This games build is almost exactly the same as the open server test from a few months ago.
A lot of those issues have had been fixed. But as a avid survival game player. The two extra tool bars separate for consumables and tools is completely unnecessary and it only hinders your game-play. And not just that. I love to move my own items within my inventory. Which i can't in here, which is a massive nope. I want to micro manage my inventory.

And of course, the same issue remained such as door animations. Heck nawh. It has no animations! Like c'mon. Get that sh*t settled before releasing a game into 'early access' even though, this game had been in development for quite some time.

The choice of equipment doesn't really do much for you in regards of difficulty, it just gives you a fancier or more rugged outfit. Got to mention it since its rather victorian, there's only civilain-like gear. There's no military centered gear so far i've seen. Same amount of weapons compared to the so called 'older build'. No companion controls, neither no explanation what you are supposed to do with recruits/companions.

And my biggest red flag, online forced gameplay. Its a curse up on the gaming community as of late, and its getting worse. This game could've easily had it offline, yet somehow, they shot themselves in the foot by making it online only. Games really aren't our property anymore. And everything has to be a 'games as a service.'

I want to keep it in my games list, but honestly, this game needs to cook a lot longer then its advertised. The game-play loop needs to be better, and of course, recommend a end game. Such as base defense. Until then, i'll go ahead and refund it. And revisit it at a later date when there's a lot more done to the game.",1708463121,1708463577,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

One of the things I like the most in survival games is character customization and I feel it lacks that. The clothes have no way of having cosmetic items displayed and you're stuck with whatever the game gives you which often results in an awkward looking appearance.

Character customization aside....

The map system is weird.  There did not appear to be any indications on the map where I had built so I had a hard time finding my settlement again. The combat is extremely janky and awkward... The character animations are extremely awkward and janky and overall I feel they're just off. 

Not pulling from chest is a big no. Couldn't figure out how to pick stuff up again. Not being able to upgrade your house materials is a big no. 

Being forced to play online 24-7 is a big no. That is not how valheim and other similar games work. That's not how enshrouded works. Why the hell do I have to play online when playing SINGLE PLAYER!? What happens if the company goes bankrupt and shuts their servers down? I guess I won't be able to play. Big No.

The game is beautiful even on performance and runs well for me. Combat is so far not challenging but still feels responsive and fun and the environment is amazing. The different biomes are all unique with their own life and I can't wait to play with the cards and see what else I can unlock. The bits of lore I've got through really makes me feel like the game has a solid foundation.

Character creation is cute and lets you make a unique character and as a lover of character creation I'm quite impressed.

An example would be the absurd crafting mechanics. There's just way too many different tiers of items and they're poorly organized. The game lacks the mechanics to make the crafting bearable, and even then, it would still take far too much time to craft whatever it is you need.

A game with a world as beautiful as this should not encourage you to spend most of your time in your base hunched over your crafting bench. On top of that, the game is poorly optimized and runs suboptimally even on high-end hardware. The combat feels janky, unpolished, and very basic.

Not an issue in and of itself, really, but the terms and data mining did seem a bit... extra.

As for the gameplay, I actually felt quite confused in some of the menus and sometimes the menus didn't respond (eg. trying to select a new recipe on controller didn't actually move the cursor). Also, the game is mostly advertised (from what I've seen) as Third Person yet that option has to be enabled and is listed as ""experimental"". Seemed odd. I was bouncing between different biomes via the portal system based on the tutorial but wasn't sure how or why I had the cards I did that allowed for such travelling. Plus, when eating berries, there is no animation so I wasn't sure if my character was consuming them or not. Another example of weirdness was when I was crafting the Hunting Knife. I had no indication that it had been crafted so I ended up crafting three blades in total before I noticed my hotbar filling up. I've several hundred hours across many different survival games and this was a first for me.

I was pretty hyped for this for the better part of two years. Playing it now though, I realize I had rose-tinted glasses on. Much of the footage and gameplay you see is of the ""fun stuff"", but very little is shown of the mediocre, draggy gameplay sections.

[h1]Good:[/h1]
+ The game environment looks good, even on low settings
+ It's decently well optimized, so for someone with mid-specs like myself, it runs at about 80-100 FPS
+ Sound effects are crunchy and crisp, and balancing is good
+ So far the voice acting is good. Only interacted with Puck so far though
+ You can use two items at once, right hand and left hand equipment
+ Repairing items in this game is simple, just use essences that you get from salvaging materials/equipment
+ Resource nodes tell you how much tool strength you need to harvest them

[h1]Bad:[/h1]
Oh boy. Here we go:

- Always online. Man this one was disappointing. I hate when games offer no offline mode

- Character creation is insanely deep but oh my god the models are so terrible looking. These are genuinely some of the ugliest models I've laid eyes on, in any game, even including 7 Days to Die. 95% of the hairstyles look kinda uncanny, like the hair has no volume to it and is just a sheet of paper covering your head.

- UI is needlessly complex. I've never struggled this much with a campfire in any survival game ever. Cooking a Healing Salve requires me to ignite the campfire in a separate UI, then go into the crafting UI, then click on the recipe, then click on the bone component, select which bone I want to use, then click on the fibre component, and select which fibre I want to use, then click on the number of crafts I want to make, then click Craft, then wait for all of it to craft. If you read through all of that, you're insane. As are the people who designed it this way.

- UI is somewhat inconsistent. I can Shift+Drag to split stacks one way (into campfire), but not the other way round

- This game uses Valheim's food system, but an even worse version of it. In Valheim, you need to eat to raise your core attributes, but choosing not to eat will not kill you. In this game, you need food to gain attributes, AND not eating will kill you

- Carrying capacity at the start of the game is atrocious. 50kg seems like a lot, when 1 stone block is 1kg, but yeah it's nothing. You'll run out of room real quick

- Building is not smooth at all. You gotta open the build menu, click the dropdown list for the building category you want, then scroll around till you find your component, then double click its icon to pull up the blueprint into the world. It's so many clicks for something that should be so simple. Furthermore, you can't just place something down. You gotta place the blueprint, then add materials to ""finish"" the construction, even if you already have the materials on you.

- I have no idea how to move an incorrectly placed blueprint, and at this point I don't care to find out. I spent a solid 5 minutes figuring out how to move a campfire off the soil, since they said it would get a stability penalty. In the end I just gave up cause highlighting/clicking ""Move"" in the interaction wheel did nothing.

- To be entirely honest, I don't get what the cards/realms systems are for. What it's saying to me right now, is that my builds are all temporary, and I'll have to start from 0 (building-wise) everytime I move realms. I have no idea if this is how it's supposed to work, but I guess I'm not gonna find out anytime soon, since the game has already lost my interest

- I don't understand resting in this game. I put a bedroll under a shelter, and pressed 'E' to short rest, and it refilled some of the blue ""Rest"" bar. It didn't fast forward time, it didn't lock my character while I ""slept"", and since it didn't fill the bar completely I just mashed E until I was fully rested. Is this really how it's supposed to work? That's weird as hell

- You can't drop stuff in this game. Again, I spent like 2 whole minutes trying to figure out how to drop things, only to realize that Extraction was the only way to remove it from my inventory. It's not intuitive at all. Also the game never showed the ""Shift to split stack"" tooltip when dragging the item to extract, so it wasn't clear to me that I could salvage part of a stack. It's another inconsistency, cause the ""Shift to split stack"" tooltip shows up in the campfire UI

[h1]Overall: 4/10[/h1]
Honestly, it's not even that the game is bad. If I'm looking at it in a vacuum, the game is actually fine. However, as someone who plays a ton of survival craft games, yeah I'm not impressed. It's one of those situations where the endgame could be amazing, but I'll never know cause the early game was so disappointing.",1708461839,1708462333,False,95,6,0.652731716632843018,0,True,False,True

The game looks quite similar to REMNANT in that you can change the map by changing cards as well as bosses.

Battle:
I don't know what else to say, it's very basic like running to the enemy just click the left mouse button and use the right mouse button to glide. Change your perspective left or right to dodge.

Crafting interface:
It feels uncomfortable to look at and it takes some time to get used to the game's mechanics.

Crafting buildings or items is a bit absurd in that when you have enough resources, they will automatically be crafted so you don't need to spend time sitting down to complete it, but explain it from the perspective Magic is also good. This is a bit absurd because the main character initially doesn't have the magic to do it.

Graphics:
I still think it's not very sharp, it feels like the game is on low settings even though I've adjusted the graphics to high but it still doesn't look good, the resources are hard to see so I have to run closer to see if it matches the inventory. mine. . (I was also quite surprised because it had a capacity of 60gb)

Just so we're clear, Inflexion collects:
-IP Address, pretty standard
-IP Geolocation?
-All text chat logs tied to your account?
-All voice chat logs tied to your account?
They apparently also keep any data that you associate with your in-game account that they can tie to it, including social media presence, which is just weird.

This is all shared with:
-Storefronts like Steam and EGS
-Companies within their ""group"", with no real explanation as to why your information is shared with these other companies, or why they put group in quotes
-Any company that buys them out
-Law enforcement, which is about the only one I can understand

The most annoying part is you can opt out by just emailing their generic contact email, and you just have to hope they actually opt you out.

Careful not to spend more than 2 hours in character creation and the tutorial. As you can see, I spent a bit of time looking around and it came out to 1.4 hours. It can't be skipped. Would be nice to see if it gets any better but 27 bucks is a lot to gamble from what I saw in the tutorial. Fairly certain a lot of the trailer is just vertical slices.

Combat is atrocious, UI is ugh, crafting menu is inexplicably dumb. I had what I assume is a bug, I died to one of those golden robots in the desert tutorial and when I respawned 4 of them spawned on top of me, just walking. I attacked them and they just kept walking. I also had enemies take off when attacked and run away, only to run out of sight and then randomly return like 2 minutes later.

Also, as an added tidbit, I keep seeing positive reviews with assurances that the game is fixable. Top positive review says it and is a 21% match for being written by an AI. As a college student who has been using ChatGPT to ""assist"" me in writing papers for a while, my barely modified papers still never hit above 5% likeness.",1708460246,1708462089,False,16,3,0.370782852172851563,0,True,False,True

The premise is alluring and the environment/world building is probably some of the best I've seen in recent surv/crafters. However, Nightingale does not respect your time. It, in it's current standing, demands of you constant attention and effort put forth into its crafting aspect. Everything else about it seems to take a backseat. 

For example, most crafting games now a days will either pull resources from your chests when crafting, or offer ways for this mechanic to be introduced if not given to you immediately. There is no such functionality in Nightingale. Combined with the inability to rapidly move items from your chest to inventory or vice versa and having to fight with the unintuitive interface, it compounds the amount of time you already spend fishing through chests and the like. 

Pile on the fact that there's multiple tiers to each item, each crafting station, each drop by an enemy (predator and prey hides are different here), the fact that each item requires multiple components that they themselves also require multiple components, etc. and you can see where you start to sink all of your time at.  

Another example being the basic tier 1 house building. These items such as windows and platforms require multiple resources themselves, wood, fibre and stone, but also require multiples of these individual items for each piece you set down. Building a simple house goes from a 2-5 minute affair to a 20 minute job. 

Because of these issues, you tend to start noticing other problems as you try and break from the monotony of the grind, ie. the combat is lackluster. The initial impact of fighting begins to wade quickly as the game tosses swarms of low level enemies with very basic attack patterns; lunge, swipe, repeat. During my initial couple of hours with the game, this pattern repeated constantly, and from what I hear, it doesn't get any better. 

This game has potential, it's just unfortunate that some design choices are severely hampering what should be an enjoyable trek through alien lands.",1708462004,1708462004,False,22,1,0.568351328372955322,0,True,False,True

From building menus, to movement, to combat, to visuals, to UI, it's just all very very unintuitive, clunky, janky, and often frustrating to maneuver around. There is no simple way to just left clicking to store or move one item at a time, you have to shift drag into menu, then use a slider? Like seriously.

Building bases and crafting is a major part of the game, apparently, but holy hell the agony it is to use the building menu where you have to get out of it every time, and go back into it to select the same wall, foundation, etc to place it then hit esc, then go back into the build menu AGAIN, like why? It's taking 5 steps backwards in the world of survival games to have such, essentially punishing and backwards design elements in the gameplay.

Combat is simply moving around, block when you're about to get hit? But feels very not rewarding or satisfying to hit anything, and most mobs just take it in the face and keep on charging you. That and the animations are very stiff. Ranged combat feels often unresponsive, as hitting my right mouse key to aim, often doesn't aim down sights, and shooting mobs feels like a wet noodle, and reloading? I'm mashing ""R"" key multiple times in order for the game to seemingly decide ""Oh yeah, lets reload!""

This game needs a whole lot of looking over in almost every element of the game before I can even dare recommend it to anyone, let alone my friends.

The developers didn't do themselves much of a favor to release the game this early, despite feedback duing betas and public tests.

While the game has its very own style in terms of aesthetics (depending on personal taste, this can be good or bad), it still feels rather unfinished. Controls feel clunky, POIs in the generated gameworld feel somewhat out of place and often aren't much more than little eye catchers. Enemy AI could need some improvements as well, as they get stuck on terrain quite easily.

Overall, for me personally, given that Enshrouded felt so much more polished, this game is more like your average survival game. While the setting feels somewhat unique and the portal mechanics might be first of its kind in this genre, everything else about this game feels very average and sadly underwhelming.

I believe this game has the potential to be a very fun and exciting game but at the moment it is missing a lot of core mechanics and quality of life that would make it worth playing in the first place.
1. The combat though seems like it has potential consists of enemies that don't have much going on except health bars and lame leaps and auto attacks.
2. Puzzles. The game has ""Unique locations"" that contain puzzles to access upgrades, Bonuses, and Recipes. Sadly, the puzzles are super simple, a 5 year old child could solve them and doesn't feel super engaging.
3. Though the game is forcing you to play online, which itself is an issue since you are yet again at the mercy of unreliable servers, their is no side by side progression through quests of tutorials with any of your 5 other friends you could be playing with.
4. Speaking of tutorials, the tutorial takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on how quickly you catch on to mechanics with limited inventory management and material efficiency, all of which you have to complete before being able to join someone else's world/host one
5. The player limit being 6 for a game that boasts size and versatility is sad and a bit of a let down. The world variety is a grand total of 3 at first and cards aren't varied either which is what would have made this game stand out. The portals and worlds you augment with cards and could change the realm is left stale and boring with its current limitations.
all and all I was very excited leading up to this game. Character creation looked great though is also incomplete. This game will maybe be worth buying in another year.

A letter to the developers:
Obviously I am unaware of the pressure/restraints placed upon you as a team by the forces of capitalism and leaders of the company, that being said, being that you are also the publishers, it would be strange for there to be that much of a disconnect. I think that you should have held this game closer to your chest and maybe released it a little later in production so that there would have been a cleaner and more focused direction in your game. Maybe a longer discussion and better decision making in what you want the content available upon release needed to be had but this game as is, disappointing to say the lease. See you in a year or two and hopefully the game state then will change my mind.

Best of luck, A hopeful yet disappointed fan",1708458965,1708458965,False,722,31,0.76077955961227417,50,True,False,True

I have elected to refund the game for the time being for the following reasons:

1. game progression bugs - I have had to make 2 characters and delete them both and start over again as the quest system has a habit of getting stuck and not progressing you. You get to a realm and with the quest to go to that realm - when you are already there. this is a known issue on the bug zendesk and lots of people are running into it. the log out for 15 min fix doesnt work.

2. the keybinds are a mess. if you want to remap your controls good luck. keys are blindly hard coded and while the game gives you the option to remap - it doesnt actually work.

3. the crafting is...well....tedious. it's has too many steps and the interface is not intuitive.

4. the game worlds seem small..and having just come from Enshrouded the compare here is stark, and not in Nightingale's favor.

maybe when it gets some more polish, a lot more, I will buy again. but for now, with so many good games out there. I choose to move on.",1708458965,1708458965,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ive been watching a lot of streams as well as all of the variety and uniqueness this game has to offer. I am always perplexed by the human need to judge a game that is on DAY ONE, HOUR ONE, of release. This isn't THE DAY BEFORE guyz. Its ok! The devs arent gonna run off with your money!

Early on:

I am loving the uniqueness to the worlds as well as the complexity, but simplicity of the environments. They are fairly small in comparison to other survival type games, but they feel more alive. Generally, you arent running somewhere where there is nothing to run too. 

The crafting system seems extremely unique and complex. Which is something Ive wanted in a survival game for some time. I also love the fact that you have complete freedom when designing your weapons of choice.

The card system, which links in to the procedural game play, seems like a lot of fun. Unlike NMS, the worlds do offer a lot of activity (Compared to NMS on day one of release of course).

I am looking forward to being able to play with friends, and compared to Enshrouded (in a coop sense only) I am extremely pleased to see that my progress, and instances, are character based and not server based. Meaning I can progress at my own pace as time goes by, and my friends and I can share ""home instances"" if we choose too, then team up for coop gameplay. Nicely done.

This will be an ongoing review, but very early on, the game seems to have a lot of MEAT to it. And its nice to see a game that isn't AI generating it's early trailers (Hey there The Day Before KEKW).

Each to their own, but I am looking forward to exploring all the mechanics and content that Nightingale has to offer! GL HF Realmwalkers!

It's also gorgeous, and it is running well on a 3070Ti. I would love to see even better performance, and I suspect the actual content available at this stage is a little thin, but I think for the price it'll be a super fun game to watch grow.

It's not often that a game manages to strike such a perfect balance between compelling storytelling and engaging gameplay, but ""The Nightingale"" accomplishes this with finesse.

First and foremost, the narrative is an absolute triumph. Set in a beautifully crafted fantasy world, the story follows the journey of a young protagonist on a quest to save their kingdom from an ancient evil. The characters are expertly developed, each with their own motivations and arcs that kept me invested throughout. The writing is top-notch, filled with poignant moments of emotion and intrigue that kept me eagerly anticipating what would happen next.

But what truly sets ""The Nightingale"" apart is its gameplay. The mechanics are polished to perfection, offering a seamless blend of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. Whether I was navigating treacherous dungeons or engaging in intense boss battles, every moment felt exhilarating and satisfying. The level design is exceptional, offering a perfect balance of challenge and reward that kept me hooked from start to finish.

Visually, ""The Nightingale"" is a feast for the eyes. The art style is stunning, with vibrant colors and intricate details that bring the world to life in breathtaking fashion. From lush forests to sprawling cities, each environment is beautifully realized, making exploration a joy in itself.

Accompanying the visuals is a breathtaking soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's atmosphere. The music is hauntingly beautiful, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments and immersing me even further into the world of ""The Nightingale.""

In conclusion, ""The Nightingale"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. With its gripping story, polished gameplay, and stunning presentation, it stands as a shining example of what video games can achieve as an art form. Whether you're a fan of action-adventure games or simply appreciate a well-crafted story, ""The Nightingale"" is an absolute must-play. Highly recommended without hesitation.

Version Nikola Tesla world/inspired by Andrew Ryan

This game does not include Big Daddies but realm creatures instead...

Explore realms created by the Fae, set in the Victorian era. New Golden Age of Humanity. We thought almost equal to the Fae, which was a mistake, cast out by the Fae. Humanity left in darkness when the Fae abandoned us, cursed by the Pale & shattered Earth. Flee via realm gates. Reach last bastion of Humanity. Remnants of humanity, form Nightingale, holds back the Pale, last refuge. Nightingale brightest must learn mysteries of the realms & the Fae magic. Discover secrets & forge brighter future for tomorrow.

While fleeing via Earth gate you must fight to survive & thrive new uncharted realms. Explore maze of labyrinths realms; find a way to Nightingale City.  Will you be the saviour Realm Walker?

Be mindful of the Fae you encounter Summer & Winter Court…

''The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great, and he repented he had made man on the Earth. Rain. 40 days and 40 nights of the stuff and He left not a thing that walked alive. You see, my friends. Even God is entitled to a do-over, and what is Columbia, but another ark for another time?”- Zachary Hale Comstock

“What one man calls God, another calls the laws of physics.” - Nikola Tesla

“I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Nightingale, a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, Where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Nightingale can become your city as well.” - Andrew Ryan

“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” - Nikola Tesla

Inspired by Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell
