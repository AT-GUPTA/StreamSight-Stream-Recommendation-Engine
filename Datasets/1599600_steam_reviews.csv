Your goal is to start a restaurant with a limited menu, improving your setup after each successful day, overcoming increasing demand from guests and the need to make more complicated and various menus. You need to distribute chores of cooking food, serving dishes, dishwashing and cleaning.
It's a good light-hearted game about managing your restaurant and increasing demand for dishes and amount of guests.
Considering it has also a Remote Play Together, you can have 1 copy for the entire party, which makes it easier to gather - for me, I'd hardly lure people into trying it at first glance if each of us had to buy it.

I'm sick of developers randomizing a couple elements in their game and slapping a shiny ""roguelike"" or ""roguelite"" tag on it.  Unlike games with procedural generation and true rogue elements, this game gets old very fast as each run feels extremely similar to the last.

Each run starts with choices: floorplan and recipe. Each successful run is at least 15 days and before each day, you can change where the furniture is placed. Furniture placement is important because depending on which cards you pick after certain days, you need to rethink your flow of cooking.

PlateUp! can be played alone with certain recipes, but friends are needed for more complex recipes. Failed runs end abruptly because of not practicing a new recipe variant or making a mistake with furniture placement.

Even though I am not into games where I can lose progress just because of small mistakes, PlateUp! unlocks plenty of new things to try after each run.

Pros:
- You have to plan out every day and the stuff you get to improve your kitchen is random.  Upgrades are totally random.  You don't know if you are going to get the dishwasher you want or a useless upgraded sink.  You can never rely on getting the automation stuff you need.  
- Coop is a blast.
- Different food types keep the game interesting.

Cons:
- It isn't clear to me how you get all the food types.
- The restaurant layouts are just awful.  The areas where customers eat are usually tiny, then you have giant prep areas with 5 different useless rooms.  What are you thinking?  Give us more eating area and LESS kitchen useless room areas.  Most of the space is useless in the dev made areas.  Have you been inside of a restaurant before?
- Rerolls for blueprints.  Automating your restaurant requires you to pretty much have everything up front.  Do not rely on fate to give you what you want.  Enjoy another dining room table or useless mixer.

Anyway.  This game is a nice distraction, could never be my main game.  I enjoy the coop for a quick 15 round fun session or a turbo session.",1705167958,1705167958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has a lot of potential, it's not very often you see games like this. Since most developers are greedy, lifeless, and boring.
This game has a lot of good dishes to expand upon. My one problem is, some of the dishes are kinda unpolished or unfinished, in my opinion.
The pizza dish only has 2 extra pizzas you can make.
Either cheese, (regular) onion, or mushroom. Not even pepperoni??? Or even sausage?? We should have more than 2 extra types of pizza for a game that came out more than a year ago. Even the coffee feels more diverse than the pizza.
I really really hope they expand upon their dishes more instead of focusing on the bogus holiday event horse crap, that only gives you temporary clothing that is immediately deleted after the holiday.
If it's a singular indie dev that's respectable.
But still, get your priorities straight, we don't want limited time holiday clothes.
We want fully fledged out dishes.
But this is still a very fun party game for the relatives in the end. Even if the experience isn't all there yet.
If you're on the fence about this game, get it with golfie in the bundle.
If you want to read my review about that game just check my account.
This game is very worth the 20 bucks off sale, even though I got it on sale for 10 dollars and 50 cents, which included Golfie in that deal.",1704226993,1704227800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Grinding to unlock more restaurant layouts and foods provides a needed sense of satisfaction since (as a roguelike) everything inevitably ends in failure. (Technically surviving to day 15 is a ""win"", but you keep playing in overtime rounds to see how far you can go) 

Late stage gameplay involves trying to find ways to automate everything with conveyor belts and automated mixers and the like. It's frustrating, frantic, and (mostly) a joy to play when things are going well.

She was never a gamer, but now she doesn't want to do anything but play this game anymore and it's too much for me. There's so much more to life but she won't hear of it. She only leaves the house for work and appointments now. The other day I noticed she was staring out the window, motionless, not making a sound. I asked her what she was so enthralled about and she replied ""I need the copying desk to make more conveyors, otherwise the combiner is useless."" In the morning I asked how she slept and she said she dreamt of new strategies for her next solo run, like starting with a prepping station and upgraded sink. She came home from work and began telling me about all the PlateUp research she had done on her commute. First she took over my Steam account, now she's made her own so she can play endlessly on the brand new workstation I built for her. I went for a motorcycle ride with my friend and she didn't realize I was gone for 3 hours. When I came home, she told me she almost completed Day 15 on a solo run and would've won if it weren't for the terrible blueprint drops. We are moving overseas soon but I fear on moving day, she's going to remain glued to this game while our entire home gets packed away. By the time she snaps out of this enchantment, it will be too late.

There's a dark kind of magic in this game and it has locked her soul in the overnight freezer.

Send help.

Plate Up! is a delightful gaming experience that combines strategy with culinary creativity. As a marine policy officer, I appreciate the importance of precision and planning, and this game certainly delivers on both fronts.

The game's mechanics are easy to grasp, making it accessible for players of all levels. However, it's the depth of strategy and decision-making that truly shines. Much like policy development, Plate Up! requires you to think several steps ahead, whether you're crafting new recipes or managing your virtual restaurant.

The graphics are vibrant and appealing, adding to the overall enjoyment. As someone who enjoys discussing sports, I appreciate the competitive aspect of the game, as you can compete with friends or other players online.

In conclusion, [b]Plate Up![/b] is a well-rounded game that offers both entertainment and a chance to exercise your strategic thinking skills. It's a winning recipe for a great gaming experience.",1701283995,1701283995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although the manual skill cap is pretty high, it is hard to get much further than day 15 without automation. Unless you put the time in to learn how to automate a dish it can be hard to grasp what you need let alone prioritize or budget for it.

overall the design of the game is extremely cute and charming, the animation is perfectly stupid looking, the sounds and rush you feel while playing make this game so compelling. i would say this game is probably more fun for people trying to reach a goal than it is a ""chill"" game. it's really easy to immerse yourself into it when you get focused, to the point that you don't even realize how much time has passed.

I really wanted to like Overcooked but it was way too masochistic and dependant on playing with other people (which we all know can be a hassle sometimes) but I really like the cooking aspect of it so when I saw a youple of streams of PlateUp! I was intrigued to say the least.

I finally jumped the gun and bought it, started trying it out in singleplayer before starting the endeavour of convincing friends to try it with me (which went way easier than I thought due to supporting Remote Play) and suddenly 9 hrs had gone by.

This game has no right being so fun in singleplayer and it's one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played. The roguelike aspect of it (and the ng+ style of franchising) is really well done - not too saturated and everything feels like it really has a purpose, especially after a few playthroughs whn you realise that the Mop is lowkey one of the best items in the game.

The first weekend I bought this I played about 26 hrs in total. I can not recommend it enough and if it is ever on sale - buy it immediately.",1700735651,1700735651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the gameplay. I love the puzzle aspect of how to set up your restaurant in a efficient way and try to balance it with the constant and random challenges thrown your way by the game. The rougelike aspect of the challenges every new restaurant and day that you tackle is fun. It may get tiresome after playing a run or two. But after I stop playing it and resting a bit, I find myself wanting to tackle another run because I found myself thinking of a more optimum I could have done it. I did dock a point because I wish there was like a creative mode where I could just go crazy with all the possible appliances and upgrades to see how they work. But that is my main gripe. Does not take away from the awesome game that PlateUp is. My daughter loves playing with me locally.

VISUALS: 8/10
It is a cute, less detailed, blob-like person, serving cute, generic, blob-like customers, while using kitchen and serving tools. It won't win best graphics or anything like that, but it works. I also love the seasonal updates that add a little more personality to my blob-like restaurant crew.

OVERALL: 8/10
I love this game. Losing a run just gets you into thinking how you can make the next run better. You can quit a run midway and continue later on, but overall, the back and forth between losing, thinking, creating a new run, works in the aspect of the game. The hilarious idea that losing means, you close down your restaurant and starting a new run means starting a new restaurant is hilarious to think it happening in the real world just so easily, but it works overall for the theme and pace of the game. It is like, well, i screwed up, goodbye restaurant. Onto the next one. The season updates are a cute and simple addition as well.

There's automation to help you deal with things. Meals become more complex or customer numbers get incredibly high and you have to find a way to contend with that.

The game was great at launch, it was pretty fun and getting updates at a decent rate.

But after awhile the updates started to become few and far between with alot of them just being garbage and most updates just broke multiplayer for people and some still cannot play multiplayer without issues.

The roguelike element of this game really isn't all that great and the replayability is lacking.  What I mean is there is little to no variance between runs,  A run basically boils down to: Did I get X appliance?  Did I avoid the bad cards which are complete RNG?  Will my layout work?  Did I get early copy/blueprint/discount desks?   If any of these are no then you are more than likely just gonna struggle and have a bad time which is no fun.

The only good building layouts come from a website that you can make your own in which is really weird that this is STILL not implemented into the game.

The card system is quite garbage imho because there are so many cards in the game that will literally just game over you and you just have to accept it.  There is alot of recipes that a sane person would never accept such as soups because they require too much for how little they give.

The only saving grace for this game for me is mods which have had alot of drama revolving around kitchenlib with the creator having backdoor access to anyones game at any time and the devs didn't really seem to care that someone could literally come into your game without permission and do whatever they wanted to it.  ""We are not responsible for the content of mods, and players are downloading mods at their own risk."" Despite the fact nearly every mod on the workshop relies on kitchenlib, but the devs response to all this was ""We are not responsible for the content of mods, and players are downloading mods at their own risk.""

The game literally does not get significant updates or meaningful ones anymore and this has been going on for almost a year.

There is alot of things they can add to the game but probably will never like a drive through which was talked about a long time ago but never happened.

Did I get my moneys worth? Sure, but I still cannot recommend it because it feels like the game will never receive meaningful updates and the only things that get posted are ""Plate Up is on sale"", and of course the drama that you can google ""plate up kitchenlib drama"" and will find any additional information you would want to know.",1697500360,1697500360,False,0,0,0.449826985597610474,0,True,False,False

This is a great game, it is relaxed at the start but progressively gets more complex as the game goes on. 

The nice thing about this game is the multiplayer, if your friends all have the game perfect, if not then you can use steam remote play and provided all your friends have stable internet and a controller only the host needs to own the game. 

I bought this game at launch and have a blast everytime with it, the twitch integration is nice but could use some refining and more things to do. i mean if chat could change a customers order or remove something from a counter that would be cool and add to the hysteria of late game setups.

A year ago I bought this game, because I thought it looked fun.

It is fun. But I have no idea why.

[h3] Plate Up: The Survival Horror Game [/h3]

Having worked in restaurants, this game evokes the terror of missing an order, of moving too slow, of making even the tiniest fraction of a mistake and the whole world burning around you.

This isn't actually what it's like in a restaurant, customers are rarely so ruthless as they are in this game. But that's what you're afraid of. This game recreates that fear perfectly.

[h3] Plate Up: Tower Defence [/h3]

They come in the day. A steady trickle that grows into a dreadful yellow tide that threaten to take everything from you.

They are weak to different weapons, and the combination only becomes harder as the game goes on.

During the night, you build your defences.

[h3] Plate Up: Factory [/h3]

In order to have everything you need to survive, you start automating your base. Grabbers constantly shift food and plates to wherever you can most easily make use of them. Mixers chop and knead, plates get rinsed by themselves, you build an empire of machines to do everything you could possibly imagine.

But it's never enough. Your machines grow ever more complicated and yet... there is always more to do. Too much.

[h3] Plate Up: The Roguelike [/h3]

Then you fail. If only you were a little bit faster. A little bit more clever, maybe.

Oh, well. Too bad. Time to go again.

You know I didn't actually think that would work. But if it did, I [b]had[/b] to know. Too bad. Let's try again.

Suddenly you find your stride. You can do this. You can go FOREVER!

Oh well, I lost. Time to go again.

[h2] Plate Up! [/h2]

Plate Up is a simple game. You can do everything with 2 buttons.

It's a bit fiddly at first, but you quickly start getting good with the controls. The improvement pace is massive.

Then you start reading a bit, in between the hectic days. You see the blueprints lying around you, and you wonder...

""What if I put that there? Or maybe here? Then I could... Oh, but that wouldn't work... would that work?""

This is a game which is extremely simple to play, easy to learn, with an enormous depth to master. And once you have mastered it, you can rope in your friends and show off.

But if you've read this far, you deserve a little prize. A lesson, from me to you.

You do not lose by making mistakes. You can make loads of mistakes.

You lose when you panic. If you don't panic, you won't lose.

And if you do lose, then you're in a sufficiently calm mood to try again.

That's why this game is so fun and addictive.",1694621546,1694621546,True,104,24,0.88457411527633667,2,True,False,False

I've been playing with my wife the entire time, and while we had some really great runs, three out of four were usually tedious and frustrating. That's also the reason why I thumb it down (would have chosen ""neutral"" if it was possible).

My main gripe is how appliances (the parts to build your kitchen with) are obtained. What you get each round is randomized, but there are several game mechanics that can be used to improve the odds for getting the appliances you need. This has gotten way out of hand in my opinion. It's no fun at all building up the ""Research and Duplicate Area"" in your kitchen every run.
It can also lead to very frustrating situations when you get a rare appliance you need (e.g. the Conveyor Belt), but you don't have the Duplicate Desk or a second Blueprint Cabinet yet, so you have to ditch it. And of course there are also runs where the RNG simply won't give you an essential appliance.

Then there's the ""hardcore nature"" of the game. One unhappy customer ends the whole run. While I actually like a challenge in games, they've overdone it in this one. You can have a perfectly running kitchen but one simple mistake (by anyone of the players) can end the whole run.
Example: A group of four customers order salads. Depending on your ""Restaurant Cards"" (more on that later) they can order salad with any combination of the following toppings: Tomatoes, onions, olives. As soon as you serve the first salad, you'll only have a few seconds to serve the other three for that group. The toppings are not actually listed anywhere (like in Overcooked), but you'll have to identify them from the icon over their heads. If you place a wrong salad (let's say with missing olives) on the table, they will not actively refuse it, but you won't be able to add another dish on the table. By the time you realize this, you basically ran out of time and the run is lost.

I mentioned Restaurant Cards earlier. These are modifiers that are applied to your restaurant every few rounds. Players can always choose one out of two random cards. While these cards are a fantastic idea and often create fun challenges, they can be absolutely brutal and unpredictable. E.g. when you choose to open a Cafè, you can get two restaurant cards that add other main dishes, e.g. Pizza and Dumplings. Either of these cards will completely transform your restaurant, as customers will now [b]always[/b] order  Pizza/Dumplings and [b]occasionally[/b] want a coffee for dessert. Some cards are literally broken, because they overwrite your previous menu (e.g. Brownies/Cupcakes overwrite Cakes).

In my opinion these major problems could have been easily solved. Instead of the whole, luck-based ""Appliances Blueprint Meta Game"" players should be able to buy appliances via a shop system (with random discounts to keep things fresh).
And instead of one unhappy customer ending the run instantly, it should cost a penalty and the run should be over when the restaurant is bankrupt. The penalty could still be tough and quickly end runs, but at least players would have more control over it (and the ""Extra Life"" appliance is stupid).

Many others minor annoyances in the game have been addressed by modders already, so I highly recommend browsing the Steam Workshop for quality of life improvements if you want to give the game a try.",1693473109,1693473253,False,9,0,0.604399621486663818,0,True,False,False

I've played the game for awhile and I love how much it distances itself from other games similar to itself by shifting the focus from a rage cooking game to a more fun collaborative and sometimes puzzling game. There are so many options between the resteraunt blueprints to the foods you can cook! You also can design your resteraunt to better suit you and your groups needs. And I love that you can even play alone when you can't with others. The game provides simple to follow instructions for all aspecs of the game, making it very user friendly, even to people who aren't that good at gaming. It has nice visuals and plays very smoothly, even on my computer that can't even load a flat Minecraft world!!

The pros;
Great simple game.
Has twitch Integration.
Has a bit of multiplayer.
Is Fun to play when it doesn't glitch.

The bad:
The customers patience's is extremely short.
not enough cash to make it past a certain day solo.
without a mod like WeMod.

Your restaurant is on fire:
Most of the maps stink for playing a long game. Can't make an efficient solo restaurant
Multiplayer burns down quite alot.
They have almost no medium to big maps for creating fun restaurant layout to play.
Way too many walls and doors for a restaurant.
Waaaaay to many mini game restaurants with extremely small spaces
No way to recycle and upgrade gear you have bought and placed( without a mod)
Hit end game and want to make a cool franchise from all the unlocked game cards. nope. It is random as can be.",1692349250,1692349250,True,1,0,0.439763724803924561,0,True,False,False

You pick a floor plan and a menu item and advance through rounds of gradually increasing difficulty, in hopes of being able to ascend to five stars after 15 rounds and ""franchise"" said restaurant. 

In roguelike fashion you are able to upgrade your restaurant with some element of randomness involved, round after round. While you pick a predetermined floorplan, you can place dining tables, counters, stoves, ingredients etc however you please so it does demand some level of ""tactics"" in a way that kind of reminds me of tower defense games. Even though you  have just one menu item, you can opt into challenge cards that add things like desserts, sides, or additional ingredients (e.g. onions and olives to salad) which make the game more complex as the playthrough progresses further. You also can add certain items that elevate the casual/upscale-ness of your restaurant, unlocking perks that will make your playthrough easier (for example, increased patience in the dining room). There is a really chill ""coffee mode"" you can unlock eventually which requires basically no food prep and takes all the challenge out of the game but is a nice whimsical way to pass the time if say, your partner can't handle putting together a recipe. 

I've only ever played this game with a patient person who was a good teammate so I'm not gonna say this game is like, friendship ruining or anything, but certainly it has the potential to cause some mayhem as everyone needs to be on their toes. Nobody ever has a designated responsibility (everyone has access to the kitchen and dining room at all times) so you have to be good at delegating and talking about what each person's jobs are at any given moment to be able to keep up with the rush. 

Even losing doesn't feel so bad because you still earn experience towards more rewards and menu items, and plus you can kind of cheese it by pausing and quitting to lobby whenever you realize you're in a losing situation. You can have multiple different restaurant saves concurrently as well. 

I do wish that the game had more in the way of animations, for example washing dishes, cleaning spills and doing literally anything food prep wise has the same weird animation. Minor criticism but it is there. 

In the end I think that this is a really excellent restaurant sim game and the roguelike elements make it infinitely replayable, as opposed to Overcooked which comes to an end once you've finished each level. It certainly has a lot more staying power and potential so I hope this game is a success.",1691751153,1691751153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About game?
---------------
Teamwork and Communication is the key to beat this game. I love the simple but funny and lovely graphics and the very simple core concept behind it. One of my favorites and will be a favorite for a long time.

What do you have to do in the game?
----------------------------------------
You have to cook, serve, clean and manage whole restaurant with your friends. And it's quite challenging but easy when mastered. Run your restaurant while completing levels without dropping a patience of a single customer if you know what I mean.

Final thoughts?
-----------------

Pro: Great gameplay mechanics
Pro: Very similar to overcooked (frantic/challenging/co-op)

Con: Progression system.  (more below)
Con: Sudden death/failure  (lose one customer, lose the restaurant and restart from scratch)

The progression system is what ultimately made my wife put down the controller and suggest we just go back to overcooked 2 and do some DLC.  Her words were: ""We just have to restart the whole restaurant every time we play and don't ever really win"".

Now before anyone misunderstands, I do know the progression mechanics in this game.  You get access to new things and new recipes/machines/equipment based on doing well in previous runs.  The problem is how this is presented to you.  It literally feels like hitting restart on a level you've already beaten, except every time you get one new thing added to the next run..... it feels tedious.  

Now overcooked and similar games basically did the same thing, except for one big difference.  There was this big map with different places all over it and when you beat one, it had a big star on it saying COMPLETE.  Honestly I think if there was some map or progress legend showing what you've accomplished so far and where you were going it might have made a difference to keep us interested.

*Again, I'm still reviewing this as ""recommend"" because the game is so well done.  It just was not a good fit for us.  Not asking for a refund because I never do unless a game is broken or buggy.",1691332948,1691332948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you enjoy roguelite games but want something more colorful and tasty? Then you should try Plate Up, the game that mixes both genres in a delicious and chaotic way. Plate Up is a game where you can create your own restaurant, from the menu to the decor, and serve your hungry customers. You can play by yourself or with your friends, as you cook, serve, and clean up. The game is full of options and surprises, as you can choose from different cuisines, appliances, recipes, and upgrades. You can also discover new places and secrets as you play.

But be careful, Plate Up is not a piece of cake. You have to manage your time and money. If you mess up or disappoint your customers, you might lose everything and have to start over. The game is hard and demanding, but also fair and rewarding. You have to learn from your mistakes and improve your skills. You also have to work well with your team, if you have one. The game can be stressful at times, but also fun and satisfying.

Plate Up has a cute and simple art style that suits the game perfectly. The graphics are colorful and charming, and the animations are smooth and expressive. The sound effects and music are also great, and match the mood and theme of the game. The game has a lot of humor and personality, especially when you interact with cats or streamers. The game also has Twitch integration, which allows you to play with your audience.

Plate Up is a game that will make you hungry for more. It is a game that combines cooking and roguelite in a unique and original way. It is a game that offers a lot of replay value and fun. It is also a game that you can play with your friends or family, as long as you don’t mind some friendly fire and cooperation.

You start by picking your starting menu and the floorplan for your restaurant. The goal is to serve all customers before their patience runs out. As the days go on, you collect money which you use to buy new appliances and upgrade your restaurant.  You also pick challenge cards which modify your run by adding a new hindrance or expanding your menu.  If a single customer leaves unhappy your run is over (barring some rare continue items).

Making it far relies on both mechanical ability to quickly cook and serve customers, but also strategy in picking the right cards and spending your money on the right upgrades to handle the situation.  You fully design your kitchen outside of the actual floor plan, deciding where appliances go and where customers sit, meaning it's up to you to find the most optimal ways to do things.  This is usually a mix of both manually doing things and automation.  Eventually you can automate it so a meal entirely prepares itself.  It's even possible to fully automation preparation and serving.  Eventually though, the lack of space will catch up to you and oftentimes it's not really about automating everything but rather smartly deciding what to automate and what to do manually, as space is limited and automation always takes up more space than manual actions.

The 'end game' consists of a few different goals. 
 
The first is franchising, where you simply make it to day 15.  Once there you can quit immediately or keep playing, and after the run ends you can take your starting menu plus 3 of the cards you picked during the run and start a new run with those cards, plus a special franchise bonus card. You can then attempt to Franchise that run, adding more cards and franchise cards until you eventually fail to hit day 15 during your run.  Each time you franchise you go up one 'tier' so the goal is to climb to the highest tier possible by chaining franchises, with it getting increasing difficult.

The next is playing for Overtime, which happens once you get past day 15.  This is simply trying to get as far as you can within a single run.  This is usually about automation and effectively using space as your restaurant fills up and your menu continually expands.

Then there is speedrunning, where you simply attempt to complete day 15 on a specific seed in the shortest amount of time.

And then finally there is Turbo mode, which ratchets up the difficulty by adding a challenge card every day along with a massive increase in customer numbers.

The game has been out for a year now and the developers are still releasing new content, entirely for free.  No DRM, No micro transactions, Not even paid cosmetics.  Just quality update after update, entirely for free.

There is a ton of content between the different menus as well as a bunch of seasonal challenge modes, but if you ever get bored of that, the workshop support means you can then just go download some user made menus and try those.

This game is a rare gem that does everything right. If I had to think of a negative it would be the RNG inherent in the card choices.  Not all cards are the same in difficulty, which is by design.  Some are good to get and some are quite bad, and if you are unlucky you can be forced into a choice between two run ending cards.  But even this is only a minor blemish in what is otherwise a fantastic game.

And failure is punished as hard as always, total reset after the first three easy days have passed. Your upgrades are of course randomized so sometimes you just get shit ones. That can make it feel pretty punishing at times. 

But a bigger flaw is the progression, as you level up your save you unlock new types and sizes of restaurants. For the majority of my hours we've been locked to the smallest space possible. Which makes it more a game of tetris and trying to fit everything in the map at all than some sort of smart optimization of your kitchens.

But with those things out of the way, it's a banger of a game. The graphics are fun and the color blind mode helps those who find some UI things harder to read. Controls are intuitive and most fuck ups were 100% our fault. I played it exclusively as a coop game with 2-3 friends at once. 

It picked up after we unlocked medium sized restaurants, they just work better with a 4 man team. Automation is a neat thing to play with long term and the game really rewards exploiting the hell out of it. So I gotta give this a solid thumbs up.

Lastly compared the Overcooked I enjoyed this more. Overcooked just throws as much random crap it can at you till you buckle. Pretty much everytime I lost Plate Up! it felt like my own fault. Overextended, guessed wrong, got cocky etc. There's much more control over how hard you make it for yourself but it's not without chaos.

1) The game desperately needs better client-side checking for multiplayer. Those milliseconds of delay between pressing a button and an action going off, facing the right thing only to have the wrong thing grabbed when you are not the host are the difference between succeeding and failing a day.

2) The game needs to provide more automation tools more often. There's no excuse why you can get a 5 star restaurant without ever seeing a single conveyor. It's impossible for me to believe anyone is able to create fully automated kitchens without cheating with how sparse the automation tools are, unless it's all locked away behind levels.

3) There needs to be some better logic to the choice cards between days. Too often I am presented with two choices where both are guaranteed failures.

4) Some recipes are just far too complicated for a game where you're battling against multiple failure timers. I'm looking at you, Apple Salad. They may be fine on their own, but when paired with one or more other menu items, it's a death sentence. 

5) Please add some more costume items. The hats are great and there's a large variety of them, but there are only 3 choices for your primary attire, which is boring.

6) The research desk needs to have its appearance rate increased. If the required strategy is to put your first bench in the blueprints cabinet to get a second one early on so you can actually get decent automation, then people don't have a choice.

7) Some of the restaurant designs are nonsensical. Thankfully there are a variety of choices with more getting unlocked as you level up. 

8) Tone down the mess making slightly. There's currently more mess than food. People are smuggling in their own food just to throw on the floors. I think some customers are straight up exploding when they take a bite of food.",1690657191,1690657191,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My first though was it is a clone of overcooked, but its not! This game has worse graphics, but different mechanics and strategies. So its just similar, but not the same at all. 

Controls are not comfortable at all, but fortunately, you can build your own. 
Many mechanics are not clear at all, googling is helping here.
Different ways to cook, cards to choose from and upgrades make you stay more and more. The game itself is very different on every run. 
Loosing is a way of upgrading, so you might feel a bit conflicted but then just get used to it. 
Difficulty depends on your coop level and/or cards you choose. I finished many levels solo and it was quite relaxing.

StarFluxGames (head modder [literally making the library multiple mods list as dependencies] and beta tester) created a mod to secretly join games and troll people. Even the mods who didn't use KitchenLib (or the ones who removed it, like some of Milo's mods), still point to the Discord server StarFlux owns/admins for support.

Modders who create backdoors should not be verbally(textually?) fellated in public by PlateUp! staff and allowed to continue their assault on the gaming public, yet this is exactly what has happened: https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gkfgu/addressing_concerns_regarding_the_kitchenlib_mod/

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gpt3c/monica_has_been_in_talks_with_kitchenlib/ https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14gnq19/psa_mods_created_by_starfluxgames/ https://imgur.com/xAfF2bw https://www.reddit.com/user/missmonicaplays

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/14h0qmj/when_can_the_community_expect_an_apology_from/

MissMonica has repeatedly lied to me, the PlateUp! community, Steam, and the greater whole. I've attempted to request a refund from Steam, yet the PlateUp! devs have not allowed this. It astounds me that the executive team behind ""It's happening"" (lack of normal English capitalization entirely theirs) would continue to support verifiable lies in their media presence and an affirmative rejection of consumers who feel violated by the laizzez-faire attitude given to their game sessions by Monica, especially considering the violator of assumed privacy has such a personal connection between the primary instigator and aggravating party (StarFluxGames) and the employee covering up the clearly unethical (and even, illegal in several countries) collusion, of which she was made aware previously (and in public) on multiple occasions. I request a full, qualified response from someone with an actual leadership role from ""Its happening"" (lack of capitalization entirely theirs) or Yogcast, since PlateUp! seems to have no firm contacts outside their compromised Discord.

MissMonica is on record for not caring, and even in one instance, finding humor in breaching others' privacy. With her personal ties to StarFlux and the repeated violations of trust from both of them, it astounds me that they are allowed to have this amount of influence in the modding community, this subreddit, and this company.

""🍽️ Plateup: Cooking Chaos at its Finest! 🍳🔥""

Plateup has taken over my gaming menu and left me hungry for more! 🍽️🎮 This addictive game has transformed my kitchen into a well-oiled machine, where efficiency is the secret ingredient to success. The satisfaction of improving my culinary skills with each round is absolutely mouthwatering!

What sets Plateup apart is the ability to automate the entire kitchen. It's like having a team of culinary virtuosos working in perfect harmony. 🤖👩‍🍳 With my partner in crime, ThatGuyRyan, we've spent over 100 hours concocting the ultimate recipes for success. The joy of watching our kitchen operate like a well-choreographed dance is truly exhilarating!

But let me tell you, the real flavor explosion happens when we unleash our inner culinary tyrants and refuse to let customers leave! 🙅‍♂️🗣️ The rush of adrenaline as we juggle multiple orders, shouting commands and keeping everyone entertained, is an absolute blast! It's all part of the hilarious chaos that makes Plateup so irresistible.

If you're craving a fun-filled gaming experience that leaves you shouting for joy, look no further than Plateup. 🎉🍳 I highly recommend it to all aspiring virtual chefs and those seeking a taste of high-energy entertainment. Get ready to have your kitchen skills put to the test and leave your customers begging for more!

So, put on your chef's hat, grab your spatula, and dive into the culinary mayhem of Plateup! 🎮👨‍🍳🔥""

If you're buying it for single-player or local multiplayer, go ahead. If you're hoping to play it with your friends, make sure to test it within the refund period, for it will not get better (but also may get worse even if it did work fine at first).

The game's netcode is a classic client-server model. The person hosting the lobby is the authority and decide what's going on. The catch is that the only thing the client decides is their movement - every action happens only when the server says it did, including highlighting tiles to interact with.

The result is what can be seen as a delay between you approaching a tile and a tile actually highlighting. Pressing a grab/interact button any earlier will result with you doing so with the tile that's currently highlighted, possibly a few meters away.

This can look mild in some cases and [url=https://imgur.com/4KmMhAz]absolutely unplayable[/url] in others. The game can work fine one day and the next day act like one of you is on the moon (or how else do you end up with input latency of over a second). Heck, you might give up on trying to make it work, play some other P2P game for a while (which will work completely fine, surely enough), come back to PlateUp, and it'll lag visibly more/less. I have precisely one friend that the game almost always works well with, which isn't even the closest one geographically. I have a wired optical fibre connection, as do most of my friends. There's nothing left to improve in the setup.

I have no better way of describing the response to this issue than ""gaslighting"". Search ""lag"" on the game's Discord and you'll see over and over how someone comes in to ask why the game misbehaves and is told by a moderator that it's probably their network. Some people persist that this doesn't look like a ""their network"" thing when every other game works fine, and are told to open a support ticket, where they will be told to do a whole ritual (get a static IP! Uninstall your VPNs! Fiddle with Steam settings until something happens!) and the ticket will be promptly deleted afterwards.

Netcode is [url=https://yal.cc/works/]one of the things[/url] that I do for a living. At one point I opened a ticket with a much more detailed description of this issue and usual mitigations, was told that it'll be looked at, and the ticket silently vanished. A few months later I asked where that went and was told that [url=https://imgur.com/fgNujJQ]""at this time there are no plans to fix this specific issue""[/url]. I could spend time making a mod that addresses this by rewriting the game's netcode through Harmony, but that's a very high-effort method of doing someone's job, so it is much easier to move on to other games.

It is what it is.

[h1]Original review follows:[/h1]

A wonderful restaurant management game with procedural generation.

There's a lot of space for optimization and gamble - there are both generated and seeded locations, menu types, appliance blueprints (which you get every day and can reroll/store/upgrade/...), modifier cards (you pick one of two every 3 days), decoration types (which give various bonuses).

There's a whole range of appliances for automation (mixers, conveyor belts, combiners, and alike), provided that you can get your hands on them.

Getting far enough in a run lets you start another run with some of its cards (each such ""re-run"" gets harder).

Playing both in single-player and multi-player is interesting in its own ways - in SP you have fewer customers and try to automate everything you can; in MP you have more customers and can split tasks between 2..4 of you.

All in all, you can get a lot of hours out of trying different things - there are many strategies are valid, even the absurd-looking ones.

Note: A very certain caveat is that it can take a while to unlock everything, as evidenced by the last unlockable dish having been cooked by <1% of players as of writing this",1661207618,1689068160,False,3,0,0.548611104488372803,1,True,False,False

I have almost 1200 hours in this game. It has consumed most of 2022 - 2023 for me. It helped to kick start my streaming, and the plate up community helped get me to affiliate on Twitch within 30 days. I love this game, I love the streamers in the community, and I love the viewers in the community. Prior to recent events, I would have told anyone that the PlateUp community had almost no Toxic members. 

Unfortunately, I will never play it again as long as the current community manager remains employed by PlateUp and StarFluxGames remains an active play-tester and modder of the game. The community manager is destroying the community for this game, and therefore the game itself.  This individual has long been silencing those with criticisms through locking of threads and account bans across the official Reddit and the official Discord. They will attempt to push concerns into the Discord ""bug report ticket system"" so concerns can be hidden and ignored.  They have enabled the modder StarFluxGames to have back-door access to anyone's lobby who installed the Kitchen Library Mod (which is a base library mod required for 90% of the other mods). 

Although they claim that this has since been resolved, the individuals responsible for this ""lapse in judgement"" are still actively involved and central to the game's ongoing production. 

This backdoor was specifically there to allow StarFluxGames to ""prank"" streamers while they were live by messing with their game during play. Monica was fully aware of this behavior and allowed this backdoor and StarFluxGames to persist for several months. This backdoor allowed StarFluxGames to access my game on a community night with several members of my community and my 7YO daughter playing. He changed our game mode, set random things on fire, changed our outfits, and more. While this may seem like a ""harmless prank,"" it took control of our stream and community night away from us without our knowledge or prior consent. This happened to several streamers, and what tacetly approved by the plateup team. This even occured during a sanctioned plateup event, with no action taken. During this event the community manager even said ""This modder has access to 30,000 computers...""  

You can say, ""well don't play with mods then."" And sure sure... but the vanilla game has not kept up with the quality of life updates that the mods provide and is essentially dead after 100 hours of play. The mods are what is keeping this game alive.

I'm saddened with the direction the community manager has taken the game and the behaviors that have been allowed to persist without consequence. You can tell me that the backdoor has been patched, Kitchen Library mod updates will be reviewed by the PlateUp Dev team, and you can tell me to not play with mods if I'm concerned about my game and stream's security. None of that means anything as long as the modder is still a primary member of the team and the community manager who enabled and protected this behavior remains in charge. The community manager is also in charge of the play testing  team, of which the offending modder is also a part of. This modder also responds to Discord bug issues and asks community members to provide their game log details often. There was no ban, the modder continues to upload and update his own mods, the modder continues to be active in the modding channel of the discord, and there has been no consequences for these actions.

Here's the punchline of this entire situation: The primary developer and creator for this game has a PHD in Cyber Security from Oxford... so was this backdoor a mistake or intentional? Therefore, was the subsequent cover-up and protection of this modder just as intentional? 

As long as the modder has not been banned from this community, and those who have enabled and protected his behavior continue to have any part of PlateUp, I will no longer play, stream, and support this game.

I'll miss this game, and the community.

Play at your own risk.

Plate Up is a co-op cafe management game with a steep difficulty curve. It draws comparisons to Overcooked but offers a unique experience where players take charge of the restaurant layout, menu, and day-to-day management. The game incorporates roguelite elements, with layouts and menu items unlocking every five days and temporary upgrades. The graphics are cute but basic, focusing on functionality rather than visual appeal. The game's high difficulty and emphasis on strategy may not appeal to casual players, but it offers a deep and challenging experience for those willing to invest time and effort to find that synergy with friends.

I must have missed the roguelite tag.  I thought this game would be more of a restaurant management simulator, but this is more of a group/party play type game.  I would not bother playing this game solo as it seems it was designed to be played by at least two players.  Difficulty in this game does not scale down for solo, except you do get a few extra coins.  Playing successfully solo means you have to restrict what kind of food you serve and you need to automate.  However, getting what you need to automate is completely random.  Really frustrating when there is barely any way to influence what items you can get for your shop.  Also, the only permanence that I found was unlocking new blueprints and starting food items.

At first, this game seemed interesting.  I enjoyed playing and failing my first several tries.  But as I kept playing, I realized there is no progression.  You’re just replaying the same game over and over.  Again, this could be more fun in a multiplayer/party game, but it gets dull fast when playing solo.  There are some bonus items you can obtain and bring with you to a game, but these last one game and are random.

The final straw was on my last game, where I was doing very well and was about to hit the last day.  I was trying to run around quick at the end of the night mopping up when I suddenly became trapped by sitting customers.  I thought I would be ok as sometimes customers can be slightly pushed to get out of your way.  However, I got stuck…and after failing at this good run, losing several good bonus items I had saved over time to bring into this game, and to such a silly issue where I dared to make the customers happy by cleaning only to find that I could not even say “excuse me” so I could get back to the kitchen, I was done.

Overall, this game might just not be for me.  I think it has a lot of promise and some other people might like this kind of game.  I would just recommend you think of this as a multiplayer, roguelite, party game.",1688148540,1688148540,False,1,3,0.463601559400558472,0,True,False,False

[b] Have you ever thought, ""What's it like to work with Gordon Ramsey?"" [/b]

Well, if you play this game for 20 - 30 hours, than que it up with someone who is brand new, guess what? You will be Gordon.

This is the flagship game for publisher Yogscast Games. As a Yogs fan myself it was an easy purchase. Watching Simon yell at his back end worker (Ben) about keeping the kitchen clean was my selling point. 

[h1] A quick rundown and overall thoughts [/h1]

This game has it all. It's the perfect bait. ""Why Bait?"" Because at a glance its a cute game. It's inviting, the colors and characters are something you expect out of a kids game. Eventually when you sit down and play it you find out, at about day 7 on a run... You got a line out the door. You're chef is spinning around pinging in a circle and not cooking. The waiter is cleaning the floors in the dinning room and starting to have a mental breakdown, because of the red bar above everyone's head . You figured out nobody's doing dishes and now you are starting to feel like a minimum wage employee at Olive Garden. Right about then you figure out  ""This isn't a fucking kids game, this is real fucking life"" That's when it happens... You are completely invested.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[list]
[*] Fantastic Multiplayer
[*] Ability to change every aspect of the kitchen
[*] Automation
[*] Fantastic upgrades
[*] Intense challenge
[*] Costumes
[*] Varying game-play challenges
[*] Generated map layouts
[*] Rouge like difficulty increases

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[list]
[*] KBM Controls are awful as default (Rebinding is necessary)
[*] Modding has not taken off yet
[*] Challenge on small maps can be too much
[*] Leveling feels a little slow

- New game: not enough mods to solve the previous problems
- Vanilla game doesn't allow restaurant layouts to change during playthrough and most layouts are wonky

Give it a try with a few friends you won't regret it!

The TLDR is Overcooked with more strategic planning and less chaos. If this sounds like your stick it is a great experience, however.. Personally I feel like this game is on the cusp of greatness yet never reaches above and beyond its core gameplay loop (which is fine by the way). With just a few added features it could be truly marvelous.. 

Plate Up! Brings you (and hopefully a few friends) on a journey to furbish, plan and organize a restaurant with various weird themes and on the way enhance that experience in a true roguelike progression system with more and more utensils, tables and robot servants. Now the great stuff is the potential of a swell time, the chaos can be managed and the joy of seeing your restaurant grow is really great. I really love the modularity of the game and if you should do one thing at the start is to get the kitchen editor to make your own restaurant layouts which adds another fun moment to the game since what you see is what you get.. Once the game is on there is no way to physically make your diner larger.. I really like the combination of overcooked mania, clockwork precision serving and a more strategic planning part, in theory.. 

However the way difficulty works is that it just adds more starters/sides/mains to your increasingly shrinking workspace and makes automation the only real endgame goal of the game. But this is fine right? I LOVE factorio and automation so this should be a match made in heaven? Well not quite.. In Factorio I have an agency over what I can craft and automate, in Plate Up! the system works on more or less extreme RNG.. 

You want a conveyor? Well you better hope it comes up in the next planning phase (together with an extremely random selection of stuff to buy) or invest heavily in a blueprint cloning facility that takes up precious space in your already crammed workplace. On top of that ONE mistake tanks your run and you have to start over, and yes I know about “extra lives” and save scumming and all that, the mistake might be so minor that it is a pure non-factor and back to square 0 you go.. You also want to be able to serve stuff manually why constantly having to plunk down new pots, pans, bacon dispensers and napkins in every single square of the kitchen. A game about automating a really tight restaurant where the automation itself is locked behind RNG and a process of even progressing far enough for the automation to kick in feels a bit odd.. But maybe that's just me. A way to expand your growing restaurant by adding more rooms, doors and maybe even a garden would have been awesome and play right into the restaurant-simulation I had hoped for it to be.

So it's part great, part flawed and part expandable? In the end I really like Plate Up! despite its few flaws. I went in and expected more of a Pizza Tycoon kind of experience mixed with Overcooked, and this is not that.. What it is however is a great co-op game about the futility of capitalist life where a single mistake will ruin your branding and put you on the streets begging for slops for the rest of your life.. Unless you are extremely rich, then you just let machines do the work for you..

You pick a recipe and a restaurant layout, and then you play through the days. As you go through a run, you'll get more recipes, decorations, etc. for your restaurant. You also get different random items that will help you build up your restaurant, especially your kitchen. You can upgrade items as well, which is a lot of fun. I play with no automation currently, but a lot of people use the automation items, which will help you cook items automatically. Even cooler, Plateup! allows you to play up to 4 players in a great online co-op mode, and some  mods allow you to play up to 8 players.

Dangerously so.

Overcooked was alright. It felt like a party based puzzle game with restaurant flavouring. PlateUp!, on the other hand, feels like a party based restaurant game.

Ever had a great meal at a restaurant and wished the portion sizes were bigger? That's PlateUp!.
Ever deeply considered ordering ANOTHER plate, regardless of the looks of mindless horror you'd get from your friends and family? That's PlateUp!.
Ever had to death grip the table to the point your knuckles are cracking to prevent yourself hauling off and dummying the elderly woman at the next table and stealing her freshly arrived meal? That's PlateUp!.

Set up your kitchen, hijack one of your lesser evolved friends to wait tables for you, and roguelite your way to building the restaurant of your dreams. Unless you make a single customer wait too long for their meal, whereupon your business collapses into financial ruin and your dreams are utterly dashed upon the rocky shores of the roguelite existence.

But that's part of the fun.

Devs, I want more. More recipes to choose from. More items and stations to play with. More room to expand my restaurant into. I want to make cakes. I want to make cookies. I want to make sundaes. I have more money. Let's trade.

[h2]I LOVE THIS GAME![/h2]

I have two kids. There isn't a lot that can get my attention, especially at night, when I need to sleep. BUT [i]THIS GAME.[/i]
Let me tell you about this friggin' game.

It's multiplayer! But I've only played it single, so that's all I know. My apologies. I end up killing my husband when we play games like this, so I haven't played with him. [i]Yet.[/i]

[B] THINGS TO KNOW [/b]
• You choose from a set of kitchens that are randomly generated. (You can see the blueprints for them before choosing, so you know where closets, kitchen, doors are etc).
• PRACTICE MODE - practice food before you make it! You'll become a pro. And also you serve cats in practice mode. Absolutely worth it.
• [b]CHOOSE FOOD WITH MORE STEPS![/b] Honestly, pizza, soups and sides, they can all be good, you can make more than one portion for the cooking time so it makes life a lot easier, especially in the beginning. Often it means you get less customers because they order more, and that's good, they have more patience in-between meals! You dont need to rush as much as you would between more customers coming, eating, cleaning plates, going etc.
• Once you inevitably die, and [i]you will[/i] you'll unlock new recipes, new goodies, locations etc! Dying is good! 
• You can wear silly hats. There's loads, all free, in your room at the beginning.
• You can change your character's colour! Check the mirror. 
(I am a purple chef, with silly cat ears).
• A bit like diner dash, once you finish a level, you'll earn money and you can upgrade or add more items to your kitchen, and rearrange it to your liking. [u]It's not overcooked.[/u] You will be able to rearrange your kitchen and do whatever you want with it. Don't want a bin in the kitchen? Stick it next to the customer you hate!

• Mops instantly clean your floor and make you move faster. I absolutely recommend it.
• Breadsticks seemingly work best when you feed them to groups of 2 or more, especially when serving one plate to one, and going back to quickly cook another plate.

• For what it's worth, I have played 6 hours! And I haven't gotten ANY bugs, so far, so...honestly it's good! Far better than expected, I WOULD LOVE some DLC!",1682881622,1682881622,True,26,3,0.709727764129638672,0,True,False,False

There are 5 levels to each stage. You start at level 1 and make your way up to 5, however if you screw up your order or run out of time serving even 1 (ONE) customer, the game is over and you have to start from level 1 again.

And this is where the product is a deal breaker for me. The game is intentionally designed to have you fail repeatedly every time you reach level 3. You cannot progress beyond that level without automating things, and you cannot automate things because your overall level is too low, hence you don't have any items available to you to automate anything. The only way you can automate your kitchen is if you fail enough times to progress with your overall level, unlock the correct items and then maybe, MAYBE, get past 3.

You get to choose the level layout and the recipe you want to cook, you name your restautant and your goal is to keep going as long as possible with the cash you make and the blueprints (Counters, sinks, plates, research desks. etc.) you're given.

There's a rogue-lite aspect to the game where the blueprints you get day after fay are randomized, the bonus/malus cards you can choose after some days, being able to reroll blueprints for money and if your place fails, you have to restart from the beginning, unlocking stuff and hoarding things in your loading bay all the while. After 15 days, if you end up failing, you get to create a franchise where you can keep going with the cards you got in your run.  

Really brings you all the rush of being a cook/waiter/dishwasher without, you know, the hassle of being actually there for real.

At first me and my friends we've tried the demo version, since we were a bit hesitant because it seemed to be just Overcooked 3.0, but after 2h of gameplay and not even completing the full demo version; I can tell you that this is not like other demo version of other games, to end in 15-30 min, you can definitely play for a while without getting bored and it's presetting, offering you quiet a lot in the demo version! 

This game has a lot of potential, the controls are not clunky, the interface and gameplay are easy to understand, gameplay wise..you have to think in advance and plan your gameplay, how are you going to set up your layout, to manage your space, which perks, decorations and items you should use to be able to have a smooth gameplay which I consider to be original. I kinda understand why you would believe at first that this is another copy/pasta overcoocked game but thats not the case, this is different and not even mentioning that the game is rewarding you with cosmetics/skins when you are progressing in game, if the devs will keep this game updated, briging new content, 100% this can compete with the other game overcooked.

The game experience is decently customizable due to the workshop.

Very enjoyable game to play with buddies, though I wish the game would've added sprint, a reward for keeping the restaurant clean, & a reward/sell price for throwing out appliances; also I feel that doors are a bit rough to navigate at times especially in multiplayer. I also kinda wish they would've done like a 3 strikes system or something, & the early kitchen layouts are sorta nightmarish, while the randomized ones available later are much more enjoyable.

I hope they will add more outfits, & other things to the game.

OH, and sidenote the demo has some appliances priced differently than the full game, & messes take longer to clean (I would assume to promote using the cleaning & buffing tools) so be aware of that, though I think it was handled fine.",1681705095,1681847310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With its charming graphics and catchy soundtrack, this game is a feast for the eyes and ears. But it's the gameplay that really takes the cake (or should I say, the steak?).

Pros:
[list]
 [*]PlateUp! offers a wide variety of dishes to cook, from classic comfort food to exotic delicacies. Each dish comes with its own unique set of challenges, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.
 [*]The controls are intuitive and easy to learn, so even novice chefs can jump right in and start creating culinary masterpieces.
 [*]The game's sense of humor and whimsy will keep you entertained for hours. From the quirky character designs to the silly sound effects, PlateUp! is a joy to play.
 [*]The game is also educational, teaching players about different cuisines and cooking techniques. You'll come away from PlateUp! with a newfound appreciation for the culinary arts.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
 [*]If you're looking for a hardcore cooking simulator, PlateUp! might not be for you. The game is more focused on fun than realism, so some players may find it a bit too casual.
 [*]The levels can get a bit repetitive after a while, especially if you're trying to earn three stars on every dish. But with so many different dishes to choose from, it's easy to mix things up and keep the gameplay fresh.
[/list]

1. Infinite replayability with the roguelike system using difficulty cards to make every run different.
2. Capability for solo play: there are a lot of ways that PlateUp! makes solo runs more possible besides just trying to control two chefs at once.
3. Instead of being stuck with overly inconvenient kitchens, you get a constant influx of appliances and have to figure out how to lay out your kitchen yourself.

It's a simple yet quirky little chef simulator. It's fun but I find it a lot more fun with friends. Solo play isn't impossible just a lot more difficult because you do EVERYTHING. 

If you play with a friend who can serve the customers and wait tables while you prep and cook food in the back. (Or vice versa) then I feel the game is a lot more fun. I found it difficult to progress beyond day 9 or 10 in solo play. That's my only gripe is that solo play seems like an afterthought. Group play seems to be this games primary focus.

I have not yet progressed far enough to do any automation stuff, which I'm sure makes solo play much much easier, but getting there has been a struggle. 

So for me personally if you have nobody to play with, I'd be on the fence about buying this game. It is fun but has limited potential, at least in my opinion. But if you have people to play with then this game is an easy recommendation.

Overcooked is fun but is solely focused on stress and adapting to a new kitchen layout can result in a lot of frustrations especially when you play with casual players.

PlateUp! on the other hand is more focused on problem solving and optimisation. Having your own restaurant and switching the layout whenever you want creates a more manageable experience even for newcomers.

I enjoy the rogue-lite aspect as well. It's fun to see all the different upgrades you can acquire.

Even if you don't have friends, just buy it, you can play it alone (some of my best runs have been solo runs). The devs update the game ALL the times. I really have nothing negative to say other than that steam's ""share & play"" (or whatever it's call) makes the game laggy, so probably better if your friend also buys the game. 

Pros:
* The game never gets old, the RNG creates a chaotic mess that's fun to solve. 
* The devs are always introducing new content in the form of holiday events which is really fun and keeps you coming back for more
* The devs listen to player feedback and update the game accordingly
* If you like overcooked, you will love this game. You will probably NEVER play overcooked again because it feels boring / bad compared to PlateUp. Overcooked is dead to me, PlateUp is the only restaurant game I will ever need again. 
* Return to the early 2000's with REAL couch co-op
* A game that have amazing multiplayer AND can is just as enjoyable solo'ed

Cons:
* Fuck potato salad",1679242818,1679242818,True,5,0,0.578313291072845459,0,True,False,False

1. It's way too hard to level up, and you have to play the same few recipes over and over again in order to unlock new content, which gets incredibly stale

2. They should add a layout editor. Every time we tried to play we'd spend a ton of time just picking a good seed to try our run on, because as you get better and play more you try to optimize and get farther and farther into the game, and it just isn't fun when you lose not because you played poorly, but because the restaurant just had things in the wrong place.

A whole new kind of cooperative play, it condenses workflow and streamlining gameplay down into 3 minute rounds, where up to 4 cooks upgrade and iterate and enhance their workstation to fulfill various tasks. Timmy can chop vegetables, Jimmy can wash plates and plate salads, Dingle can take and deliver orders, and Pringle  can make pies in the back. 

The roguelike elements are surprisingly fun and well thought out, you can run kitchens different ways allowing you to shift your playstyle and build restaurant to restaurant.

theres definitely a learning curve, but once you know how to make it to overtime, its just smooth sailing pure addiction. i love making just fully automated restaurants now, while the first couple runs i just instantly died anytime i add a third dish lmao. things i wish i knew when i started:

- make diner style restaurants!! (i.e. put the tables right next to the windows, so you can serve from inside the kitchen! this one tip makes the whole game MUCH easier!! no interaction with doors needed during the game!!)

- when your menu is simple, like, you only have one recipe, just bring the food when you take the order and insta-serve them by double-pressing!)

- building onto that, if you have like, two people on a table: put one serving on the table, go back to get another one, then instantly serve! (no need to make two trips and risking the customer patience going fast!)

- put the first research desk into the cabinet, and get your next one to research it! that way you can get a blueprint/copy desk early, which is really important!!

- you can stall serving the last few customers in order to get your research done at the end of the day!

- choose cards that have new food items if you think you can! the customer reduction is very important!

- avoid the cards that just *adds* customers, e.g lunch rush, dinner rush

- sinks clean up messes on the floor (as long as theyre not like, the biggest mess tile), so put sinks near hobs!

- get a wash basin + scrubbing brush for super speedy cleaning!

- get a new stack of plates early in the run! it has double the plates on the same amount of rack...age

- if a recipe says ""or add water"" (e.g. pizza, dumplings), interact with the sink while holding the ingredient! dont knead the flour manually.. soz

- you can remove the available chairs on a table by interacting with it! this way, you can force customers to sit where you want, so they wont block you with their body!

- finally, dont feel bad to use the wiki! its handy to know what upgrades into what, especially if your just getting started!

- oh and avoid soup. especially early in the run. theyll kill you. all my homies hate soup


anywho yeah! great game! please buy it.


_____________________________________________________________

review when i had like, 4 hours in the game lmao:

good fun all around! the singleplayer campaign is kinda stressful, but def not as bad as overcooked's singleplayer and it leaps n bounds more enjoyable than oc's lmao. im sure this is way chiller n easier when played multiplayer tho!

hate the door physics though. thats my one gripe. genuinely wish that the doors were just visual and that they open automatically or theyre maybe like. open archways, or maybe curtains or sliding doors that just open when you go through. rn it just feels janky and heavy, having to shove a door open with your forehead every time ya wanna go to the next room.

and to a lesser extent, the speed that dirt accumulates and how much it slows you down is. a bit much. like im sure in multiplayer you can split duties for cooking/prep and cleaning/service but for singleplayer,,,,,, its just. a bit too much. maybe it could be toned down a little?

really good game though! love all the upgrade system and stuff!",1659757418,1678959100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I do miss being able to comically throw ingredients around the kitchen, I appreciate the less chaotic nature of this game compared to Overcooked. Things to get hectic but not because your restaurant is split onto 4 icebergs. You instead deal with trying to serve your customers in a timely fashion.
The game is updated regularly so you know the devs care about the game despite the lower price tag. Content is consistently added, new recipes, and blueprints for new ways to help your restaurant reach the goal of 15 consecutive successful days of business.
Basic gameplay revolves around the rogue aesthetic of failure is common but brings progress. Progress comes in the form of XP and 1 time use blueprints that can be brought with you in future runs to help you achieve success. Gaining XP leads to level-ups that grant you new map options and recipe cards to start with. If you manage to run a restaurant through day 15 you can franchise it, while allows you to save it to be played whenever in the future or you can scrap it for a large chunk of XP. This format may not be for everyone but thankfully this game has the amazing remote-play feature so you can experience all the game has to offer with up to 4 people (until you add mods of course) and find out if it is right for you.
I played 15+ hours solo before introducing this game to my friends and still really enjoyed it by myself. I do think the game is made much better with friends but you also don't really need any of the automation machines once you introduce more people so take that as you will. 
All in all, it is a very fun rogue/restaurant management sim and if the full price tag doesn't seem great, this game goes on sale practically with every update (almost monthly).",1678900891,1678900891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nov. 2022:
I'm addicted to this game, and it's deserving of all the praise it's received. I'm so looking forward to more recipes and such being added to the game, as its replayability is kind of endless already, and it's only been out a few months! 

I always wanted to play co-op cooking games like Overcooked but I don't always have people to play with, so I wanted something I could enjoy playing by myself as well. This is the game I knew I wanted but didn't know it'd exist one day. I'm so very glad. Unsurprisingly I found out about this game from Yogscast on Youtube, during the Halloween update, and I was immediately obsessed. 

I love how even inevitable failure is rewarding because you get experience and unlock things. The RNG element, the cute recipes and fast pace, the challenge and fun of figuring out how to do the layout of your restaurant and what challenge cards to pick for success, whether solo or with others, has given me so much entertainment in the short time I've had the game. Even though it has Steam's Remote Play (bless you Alistair/dev(s)!), I bought an additional copy to gift just to support the dev(s). 

This is a seriously great game if you're into stuff of this genre, and I highly recommend it. It's fun, funny, challenging, replayable, good for both solo and with friends, easy to pick up and just play from the start. It was said that this game was intended to combine hectic cooking game co-op with functionality and replayability. They definitely succeeded in my book.",1667483512,1678821266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can improve it by leaps and bounds with mods from the Workshop, but I don't feel a review should reflect fan made content, just what the devs put out there.

What you get from the devs is a highly RNG-based game, with no forgiveness if items that are rotated strangely when you start a day (causing you lose the run, instead of allowing an option to restart the day) which REQUIRES you to move items in order to check for new upgrades between shifts, which results in accidentally having items rotated the wrong way...and so on and so forth.

Mods required: one of the 'noclip' or 'ghosting' ones for the prep time. There's one to restart days as well, which can allow you to fix those rotation issues you've likely spotted within second of starting a new day.",1678807119,1678807119,False,0,0,0.370792925357818604,0,True,False,False

As an avid fan of most roguelites and roguelikes games, I must say Plate Up adds some truly interesting flavors to the genre. You take on the role of a restaurateur, and tackle the demanding task of taking orders, preparing and serving them within a time limit. The game revolves around time management, with arcadey game mechanics. With each passing day new items can be added to your culinary repertoire and can also be upgraded. (if you got the money for it), along with added perks and challenges, a staple for any good roguelike. The game ends when you are unable to fulfill an order within the time limit. 
As you progress further into the game more and more dishes, floor plans, etc are unlocked, each with their own set of challenges. My friends and I haven't gotten very far but we can tell we have barely even scratched the surface. 
For me the game truly shines in the co-op department. Whoever said too many cooks spoil the broth has obviously never played this game, as this is one of the most fun and true co-op experiences I have had in my 20 years of gaming.

The game loses it's fun value after a few hours/days - You end up restarting because of a single fail usually (which isn't necessarily what I take issue with). If there was a ratings system for your restaurant it would give you things to work for and a heads up before failing for some tiny reason. It seems like the reason is that there's only me and my wife playing, so sometimes there is that extra person waiting in the queue outside and you just can't clear them in time. Poof, end of game because one person had to wait. 


The issue is that when you restart it's just the same boring path (or routine that becomes boring) - What I mean is that it would be nice to have longer sections of feeling like you are running a restaurant. 


It doesn't feel consistent - You either get days of boring routine, whilst you upgrade etc (which is fun) but then suddenly one hard day and you lose, restart or a couple of hard days.. THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT PHASE, which feels unrealistic. Because of that it just feels like work ... Missed potential here.



So if you are playing with one other person, it's fun until suddenly you fail. Rinse and repeat 30 times and ask yourself will it still be fun making the upgrades knowing that:
a) Your play through will feel the same.The first load of days will all be too easy and the same.
b) The single mistake , which is inevitable, will force you to do it all over and experience nothing new. You will both be counting down to that hard day and realise ""hey, our restaurant is pretty great but it is near impossible to overcome the extra person/issue with just 2 players""



So thumbs down if you want something that is cooking/teamwork but allows you to play and enjoy your time over long periods. I get that it is like a roguelike but imagine playing darksouls and dying but you restart entirely 30 times over - Or worse you are fine but your partner dies and you all have to restart. No retention of levels, lose all equipment etc 



I would change it to a thumbs up if say there was extra lives options or a restaurant ratings system (i get sometimes you have a life crate, but that is rare).",1667042650,1678019362,False,2,0,0.492651969194412231,0,True,False,False

You will scream at your friends because they forgot to give the customers a plate. You will force-quit the game because you don't want to lose a level. 

Best purchase on Steam so far. For the price, definitely worth it. I get excited every time an update drops. And I have not even tried the mods yet!!! 

The only issue I have is that if you have a bad connection, the game can get VERY laggy and not be fun when you play online. :(  also you only get one save file per account if you don't make a franchise.

Written in October 2022;
I've greatly enjoyed this game, and it has a bit of Diner Bro's feel to it, but the Rougelike elements add some good spice to every session. I've played with multiple friends who all have a different way of processing things and cleaning so the game adapts to different play styles moderatly well.

And you even discover strategies you wouldnt have seen otherwise. Its also very easy to pick up with friends at home or online. 

The added mods make things very fun and keep the flow of new things and restaurants going. 

The devs are also solid at trying to provide themed content during holidays and festivities which makes its fun to keep coming back with new challenges, dishes en restaurant styles.

The most fun part of the game is trying to finish the day flawless with your friends.

Pros
+ The game does not progress monotonously.
+ The variety of recipies are quite enough. (I wouldn't say no to more.)
+ The challanges in the game are quite enjoyable.
+ Easy to join your party and play with friends. 

Cons
+ It's definitely a multiplayer oriented game.

I also prefer to go straight to the game because I'm quite impatient. However, 5 hours later I found out that this game is all about your kitchen setup. The play style and difficulty depends on the layout of the kitchen and the card effects. It is the opposite of OAYCE. I like that I can choose a map, configure the kitchen setup and decorate the rooms. I really like the autonomous play style, it's quite unique. I put in 9 hours so far. Also, I'm not a big fan of roguelike games, but this is really fun!!! I think it's my first favourite. The mods made the game even better and I have fun playing alone or with a group. Me and my boyfriend got frustrated in vanilla mode and we didn't like how the restaurant closes too fast, but after installing the mods, we were able to play more. The multiplayer is very doable and easy to progress, unlike in OAYCE, I have to play in a group to finish it and the more players there are, the harder it gets. This is probably my go-to game if I just want to chill. The player base is also friendly and chill. I was so happy to play with them.",1676301944,1676301987,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

My ass always ends up blocking a crucial pathway and panicking as the restaurant fills with more customers and gets messier. BIG TIPS IF YOURE STRUGGLING (and you will): 1. You can remove chairs from tables, this helps with arranging and making space for more (it's better to have more tables cause you typically have smaller groups at first) 2. Dishes will overwhelm you quickly. Invest in the dishwasher or the sink that lets you wash multiple plates at once. The tray that lets you carry multiple items is also a lifesaver, but the items you get are all RNG so good luck. 3. Keep your menu simple. Adding sides and other things you have to make clutters the kitchen and it's really hard to manage.

As a fan of Over Cooked, I was drawn into PlateUp with its cooking mechanics and cute art style. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the two games are similar on the surface but not much more after that (Think Cultivation Simulator vs Rimworld {hey hey people...}). 

While Over Cooked is more focused on the fast pace of an arcade game with different quirky challenges to overcome, PlateUp is more focused on growth and personalization. Starting with one menu item and minimal/basic work spaces and tools, each run is a random and unique building of additional menu items and more tools to make the job either easier, automatic, or to make the your eatery fit the theme assigned at your first Star Rating.

Dungeon crawling aspects of a semi-unique starting run, being the choice of a randomly generated kitchen and one out of four choices from your current recipe selection help keep new ventures feel unique and keeps the repetition of restarting less daunting. Level progression unlocking new kitchen layouts and starting items makes you want to keep saying ""come on guys just one more round"", and the random item cards make the quest for a perfect kitchen interesting and spicy.

Last but not least, this game is very much enjoyable on your own as much as with a group. The time given for ordering and delivering food is slower on your own than with a group, allowing you time to cook, serve and bus tables. There are enough basic automation features that even a dumbass like myself was able to make basic automation of time consuming recipes. And if that is too daunting, items to make prep work faster, clean dishes automatically, and even take orders from the kitchen are common enough to bank on helping you out.

I recommend this game to anyone who likes quirky cooking games, as a 4 person party game anyone could enjoy, and as a great end to a date night",1675740385,1675740385,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The only reason why I'm leaving one for PlateUp! is because i want anybody who has a significant other that they want to play games with but that SO has a hard time getting into games, to give this game a shot -- it was the solution for me.

My girlfriend has never been interested in playing games with me before, but one fateful night she decided that she would really like to give it a shot and asked me to find something that we could play together on the same screen. I landed on a couple options, and she picked this one.
Now, she asks me if we can play on every one of my off days. We've sunk 30 hours into it in the first week and half of having it. 

NOW for the review. 
Its an absolutely great game with lots of replay-ability, many power ups and different items you can come across that drastically increase your ability to perform. There's a bit of a learning curve, but many times did my non-gamer girlfriend suggest ideas that I never would've thought of, that worked really well -- so there is some amount of intuition involved with it that some people will have and some won't. 
It can get repetitive, but there was always something we could do to reignite our interest. 

The developers are super active and are pushing more content out regularly, this is a game that is loved and cared for, and the devs don't take us for granted. 

We've had a blast with this game, and really think you will too. Give it a shot!

Pro tip!!: It's okay to use the designated ""kitchen"" as a dining room if it increases your productivity! - the non-gamer girlfriend's tip that saved us many many times",1675475133,1675476584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seemed far less polished or or interesting, but the reviews so so positive we gave it some time. We are glad we did. 

It's not possible to compare this game to Overcooked, the only common thread is cooking.

Overcooked minimises all of the processes to be as simple as possible. You refined a very small set of skills and actions to perfection to win. 

Plate up maximises all of the processes, it requires a hyper level of micro management, system and task analysis.

Great game for hanging out with the SO. There's decent amount of upgrades to obtain.

We weren't at each other's throats like other game titles that are similar to this game play. We role played a lot which was super fun!
    There are few opportunities for AFKing for needy pets and kiddos as the rounds can be very intense and require an immense amount of concentration.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

游戏有多人，但毕竟是 roguelite, 想象了一下应该不适合当 party game，除非有志同道合的稍微长期一点的玩伴。

做菜部分：除了传统艺能切菜煮菜洗盘，还要给每桌客人分别上菜，各种操作的时机安排也有讲究，甚至还能用奇技淫巧指定每组客人坐哪，美女餐厅爱好者狂喜。

经营建造部分：第二天开始可以买更多高级设备升级厨房，还能科研。通关过一次，或者玩过每周地图以后又会打开新思路，[spoiler] 追求自动化厨房 [/spoiler]。自己摸爬滚打出一套方案以后，才思枯竭但又觉得还能改进，再看看网上的视频，又会惊叹还能这么设计。玩了一百个小时都不断有新鲜感。我个人其实不太喜欢那种沙盒建造游戏（factorio）的，但这个游戏比较循序渐进，不需要设计，单纯当做菜游戏玩也是能通关的，但想要改进就会慢慢陷进去，不玩的时候都在想厨房怎么设计。

Some rounds leave you with no useful upgrades, while others force you to ditch things you have been seeking because only one blueprint can be saved between rounds. The random upgrade system is so brutal. As a solo player, a dishwashing machine would save my restaurant. So why does it keep giving me a power sprayer or soaking tub? (that costs the same amount to purchase??) Other things are just outright useless and overpriced, like extra onion bins. If they never run out, and you plan your layout properly, there is no need for a second onion bin. Why does it eat one of my potential upgrades AND cost 3x the price of a far more useful basic countertop?

The ""ideology"" upgrades only come after two specific rounds. Some of them cost more than others, despite having the same effects, and even drawbacks. Why are these not interspersed randomly with other blueprints after the initial unlock?

Some foods are stupid easy to push out, but others start easy and quickly get hit with complexity creep, leaving you without adequate workspace. Others seems beneficial at first, but force you to throw out waste (corn on the cob/pumpkin anything), making the hectic day-to-day even less manageable, especially when the basic trash bin sucks and you have to get super lucky to roll a trash blueprint and then spend a day upgrading it to even manage a day of corn sales/picky eaters.

Don't even get me started on the burgers with onion/tomato toppings that only sell for $3!

I would love a way to design my own layout instead of taking one of the procedurally generated ones. I would love a telegraphed or semi-chooseable upgrade tree so that I know, at least on a general level, what I am getting myself in to. (My burger joint needs prep stations, not freezers.) I would love to love this game more than I already do, because it has a really fun gameplay loop!

That being said it's close to being perfect, but not quite there are definitely things that could take this to the next level.
1. More customisation; Would be great if there wasn't just the same items when decorating the restaurants. With the textures being themed to the restaurant picked. Some of the wallpapers are ghastly!
2. More unlocks; Maybe having a store or shop in the menu with individual player credits earned? It sometimes feels as if you have a really good restaurant going for a lot of overtime and get no reward?
3. More game play modes; Random variables before going into a game for example you can only use one hob but you get bonuses because of it. (Sort of like in Hades)
4. A tool tips page; Sometimes it would help explaining how to use the more complex automation items more intuitively.
5. Improvements on menu; The menu is one of the best things I have seen in a while. Quite often its just fun to mess around there. If you were able to customise this, design rooms, purchase items, more customisation options for the franchise, leader-boards and stats for runs etc. 

With all these features the game could really be something special.

The experience pulls you in while you get to refine your production pattern structures, and having the restaurant as a continually growing space that can end any moment will keep you firmly in your chair planning the next step; all of this is fine enough in single player for that addictive pattern molding, but coop is even better as the cracks in your planning and speed of action required make a frantic landscape of pushing until failure inevitably occurs and players are forced to rebound in the moment under real and honest pressure. 

There are issues with the game - the failure conditions can feel unfair; the random nature sometimes hits you with ridiculousness; the controller play could be tighter; some mechanics blocking doesn't make sense (can't switch held things, research randomness is unforgiving); but much of this is just in the nature of its hardcore play, which usually has the effect of making any survival actually mean something to the player. By having the restaurant function has a vessel of the team with consistency and modification between rounds, real stakes develop and it feels more engaging long term than say just operating in a random kitchen (Such as in Overcooked - which did have tighter 'play' otherwise). 

Really though what is the cost of failure when there's always room for another kitchen? And without a possible failure where would any of the meaning be that makes us strive? Such is the hardcore nature of the rogue-like - I guess. Anyway, I played the demo first, thought I'd pay probably at least $20 for the game, and saw it was only $12 at the time which made it a no-brainer purchase. About 30 hours in of mixed coop and single play I haven't unlocked or seen everything either.

Although traditionally advertised as a rogue-lite building restaurant simulator, it should be expanded upon to recognize what will be your greatest achievements in problem-solving the puzzle known as customer service. You and up to three (3) friends will spend many a great times wondering if you'll even make it to the next day in this wonderful adventure, but fear not for perseverance is key and getting to it whether it be front of house or back of house will open your senses to many new adventures! Learning when to take orders and how to set up the restaurant to be fully automated or manual will be some of your greatest tests, but in the end you will learn with each new given day a new set of skills to better prepare you for your next franchise.

The layout of the first levels is annoying- a kitchen, a smaller room to the side, and your dining room, with doors that are easy to get jammed in, the tables are placed next to the doors causing customers to block you in your kitchen, and lack of flow is weird, maybe it's single player and these maps are designed for multiplayer, but your guys are made clumsy at first, it's weird feeling controls for me.  Also, the blue upgrades in envelopes on the ground doesn't feel good for me, it's just hard to walk around and see what they are, constantly hitting other items by accident when i want to see whats in the envelope!, give me a list like you would expect.  Moving stuff around is a pain with all the clutter, you'll pick up a dirty plate and have nowhere to put it? And a run will end with one mistake, leading to multiple replays, or leveling up.  I do think it's funny that you can plate IN THE SINK.  It's also very easy to accidantly choose an upgrade by pressing right or left, before you have thought over the two options you have moved on to the next level.  If people want coffee they sit at a table with dirty plates.  It's telling me an item, counters, is upgradable, but can't somehow?  When navigating around the tables why am i able to push an eating customer away from their meal by walking by/through them if they're too close to a wall. Its funny that if i don't have any clean dishes i can get away with putting the cooked meat on the table next to the customer while i go and wash a dish, juggling items in a kitchen with too few surfaces.  And something doesn't sit right with me that one table messed up and your kitchen closes, pretty rough.  All too often i tap a button to pick something up but i'm not close enough, causing me to tap multiple times, often picking it up and putting it back down, am i close enough or not lol?  Imagine a perfect run with every order made quickly only the final table you make a mistake and put tomatoes in the salad when it was a plain lettuce salad, level failed; this should make you loose money which means you can't buy cool upgrades, not a failure of the level, in my opinion if you go too slow that should build up in a chain of mistakes not just one and you're done.   This seems set up for multiplayer more than solo play, so i'll update my review after trying that.  I like the game but it's not sure where it wants to be, it's kindof an RPG with all the upgrades, but it's no 'cooking version of fall guys' at least not yet. or like,,,, the diablo of cooking games? nope, fun but not satisfying",1672313808,1672968945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the seasonal special events, though I started playing with the one/month holidays of halloween/thanksgiving/christmas. Hopefully they keep coming up the rest of the year. 

My only real complaint is that automation feels a bit underwhelming. It's difficult to get anything useful set up before day 15, and after that there's no bonus for pushing deep into OT. On top of that, the least fun I have had in this game was when I had a fully automated kitchen. Spamming X for 5 minutes to beat one day is not interesting gameplay.

We saw PlateUp! and thought it was worth a shot even if it was more of the same, and in some ways we were right, but so many systems and mechanics are different you have a completely different game which in out opinion at least is even better than Overcooked. It feels like Overcooked mixed with the essence of FTL's almost perfect roguelite gameplay warped into running a restaurant.

PlateUp! somehow manages to feel less stressful, but is also more punishing being that it's a roguelite. For me this was excellent, after all now failure is mandatory to progression, we're winning if we win or lose! You will lose of course, many, many times for a wide variety of reasons. The strategy and planning and randomness for me felt a LOT like FTL, it's the closest I've actually felt to playing an FTL like game for a long time. Sometimes you're just begging for a mop, or some wellies that never show and you know you can't make the next day. 

Progressing will see you pick from 2 random options that will increase the difficulty every few days and you'll have to decide who is going to take the hit, if either of you can. Sometimes you'll be on overtime day X and two cards will drop and you know it's game over next round either way. Yet somehow it feels right, somehow they made this work so well. You of course also get to choose a path of benefits, things like reducing queue times, tables make no mess etc, it's picking a strategy that's going to get you as far through this run as possible. Between these card days you get a choice of items for your restaurant, many of which can be upgraded if you remember to, and you will absolutely want to be ready at the research desk ready to fire off that upgrade at the start of the day. There likely won't be another chance as the customers turn your lettuce salad into a regurgitated roast dinner on the floor.

As you progress you'll unlock new maps, new sizes of maps, new items, new everything and you'll need to use everything you've learnt to make it through. No two runs are the same, you won't see the same map again for a long time. You only get a small selection of maps each run and you want to choose the best for your strategy. There are daily and weekly maps that will really let you get your planning and automation brain in gear if you can hold out long enough! If you do reach day 15+ in a run you will be offered the chance to start a franchise, a prestige difficulty as it were where you choose 3 of the cards you got this run and start with them. This is almost always bad, but the franchise will also give the option to choose a benefit. It will still without any doubt be much harder, we haven't made it to day 15 of a franchise yet but we can't wait to try again!

I can't recommend this enough for a couple of friends or a group, it will get you talking about all aspects of the restaurant rather than just the most efficient ways to cook something, or spending time just learning how a map moves around (looking at you overcooked 1 boss). It's much less a ""you're terrible at your job"" and more of a ""what do we have available this run to make it easier?"". Need a better sink and another dining table?

I worked as a chef for 6 years and Overcooked was unpredictable chaos to an extent that I found it would remind me of the worst kind of stress of cooking and that's when everything is spiraling beyond your control. PlateUp on the other hand draws back on the random chaos and gives you control over the layout of your kitchen and it really does remind me of how it felt trying to optimize a work station with the tools at your disposal, which is a part of the job I've really missed because it feels so damn satisfying. 

My one gripe is that it's nearly as unfriendly towards solo players as Overcooked, I want to be playing this game all the time right now but I don't always have a friend available to play with and playing solo feels like it will require a lot of luck and probably some cheesing to actually beat solo. It always surprises me when a dev makes a game like this that allows single player but they don't even make an attempt to balance it for solo players when that's such a significant audience. 

Frankly I wouldn't recommend the game if you don't have people to play with. That said it is a hell of a game. If the devs actually balance it for solo play it would be a 10/10 game",1672138241,1672138241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That said, if you don't have a head for kitting junk out and optimizing space (like, just look at the screenshots on the store page), checking the wiki is absolutely necessary and you will probably genuinely never reach the heights of play that others do because I am built like a moron and the skill ceiling is in the stratosphere.

This is definitely a with friends kind of game.

With friends you can get pretty crazy on designs and customer volume.

One miss step can ruin it all though let me tell ya!

Solo game play is fun and stressful, you need to work on automation right away if you plan to run a solo shop.

OVERALL GAME PLAY 

Many different foods and side dishes to serve each adding their own pros and cons to the mix.

Variety of locations to pick from each with their own pros and cons.

Cards that add much needed twists to keep the game play entertaining and yet somehow frustrating occasionally lol.

In single player, it's almost impossible to progress correctly since you have the same difficulty as if you were four on the map. And the roguelike progression system is really slow. Too slow. Making single player people giving up since the content begin grindy and repetitive as hell. Coming from Diner Bros, i don't know if i enjoy playing this game since i don't feel improving as i play. 

The blueprint is also too much about RNG, sometimes, you can wait 5 days before getting what you want (and the game doesn't wait for you because the difficulty increase as days pass).

The quest card are badly design because decoration item pop-up only when you are on the quest card day. Meaning, you don't have money to buy them anyway. So, what's the point if you can't complete the quest to get a buff ? And of course, if you reroll, you get decoration item only, not tools useful for your kitchen.

The end game sound pretty lame. When you are in overtime, there is no real goal anymore, you just need serve customers endlessly. 

The blueprint drop is bad. Meaning, it's always the same start item who drop. I don't really see the point of doing that. Of course, you can upgrade them, but you still need to have a search desk and cabinet (good luck to find them). 

The room is way too tiny, even when you access to medium and big rooms. It make the game just annoying because you can't place everything where you want. It's getting worse with automation, there is just no room to do what you want.

It would be great to have a waitress if we play solo like in Diner-bros. 

Great concept but lacking of polishing to make the game enjoyable in the long run. For now, it's just frustrating as hell and even if i like the game, i just don't want to play anymore.",1670688020,1670688020,False,2,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

The baseline is there: It's a rogueLITE (coming to that aspect later) Kitchen simulator, reminescent of Overcooked, but imo less casual in a couple of ways.

I like the core gameplay: you build up a kitchen, get more customers, more foods, more devices to cook them. But there's automation...and this is where the game loses me completely.

I love the aspect to throw some factorio in there, but the concept just doesn't work out. Imo it is way to hard to come by the parts you need to get the automation going, and even if you grab hold of some of the items you need you almost never get all of the parts requiered to rly get ahead of the curve OR you lack the money to buy them, even if you phone in lots of customers.

All the yt-videos I personally saw were built from seeds with exceptionally good layouts. And so i started to wonder how to get there, but never managed to do so.

I rly dislike the single-player aspect of the game, mostly because of the layouts that don't encourage single player gaming. you almost always need a second player to survive in the later stages (or probably automate the processes which you lack the parts for). Speaking of layouts, there's a couple of layouts that a strickly superior to others, but you need to run seeds to find them. None of the randomized layouts I encountered were anywhere close to some I saw in seeded runs. 

And it's a poor fact that I had more fun watching someone mess around with the game than having it myself, espacially when considering that I always had company to play with, up to 4 players at some points.

The game has a very unclear rogueLITE progression system which is not accesible from any menu. You can only get a glimpse of the overall XP-Bar right after you finished your playthrough. And the communication of the rewards for said XP-progression is non-existent.

I will see if the devs change anything to my liking and I would really love to see some changes implemented.
- Clear XP-Progression, let's see an upgrade window or a progression bar with an item or feature you're working towards
- Easier Automation, cheaper parts, clear despriction what the items are for
- Better single-player experience - specific layouts for singleplayer maybe, or a (task-based?) robot-npc to help you out. (like in unrailed maybe)

Management games are supposed to punish mistakes with reduced income, not a game over screen. It's not easy to learn how your game works when we have to restart from the beginning every time it gets more complicated. This isn't an action platformer, where the total number of gameplay mechanics to learn are very limited. Our hard fought progress is reset so many times because there are so many mistakes we can make, and because the game takes place in a universe where restaurants are required by law to serve any customer that enters it's doors within a limited time. 

Basic quality of life problems. Frustrating progression. So much wasted time from runs ending unfairly. You can lose HOURS of progress for STUPID little things like your character being TRAPPED BY A PUDDLE. 

Roguelike doesn't mean I want to waste my time and doesn't mean I think an unfair loss after a challenging campaign is fun.

It's fun even in single-player mode, and the devs are adding more automation appliances, looking forward to see more. Multi-player mode with 3+ players in a small kitchen are pure chaos and I love it.
Every run is so different than another, progression is subtle but it is there, could be more rewarding or there could be modifiers that could affect the runs as in Hades for example.
Devs are taking care of their beautiful game, updates keep coming, holiday events are cool also!
Also I want to mention that as users we don't need to interact with a seperate UI to start the game or manage the kitchen etc. It is all in the game, that's really well executed.

You must embrace impermanence playing this game because you'll spend hours building and setting up your restaurant only to lose it all due to an angry customer! I have still yet to reach overtime day 4. The furthest I have gotten is OT day 3 and that is a struggle since you don't get any automation will near day 12 at least or later, and then if you can afford it. Honestly, I do not think it is user friendly for solo players. There are NO ROOM for mistakes and if you aren't set up conveniently, you will fail. It gives me rage quit and I am going to take a break for awhile, or until I can get other players, but multiplayer isn't really easier. You get more customers and more impatience so I really don't see how one can succeed unless they come in with great tools at the start.. still no promise for success. Would I recommend? Over all it is a cute game so yeah, but the fail rate is too high and not enough help offered to take advantage of, as in great blueprints.

The most amazing part of Plate Up! to me is that it can be as competetive or as casual as you want. The progression feels fun rather than forced. Every time you 'fail,' you just get to start again after learning something new. In fact, nearly failing the resturaunt is the most fun part for me and my friends. Barely scraping by is way more interesting than sitting around not having something to do. 

All that being said, I think some minor tweaks should be made to blueprint balance (blueprints are the appliances that you can place in your restaraunt). As it stands, I think there should be difficulty options to increase the number of blueprints you receive (without using copy desks or blueprint desks). Furthermore, certain runs it feels like you receive little to no automation.

No. I have tons of ideas, and sometimes the game is annoying as hell. Do I love the game, would I buy it again, would I recommend it? Yes to all three, 100%. This game is cool as hell. Along with Vampire Survivors and Elden Ring and probably either Shotgun King or Backpack Hero, it deserves a Game of the Year slot. Anyways, time for me to serve more salads until I get an aneurysm from dealing with all those ungrateful rat bastard customers. This game allows me to fantasise about still working in the food industry, before my plantar faciitis killed my dreams.

What would I change? A few things. Messes should either save progress on cleaning, or reduce in size at various cleaning checkpoints. There should be an option to unplate things, without using the garbage. Whether this option or the garbage is used, the plate should be dirty, since it just had food on it. I would not object to scaling tips based on how promptly a costumer was severed, adjusted for how precisely the food was not overchopped or overcooked. As in, before it goes to the burnt stage, or the next stage of processing, or customer walking out, the progress bar could have some further meaning. I wish there were either more saveslots, or separate saves for multiplayer and singleplayer, since every time I play with a friend and one of us has to leave before the run is over, I find myself having to either ruin the save we were on, or just not play for a week. I would not object to counters holding either two or four plates, since tables can. Also, being able to stack dirty plates. Either of these might interfere with the frenetic atmosphere the game cultivates though, so I am not so certain on those points.

You get the process management aspect of a game like Overcooked, where coordination amongst players is crucial, so you are all filling your roles and not getting each others way. This can lead to some beautiful runs where you are all exactly in tune, or it can devolve into some hilarious chaos!

You also get the logical aspect of automation of your kitchen, which scratches that itch of anyone who likes games such as Factorio or Satisfactory! To see your kitchen work itself whilst you sit back and relax, is truly gratifying.

Finally, the roguelike aspect of franchising. Even if you don't make it to overtime day 1,000,000, being able to carry some cards through to your next run can lead to some unique and interesting combinations of running your kitchen, so it always feels fresh!

A handful of bad reviews seem to be based around people not understanding exactly how things work. It's fair; if you want to have your hand held through a game then this isn't the experience for you. If you want to figure things out and have a hilariously panicked time doing so, then you'll find satisfaction when you finally manage to set up rudimentary pizza automation.

Singleplayer is 100% doable. It's the only way I've reached Day 15 to unlock the franchise mode. It just takes a shift in perspective to get the restaurant management right. That being said, the chaos of multiplayer (which Steam Remote Play works BEAUTIFULLY for) is a whole new and silly aspect.

My ONLY ask is for a sandbox so I can play around with some of the advanced restaurant loadouts without having to grind my way up to them.

Multiplayer: The major selling point of the game (at least for me). The multiplayer is incredibly fun! I've played this with multiple friends (including one who thought this was just a random Overcooked rip-off) and they all ended up enjoying it! A major perk of this game is the fact that through Steam Remote Share you are able to play this with almost anyone who has a computer with only one person needing to own the game! If you have a group of friends that want to put yourselves to the test with a stressful coop game, this fits the bill perfectly!

Single player: Playing this game alone is both incredibly calming and stress-full at the same time. It's keeps you on your toes at all times while still having an incredibly calming atmosphere. It allows for you to have a fun, long winded run even though you have to manage so much on your own. The ability to automate pretty much everything adds to this as well! It's an overall really fun experience to play a run solo, so if you get this game I recommend trying this out from time to time!

Having the ability to design where things are in the kitchen, where the tables are, where to set up the washing up station (sometimes its better in the tables area than the kitchen!) makes it have so much thinking and evaluation behind it at each level. Add on top the ability to upgrade equipment and counters, as well as having different challenges thrown at you throughout each restaurant run, makes it so adaptable and unique that it becomes a very satisfying challenge to try to beat.

Add in friends elevates that further so long as you accept that your friendship will be tested by the stress! Its very good fun that is a worthwhile challenge that is very satisfying when it goes right.",1669235954,1669235954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PlateUp! is a cooperative or singleplayer rouge-like restaurant simulator and the most fun I've ever had in a co-op game. My girlfriend literally begs me to play this game anytime she gets home, and building a restaurant together is such a great way to spend time with friends or loved ones.

Like any cooperative cooking game, there is a healthy dose of chaos to be had playing PlateUp! Every day an ever-increasing number of customers come in to dine at your restaurant, and in the later days both chef and waiter will be furiously running around trying to manage food, dishes, customer patience, and worst of all the queue outside the door. Scrambling, improvising, and yelling at your coworkers is sure to give everyone a good laugh, but there is also the calm before each storm that gives the strategy-minded folks like myself a chance to analyze, rearrange, and optimize.

Each restaurant is fully customizable (aside from the walls and doors), and additional utilities and tools are available for purchase after each day. Managing money, researching, and experimenting are all key parts to optimizing the space in your restaurant as you acquire new dishes and challenges to overcome. Fully automate dishwashing, toast-making, soup-portioning, and even floor-cleaning for incredible efficiency and an instant hard-on. You're also able to buy practical decorations, wallpapers, and flooring to create the ideal look for your restaurant while minimizing the damage done by [strike] the absolute pigs [/strike] the lovely patrons that come into your restaurant.

Finally, and perhaps most compelling, [i] this game is being updated all the time! [/i] New dishes, bug fixes, and balance tuning regularly, and even full holiday updates for Halloween, Turkey Day, Christmas, and more! The developers and players put so much love into this game and it absolutely shows. My girlfriend and I have played for 70 hours, and we're going to continue to play for hundreds of hours more as we unlock new dishes, enjoy new updates, and challenge ourselves with all the different options PlateUp! has to offer.

Whether you like strategy or just plain chaos, this is the game for you. Grab your chef's hat, grab your friends, and PlateUp!",1669231852,1669231852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PlateUp! trades Overcooked’s short, hectic, and hand-crafted levels for a different approach: you design your own kitchen. That is combined with roguelike elements, giving you choices on new cookware and what perks and dishes to add to your restaurant.

Every choice you make in building the restaurant has one goal: optimization. Every day brings in more customers, so you want to find time savers at every step of the process, be it prepping ingredients, delivering the meals to customers or collecting and cleaning dirty plates. My personal favorites are the automations options (conveyor belts, combiners etc), it’s so satisfying to have a pizza ready to be delivered without lifting a finger.

I’ve enjoyed the game both in single player as well as 2 player co-op, and I think the game works just as well in single player. I can’t imagine how hectic 3-4 players would be, and I would love to have the chance to try that as well.

Some quality of life features are a bit lacking. For example, if you lose and didn’t see which loading bar ran out, it can be a little annoying - a slow down effect and zooming in on the losing culprit would fix this.

Overall a superb cooking game that I can and will keep coming back to!",1669225267,1669225267,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Only complaint is that it's very weighted for multiplayer and playing solo is a grind at best and impossible at worse.
