first of all train collisions cause gameover? just let us manually remove trains from the rail/clear wreckages so that little mistakes dont royally fuck everything

not giving us routers at tier 2 is stupid, basic automation should be cheaper and available at tier 1, basic tools like auto accept trains should be cheaper, doing things manually gets old after your first playthough

the current game meta is just picking the simple contracts and cramming in as many you can until you hit T3 so that you have routers to properly manage your rail network, its really dumb but kinda necessary or you just end up building redundant parts

there is a bug where if you place tracks unpaused the game drops to 1fps and also happens if you unpause with the tracks interface active

the story does a poor job of teaching the fundamental techniques, explaining how things work isn't enough. the experience is very frustrating for a beginner and is why this game has so many negative reviews and only mature gamers such as myself would bother to keep trying and give the game a chance

there should be a mode where you have preset contracts based on what that city would actually need instead of just a bunch or random stuff and your goal is to earn money and build up your network so that you can eventually fill all the contracts and win",1708953863,1709038803,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: If you like puzzle and management games, you will like it: 9/10
UI design: 2/10. The UI is ugly and very basic. Some elements are too big, some are too small. For example, something that you have to build in the game is quite difficult to understand if you are new to train dispatching. You will get a sped up (!!!!) tiny video that should explain the usage of that thing. You really have to squint and watch it multiple times to realize what is happening there.
User interface: 3/10. The building expreience is quite rough...
Story: 4/10. I hated the ""mentor"" character in the story. [spoiler] But plus that, at least, you can betray him![/spoiler]
Bugs: 1/10. Ther are some bugs, but the main issue is that after about 8-10 hours of gameplay every game starting and to have huge lagspikes and eventually your autosave becomes corrupt. And you can't do anything about it because if you do not realize it soon enough, each one of you your autsaves will become corrupt and you can start again.

All in all, I gave the game ""recommended"" because it is very unique and intersting. Aside the problems, I liked it. I hope the developers will fix the bugs and improve the game.

I love the schematic nature of depicting train lines and switches. The game is immersive and I really feel like I'm a train dispatcher and route engineer.

But the game is quirky, and not in a good way. The UI design choices makes the game cumbersome, and the signal logic and train route management system is annoying. It takes a while to unlock upgrades to get better signal automation, but even then, you are stuck with many hours of playing with bad signal logic management. 

The game uses a variety of ""sensors"" to control ""train signals"", which seem unnecessarily complex and cumbersome. This means you just can't tell a train to go from A to B using route X, Y and Z in the train timetable schedule. You also have to ensure the ""sensors"" and ""signals"" are also set up correctly to permit that to occur. 

Its a weird extra step where you are tasked with creating a series of sensor-signal logic gates that must correctly match the train schedule. The complexity of the game occurs when these sensor-signal logic gates must cater to all the different train routes that pass through the signals. The sensor-signal gates are a kind of ""logic test"" to see if your signals can correctly route all your trains to where they want to go. Merely specifying ""Go from A to B via X Y Z"" in the train timetable schedule is not sufficient. Your ""logic gates"" must also be set up to route the train there. It's just a really weird way to route the trains. 

After unlocking the basics, you then get tasked with routing trains that take a long rest at some stations. This can block traffic. So now you need to shunt the trains into a holding area and set up sensor-signal logic gates to permit this to occur. But again, there is a lot of manual clicking before you can unlock the automation for this to occur. 

The game isn't helped by the poorly explained and poorly worded tutorial. There is some improvement needed there. 

I really want to recommend this game. But after 10 hours of playing, the game mechanics start to become annoying. The sensor-signal logic gate mechanic just isn't fun after a few hours. I feel I need a dumber version of this game. I just want to tell the trains to go from A to B via X Y Z and it should just magically happen (just like all the other transport tycoon games).

Secondly, in the 5 hours I've played, there have also been several game-breaking bugs I've come across. For example, ghost tracks that think they are occupied when there is nothing on them. This lead to no trains being able to navigate to these tracks. These tracks can't be removed either. Sensors will also trigger without trains travelling over them which will cause sections of track to close randomly and delay your trains.

Third, when accepting contracts, you are only able to view schedules for up to the next hour. This leads to issues where you might accept a contract that has a schedule conflict several hours later.

Credit where credit's due - the bugs I mentioned have largely been fixed in the last week and the game is now playable on controller. It's jank, but it's playable, yay!
To expand on the jank: B closes signal and sensor GUIs except when it doesn't. X closes the build mode, except when it opens a tutorial instead (which you can only quit out of by loading a save...?). Build mode deconstruction rarely removes what I want, upgrading tracks is confusing at best because it doesn't show what you have selected. The shop button inside building mode doesn't have a keybind for some reason, you need to navigate there with the virtual mouse. Speaking of, you frequently need to use one of your joysticks as a virtual mouse. You can't rebind which joystick controls the cursor and which controls the camera. Especially due to the build mode problems, I don't think it would be fun to play Rush Hour where building speed matters. But it's playable in the freeplay mode, which is what I care about.

That's it on the controller support - playable for freeplay but jank, do not recommend for Rush Hour.

Gameplay as far as I got upon replaying the tutorial is still missing the challenge for me. You gotta time stuff (until you automate it), but beyond that the challenge is in building your rail network. There, the only challenge you get is junction building within the map layout. But you can just criss-cross rails any way you want, so the map layout doesn't really matter, the most simple way to get from A to B always works. I wish there was some extra challenge there, some kind of restriction like not being able to make 8-way intersections (and more. Like there used to be).

The GUI in general is still taking me some time getting used to, but it doesn't seem any more jank than the janky controller support so far. Not good, not unplayable bad, just kind of there and sometimes annoying.

[b]To sum up:[/b] Playable on controller now! Still finding out if there is some challenge in building that I haven't reached yet. Too much jank and too little challenge for me to flip that thumb to ""Recommend"" on my review, especially considering that this is the version they want to do a full release with. 

[hr][/hr]

Original review from November 2023:

I first bought and played this game with Update 6 and 7, in mid 2022. It was fun! I liked the challenges offered by the restricted building options that made my rail network look like something you might find in the real world and made me have to think while building. I liked that it had very few keybinds so I could quickly and easily make a layout for my steam controller and play with that instead of keyboard and mouse. Why is this in past tense and my review negative? Because game updates removed all these features.

The building options were expanded so all junctions, no matter how impossible looking, are buildable now. Now you just build the same 3-way junction you've been building in other games for years, and 4 more crossovers over here and over there and you're good. Easy? Yes. Fun? No.

The entire GUI was updated, they added many more keybinds and controller support. Wait, that should be good, shouldn't it? It would be, if the controller support wasn't broken and the new GUI was better than the old GUI.

Let me illustrate with an example, from when I tried to play today.

A frequent action you need to take is pausing the game. A train spawns, pause while you set the route, unpause to watch it go. A train wants to depart from a station, pause while you set the route, unpause to watch it go. The default keybinds for the game speed are set up so you can only cycle between speeds. But you cannot instantly pause, you always have to cycle over other speeds, either slower or faster than the current speed.

The obvious solution to this is to bind the ""pause"" action, which is unbound by default. That is much easier said than done:

I can't navigate the entire controls menu with the controller, it gets stuck at some point. I spend a few minutes trying to navigate to the pause control with my mouse in a way that also changes the focus with the controller. Finally I get there! I rebind the key and choose the same control as one of the speed cycle controls. So, I should unbind that speed cycle control. It looks like there is no option for that, I cannot remove keybinds. Maybe the game handles duplicate binds? I open a map and try it out. It does not handle duplicate binds in a way that helps: It cycles the time and doesn't pause. Oh and my experimentation delays a train because I'm not fast enough to pause again, so I'll have to reload. Anyway, I'll bind the control to some other key then. Some experimentation later, it seems like the right and left buttons are free, I can use them. I do the dance to try to navigate to the keybind with my mouse again. Finally I get there and rebind the controls.

I sit there wondering whether it's worth the gameplay to spend 10 minutes fighting the UI just to to rebinding a single keybind. And really, what gameplay is there between all the fighting with the UI?

Whatever, I attempt to play. The tutorial tells me to route a train to a new station, so I go into build mode to add rails to that station. The build mode cursor is somewhat broken, but I can work around that and build the rails. I switch to signals to build those. Oh wait, switching to that uses the right and left buttons. Now my game is unpaused and the train is delayed again. I bury my head in my hands. There is no remaining keybind that is free that I can think of. I briefly debate whether it would be possible to just bind both speed cycle controls to the same button. But I still need one speed cycle control to be usable. So that's also impossible. I ragequit the game. Or rather, I press the ""quit game"" GUI button with A which pops up an ""save unsaved game?"" window. I select the ""no"" button and use A to press it. The game shows ""saving"" anyway. A game restart shows that the game was indeed saved.

To sum up, today I had an unenjoyable 15 minutes of fighting the controls and GUI. I made no progress but I have an unwanted extra save with a delayed train due to UI problems. I have no solution for the speed/pause keybinds. I give up.

I tried to give this GUI update and the controller support a try, after one year away from the game. I want to play this game, I want to like it. I really tried. I reset my game and started fresh with the tutorial. I used the tutorial to learn the new keybinds and new GUI, with mild success. I had the game open for roughly 2.5 hours. I encountered and reported 9 bugs in that time, all on the game's stable branch.

I hope these bugs will get fixed. Maybe I will give the game another year again and then give it another try. Maybe the game will have better controller support by then. Maybe they will re-add an option with building restrictions for rails. (No, I can't just restrict myself because I can't remember what exactly the restrictions were.) But that ""maybe"" already failed me once. And that ""maybe"" doesn't make the game playable now, when I have time and interest.",1699100009,1708079968,False,16,1,0.659536659717559814,0,True,False,True

Odds are, because of its niche nature, you may know if you're going to like it or not just based on looking at it. However, if you're still undecided, here's a few reasons why Rail Route is truly a special gem of gaming:

1. There's a great level of control over the pace the game comes at you, especially in Endless mode.
2. Time controls give you a lot of flexibility in pacing as well, 1x (real time) is almost an idle game, very relaxing, easy to do while doing something else. 25x on the other hand is like an arcade management game, almost more like Mini Metro.
3. Overall the UI is really polished and gives you lots of options for how to view the necessarily information you need to keep trains running.
4. If you're worried about Early Access, this game is almost done and feels almost done. I've had one minor bug come up but amazingly the game actually had a tool for me to fix it (station configuration can unassign bad assignments that won't go away!)
5. On that subject, the developers are clearly very responsive and engaged with the community in a way that's really encouraging to see.

Overall, as someone who plays a lot of strategy/logistics type games this is easily one of the best and I can see myself getting a ton of hours out of it.

While I understand the concepts in this game, as a new player, I find the UI terribly uninformative and there is a lot going on right from the start. There are lots of nouns, but very little in the way of verbs. The game is not finished, I understand, but based on forums I've been on, it sounds as if the current UI has grown from something simpler that others have had the benefit of learning before advancing to the current one. For newbies, there is a steep learning curve.

Examples:
it's not crystal clear which way a train is oriented based on the sequential lighting up of the cars.

Is that light sequence starting at the front of the train and moving backwards to show you which end is first, or starting at the end of the train and moving forwards in the direction of travel?  Both locos are just pause icons while stationary. One should be an arrow or chevron or something.  For that matter, why must the player determine which way the train will leave? I'm a dispatcher and the destination is on the contract and out of my control. While IRL, dispatchers probably reiterate the clearance to the driver, it seems a bit unbelievable a driver would get in the wrong end of a train and drive against signals the dispatcher set.

The game also urges you to build more rail, and it works with some quirks but you can't afford signals, at first.  Train contracts have defined departure times, so you have to really space them out to avoid crashes and gain revenue.  No use building a slip track if you can't buy signals. Advice should, at first, be good advice, not urging actions would cause accidents that make the player start over.

This game could really benefit from more specific lessons, like how to build slip tracks and signaling that occurs when you reach the point where this kind of infrastructure is needed and affordable.",1696785739,1696786223,False,6,0,0.578560173511505127,0,True,False,True

When I bought this game, I immediately liked it very much: regular updates, 4 buttons at the left-hand side of the screen to let the magic begin! A simple to understand, clean UI, intuitive track-laying, some contracts and with a cleverly designed and balanced gameplay I was really proud to have finished my first “Endless” map. The ""learning curve"" and challenges during an Endless map playthrough were just perfect.
On top of that, the game features a free demo with one of the longest and (I think) really enjoyable tutorials I’ve ever seen in a game anywhere else. After that, Workshop support was added for even more fun and I’ve enjoyed countless hours dispatching user-made station lay-outs I’ve visited in real life with challenging timetables, just to get the perfect score.

However, a few months ago I decided to start playing this game after quite a long break, discovering that everything had changed. Reloading one of my endless map saved games, I found out that even the most basic features had become a frustrating job. 
Taking a new contract from the list with contracts? Nowhere to be found. 
Rerouting a train? Troublesome… 
Deciding whether a track is 40 km/h, 80 km/h or another speed? No more clean, distinguishable color patterns by default, but the colors all look alike. 
Laying, altering or removing track? Couldn’t get the hang of it…

When reading the discussions here on Steam, they end with either “restart your endless map so you can enjoy the new UI better” (I don’t want to restart them because I liked my previous creations) or “downgrade to the previous game version"" (I don’t want that either, because that won't be supported in eternity).

After about 15 minutes playing, I quit the game, disappointed. Such a shame because I’ve enjoyed this game very much for more than 180 hours before the UI ""update"" came. My sincere apologies for this negative review, I can't recommend it [i]anymore[/i].

 I like that you can play it as a straight dispatcher sim, or you can play in endless mode and slowly expand and improve your network with the money you make from the trains you run. You can play a chill line with a few stations, or a complex mega map showing how the transit sausage gets made. There's good examples of both already on the workshop, even in early access.

The editor allows you to build your own layouts and even model the very tracks that you live on the other side of!

I appreciate the developer's response. I will make a note to myself to re-play and re-review the game in a month or two from now to see if it has improved.

Original review:
I concur with another reviewer about the tutorial being annoying* and the pacing feels off. It either feels too slow and you're sitting on 25x, or things are moving too fast and it feels overwhelming.

I think the core idea of the game is good one. I agree with another reviewer who points out trains are the most fun part of Factorio, so this could be a fun game. But... trains are much easier to figure out in Factorio. The UI in this Rail Route game looks minimalist and simple on the surface, until you try to use it. Then it's a bunch of memorization of left vs. right click for different scenarios, and remembering orders of operation. It's hard to tell which train is coming up next.

I think the devs should sit down a few brand-new players and watch them try to use the tutorial and figure the game out, and smooth out parts that are confusing. Take a cycle to stop adding new features and instead, make the UI more intuitive. If the core UI is fiddly, it doesn't matter how many cool automation widgets you add, it will be too much of a chore for people to pick up the game.

I really do think there is a seed of a great game in here, it just badly needs a UX consultant.

In the early game, all you do is this :  build a track from A to B, click an icon to deploy a train at a station, then click signals and junctions to make that train go somewhere.  That's the gameplay.  Even if a train is doing the same route for the 28th time, you still have to click the same 6, 8 or 15 things for it to find its way.  By doing this, your goal is to collect money and research points.

The money is needed to build more rails and signals, that way you have an even larger area to watch and more signals and junctions to click.  But forget about the tycoon aspect of it.  You have no maintenance fees, no employees to pay, no fuel to buy, none of that.  The worst you can do is cancel all your contracts and even then you wouldn't lose a dime for a thousand years.  You can even deconstruct anything and get a 100% refund on it.  In other words, bankruptcy is impossible.  You are competing against no AI, you are just playing a sandbox game where it's impossible to not make money.

The research points are needed to buy upgrades (new techs).  Sounds good.  Well, many of those techs are literally UI upgrades.  You read that right.  The UI is pretty crappy at the start, you just need to suffer for a while to make it better.  Who the heck comes up with such ideas?  Other upgrades are to buy faster tracks.  That does not change the game at all.  Trains move faster and let's hope that by itself that'll make you happy because otherwise, your situation hasn't changed at all.  Finally some techs are for automating train movement.  So after many hours of clicking junctions and signals, finally you're there, automation.

Turns out the automation in this game is a chore to set up.  You need sensors for automatic signals to really be automatic.  Each sensor has to be programmed by the player.  It's easy to do, but it takes way too long.  If you rebuild partly a junction, many sensors are no longer well programmed.  If you unlock a new station, many sensors need to be updated.  It is very tedious.

Technically, once you have all sensors and automatic signals unlocked, you could let the game run the same 2 fully automated routes for hours (IRL) and come back to -practically- infinite money and research points.  From now on the only point of continuing is expanding the rail network.  But what worked for station A to station B is the same thing Station B to station C will need, etc... You can keep building, but with no real purpose.

Other irritating points :
- You don't own trains in this game!  You only own the tracks.
- Many techs are not intuitive at all to set up and use.  You'll know their purpose if you read their description but you'll not know how to make it all work.
- About my previous point, many tutorials are missing.  That I can forgive because it's early access.
- The max game speed (aka fast forward) could be much higher
- The game price tag makes no sense.  This is a 6-8 dollar game at most IF it offered real game play.

So overall, the early game is a grind to artificially create game ""content"", as you have to sit there and click for hours.  When you finally can automate things you're printing infinite money, but what for?  You already have the good techs anyway, building more rails is just more of the exact same thing you've been doing for hours.

I'm a huge fan of automation games, management games, tycoon games, puzzle games, I even like idle games.  But this game is none of that.  I read other reviews that dared to put this game, Factorio, Railroad Tycoon and other great games all in the same sentence.  I can say I got baited real hard.  I would refund the game, even just to get 50% of my money back, but I played for too long.  Not because I was having fun, I was having none.  But I had to at least unlock all the techs before I knew what to think of it.

The 96% or so positive reviews this game had when I bought it was also a bait.

There's a sort of tutorial baked into the story mode, but I found this experience more on the annoying/frustrating side than anything. The story teller will randomly tell you to do actions, but the pacing seems off. I felt like I was consistently being told to do things ahead of when I actually need it, often times being a distraction from what I was trying to achieve. And even then, there would be hints on the screen, but the icons weren't always obvious what I was supposed to do. The add insult to injury, the story teller will keep telling you what to do on repeat every 60 seconds. At one point I just muted the game and hopped over to YouTube to figure it out.

After abandoning the story mode and trying to put in time on ""endless"" mode, I just wasn't finding the experience enjoyable. The timing aspect is strange, in that, I was finding myself toggling the speed a lot. It would be like, either waiting, and running things at 25x, then a train arrives, and I'd slow it down to 1x or 5x, then quickly speed it up again. There was definitely a feeling of the game being too fast or too slow.

As an example, if you upgrade your track to allow faster trains and there happens to be a train on the network, the train on the old track is stuck on the old track *forever* and will refuse to use any of the track while train after train stacks up. I spent half of the 5 hours I played trying to untangle how the interface works and debug why my trains would get impossibly stuck or a switch would refuse to unlock because I did something I thought the tutorial had told me to do. 

In addition, while working through this tutorial and trying to understand how to route trains, the tutorial every so often throws you into special game modes which have their own set of obscure rules. I gave up when I tried to make an addition to a track in one of these modes as I had in the normal game mode many times, and the game told me the space had 'already been allocated'. It's difficult enough to work through a challenging interface but having to learn multiple challenging interfaces which work in contradictory ways was too much.

If you toggle a track switch to a different direction while a signal has it locked then the previous track past the switch will be stuck green, this prevents trains from arriving on the platform.

Clearly a labour of love. 
Why I didn't enjoy my time:
Sadly, I don't think it's exactly what I expected. I was going in thinking I would immediately set up complex automated routes, but you slowly scale up to this by unlocking upgrades; there's a LOT of early manual switching, and don't expect to have a significant amount of automation for a while.
I also found the route building/map building a little complex to read, as the mountains aren't that easy to see and to understand. 
Finally, I was quite frustrated at the inability to sell a platform bought by mistake; I couldn't use it until I unlocked auto-blocks, that was a shame. :-(

Why I am still reviewing this positively:
There is a lot of care put into this game, and I think it will scratch a very specific itch in people. I think you shouldn't go in expecting a Factorio-like train network set up, which is what I was sold by the reviews of this game.

Pros:
+ very fun and challenging, especially mid-game
+ looks great
+ you can scale how challenging the game gets by accepting more or less contracts

Cons:
- core mechanic - signals - is buggy - if you change a switch on active segment, some segments stay green and are a pain to reset
- it's kinda difficult to see what trains will be starting soon - even with ""improved labels"" the remaining time is small (and may be confused with target hour which uses exactly the same format)
- there's huge speed penalty for single-engine train going backwards while there's no easy solution for turning them around or option to add a second engine
- prices seem kinda unbalanced - you need to grind even for auto-signals which are must-have for anything more complex than track with a single switch
- trains don't automatically reverse on edge stations (which makes them a pain to use for urban transport)
- automation is funky (I've had it stuck many times), not quite intuitive and very expensive - that's a late-game feature

The implementation of the underlying idea simply isnt there yet. This game should be in early access because it most certainly isnt ready for prime time yet. Let me put out a few specific points

- Scoring mechanism: The game deducts points for stopping trains at signals. This is stupid, only arrival times should count. I find myself taking unnecessary detours purely to keep the trains moving, rather than moving them as quickly as possible.
- UI display of trains on long-but-displayed-as-short paths is not good. There is no indicator of direction, and the overlay menu for details is hard to reach - you need to hover over the small red line, rather than the train ID or any related notification icons.
- the mouseover menu for trains is crap. It is huge, poorly differentiated from the background, and doesnt contain pertinent information (will it stop at the next stop or pass through?). Make it small and concise, or big and detailed. But not the current version.
- the notification system isnt good. It constantly pulls me to irrelevant things, and makes it hard for me to focus on details and important stuff. Example: A new train will be a notification icon until I set a signal for it, even if I have clicked it and it just waits at the starting starting for 5 minutes. This is stupid and distracting. I will check this train 5 times unnecessarily and miss the other train moving towards a red signal, causing a point deduction.
- add a log for point deductions. This is probably related to the bad notifications, but I freqneutly find myself with point deduction that I cant explain because I dont catch the small notifications and there is no overall list,
- the overall menu structure seems to suggest that a game is always running in the background and I just need to click the right button. I find this messy. Make a clear distinction! What am I doing at any moment?

after an hour of manually routing trains between 3 stations and taking the very rare red contract that let me unlock basic UI features I got bored.

I don't know if im playing this game wrong but the automation is locked behind a ton of really tedious progression so I feel like im not really even playing the game yet. manually clicking signals/junctions is not fun and I know the devs have a ""unlock all technology"" checkbox but then like, what's the point in even playing?

this game feels like its missing something, like It should be about managing the complexity and iterating on a complex rail network, but instead it's like a plate spinning game where you gotta click the right things at the right time. Other games like this have a loop where you take a complex problem, solve it with automation, and then move onto another problem, this game doesn't let you solve a problem to progress, you're still expected to manually manage the original problem forever I guess until you have all the upgrades in which case you just solve everything at once?

The game's visual style is great, with a good balance between style and minimalism that keeps the focus on the gameplay. It's easy to build your own railway network and manage it efficiently.

One aspect of RailRoute that I appreciate is how well-made it is. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches yet, and everything seems to work as intended. There are some things I wish the game had, like being able to adjust the map size in the editor after initial creation or shunting (there are rumors this is a planned feature??). But the game is still in early access and actively being developed with the help of the community (Discord and feedback website). So I guess some things will still change.

One thing to note, however, is that the German translation is too technical for a casual game, in my opinion. This can be a bit of a drawback if you're not familiar with the technical terms used in railway management. However, the English version is great and easy to understand.

Overall, I think RailRoute is a fantastic choice for anyone who loves railway management games. In fact, there aren't many good railway management games out there, which makes RailRoute a rare gem in this genre. It's easy to pick up and play, especially with the recently added “story” mode (it's more of a prolonged tutorial, I guess). There's enough depth and complexity to keep you engaged for hours on end (if you are a nerd like me).

This both works as train dispatch but also as a puzzle... Things need to move at the correct time and things need to arrive at the correct time. Too early is OK but they will wait the whole time until it's their time...

The demo (which doubles as the tutorial) is through and shows you all the venues of the basic parts of the game as a whole. Game modes, connecting stations, what represents the trains, etc... It's one of THE BEST TUTORIALS I've ever went through. Strongly recommended. ALSO! It doubles as the demo for the game. If you are not sure if you may like the game, grab that tutorial! It will show you enough to know what lies ahead!

This is WIP but you get you bang for the buck, even at full price. If you like what this game has to offer, give it a try. Take the demo/tutorial for a spin and try it. After that, you can also use the 2h extra steam gives to grasp whatever the tutorial didn't touch.
There's no middle for this game. Either you love it (like I do) or you don't care about it (which is fair enough).",1660470109,1676457379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has a clean UI and relatively straightforward mechanics that lend themselves well to creating increasing complicated designs to solve problems. Unfortunately, there are some major issues with it once you go beyond the pretty UI.

The game's controls are borderline awful. You will get RSI from all the clicks required to (re)build intersections and setup the sensors / signals. It does not provide you with tools to make this easier at any point in the game, even though it has a lot of various 'QOL' upgrades that you unlock during play. There are no shortcuts for opening the menus you actually use during play or for things like selecting which entity to build next. There is no undo, or copy-paste support, or even the ability the shift a region by 1. Every time you move a sensor, you have to make sure to do a dance with copy pasting the tables or you have to remake it from scratch and hope that you do it right or you might deadlock your network. Even if you copy paste, you often have to update the settings on lots of sensors / signals because the game does not track the rail network very well. These issues are the major reason I stopped playing the game; my hands started to hurt from all the clicking and controller support is not viable.

The devs have focused on UI (and attempts at UX) over gameplay so far. A pretty game is the result, but its gameplay ends up being shallow and repetitive. They have insisted that this game is not meant to give a puzzle, but rather be an accurate simulator. However, they have taken very few steps towards realistic train network simulation. Perhaps they will be able to overhaul the mechanics of the game later to support this, but I see no movement towards that so far. I have, however, seen them remove several of the limitations that helped drive the puzzle nature of the game (adding all switch configuration options, removing sensors / signal placement restrictions), which has removed a significant amount of the challenge of the game for me.

Most of my thoughts are coming from the perspective of the Endless gamemode. However, I feel that the other gamemodes make my complaints of controls even more relevant because they provide time pressure which results in fighting the controls even more.

As a footnote, the devs have chosen to engage in a shady practice for getting analytics data of putting an opt-out in the settings that is only relevant for the first launch of the game... before you'd even have a chance to opt-out.",1672839665,1672839870,False,23,0,0.625398159027099609,0,True,False,True

There are 3 game modes for every taste:
Endless mode: a more economic approach to the game. You'll have to build your railway network yourself and dispatch trains on that. The more trains you stuff in a map, the better. There are plenty of automation options to help you build a huge network and earning that sweet sweet cash. The trains repeat every hour forever. That's why it's called Endless.
Timetable mode: less management, more dispatching. On usually prebuilt maps you'll have to dispatch a lot of trains for a fixed time period and you'll have to try to keep them all on time, otherwise you'll get penalized and won't reach 100%.
Rush Hour: this is an even more puzzlier approach where you're just gonna get a lot of trains thrown at you and you'll have to somehow lead them to their destination before as quickly as possible, so no accept timer runs out and you lose.

The devs have always been putting in new features, optimizing existing ones, even maintaining a native modloading tool, listening to the community.

But let's talk features.
Rail Route is a simplistic, yet incredibly complex game about being a train dispatcher. You get a schedule, you get control over the rail network. It's your job to schedule all trains to arrive on time. Simple, right?

In Endless Mode, you develop your own network of stations, lay your own tracks, manage your own contracts and do everything at your own pace. This is the ""default"" and most relaxing experience from the offered game modes. It even allows you to develop your own automation strategies for your network!

In Timetable mode, every second counts. Get points for scheduling your fleet according to the timetable, get points deducted if trains have to wait, and try to stay on top of things.

In Rush Hour mode, every realtime second counts - there's no pause button! With every wave, the amount of trains increases, and you'll desperately try to dispatch them to their stations on time. And to top it all off, there's also a leaderboard for that. So watch chaos ensue, or try to stand tall and compete on the leaderboards.

The game also ships a very intuitive, albeit at first intimidating level editor. You can create your own maps, schedule your own trains, and set them up for every game mode as you please. Let your creative passion flow, or recreate the local train schedule - the choice is all yours!

Let's talk rating. I've personally spent a good amount of hours on this game that unfortunately Steam didn't track due to ""offline mode"". But it's a really great game to wait time out and to just relax. The modding community continuously releases new mods to extend the game, the devs keep adding new features and work with their community, and the mappers create custom maps. All of those feature deliver a very consistent relaxing experience that I can only highly recommend.

4/5 Gameplay - simple, but keeps you going
3/5 Soundtrack - it's not bad, but eventually becomes repetitive
5/5 Design - The game looks clean and timeless, and the devs have already announced they want to keep it like that.
4/5 Fun - Some aspects still require refining, but that's to be expected from an early access game. The other parts - automation and scheduling, are incredibly fun already and are still being refined to this day!
====================================================================================
16/20 Total - I highly recommend this game as I expect this game to become even more fun in the future.

Final words: This game is early access and was developed by a small indie team. Some things aren't perfect, and that's to be expected. Ymmv!",1669588958,1669588958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Game has a few drawbacks currently:
- Not able to automate fully (i.e. can't route InterCitys without workarounds because of a missing feature in the arrival sensor)
- When breaking existing routes you have no clue how many sensors you have to fix (optimally would be an automatic fix)
- No possibility to copy routing tables (i.e. at departure sensors)
- You can't see the full timetable of all stations together - it's a bit of a pain managing contracts

But since this is early access and the developer seems to be working on these things (and hopefully expanding the game and features!) I'll be recommending this game.

I've briefly played the Rush Hour and Endless modes but they didn't appeal to me much. It's the timetable mode where this game shines for me. Having the editor as well gives this game so much more replayability.

I've made a few maps based off real world stations/schedules in the UK. There's a few quirks where you need to use your imagination a bit to get the layouts correct and the editing process can be a little tedious at times, but there's nothing worth complaining about.

There's still some additional features I'd like to see, but it seems the developer has either read my mind or already had them on the drawing board so I'll be waiting for those in due course.

Honestly, it's got the same ability to suck you in as Factorio.
Rush hour and timetable can be hard but recently got into endless and the only problem I found was you cannot automate a train to enter a free station when it becomes available, the sensor only works when the train goes over the sensor. so if you have a station that just accepts freight you have to manually set it to the right station.
I didn't know how to use sensors until I played a timetable level with them so that could be on me how to optimize it.

As someone who normally plays the train driving simulators or management games where you build up a train network from scratch, changing it up and acting as a signal and switch operator isn't something I thought I'd enjoy. Clicking signals doesn't sound nearly enthralling as managing a whole transportation business. That is where [i]Rail Route[/i] stands out: it's not a one trick pony that's just about setting signals and getting trains to go places on someone else's rail network!

For those who like the experience of managing trains in [i]Factorio[/i], or building lines in [i]OpenTTD[/i], [b]Endless Mode[/b] is impressively addicting. Rather than just making signals turn green, you get to plan and build a rail network that makes money, kinda like the other transport tycoons, [b]and[/b] get to mess with signals. This combination of the high level management, such as deciding how to build tracks and choosing which contracts to accept (you don't buy trains, you accept contracts to determine what trains run on your line), with the low level management of changing signals is actually really unique and makes for an early game that keeps you on your toes.

As your network grows, the manual management of those signals does get tedious-but that's what upgrades are for! Eventually you can [i]fully automate your entire rail line[/i], perfect for those familiar to making rail lines in [i]Factorio[/i] or similar. Into the late game, you gradually shift towards that high level management strategy, but that doesn't make things less busy. Even with every upgrade unlocked, there's still a whole map to explore, money to spend on track upgrades, and endless scheduling optimizations to get the highest revenue per hour (which directly determines score). Not to mention all the things which go wrong and force you to take back manual control for a few moments.

I [b]love[/b] this combination of [u]transport simulation[/u], [u]signal simulator[/u], [u]tycoon game[/u], and [u]automation[/u]. It's something I didn't even think was possible. If you enjoy even [i]two[/i] of those genres, you'll probably love this too.

And for those who really want just the train dispatching element without the management or automation extras, [b]Timetable Mode[/b] offers the 'proper' train dispatcher experience. This is the part I thought I wouldn't like, but after getting a perfect score (all trains dispatched on time) on all the official maps (I see more maps are on Steam Workshop too!) I can confirm this too is a good experience. The only thing I haven't done much with is the [b]Rush Hour Mode[/b] which seems to be a more arcade experience. That part might not be for everyone.

Overall, the mixture of genres this game employs is a real feat of game design, and means there are loads of people out there who would have tons of fun playing [i]Rail Route[/i].",1664577548,1664577580,True,42,0,0.832179486751556396,0,True,False,True

Excellent relaxing piano music in the background. Really invokes the trains vibe, almost reminds me of that old show Reading Rainbow. The story is really well made and I enjoyed the experience, although I think it can feel a bit too naggy or disruptive at times.

It's hard to compare as I don't know any other games like it. I wouldn't even say I am super interested in train games or played that many before this. Unlike Ticket To Ride, at least it has the right to call itself a train game, and certainly lives up to that expectation. Ticket To Ride is inaccurately named - you never get to actually ride a train. Trains don't even exist in that game, only tracks. So at the very best it is a mediocre train track building game. Rail Route, on the other hand, is honest in what it presents. You truly do Route the Rails and it's a quite enjoyable experience, at least for me.

Altough I really miss the ability to build two faced (Janus) signals and a dedicated story or challenge based campaing mode. 
Some features that would be handy in the future:
- Two faced signals: It gives more felxibility to cover blocks in each directions with less signal to be built
- More different track types based on elecrtified (via catenary) or not - these should also needs to influence trains (steam / diesel-electric/ electric)

- Events: 
*storms; 
*snow (maybe with also the need to order an emergency train to clean the track); 
*accidents; 
*urgent special cargo trains (for example: plutonium or gold carrieges) player controlled just usual but with priority, or just completly by AI and the other trains are set aside by the AI to keep rolling that special one. In the letter case tha player only option is to completly revamp the time table and search for alternative routes; 
*locomotive failures (maybe with also the need to order an emergency train to clean the track and tow it into to the nearest station, also causing serious delay on the network)
*late departure from station due to some medical or police action, and the player needs to do its best to get green signal to that train to reduce the late

- Road vs. railroad level crossings: on OPs (Operation Points such as stations) these crossings are several times manually managed, maybe a later tech should be about it to be automatic
- There are no SOL (Section of Line: so the section of a train line that is in between two stations/Operation Points) based passenger stops. These passenger stops are usually lesser stops for trains than stations and are often part of a SOL, but in the time tables trains (especially passenger ones) are stopping there to pick up passengers.
- Track maintenance: So track sections in that case have a lifetime and a status (perfect, good, medicore, speed limited, heavly speed limited, unuseable) that is changeing over time. The player needs to keep on eye out for these attributes, and if the situation gets worse tha player needs to order a track maintenance unit which will travel trough the selected line and repair this.

The game specifically avoids block signals, and has its own variant of chain signals. I thought that would be annoying but it was definitely a good choice. You're given similar but more manual options, and unlock them as time goes on.

The algorithm that decides what routes to offer is very smart. If you have three stations, and you try to open up a totally isolated group of two or three stations, it won't cooperate. It won't make routes that slot nicely into your network, it constantly challenges you to make tough routing decisions.

The UI polish is excellent. Every mechanic and upgrade is well documented with images and gifs. The map variety is also excellent, there's a range of maps with their own algorithms for providing routes that make each map a unique experience, not just a new set of walls. Maps are very replayable. The rough parts are the story, the music, the voice acting, the cutscenes, and the tech/upgrade tree. All of those except the tech/upgrade tree are optional and can be disabled. The tree is passable in its current state, and doesn't detract from play.

The biggest issue if the difficulty is backwards - the automation that improves things requires purchasing, so everything has to be done manually, and it's frustrating. Having to manually reverse trains that are doing return journeys doesn't make the experience fun or enjoyable, but irritating.

Being able to distinguish the different trains is also grating as they all the same colour - it's impossible to see at a glance which train is which compared to what is on the schedule - only by clicking on them can you get the details - being able to recognise at a glance would greatly help, compounded the more trains there are. 

Laying new tracks down is made more difficult because there are restrictions on placement that aren't clear and the placement it self is not clear where it's going to start end end - you get some coloured square appearing, but there's nothing showing where the actual track will end up, leaving you with bits of track I couldn't see an easy way of removing or undoing (is there and undo?).

The time steps are also oddly paced, 1x is excruciatingly slow, 5x is a jump too far at times - would like more finite control on this.

There are three stages into the game: 
1. No money, no automation, you have to manually set every signal and train. (About 2-3 hours)

3. Got money, got all the tech, but challenge is gone. Boring all the way through.

The last stage makes (re)playing any of the other (endless)maps than your starter map completely useless.

The biggest gripe with the game however is not having enough room for the tracks, signals and sensors. A simple duplex track system is not going to work for most of the maps. 
In the main menu the maps with even less room for the track are called 'challenging' and 'ludicrous'. Optimizing your tracks, schedules and contracts should be the challenge, not fighting the game. Also not being able to lay the track as a '+' is rather dumb.

It has three major modes:  endless, rush hour, and timetable.  

Endless is just that--you start with maybe three cities (at least in the early scenarios) connected by pre-existing rail, and a few trains in the schedule.  You earn money and the first type of experience just running these those trains on time.  Money is used solely for expanding track, buying new platforms (stations)  or adding signals or other enhancements to your rail lines.  Best part--you get full refunds on things you pull back off the track.  You also get green experience--which allows you to acquire upgrades from UI, contract, operations, and automation categories.  You'll notice, however, that some are locked behind red experience.

Also in endless, you will be offered new contracts to expand the density of your schedule and bring more traffic (and more revenue) to you.  Upgrading contract with experience will expand the variety of contracts you can get, as well as give you one-way contracts to award that red experience needed for some of the upgrades.

Rush Hour--I haven't played this much yet, but you get trains getting issued from various stations on the map in every increasing waves.  You have to build track to those stations in order to even have those trains run.  All while doing this quickly and efficiently, as every bit of track used eats time too.  I'm kind meh on this, but I'm sure it'll appeal to some.  :D

Timetable--Oh, as much as I don't care for Rush Hour, I loooove Timetable.  In this mode, there no rail network building--everything, for better or worse, is already built.  You just have to run the schedule...perfectly.  Maps vary in the number of trains to run, the number of stations, the time span (varies from 20 minutes of schedule to much, much longer), and obviously the rail network configuration.  It's pretty much a puzzle, and it's fantastic.  I do like Endless mode, but I spent the majority of my time in Timetable.

Other reviews state this as a Sim/Tycoon and it hits pretty close to the mark.  You essentially take on the role of a train dispatcher making sure that your line runs as smoothly as possible.

With Endless mode you start out small but as you get further along youll gain the ability to automate your routes and expand your network till eventually you have trains whizzing around the entire map on a vast network of switches and automated routing that's incredibly satisfying.

Meanwhile the Timetable mode is more like a intricate puzzle mode where you have to figure out how to get everything rolling on time to get the highest score. (Not personally my cup of tea but enjoyable nonetheless.)

Both modes have full workshop support, so chances are if you don't find a map in the base bundled game you can find one on the workshop - Or if you are feeling especially creative you can jump in the editor and make your own.

EDIT: Recently they added a narrative story (The Story of Jozic accessed by playing the Prague Endless Map) that functions as a tutorial and it does a wonderful job of guiding you through the games systems and even game modes. So below point no longer relevant but keeping it in for history sake.

The only point I can deduct currently is that the ingame tutorial at time of writing this review is not all that helpfull, It functions well enough but they are essentially miniature showcase maps that really don't explain how to use certain functions in the grand scheme of things.  Though this is something that they are aware of and to my knowledge is getting fixed at some point.  (Also to their credit they made a effort to have a link to a very informative youtube series to function as a better tutorial in the meantime in the main menu)

All things being said, Rail Route is a fantastic game to just sit down and relax for nearly endless amount of hours. It can start of a little heavy on the micromanaging but when you get your flow down its a absolute treat and well worth a play.",1630434201,1656332837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can definitely see myself build some systems from time to time, even if there would be no new updates.
But as this is still early access, I'm curious and looking forward to any new content that would be added.

Personally only played the endless mode, which is very therapeutic, if you're a perfectionist.
Try to envision a real life scenario, where people from small villages work in a big city, and overseas traffic also needs to get to this big city for tourism and cargo.
But here you start from scratch and build this system yourself, building your way up with an income per train and progression tree.
The contracts you get offered will eventually give you options to build the railroads however you want, so don't be too shy to turn down the ones that don't fit your vision.

The goal for me was the endgame, where I created an automated system that makes sense and I could just let be.
If you share this goal, the path forward is optional. 
You can either take on a few simple contracts and observe your progress build slowly, which is very calming, and gives you the option to do some other things on the side and pay little focus on the game.
Or you build up to this endgame as fast as possible, which brings challenge and requires you to thoughtfully plan your railroads, contracts and your train schedule to the minute. 

Whatever path you choose, I do recommend working towards the endgame goal.
Very soothing to both work your way up there, and to observe the end result just automate itself with trains planned tightly to the minute.",1653561296,1653571459,True,5,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True

After the initial learning phase, and getting past all the voice acting, there is a very relaxing and enjoyable game-play experience here.  It would be nice if the game explained all the track-building components at the very beginning (or in a document or guide), as that would make it a little easier to understand.  Some of the starter tracks are just a little too basic to be fun at the start.

After getting over the initial learning hump, while playing a map in Japan, the game became very enjoyable.  There's good tension figuring out whether to take a risk and accept a contract, or reject the contract and slowly keep building up infrastructure to make the rail system easier to work with.  Add more signals to create track segments, which when combined with sections of double track becomes a very smooth and organized experience.


ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:

If you like railroad games, especially the ones that have hard routing, then this game may be very appealing.  This is an engineering game, and any experience you might have gained from playing other railroad games might help here.

The limitations the game imposes are a little weird.  Especially how many options any intersection between several tracks can have.  For example, if there was a simple ""Y"" where the rail splits in 2 different directions, there would be a switch between the 2 paths.  But now if you change the ""Y"" to an ""X"", now there will need to be 1 input to the center of the intersection, and 1 output.  When you click on the intersection, which input and which output is selected will rotate for every click, allowing you to choose the path.  You'll have a track that has many of such intersections, and you click on them to choose the path a specific train will take.  Sound complicated?  Yes it is!

But because of this, the direction the track can be going into an intersection and out of an intersection is limited, and because of that, you can't make certain bus architectures that seem like they would be possible.  All this just means that learning the rules of the game can be a little more challenging than it first appeared.

There are other non-intuitive parts to the game such as trying to select a track to make it green - something hopefully the devs will fix.  The game feels a little under play-tested in that regard.

Besides all these shortcomings, the fundamental game is interesting at least.  It's a little over-restricted, a little too puzzle, not enough ""can I just build whatever I like?""  No, you can't.  We have lots of restrictions on space to make it a challenge.

So the end design that is possible might look a little weird and full of compromises.  But that ""let me design something"" itch does get scratched in playing.  The game is certainly interesting, and very hard to describe to any level of doing it justice.  Unfortunately, you may not know if you'll like the game without first playing it, and even then, it may take a while to grow on you.

Cons:
The voice acting is really annoying for me - but the dev tells me it can be disabled, and the voice acting is only there for the initial tutorial.  Thanks for clearing that up!

At about 2.2 hours of playtime, I realized I might still be able to get a refund, but I was enjoying the game too much to stop.  I am certain I've only scratched the surface, but what I've seen so far I have liked, and I'll keep playing this for a while, I'm sure.

But is the game fun?
The game is minimally fun.  It's challenging, but the game cuts its own throat.  It doesn't have any nice graphics to make up for it either, so it becomes a bit more brutal than other railroad experiences.  If you make a mistake you'll be groaning.  The game likes to punish.  The only hope I have here is that as new pieces are unlocked (slowly) that the game will become less brutal, but the way it is designed, in early game, it plays fairly hard with very little joy to be had.  Only die-hard enthusiasts will enjoy this game from start to finish, and average game-players will likely be turned off.  I would not recommend this for anyone who has never played a railroad game before.

Part of what makes the game so brutal, is that a successful route can't be watched to wait for new coins to come in, like most railroad games.  Instead, random trains appear that want a specific destination, and you have to lay track or figure out spaghetti routes to get the train where it needs to go.  After it finishes, there will be another random train for you to go through the whole process again.",1650330510,1651088018,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

The problem I just can't get over is that it's a little complicate for someone who doesn't know trains and routes and train timings.  It's so easy to get yourself into a jam, because a train will sit at a station for 5 minutes while you're being bleeped at to get another train going. And, once you get your trains have jammed up, you can't unjam them without restarting (or if there is a way, that isn't included in the tutorials).

The tutorial is funny --- the first time -- but there's no way to turn off actors' voices if you want to go through the tutorial from scratch.  And, after the first ""chapter"" of the tutorial, the game pushes you into a challenge that is too far forward.  (again no way to turn the voice off while you figure out things).

DEVS: I think this game is soooo... close.  My advice as an absolute noob is to build a tutorial path from beginning to expert - teaching one skill at a time before introducing rush hour.  You had me building what I'd consider complex paths and switches without really showing me how to build routes that cross or have to turn around.  i still don't understand why I'd place an auto-switch.",1650833533,1650833533,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

I tend to find I end up getting addicted to one, maybe two games that I play endlessly which are the crowning jewels in my library. Rail route is a solid game in its early access state, but there are a few niggling things that keep me from adding this to the list of crowning jewels. 

The main premise is you must rout trains through a network, and in some cases this is a network you build and manage. There are three to four game modes, each of which are highly engaging and provide a slightly different experience over each other. Each of those game modes has a myriad of maps which you can play. Most are finite, but one game mode called Endless allows you to continue playing on a set map and really juice the efficiency and layout out of it, and it seems this is where most development time went into, and is what rail route was meant to be. 

The niggling elements include some restrictive UI elements for the contracts and timetables. The UI is inuitive and easy to get a grasp on. However, its restrictive particularly in the following case: once you unlock the perk to edit train schedules, its hard to figure out and schedule different trains, since you are restricted in your view for the entire timetable. Sure clicking through each station and figuring out when train A will arrive and depart so as to slot in train C is part of the fun, but realizing one of the trains in your network isnt meshing well with the entire system, and not being able to edit the following train in that contract can be a little irritating. 

Sometimes, scheduled trains appear WAY ahead of schedule! I'm not sure if this is a glitch but there have been numeros times where I see a wide gap in the timetable and add a new train in, only to be surprised by another train due in another 30 mins charging through the coachyard gates and smashing into the new train!

Also the more finnicky nature of sensors and automation is hard to grasp, especially at first. Placement is crucial so as to keep trains running at top speed but sometimes trains spawning from off-map anticipate a red signal and brake anyway. You can't edit the sensor placement on these stations, which means you are stuck with inefficient (though admittdly non consequential) train speeds

[b] **The game is a blast to play, especially for those who've always loved the idea of running their own rail network. There's a few elements that are finnicky or have issues, which keep this from becoming truly addictive, but overall a really well done game!**[/b]

I thought that I'd get out of the tutorial and it'd be fun, I thought I'd get the first few upgrades and it'd be fun, but I just found it beyond tedious. In over a half hour I felt like I'd made no progress.

Stuff like the auto-reverse and auto-dispatch seem like things that should just be in the game by default, it's added tedium for the sake of it. Maybe if the upgrades like that were dirt cheap, like one token or something, I would've made it further, but as is I just wasn't able to, I have better things to do than reverse and dispatch trains manually.

Overall I felt that the tutorial was well produced but lengthy, and was also disappointed and a bit frustrated when I was still confused at times after spending so long on it. I think the main culprit might be the voiceover, it's nice that the it's there, but, like, just get to the point, I don't care if you step out to take a break or are retiring or whatever, just get on with it, I'm trying to enjoy a game here. It really felt like it was getting in the way.

I also think that if the game remains as it is, there needs to be a sandbox mode. I wasn't even able to see what I was missing out on by not spending a half hour unlocking basic functions of the game.

The basic concept is pretty straightforward: manage trains through a set of stations, making sure nothing's late and everything is stopping where it needs to. There is, unsurprisingly, a series of upgrades and unlockables that one gets access to as you progress. Most of them are pretty straightforward: more advanced signals, train sensors, faster tracks, ability to manage more stations. But a few are more interesting, and I think set the game a little apart from others. You have interface upgrades that provide more information on the trains themselves (so no digging through menus for information). You also have upgrades that let you adjust train schedules after they're set (need to bump a departure back five minutes to make things smoother, or switch to another track?).

More crucially is the existence of two separate game modes: Endless and Timetable. TImetable is perhaps the more obvious kind; tracks and schedules are pre-defined and you have to handle the oncoming business as best you can. There's a finite amount of time and points to earn on any map. The Endless ones though are more interesting: here you are presented with a whole collection of stations (upwards of fifteen on some maps!) and then the opportunity to slowly link them together. As you do, more contracts become available to route passengers and cargo to them, one by one. 

Finally they do a few interesting things when it comes to trains. Sure, you have a collection of scheduled trains you can set up: local commuters, fast intercities, looping circle lines. But you can also get one-off freight and passenger trains. These are often trickier to set up, since some of them will want to stay at a platform for HOURS, and if you're not careful that can cause knock-on effects.

About my only complaint with the game is that I'd like the sound design to be a bit more indicative. There's warnings if a train is waiting at a signal, but I'd like some little touches when I'm zoomed right in tight. Things like a chunk-chung chunk-chung as trains work through switch points, a little hiss of brakes as a train comes in to a station, maybe a departing chime (different ones for different classes of train, perhaps?), maybe a horn when a train's moving out of an autoblock area?

It sits somewhere between a full-bore city sim, and a puzzle game. I don't hate it -- played for 50 hours as of review time -- but I don't love it either. I already feel close to putting it down after only a few days of ownership.

In ""Timetable"" mode, there are pre-built tracks/stations/signals/etc., and your goal is to route trains between them according to a pre-defined timetable. This mode is quite intricate. If you insist on perfecting it, it could keep you playing for hours. This mode plays more like a puzzle game. Even the ""basic"" and ""easy"" difficulty level challenges aren't trivial. I often start and stop time, or run it slow, to make sure single-track areas are shared timely by two or more trains. Your score is reduced both for serious errors like running through a switch or running two trains in the same signal block. It's also reduced for forcing a passenger train to slow or stop at a signal -- even if it ultimately makes it to the station on time. Even though I've spent less time in this mode, I think I enjoy it more. One complaint about timetable mode is that it's not always easy to see when you've incurred penalties. It's frustrating to play a round all the way through, thinking you have a perfect score, and have one lone penalty from early in the round. With that issue fixed, timetable mode could be a complete game. Timetable mode is more like a better Train Crisis, than it is a city sim. This is the best mode of Rail Route, in my personal opinion.

""Endless"" mode is more of a build and run type mode. You are given a map with few rails built, station sizing and locations pre-defined, and you have the opportunity to craft a network in response to demand. ""Endless"" reminds me of Mini Metro. You don't get to directly influence the map -- demand comes from where it comes from. However, your choices impact your profitability and your ability to gain new technology. Contrary to its name, Endless... isn't necessarily. If two of your trains crash, your game stops there unless you load an earlier save. Endless mode is frustrating to play, because it's challenging to build large, safe networks on the included maps. Owing to the puzzle aspect of Timetable mode, the game tries to make it easy to reason about things like how tracks work. This leaves ""Endless"" with limitations that make it frustrating to play. The mode prevents you from building systems that are both understandable AND efficient. ""Endless"" feels like an afterthought, and if you start there, you MIGHT be disappointed with the game. I was, until I tried Timetable.

Common junction types like diamond crossings are impossible to build. Space is too limited, owing to the shrunken scale of the maps, for large-scale use of double-tracking. Even maps that are intended to emulate large cities all but force single-tracking. This leads to both safety issues and random deadlocks, and prevents you from building a truly massive-scale system. The game has really cool technology that lets you model Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC), like sensors that direct your trains along the tracks. The reliance on single-tracking makes it difficult, even with the tech, to scale up to more than 5-6 trains at a time. Sensors and signals, like tracks, take up too much space to be utilized to their full potential. I played a lot of Endless, until I got good enough to make it to the high-tech phase... then I quit because it wasn't possible to use the technology the way I wanted to.

Overall, Rail Route is a good game, but Timetable mode is definitely more built-out. If you're looking forward to a railroad builder, hold off and see if it develops into that.",1640769497,1640769497,False,9,0,0.574384212493896484,0,True,False,True

It has very minimalistic graphics that are basically what a real train dispatch terminal would look like
and the music is so basic, that you better turn it off.
But the game itself is nice. It allows you to be a train dispatcher. Build your tracks to connect stations
with (usually) very limited space around.
So you need to be efficient with the space you use for that.
At first, you need to manually switch every single signal, which is cumbersome.
But the game let's you upgrade your automation and UI to get rid of the laborious tasks
and the natural limit of contracts you can handle manually.
Mid- to endgame, you will have a mostly automated network where you can tweak everything
to keep it going smoothly as you extend it even further.
Figuring out how to optimize your tracks, signals and contracts is part of the game.
On endless maps, there is no real goal, except maybe get all the stations hooked up and
get the whole network running smoothly like a swiss watch with denser and denser time tables.
The start of each map is a bit grindy, as you desperately need a handful of upgrades first,
before you can meaningfully adjust the network. But after that point, it's working towards the next upgrade to
make everything bigger and better.
And more stuff is coming, as it's in EA right now.

The game mechanics are straightforward and the basic concept or objetive is simple.
The level of complexity regarding the management of the train routes is neither low enough for it to become repetitive early on, nor too high for it to become unnecessarily hard and not enjoyable.

If in future updates or releases, challenges or objetives were put into place, the experience may become slightly more engaging. As it is, the game is optimal for a relaxing experience, provided one likes the type of game.
This is not recommended for all casual users.

Regarding the editor or map creator, I would like it to become more dynamic by means of rotating the platforms by 45 degree increments in order to have a better looking map with shifting routing instead of an all horizontal station disposition.

I can't really say anything bad about this little gem, if you like trains you probably already own this, if not. GET IT, it's worth every penny they ask for.

Devs very actively respond to feedback and actually implement changes based on this. For an early access game that is absolute gold.

Patches and communication are on a regular basis and the game is already very complete with almost no bugs at all.

Unfortunately, it's just not for me, I suppose. I do like games like Transport Tycoon, Airport Tycoon, Parkitect and other games like that so I thought I'd like this game as well.
But it's very tedious, especially in the beginning. The learning curve is very steep and it's just not a lot of fun. There is a lot of manually setting sign and switches to earn some XP to spend on upgrades. Perhaps when fully upgraded, it's nice.
I thought it would be more of a management game: lay the correct tracks, set up schedules properly et cetera, but you have to control every switch and sign yourself and it's really cumbersome to me.
Also, the music is just terrible (I apologize to the composer), it really works on my nerves. That's a personal opinion of course.

For example, rather than setting all the stations manually, the game should allow you to choose a start and end station and then produce a list of all the stations on that route. The list should tick where you want the train to stop (as well as on all stations tick for an all stations service) and what it should do after it reaches the end point, either run another timetable (i.e. a return service) or go to a coach yard (which also should have the ability to be double ended to allow trains out in both directions).

It is one of those relatively few games that may simulate the learning of a new and challenging profession for those now retired or otherwise away from the actual work force.  It provides a non-trivial, interesting task to learn and then master.

The game can apparently be played in two ways:  a relaxed, creative way like a sandbox (with ""endless maps""); and a challenging, score-keeping way (with the scored ""timetable"" maps).  

Make no mistake, this can be played as a serious challenge.    After 6 hours of play, and after watching an informative series of YouTube videos linked from within the game, I am trying to score 100 percent on what is arguably the easiest of the scored timetable maps: Wakefield (I believe it's called).  

So far, after repeated attempts, I've gotten my score on this one simple map up to 96 percent, but still not reached perfection (which is rather humbling).   The effort to reach perfection on this map has also slowly grown my understanding of how to play and interpret the user interface.  (UPDATE: finally, at hour 6.4, Wakefield is perfected.  On to the next map.)

I'm not important, but my point is: this is a game where patience and perseverance may bear fruit if the game seems, at first, to be hard to understand or too difficult.   

There are many maps, and many that seem much more challenging than the map I referenced.  That gives an idea of the huge replay potential I am now clearly sensing.

This is the perfect game for that: it scratches my brain in al the right places: the train, signals and stations mechanics are very intuitive and offer a very open-ended experience that will definitely vary from player to player, which then gives a surreal sense of control and makes each experience personal and unique. This also adds immensely to the game and the levels' replayability.
The contract system is an almost flawless way of seamlessly and continuously evolve the game. However, certain aspects of this system can be improved, such as locking contracts that contain far-away stations that a player isn't likely to unlock yet. That would help a lot because these ""inaccessible"" contracts would then not take up too many contract slots, the number of which can also sometimes seem limited when you're trying to save up for a new route, new tracks or new auto blocks to optimise said contract before accepting it (which will often result in several pending contracts taking up the contracts slots). But really, this is just a very nit-picky modification I would personally make to an otherwise perfect system.

The two biggest faults i've found so far.
1. The game auto-accepts contracts, even when you don't want it to. 
2. Every train needs to be micro-managed, until you earn enough points to buy automation skills. EVERY time a train gets to a train station, you need to MANUALLY tell it to turn around, then MANUALLY change the signal system to indicate the track is clear. You CANNOT remove signals at train stations, or tell trains that the entire line is their own and to just loop automatically.

This second point is a game-killer. Makes the beginning of the game extremely tedious and boring.

Depending on how you play, it can be very hectic or a very relaxed game. Extending tracks can be hard, because, like in real life, there are restriction. You cannot just put your track where you like.  When you gain money and experience points, you can ""buy"" game upgrades,  starting simple like an function to reverse a train direction automatically to high speed tracks, tunnels and so on. 

As you play, it starts relatively simply but it soon will be very complicated to keep it all running and you easily can make a stupid but very expensive mistake.

You will need some strategic thinking and make choices on how you like to play the game.

The graphics is simple, it is not a fancy 3D game, but it does not bother me at all. 

The present version is early access, so you may run into issues, but the developers follow what happens in the forums and discord, and at the moment there are frequent updates.

There are three game modes you can play:

- In endless mode you get an unfiished rail network and you must struggle to gain experience and money to develop the network.
- In timetable mode, your tsk is to bring a predefined number of trains timely to their destinations. For each train you get some points, but you loose points if you stop for a signal or if you are late and a lot of other flaws in your operations.
- The last game mode is the editor. You can create you own network, either as endless mode game or timetable game and share it usig the workshop, 

I should note here that already a fair amount of workshop networks are created and shared. 

If you like trains, puzzle games and a bit of management, this game is for you. But you also need to like a relaxed game play. It will help you a lot to keep grip on what you are doing.",1624987969,1629229966,True,4,0,0.555550456047058105,0,True,False,True

As a transport worker, I've grown an appreciation for all the hard work signallers do to keep our systems running. This game allows me to experience part of what signallers do on a day-to-day basis. With the ever-expansive community base I can see this has a lot of potential

Feedback from me:
Clean, simple UI. Default UI size does need to be larger, and ideally set as a scaled percent of screen resolution. Would also like the option to span across 2+ displays in full-screen mode (a workaround for now is to use windowed mode and manually extend the window)

A useful feature which is partially implemented (from what I've seen anyway) needing further development is syncing progress between gaming platforms (i.e. show the exact same progress synced between Windows and Mac if you've got both for example), so that you're not duplicating sessions, re-completing/finishing a session you've already completed elsewhere, and/or being able to return exactly where you left off regardless of which OS/device you're using.

Rail Route is the light, puzzly, clear cut, good looking, gamey cousin to the heavy dispatch simulation games.

As a rail and distpatch afficionado, it is easy to get into. Much easier than serious non steam Dispatching Simulation games, which are more set in stone an strict rules. 

And the easy access is good. I like the others a lot too. But Rail Route is a much needed different approach to dispatching. Build, expand, make efficient, populate with traffic, watch it play out, rebuild, retrafficate. In whatever order fits your fancy, within your ingame financial limits. Tracks cost money, unlocking steps of efficiency have costs too.

I have only played the Endless map mode, which have glued me to the screen. I have not touched neither the editor or the other game mode. Yet.

I am a particular fan of the fact that I do not have to create the traffic myself. While playing, it is instead offered to me randomly in the form of passenger or freight traffic contracts. It is tedious and not fun, for me, to spend endless time creating train schedules. So to have it offered like this, is a BOON.

Rail Route is a game developed and published by Bitrich.info

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Rail Route overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay sandbox game and to play in short bursts

It's more of a problem-solving game where you build train lines between stations and accept (or deny) new contracts of trains running on your rails and signals. Sounds easy, yeah? Wait until you try to make a double-tracked four-way intersection and you fail on your logic and make a clusterduck of trains going into a deadlock and you need to manually fix the situation, with your money disappearing into millions of debt because of delays.

Overall, to be a EA game, it's quite polished and I didn't encounter any specific bugs. The downside is that it gets boring after a few hours as you've unlocked everything and the only thing you can do is to expand. Once the signaling becomes complex, it's also hard to manage e.g. signals that you can't duplicate logic on (re-making each logic for each track on a station is tedious work and easy way to make an logic error screwing things up).",1625078984,1625078984,True,10,0,0.665260672569274902,0,True,False,True

The game is a game, so don't expect a full featured dispatcher simulation but the elements currently available are fun and easy to understand.

The tutorials are the most confusing and unhelpful guides I've ever seen. They did not explain at all how to properly play this game, which was already confusing because it is a very dense micromanaging game, where you NEED to know whats going on.

After somehow getting past the tutorial (by clicking randomly at boxes outlined and hoping the correct thing happens) I started the first level. 

ON THE FIRST LEVEL THE GAME BROKE. I sent a train from one station to another, issue was that the train had to get to a third station via a second station that sat in the middle of the route. so I send it to the second station thinking I will just reverse it at the second station and send it up to the third. Well it gets to the second station and refuses to move. I don't understand this, it had to get to point C via point B, so why did it sit there?

It is fun, a bit chilled (with some stressful moments) trying to manage and run a section of railway.

The in built editor will mean that there will hopefully be a massive amount of user generated maps to keep this game going. I may even have a go at creating a couple.

For the developers ""first game"" this is a well polished and well thought out game, sure I can think of a few things that might need addressing but most of these are quality of life things like being able to adjust the font size (default is pretty small) and also controlling how many autosave slots and maybe the frequency they save at? After playing for a few hours I had a massive list of Auto-Saves that I just ended up deleting. Also being able to name a manual save when you first create one would be nice. At the moment it just saves it as the ""map name"" (like an autosave) then you can change the name later.

In endless mode you are the builder of your railroad empire. Starting with basic railroads and a few stations you try to fit more contracts into your schedule.

A very well-made game, which presents a new take on the train dispatcher sims genre. In Rail Route you can not only direct traffic, but also build the rail network itself.

I really like the idea, it allows you to adjust your own difficulty level, because you are the one that decides how many trains you want to operate on your network. It also adds a completely new level of management: you have to connect stations by yourself, design rail layout and all the signaling and that makes this game really unique.
