Its a game i've kept diving back into over the years though and lately been giving it a good go. Its fun to build a vehicle and drive it out to battle against other players. The catalogue is big for building, you'll never run out of ideas... It reminds me a bit of those old mad max movies. Armed and ratted out vehicles... on steroids. It has had a decent amount of work done to the game over time from what i can make out.  Campaign and story options to get away from the pvp side of things, makes a welcome change. And i like the option to go on various team missions of 4 up against computer controlled enemies. The clan v clan things seems to be a well established community, not that i have done much poking around there (0 time to commit to online community stuff these days). Graphics do the job. The music, Nice work definitely keeps me tuned in, from one producer to another...

It always seemed like the other team always had a larger player advantage resulting in one-sided battles. However the game has improved in recent years.

In Scrap Patrols it is 8 players V 8 bots and is so much fun. Also the addition of an ultra tiny open world adventure map called Awakening (take crossout's standard PvP map and make it four times bigger and with no time limit for how long you can stay there, so stay as long as you like with never ending group tasks) is a fun little area to goof around with four of your friends, show off builds, and just in general destroy stuff without any repercussions and reckless abandon.

Second is the battlepass sounds good in concept but screws over every new player or those who haven't finished the season they won't be able to acquire newly added parts since it's behind a pay-walled time limited event then the recent changes to you can't craft any of the items after the season unless you have those limited blueprints. Like there was a time when they added factions and items and didn't paywall them now it's just battlepass exclusive and only items that don't get that treatment are relics since people just cough up $800 for them.
Third is clans and weeklies, they stripped weekly challenges from casual and new players, it gave players a chance to getting good parts but that got taken away from them and locked behind as clan weeklies no doubt devs want more noob fodder and sealclubbing for their top clans in clan wars and their new mode confrontation, a change that nobody asked for          they better revert this change if they don't it's gonna hurt this games player base.

I won't go into details but with its unique power score system building your vehicle is a really intricate process and have myself spent up to 3 hours on 1 vehicle
the powerscore system is like skill based matchmaking except based on your vehicles equipment and parts
even decoration parts give you a scrap bonus 
encouraging you to make your car look better instead of a boring brick with a gun on it
it's weapons, cabin special abilities  and modules all add to it's incredible building system that even if you just do the short campaign is worth trying out for the free price tag.

and if they come out with a vehicle dlc you like go for it as not only do you get a free vehicle preset but every part used comes with the vehicle with some of the parts usually the cabin are completely unique to that dlc with their own perks and characteristics.

Every weekly reset, you unlock a new set of weekly and daily challenges. These challenges are retroactive (If you miss previous weeks, you can still complete those challenges after completing the most current ones) Completing battle pass challenges are the only way to level up in the pass.
In all past battle passes, completing all challenges will complete the battle pass and give you a few more levels after that. In the current battle pass, completing every challenge lands you a little short of completion, requiring you to spend more money buying levels to complete it.

Buy a battle pass.
Buy an elite battle pass.
Buy coins.
Buy Cross crowns to buy coins.
Buy vehicle packs.
Buy storage because you cant hold the parts from the vehicle packs.
Buy ""blueprint space"" because you cant save your builds.

I have bought this game back when it WASN'T F2P. Since then i've had a cycle of getting bored with the grind(which was unbearable even when it was a paid game), uninstalling for a couple months and reinstalling, because i truly wanted to like it. But each time i reinstall it, i keep it on my PC for less and less time. Last time i literally played it for couple of days, made almost no progress, and all of the cool stuff was so far away from me, i just uninstalled to free up the space. 

Now came the time for me to reinstall it again, and i looked for any, ANY improvement, any reason to reinstall it, any bit of change to grab on to and enjoy this game for at least a while. And i failed. They may be adding new content, it's not like i can get in and check it out, because by the time i farmed enough to try it, they'd have 2 more major content updates, and i am not saying that because content updates are frequent. And now i hear that even if i got through all that grind all that waits on the end are tryhards and possibly even pay to win.

So yeah, even though I felt like reinstalling it, i didn't, and i doubt i ever will, because i know that after 2-3 matches the grind will hit me in the face again and i won't touch it for couple months AGAIN.

Everything I had achieved is gone and the game is now filled with micro transactions.  Changing this to a down vote, and never coming back.

EDIT 2: THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY A DOWN VOTE. I have revised my vote after speaking with the developers, however the text below is unchanged.

Alright so, I have been looking for a game like this for EVER. I'm going to be perfectly honest here.

I found this game and was ecstatic. Couldn't wait, PAID for closed beta. After about 50 hours of AMAZING gameplay/building. I made it to level 17. Unlocked leviathan. Was ecstatic again. Loaded a game, ANNDDD it was virtually unplayable. I wen't from being able to go in to a game and destroy almost every bot like it was scrap, and to do this I didn't even need to come near the part/power limits. To not being able to put enough parts/power on it to equally match those I'm pitted against. Cannons 5-10x the size of mine, mini-guns against my little vector. THAT is the difference between level 16, and 17. I made it through to 16 personally too fast, and now 35 hours later. I'M STILL AT LEVEL 17. I barely level up each game even IF I manage to get a couple kills, and even then my weapons are so pathetic I feel like I'm just taking those kills from my bots. This game went from WAY TOO EASY. to WAY TOO HARD. Not in a challenging I wanna keep trying and eventually win way either. More of a , what the **** where did this come from? A little progression towards this would be great. I went from blowing through the levels 3-4 games and I'd rank again. Now, as I said, 35+ hours at level 17. Goodbye, new friend.

BALANCE THE GAME.

EDIT: Also let me say this again just to clearify. I LOVE THIS GAME. Last week I'd have recommended it to anyone.  However $30 to spend that much time waiting for matches, and run in to such an imbalance not even half way through the game. At this point it's not even fun to play and try to earn those items becase I don't want to make the next person feel the way I do. (ESSENTIALLY: I'm not going to just sit and grind so once I have those weapons I can do the same thing to someone else.) Make the game fair. No one wants a battle too hard, OR too easy.

When you ask for money to keep working on a game. I surely hope your goal is to make the game what the payers want. If you want to make a game all on your own all your ideas, USE YOUR OWN MONEY. Or ask for it, after it's done, not before.

STOP Recyleing old packs and reselling them for new ones
make actuall good content and stop milking the playerbase that is left ...



unbalanced

instead of fixing the existing problems they just nerf stuff around it to try to resolve the issue

rigged pvp brawls

""pay 2 win"" 

very slow progress and relic weapons cost arround €150+ 

toxic playerbase

instead of adding good content to games they just resell overpriced recycled packs to you

a single lag can fuck over your entire round

the driveing physics are bad

people exploit the shit out of the game

developer added a way to get a limited paint by recycleing paints
the gold paint went from 17k coins to 8k coins in a few weeks
the gold paint was a reward for playing the alpha and could be sold on the market and bought by other players

stash size is limited to 1000 parts once you upgraded it to the max
but they keep adding new stuff 
and you cant collect more

they still havent fixed or addressed the issues with sideway builds or wedge builds that can lift you up and drive arround just pressing W all the time even thoe youre build is like 20.000 Kg

In the beginning it was a fun vehicle shooter where you could build whatever ride you felt like, for the most part. Sure have always been able to buy better stuff faster but that has with time become more and more important. Today you pretty much have to do that because you are teamed up with and against people that have so much better weapons that you do. Forget about the power score, that doesn't mean much. This is pay to win on steroids. You're queueing a small car with shotguns or machine guns and are teamed up against railguns that are what tier 3-4 or something. Ludicrous. 

So you can get better and buy better parts right? Yes but it takes literally ages. And during that time you will be steamrolled into the dirt over and over. Just not fun.

In it's base form there is a good game. Fun, nice physics and destruction models but it's all destroyed because of pay to win, bad matchmaking and grinding. Such a shame.

Edit after dev response:
Yeah, all those points are addressed in my review. 

Yes you can obtain the parts without spending real money. But that takes ages and during that time you are steamrolled by people with better parts all the time. Not fun.

Matchmaking, yes, that sounds good and all but the advantage of having better weapons is greater than having less durability. People are making glass cannons and are very effective doing it. So power score doesn't mean much as I said. It would have been wiser having matchmaking in tiers instead of by power score so you don't get steamrolled by people with better parts.

Sorry, not convinced at all.

Oh and I guess I missed mentioning that paying for the vehicles that you can buy with real money are very expensive. Pretty much all of them cost as much as a full game on the PC.

Find one janky build you like and dick around with it to run threw the daily/weekly checklist untill you get bored or frustrated and come back in a day to try again or a week to make another janky build.
I don't like the combat because it's slow until you start running up on purple parts, where you cannot do damage and get instagibbed until matchmaking decides to bump you down till you win one and then put you back against the middle of the leader board. It may take anywhere from a day or two to craft one purple part and it's better to just sit on it for easy materials rather than try to make it work against people who have overpowered builds they've spent years building up. 
I don't like the game as a whole because it is first stingy, second cheesy, and third falls into the timewaster catagory of world of tanks ripoff where you get one life and there is no over all progression beyond what you have in your parts storage. I'd love to have a caravan of desserts of karak style vehicles that house people and build/carry my cars, the lore already has people doing that so there might be missions where you defend escort or rescue the stragglers that might save or destroy/kill vehicles and personel from other player's fleets. With gameplay effects like carrying several cars into battle (respawns) or building parts for you wager in conflict (salvage and vehicle permenance), or artillery.

What I mean by not terribly balanced is that the whole game seems to favor melee weapons on almost impossibly fast builds or heavy ordinance on almost immobilized ones over any other build.
Overall, though, it has a nice scenery selection and, despite what others may say, is not pay to win, it is pay to PROGRESS, as anyone can have access to any weapons that are in packs without buying the pack, but buying the pack gives a surefire way to get these parts without spending 10 days earning the coins to buy it or getting the parts to craft it.

Amendment to the review: 
During the past while of playing, I've discovered that a majority of times, I seem to find myself alone in my build versus a whole enemy team, as if the matchmaking is favoring the other team's powerscore over my team's. It leads to issues with the gameplay, making it tedious to play, and above all even more tedious to grind. This is already a grind-heavy game.

I'd say this game still has potential to be great but unless they ease restrictions and let us do more grinding or get more from grinding I do not see the average person who plays this staying on for long - the devs need to pull their socks up and just allow their fan base who want to regularly play this game to grind less for the same stuff or grind more each day; these limitations are supposed to stabilise the in-game market but I feel that the limited early/mid game weapon/item customisation for your vehicle is very restrictive as a result.

The vehicle combat part is good, the problem is entirely the insanely greedy and downright stupid monetization system. Rn for example, you could spend 100 USD to get 7500 coins, and that wouldn’t even buy you a full top tier vehicle. 100 fucking dollars, for not even a vehicle, in a game worth 40$ tops. Beyond that, there’s a 10% tax on your coins for every transaction; so if you get your items, find you don’t like them and want to sell them for others, you pay for that too. You even need to pay to use the crafting benches to make items yourself. (Which can take thousands of monotonous hours farming pictures captioned with a resource name)

The actual combat is the only good part. The whole faction system and bad lore is just a sad cover to diversify and complicate their money sucking systems. Matches are 3 to 5 min long with very limited depth. There’s nothing else worth mentioning. 

You install this game you’re gonna play it, enjoy it briefly, then realize to get any of the shit you actually want to use you’re gonna need to grind for hundreds of hours, for every single item, or bend over and drop your wallet with 100’s in it.

As one of the beginning members of Crossout, I've been playing since late Dec. 2015, I was always excited for every battle. New builds, new people, sheer carnage. Recently, the progress made for every level, every item, even a damn wheel, has been ground to a halt.
Now? There is no creativity anymore. There's builds out there that are amazing yes, but now, it feels like 3/4 of the player base runs meta builds, or is a cookie cut-out of someone else. Creativity is dead, all items eventually receive a nerf bat. Melee used to be viable, now you are forced to run a hybrid build, Lances, with their only potential being one shot kills, also received them, and yes thats welcome. The days of dual engines are gone, dearly missed those days. But dont take it out on the new players by making it so grindy that the game is not fun anymore. Fix this Targem.

THE GAME....
IS NOT.....
PAY TO !@#%$#@ WIN... It puts you with players of your PS and rank untill you get between rank 25 or 30 in the main faction, its new players that run into other new players that have bought a pack and got a bunch of new parts that then stomp the newbes who dont know the weakness of things.

I can say with no doubt that theres a cheap and good counter to every build in this game under 1000 C which is not hard to come by if you do the grind or the missions...

Now as for if you should pick up this game I would have to say you should only if your okay with doing some grind for the fun you can have, as of now with these new updates it has become about 3 times as easey to new parts and get a good ride within just a day of play.

Some tips...

Almost nothing is handed to you.

Other players dont care about you.

Dont ask for help if you dont understand something, instead just look online for the endless guilds on building and what not.

Dont be a jackass to your team m8's and they wont remember to screw you over down the road. Unless your in a landship.

Issues:
I purchased a pack when it first came out. The game went through a wipe and balance update. The parts I had are no longer available to me since that wipe and the coins I had are gone as well. So all the parts and stuff I got are basically gone. After submitting a ticket on the matter the response is: Nothing. If there is ever a response I'll update the review

Experience:
The game used to have a smaller player base and I'd say then was when there was the most balance issues. When you get out of the 2.5K Power Score range was when it was hard to find a game. Now getting up to that range puts you into a range where People have paid for packs and are using them against you. So you have to change your style a little bit. It's hard to say if that is balanced but there are plenty of opportunities to make your own stuff and even make coin to buy that stuff on the market when you get access. 

Overall: 
It's alright. Not the best not the worst. The games style is nice and it's optimized enough to not be a pain to run it on a potato. I'd give it a try. My experience is a little different as I put money into the game and purchases where wiped out for my efforts without the ability to get them back in game.

About Gaijin and them scamming you, well, 2 years ago I bought the Snake Bite Pack pack here on Steam...a few weeks ago my in-game money balance dipped to the negative side like crazy. I sent Gaijin support a mail and they claimed that I had pulled a chargeback on the pack in question. However as far as all and any TOS and rules go it's impossible to do a chargeback after 2 years. I was also in contact with Steam Support about this and they have clearly stated that there's no refund nor chargeback related to this. Also, the pack in question was bought with Steam Wallet funds so can't even pull a credit card/paypal chargeback...

Selling your resources on the market is an option and can give you a lot or a little cash back depending on the player driven market value (Player driven markets I don't care for.) or you can save your junk and build better more effective weapons, modules, or cosmetics with them via the workbenches provided by one of the 7 factions you will interact with (Getting your reputation points up with each faction gets you WAY better armor parts to use with your builds as well.). PVP is VERY competitive but still fun, you never know what will happen, will you be missing half your wheels or be disarmed or will you do the un-wheeling or dis-arming? Anyway, PVE Raids vary in difficulty depending on what you want to try and if your build's power score will allow you to enter the match, a multi-objective based mission in the raids keep you on your toes and you get to fight a boss at the end of each raid. Personally, Crossout is both a fun game for crafting and creating the most odd looking vehicle imaginable, and frustrating for it's competitive PVP and sometimes hard PVE raids but I love it all the same and I do recommend everyone at least try it once, it is free after all.

If you have ever heard of Robocraft, this game also has vehicle building, a garage, and a base capturing gamemode.
That's where the similarites end.

Overall, it's much different from Robocraft, and apparently it is more pay to win. I can't have an opinion on that since I bought the Closed Beta Test pack and got 2000 coins when I first played Open Beta Test. There is very much a grind, if you want rare parts from the market, and even more so if you want epic parts.

Vehicles are built out of parts of varying sizes and you cannot buy more structure pieces, you have to level up in a faction to get more. And instead of CPU/pFlop usage that varies with different cubes, there is a parts limit that maxes out at 80 when you level up in the Engineers faction.

Crafting is interesting, basically you get the required stuff for what you want and then you tell the faction people what you wanna make. If its in a high tech workbench, you need to buy a thing that lets you use it for an amount of time.

Have I mentioned the market? The market is not like the cube shop or cube forge, where prices are set in stone. Instead it is player driven and the prices go up and down. You can make offers and also directly sell the items in their most expensive purchase or buy on the cheapest sale. It also includes fees, so that the market does not inflate and it keeps people buying coins. 
The more rare or unobtainable an item, the higher the price, even if it is a common item. The more of an item there is, the cheaper it will be. If there is less of an item, you can charge more for people to buy it. If there is more of an item, you can lower the price of it to sell it faster.

Try it yourself to see if you like it, it's free. This is just my opinion on the game and you might have a different one.",1495401634,1570201342,True,196,14,0.77648770809173584,22,True,False,False

Now that I have it I have nothing but good things to say about it. You can do PvP , PvE and brawls. You can build your own vehicle or use a blueprint or tweek a blueprint to your satisfaction.The list goes on and on if you ever have a question about it or the current status I would love to inform you. I would love to see more ppl bite on this title and make it grow in its current beta state. Yes you have to pay for Beta and the game will go free to play on release. So to finalize this pick it up and you will be very pleased or wait for it to be F2P but give it a try or your really missing out on a great title.

Did you ever dream of going against weapons that cost 30 000 coins or 400€ in real money? Then this is the game for you.

 Of course you can always play until you can afford it. If you never lose a game, use both small and large fuel barrel and survive every game, that would be the equivalent of only around 13 000 matches. Sure, you can  do the daily missions maybe get a bit more resources.

I really like this type of game where you build your own vehicle and it has good graphics and nice physics.

The game design seems nonexistent, you get noobie weapons that require an high amount of skill (like cannons) and you get higher tier weapons that require none (like drones). Size, skill level, energy consumption is all over the place. ...and the Pay2Win, don't get me started on it... 

Hope you enjoy, and if you're looking to get those really OP weapons you better start grinding as soon as possible, best of luck, you'll need it.

Now granted, I did spend some money on this when it first came out, so I haven't had any issues with currency so far.

Extremely long time to level up

And to be honest.  It gets old after a while... really old.  And in order to get really good weapons without playing all day nonstop all week then you need to pay real money just to get them.  And its rediculous.  And im no bad player whos bad at the game either.  I usually get the 1st or 2nd highest score and dont die that often.  but i would much rather spend money on a game i enjoy that one which is just a chore to get decent stuff.  Another way to get good weapons or parts is by using coing on the market.  You start off with a rather small amount and in order to get more you have to sell some of your stuff.  And the thing you sell will probably never get bought unless their rare and really good and even if they were bought they wouldn't givr you very much.  Another complaint is that the matchmaking takes WAY to long.  it says the average is around 1 second to a minute at most even though it takes me about 1-5 minutes.  And i have a good connection of about 60-70 mbps download.  And my battle score seems to be the average of others vehicles based on my experience.


I would recommed this game but it takes way to much boring grinding unless your willing to unnecessarilly use real money.


Aside from that stuff though, this game is a fun time waster.


WEAPONS ARE WAY TO OP:  One cannon/rocket shot and you can lose all your weapons,wheels,armor,and health.  Not only that, but theyve given everybot in the game 2 rocket launchers.

Anyways that sums up my review.  Hope this helps!

I was an early supporter of Crossout, I loved the idea. I still do to an extent. Unfortunately the microtransaction business model has yet again corrupted another game. 

So I paid $30 for this game, early access. It's free now. I'm not too salty about it. That gave me a 2000 credit bonus, and a free kit. All in all, I can build a battle vehicle that's pretty much all blue, possibly with one purple rarity item. 

So the weapons tier system is like this: 

White -> Trash
Blue -> Common
Purple -> Rare
Gold -> Epic
Orange -> Legendary

Each move up the chain is almost a full order of magnitude more expensive, and these more expensive items are literally tiered to do more damage. Some of them are ridiculously OP, like say for example a minigun with no cooldown (Reaper). 

Oh did you win a round? Congrats, have a trash tier item worth about .10 credits. Yes, about a tenth of one credit to maybe 1 credit if you are lucky. Oh you lost? Hah no reward sorry sucker. 

Basically if you wanted to try and work your way up the ladder without paying, it's a hopeless game, you can't do it. The frugality this game forces people into also causes market manipulation for the in game trading system, where people are constantly trying to play the market and buy goods at low price only to resell them. Add in market transaction fees, and you've got yourself a solid way to reinforce the P2W model. 

To top it all off, the balance of this game is based around Power Score, or PS. This represents the overall ""power estimate"" of the parts on your vehicle. In theory higher PS should be in tiers with other higher PS players, but it doesn't always work out this way. I've seen gaps as big as 2000 within matches. Say for example someone with a PS of 2600 in a matchup with someone who is 4600. That's not a fun game, because that vehicle is likely superior to yours in every possible way. 

So while this game had a lot of promise, they really screwed it over with a P2W and microtransaction model. 

To top it all off, every time you log in, you get a splash page of a new item they are trying to get you to buy. Oh you don't have funds? Why not add some? The icing on the cake is also every time you login they give you 2 notification bullets that WON'T clear until you look at 2 more items they are trying to sell you. 

This game should be called SellOut instead of CrossOut.

It's typical of most F2P games out there, but this one takes it a step higher by being a company that uses one type of currency in the game in which they sell directly to the players! That is P2W all day! World of Warcraft doesn't sell the players gold directly. It's a classic baiting maneuver that too many games have started doing in the last decade or so. 

The model is to make it free to play, but only give the player barely enough to keep playing, all while dangling that ""pay us to skip this"" carrot in front of them. Seeing how the only currency in the game is only obtained by real money directly from the game maker or from selling items on the in-game marketplace. If you haven't bought any of their packs, you probably don't have any meaningful parts and they are all probably white. Play a few hundred battles with your suck vehicle until you can get enough of the resources needed to craft a blue one. Good luck with that btw, cause if you need that stupid van cabin you're going to be playing a lot of those matches in the hopes that the RNG gods give you that cabin instead of a useless friggen jack you already have 20 of! 

I don't know how it is with all the parts, but I myself only have 3 purples parts and maybe a dozen blue parts. They mostly came from the two packs I purchased, which players end up selling the rares from to buy stuff they want, like I did. I used the started coin I got + the coin from the packages and selling their parts to just TRY, yes TRY out some of the other weapon types. At first I got 4 blue SMG's (that I still currently use because they are best bang for buck) and then I started trying out drones, saws, RC car things, turrets, rockets, missles, plasma gun, and so on. Of course every time I bought a couple of them at a certain price, you never sell them back for their original amount, so over time you end up losing those coins. This is just the weapons guys.... There are guns, engines, generators, cabs, wheels, tank treads, hover engines, spider legs, and just lots of different round wheels. Yes of course the higher quality ones (purple/orange) are superior to the lower quality ones in every way and hey wouldn't you know they cost thousands of coin, thousands each! 

This is getting long, so I'll wrap it up in saying that I really really want to play this game, but this is a beta and people should not be charged real money to play your beta for christ's sake! There is a guy named Entak that I guess has a special account where he has 20 of every item in the game, meanwhile I've paid around $100 and don't have 1% of the stuff he got. Again this is a dang beta and they're already making a killing from people. There is no subscription fee that gets you double XP or anything, there is only the coin and the marketplace.

I would like to address the ""pay to win"" argument briefly. The game is broken into 4 basic ""tiers"" in terms of item cost, white, blue, purple, and gold. White items you get just for completing missions, the rest must be bought on the market (don't craft unless you very much know what you're doing). The average cost of items goes as follows.

Blue ~ 30c
Purple ~ 300c
Gold ~ 2000c

Each game nets you approximatly 1c, and assuming ~20 games per hour, you can comfortably afford one or two new blues a day. Now the question becomes are blues competative against golds and purples. The answer is an unequivocal YES. As someone who   bought the game back when it was $30, i've never really been trapped in the blue tier as they start you out with 2000c, but nonetheless some of my favorite and most competative builds are totally blue. I have a very expensive walker with 2 gold cannons and routinely get smacked down by some cheeky fuck running 4 blue shottys on a wedge car. Team play, driver skill, and efficient design win the day, not  expensive gear. If you download this game and drop 50 bucks on the market for the biggest baddest cannons, you will get crushed by 4 players who can squad effectively and know what your gonna do before you do it.

If you download the game and arn't winning more than half your games, i suggest you take a trip over to the crossout reddit page which will give you lots of information about efficient design, weapon synergy, obscure game mechanics, and even some good blueprints for nubs.",1472781111,1525642918,True,0,0,0.469798654317855835,9,True,False,False

Pay to win/Grind-a-thon.

Single currency used to do eveything: and I mean; Everything.

You need ""Coins"" to ""rent"" workbenchs - every faction has three levels of workbench (Rare/Epic/Legendary) - and each one is independiant of the others, even in the same faction. Each workbench can only make a limited numer of parts before needing to be ""rented"" again for coins. You'll only have access to the most basic parts untill you've ether flashed a credit-card; or worked hours a day for weeks to earn parts that are worth using.

And most parts; require other ""Rare/Epic"" parts from diffrent factions to craft - So you'll ether have to have coins to spend - Or have crafted hundreds of parts to get to the point you can sustain yourself finacially, and have the parts you want to play the game adiquatly.

You can also sell parts on the Market to make coins; but you'll find that it takes obscenely long amounts of time to grind the items you need, to make parts, to sell on the market, to make the coins you'll need to keep youself afloat financially in the game.
 
You can skip almost all of this with real money; just buy a pack with coins - then buy the parts you want on the market.


Almost every part you can craft requires you play PvE matches to get ""Copper"" An item you can only get in PvE; or buying it on the market; To play PvE - you'll need ""Fuel"" - You can only get Fuel by playing in PvP matches - you also only get Fule if you - Win the PvP match; and survive - while having a fule tank installed on your vehicle.

Again; You can skip all this if you have real money to throw at this game.

If you're like me - and absolutly hate spending money on free to play games; Avoid this one - everyone whos spent money to get parts will ravage you, you'll struggle to accomplish anything; the game is just flat out work; unless you spend real money on it.

Dose all that sound complicated? It sure tries to be, it can take days to fallow through with building an ""Epic"" Part; if you're not going to spend money on it.


It's sad because the gameplay, and the features of the game could have been something more unique and special; but it's all locked away behind paywalls; or grind-a-thon of busy work if you're not into spending real money, to make you want to spend money to skip the grind, and the arbitraty forced time limitatations that make this game difficult to love.",1519690454,1521794133,False,109,5,0.752420663833618164,5,True,False,False

You have probably seen a lot of ""buuuh pay to win"" trash from lazy players... Well.. It's not, literally the only thing in the entire game you can't get only by playing are some avatars BUT don't think you can have everything unlocked from the first minute playing, the grind is quite tedious, specially if you are a new player, it gets easier the more you progress since you will have acces to better gear and seassons which reward you with a lot of resources. 

Note that this game doesn't tell you a lot of how it works, so take a bit of time to learn the mechanics is mandatory, one example that new players struggle a lot with is with the workbenches..  So, as you advance and get more reputation you can unlock new factions and new workbenches to craft better gear,  the workbenches are rented with coins, which are the ""premium"" currency you'll see in other games, the difference is that here you DON'T need to buy them with real money, coins are obtainable by selling stuff, you have to follow the patron: 

Play games > get resources > craft some basic stuff > play more games > sell resources > get coins > rent workbench > craft better gear > play more games > get more resources >  get better gear 

At one point you will be able to do medium and hard seassons, which will give you scrap, wires and electronics to craft or sell, when you reach to this point, you will have a pretty stable coin income.

It's also important to learn how the market works so you get some profit from the items you sell (sell high, buy low) that can take a bit to get used to.

As for equipment balance, keep in mind that every literal single thing in the game has it's counter, and most of them more than one, but that's a matter of test and error, since every player has different tactics or playstyle, you will have to experiment a lot until you find your sweet spot.

Well, if you reached to this point and want to avoid the text wall here is a quick sum up: 
This game is hard for begginers, but once you get used to the mechanics, the market, and the resource management you can have a really great time, specially if you find some friends to play with.  

Also, the game is free and it doesn't take alot of space, so the typical ""well it's free, just give it a try and decide for yourself"" is on point :P

Edit 2:
After talking with the developer and learning a few tricks and an update I am happy to report that I have changed my review to a recommend.

The positives about this game:
The fighting is awesome, I found out that you can make in game teams so if you get three people that agree to fight with you, you never have to wait to do a PvE battle!
The physics and damage are pretty fair, I haven't found to many weapons OP.
There are now daily challenges you can do and daily and weekly crates you can get that fill some of the void of how to get items and scrap to make items.
This game is all about building the best tank you can and destroying your enemies with it!


The neutral about this game:
This game is also all about grind, with level locks every step of the way and the sheer cost of everything to be crafted or bought in the market grinding is what you will be doing the whole game.
However, if you were to ask me how to make grinding fun I would tell you shooting an enemies tires off then using a grain thresher on their car till it blows up, or cloaking a 105mm cannon to sneak up behind someone and show them how foolish it was to put all their armor in the front.
This game has done something I found very hard in the past, it makes grind fun. 
So even though I find fault in level locking things and various other leveling related problems, I do not give it a negative score for that, because when you are in the swing of things you will look up and realize you advance three levels without noticing!

The negative about this game:
The marketplace is a little broken including everything being way over price and the fact it has a strange 10% tax for no reason.
The Item Crafting is very broken! Remember what I said about grind: This is what is needed for crafting a 1st level ammo pack:
2 - Basic 75mm cannons = 300 scrap each to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling
2 - Basic Machine guns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling
2 - Basic Shotguns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling
50 copper = approx 7 a game x 3 average minute game time = 21 minutes of just fighting
450 Scrap (none from the 6 guns we broke down to make this?) = 90minutes

so 7 hours and 51 minutes of game play to make a single 1st level ammo pack, but wait it takes a real time hour to craft (again for some reason unknown to me)
So the actual time is 8Hrs and 51 minutes

Now, you can buy stuff from the market, there are daily challenges and seasonal ones to help with the cost, but I would like to ask did 8hrs sound like a good idea in development?
Did someone grind to make an ammo pack to see what it felt like?
If at anytime you decide not to make that item, you will not get 1/10th of the price back it cost you to make or buy those guns if you sell them.

If you want to hook people for the long haul, add new things into the game, the whole game is about battling and it's fun as heck! Don't go for the cheap hooks like this, ditch the weapon requirement or at least make them make sense and you'd have a great crafting system.

All in all the crafting is the only thing I really have a problem with now, and I plan on buying what I need from the in game market so if you are a person who does the same I highly recommend this game!
If you like making someone wish they had prepared for your triple rocket launcher cloaking sneak attack that removed all their guns and half their armor, then this is also the game for you!

I have played this since it was in early beta, and seen this game fall further and futher into the P2W system.

The game has a great concept, and now that it is free to download, makes me happy.
But it is not free to play!

What i mean is, if you want to get items to build with, you have a few choices.

1. Buy a pack of items, easy and simple, but costs money.
2. Grind like you are a fucking korean, playing an MMO, to level up and get a few new items, for a few hours!

Each item you get from a crate, that is ""rare"" rarity or higher has a timed lifespan. So fuck you if you got a good part, you can only enjoy it for 4 hours! 

Which one would you pick?

To give you an idea how hard it is to level up i did some math!

To get from level 4 to 5 you need 65000 exp!

How much do you get from a battle?

5K?, 10K?, FUCK NO!!!

YOU GET 1000 EXP FROM A SINGLE BATTLE!!!!!!
Meaning you have to play 65 battles to level up!

How much does each battle take?

3 min of average.

65*3 =195 minutes or 3,5 hours, to level up a single time!
And all this is based on if in every round you play your best, and you win every single round, and you teammates cooperate every single fucking round!

And that's for one level, to get to from level 11 to 12... 140k exp
It scales up for each level... making more and more impossible.

Does this sound like fun to you?

This game has fucked it self over so hard, by adding some disgusting Pay 2 Win systems. 
Do not play this game, trust me! It is not fun, it's a pile of shit!
Play Robocraft, now that's a good game!

This game feels like it is run by EA!

The dev team, is adding awesome new factions, weapons, and events to the game, making it more fun to play.

The director then decides that you need to grind like a motherfucker if you want all these new awesome things, or you can buy them for the sweet price of 49.99£

Here's why this game is absolutely 100% pay to win, in fact I personally have paid $300 to win, and it works:

You can, if you grind 4-5 hours per day, every single day, for 3-4 months, get what you'd call an ""end game build"", something you can compete with in ranked, if you're the type of person who likes to be competitive and play with all the features and parts the game has to offer. But then right when you'd earned those parts, theyll drop another set of parts that are intentionally better than everything else, because they know people will pay more money to get the new parts. But you guys who arent paying, for the next months after the patch, are going to get pooped on because you dont have the new all powerful parts, and if you sell your current parts, youre going to lose a huge chunk of the value, a huge huge chunk, and if you keep doing this, youll never get ahead, and thats how the devs want it. By the time you catch up without paying, they'll be releasing their next update with new over powered parts, and will have nerfed the last update to a reasonable balance like everything else. Rinse and repeat. 

Its a cycle designed to pull as much money as they can out of those of us who're willing to pay $100s of dollars per month and those of you who arent paying are SOL.

Oh also if you dont like extremely grindy games with painfully slow progression, you wont like this in the first place so dont bother.

Also dont expect much variety or depth. With the builds, yes, tons, but the gameplay itself is based on just a small number of badly designed maps, one mode where the fastest cars rush to the objective before you and you lose before firing a shot (thats one of the two primary game modes and you cant eleect not to play it) and the other mode involves the other team rushing your base while you rush theirs and whoever gets there first essentially wins. And if you want to play any other PVP modes youre SOL because all of the other modes, including ranked, is locked 90% of the time, open only during certain hours. More often than not there are no PVP modes unlocked except for the primary one, which is linear and boring too.

Oh and why are the game modes locked? Because they dont have enough playerbase to support more than one mode reliably. Why is the playerbase all gone, this game was so hyped it was one of the top games on the F2P Steam charts?!! Because of the shittiness detailed in this review. Clearly Im not the only one who got tired of it and quit. 

Oh and the matches in all modes only ever last a few minutes, and there are not even multiple rounds. If you want a game with depth, this is not the game for you. If you're a Dad with a short attention span and frequent interruptions, you'll love it. But for the rest of us, it's unfulfilling and dull.",1512899618,1512900398,False,17,0,0.60725247859954834,5,True,False,False

This game is dying because of that the dev's never listen to their fans. When this new patch got released it lost alot of players. They nerfed the heavy cabins like shit and now they are pretty much useless. The hover's, drones and turrets are still dominating in this game and they are still one of the game's biggest issue's. Then we come to the other major problem, the microtransactions. This game is full of them and they pretty much ruin the game. People that buy thing's for about 599 will get the best gear and items in an instant and they will dominate in every single match. So the game is pretty much pay to win. I got this game for about 300 insted of getting it for free because it's such a pretty and unique game. And all i got for all that was 3 shitty shotguns that don't do s**t! And i regret it so much. But i played for about 100 hour's and grinded like shit and got some good stuff. Then we come to the whipe wich is the devs way to make you want to regret playing the game even more. All the things that you have grinded for now just gets removed and the only things that you will have left will be the things that you payed for with real money. So they basically mean ""Hey you want to keep your stuff that you need to not get your as whooped on the battlefield? Then look no further! go the the microtransactions tab and buy some of our stuff it will only be about 299 more or 599! we even got some for sale yes! You want good stuff yes? you buy, you give us your money yes?!"" 

So all the things that i had put so much time getting got removed thanks to the dev's. Then i saw how f***ing greedy the dev's where so i quit the game and i never touched it again. Now i'm watching the dev's fuck up the game even more and it's kind of enjoyable. And the grind is insane you pretty much have to put 100 hour's of your life just to get something good. Without even enjoying it.  

Thank's to the greedy dev's this game is almost dead and will just be another forgotten indie game that had lot's of potential but got killed by it's own dev's.       

I had so much love for this game before but now...i'm done.

they killed it. 

the grind was bad, it took three/four hours to build one wheel. but now it will take a full day.

you see, to craft anything you need copper. to get copper you need to do a raid, if you beat the raid you get 3/8 copper. you will need 50/200 copper. ok now this is not that bad, however to do a raid you need fuel, easy raid is 25 fuel and will give you around three copper and a hard raid cost 100 fuel and will give you around 20copper. to get fuel to do a raid you need a fuel can. you need to place it on you truck{ or tank, ect } and if it gets shot once in game it will explode and take you with it.

 but it gets worse, to get fuel you must not only win, but live aswell. now it's been like this for a long time now. but before this update it gave you 25 fuel { a easy raid} now? it gives 5.... 

yes it now takes 5 full rounds were you win and survive to do a easy raid. a round is about 3/5 minutes. you need 5, thats about 20 minutes for a easy raid that gives three copper, so to get 200 copper you need to do 700 raids { if there on easy} AND each raid is another 8 minutes long AND you will only get the copper if you win. so thats 3/4 wins, so add a extra 25% to the max time.

and then you can craft one wheel. oh look, you only need to do that another seven times.

then after crafting 8 wheels, you can start to craft the other 3 parts you need to craft one track. then after you make 8 tracks you can then make one gun. after you make 8 of the same guns you can craft the one wheel you want.

now you only need 3 more wheels.",1474304401,1511114127,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played on and off since long before it went free to play.  i keep coming back for a look because in there is a game i want to play. it's just all locked away or deliberatley gimped. the game was actually fun long before the free to play. it had some diversity to it. 

After logging in to see the changes made in 0.8.20 I probably won't bother keeping up with this anymore.

Finally acquires the perfect melee build(imo). Sets up a coordinated ambush... wait for it... BOOM! I get blown up by a cloaked explosive enemy melee build instantly!

Love the game, it is absolutely awesome. I was a huge twisted metal fan growing up and this has revitalized that vehicle combat genre I grew to love and then some. Lots of reviews just throw around that this game is pay to win. However you can't purchase skill off the shop... yes to be successful in Crossout, you will require skill. There's a learning curve here. Some catch on, some never do. Some just complain when the exploits players use get patched. So glad they actually address the exploits and patch them. Lots of strong pvp builds used to get rekt by the exploiters of particular build styles. So glad that sh!t is gone and its back to a skill based game. 
PROs:
-nearly unlimited vehicle creation possiblity
-Want cannons? Rockets? Machine guns? Mini guns? How about an auger or explosive spears? Better yet how about a rotating assembly off a combine harvester? They got em all!
-Good updates, game is progressing and well thought out before they drop them.
-Map diversity, some bigger some smaller, lots of nooks and crannies to keep you in cover or set up the perfect ambush.
-Can play as fast burst damage combat, sniper, mid range support. Theres nearly endless fluid playstyles

-Can be laggy at times, although this has gotten much better as of late.

Overal, I highly suggest this game to everyone! Yes the game is a huge grind even if You are so called p2w player.

There is no such thing as drone/turrets etc. problem, if You learn how to counter them. Most people who complain about this issue are Canon players who can't aim.

Many people also will say that Hover builds have way too much armor, but they don't know what they are talking about. To put it in simple words at 10k+ Power score ground Vehicle easily can have 3000+ structure, where good Hover builds will have only around 1000. But even if people can't counter Hover builds, changes are coming to the parts and fairly soon I guess.

People also are saying that weapons like spears are now useless against hover builds, but they might be surprised how effective they can be if mounted high enough to hit hover builds.

Reading some reviews I also see that people are saying that after 3k+ PS drones and hover builds are ruling the battlefield. ALL of those people are wrong! as I said I have almost 500 hours in the game and 80% I played missions with 3,5k-4k PS and honestly if it's not for a 4man groups Hovers and drones was never a problem to Me personally!

So now to my personal review and why I am making it positive!

1. Ranked battles for competitive players! Yes it will take months to grind before You can participate and get in top 100, but it's possible, I personally only recently started to participate, so I would say that for ok player it will take around 400 in game hours before You can do good in Ranked battles.

2. fast matches - PVP match only lasts 3 minutes, so You have to move around instead of camping! Many people still either camp, either suicide!

3. skill to win! Yes many people think that there are a lot of cheaters in this game, but I don't think so! In my around 400 ranked battles so far, I haven't seen even once aimbot or anything from that sort. Yes there have been some lucky shots that got Me killed, but I haven't noticed visible cheating. It really takes skill and a lot of practice to do good in hover builds, specially combined with Tsunami canons!

4. season missions - I completed every season mission since OBT start, it's a great way to earn a lot of crafting materials together with some containers. It used to be every week, now changed to every 2 weeks, means that You really need to spend only 1 hour a day in order to earn in 2 weeks a lot of scrap, wires, enough electronics and on top of that 1 rare and 1 epic part, which can be sold, meaning that around 400 coins every 2 weeks besides selling earned crafting materials.

5. In game market - Market is an awesome feature that can help You if You use it right. Before a major update selling some of Your stuff will benefit You greatly, after new major update drops, quick buy/sell is a thing and can earn You a lot of coins in short amount of time. My quick example would be right after Dawns children update dropped I had 1300 coins on my account, new pack came out and people sold their Icarus hovers. I used that into my advantage and did a quick buy/sell with these hovers in first 2 days I earned over 2000 coins by just buying and selling these hovers.

6. Brawls - Specificly The big black scorpions brawl, where everyone is equal and it all depends on Your personall skill.
If You haven't tried it, try it and thank Me later.

Overal Awesome game, still needs a lot of work at end game, simply because there are only 3 good building options currently for it. More works, but to do very good it's either Double Tsunami hover builds, Double Hammerfall builds or Tripple Spark builds. Drones etc. works too, but because they are passive builds it often leads into defeats. mandrake builds also work good if people know how to use them right, but then again skilled players normally know how to counter that.

I could go on and on, but simply it takes a lot of time to learn the game, but when You do it's great fun and well worth effort!",1509354339,1509360312,True,19,0,0.650804281234741211,0,True,False,False

You play only with white weapons and items vs lila weapons and items because the power score of lila items is much to low.

But the in-game way of gathering things is sooo slow. And yeah, I get it, they need money to actually continue to maintain and update the game. That's fair, that's what you expect in a free to play game with a cash market.

The problem is that the game just feels unbalanced. You can sit there for hours working on building your machine. You can fine-tune it, build it with multiple weapon-types to help cover weaknesses at a specific range, shifting your armored pieces around for maximum protection, and even try to make sure your center of gravity won't leave your rig doing awkward flips on tight turns.

And then you'll get shot down by someone who just built a flatbed of the basic frame 20 feet long, line it with the cheapest gun, and basically just shut you down by force of 'the game is designed this way'. Basic frames can't be destroyed like armor, after all. Put your guns on it and bam, they're far harder to pick off by peppering armor. 
But that's rare. Let's move on to the next game. A lot of people with neat designs, some just copies of one-another, and so on. You take your rig into the next game. And then you see it. Is that an unarmed enemy? No turrets, no melee weapon, just charging at you? Why that's an easy- What are those flying things?
Before you know it, you're shredded to pieces, shooting at someone who has to do nothing but drive around and avoid your shots while his drones rip you to pieces. In seconds, your guns are picked off, your wheels fly away, and you're shredded before you can even do meaningful damage.

Next game, rigs packing nothing but double-cannons that can pick your rig in half in a salvo.
Next game, invisible rig lined with bomb-tipped spears destroying you instantly. Well at least he can't do that one again. 
Next game, frame shenanigans. 

The game just feels AWKWARD, and as though the effort you put in is wasted. And if you get unlucky and picked out of a round early on? Sucks for you! 10/several thousand experienced needed to level up. And if you leave early, you get nothing. Not like World of Tanks where you can basically start another game while your tank is 'left' in the battle to finish it, no. You have to sit there and watch your loss or victory the entire time or you get nothing. Satisfying gameplay, 10/10.
So you think 'I'll drop some money on this game, fuck it. I'll buy some parts.' Well you better do your damn research on good builds or your money is wasted. 

Oh, right, and don't diversify. Just stack as much of one or maybe two weapon types on your rig and go for burst damage. Chunk someone and they probably won't be able to fire back to take advantage of any weakness in your weapon lineup.

It's a shame, too, because the game has potential and is overall pretty cool with mad max-style fighting, but when you actually start playing the pvp you go from 'cool post-apocalyptic cars/tanks' to 'just stacking whatever helps me kill as fast as possible to overcome the ridiculous grind'.",1505898419,1505898419,False,7,0,0.504140317440032959,0,True,False,False

The Good:
Everything about the shooting, driving, and building is very good. As you level up you get access to new factions, parts, equipment, and the like. It's very rewarding to see your creations grow from a POS to a master piece of armor and cannon. There is definitely a level of skill that goes into figuring out where to put armor, weapons, and vital equipment. In total there are 5+ factions that offer their own unique style and take on armor and cabins along with various pros and cons of using each. Also, as you level each faction you gain access to new weapons that are unique to that faction. In my old review I said that leveling was slow and tedious but that has been remedied a bit with the introduction of flags and an ample of cosmetic pieces that increase XP gain. Overall I would say the game is a 8/10.

The Bad:
Their is a player ran market in the game that allows you to buy and sell just about anything. Nothing new right? Well, in order to build the sweet, sweet cannons of doom you must use the market to obtain ""coins"",the somewhat premium currency of the game. (Side note: For winning and completing certain game modes you can receive parts, scrap,copper,wires, and electronics that can be sold in the market for coins.) The only way to build higher level weapons and equipment is to get coins and buy workshops from factions which is a slow process considering the current status of the player market. On top of that every transaction has a 10% tax on it meaning that if you the seller you get fucked in the ass a little every time you want to sell something. Not to mention the tax is only their just because. Just letting you know what you're getting into.

The Ugly:
This is my second time writing this and I want into very good detail about the problem but fuck that(and Steam). Long made short there are 3 types of weapons in the game that are broken right now, the Caucasus, Turret Deployer, and Drone Deployer. These weapons are AI controlled and always target the cabin of the vehicle. They never miss, ever. And a shot on the cab is always a critical hit. You do the math. There are currently no counter measures other than running away or shooting them very fast and killing them.

To the Players:
To the motherfuckers that keep on undercutting prices on the market, YOU NEED TO FUCKING STOP!!!!! You are hurting yourself and the other players. If an item is selling at the listed price then list it at that price or put it a little higher if only 1 or 2 of that item is listed. Stop quick selling and LOOK at the fucking prices of items. DON'T get impatient and undercut a price for a quick sell instead list it and wait 24 hours, it will sell if priced right. That's it, rant over. (never trust 16 year olds with economics.)

To be straight and to the point, this game has an extreme grind to get the things that you want. The only way to bypass this is to equip a fuel tank and farm fuel and sell that to other players for gold to buy what you want. Other than that you'll spend weeks trying to grind that one item for your vehicle all the while facing people that already have their things which is not okay.

To top that off this game has some serious balance issues. For example, this is a game about blowing [edited] up, yet, the easiest way to win is by capping and you can't reset the cap so instead of going by who destroyed the most vehicles if you have more cap points (there are 3 bars and once a bar is filled it cannot be reset and taking damage does not reset the current bar either) it goes by who threw in the towel and capped for the win. Stop this and fix it. It ruins the game.

Some weapons are just poorly balanced. Why use weapon A when weapon B does the same thing but better? More balance issues are with the cannons. If you get hit you might as well call it GG. Some shots are serious skill shots but if they're close enough you're probably not going to fair very well. Also I found the shotguns to be a waste of space the higher you go because of their stupidly high resource costs. They are already balanced by their low uptime, low damage output at long ranges, and high reload times they don't need to be restricted any further.

I could go on and on and on and on about a lot of the gripes that I have with the game because there are a lot and they haven't fixed these since beta and it makes me very unsatisfied with the product that had a lot of potential to be good.",1503010242,1503010242,False,3,0,0.377969413995742798,0,True,False,False

All three points, coupled with developers that continue to double down on making these issues worse, I cannot.

As a free player, you will enjoy this game until roughly level 10. 

You will reach level 10 in a couple hours of playtime. After that, your queues will be filled with people who have spent countless hours farming for their favorite brand of Seal Club.

Second, you can knuckle down and farm- either battles or the market- but be warned that you'll spend a significant chunk of your time getting there. Third, you can stay casual, playing a few hours a day and capitalizing on the XP multiplier that resets about 8PM Eastern US.

The actual combat is fantastic and the builder is very nice but basically every update of this game since the open beta has been working to getting players to spend as much money on it as possible. The game is pretty hostile to new players as they put players with very good gear in with fresh starts as well.

horrible game balance between weapons and with the matchmaker,   end game is only 3-4 types of viable weapons and often 10,000 vs 6,000   (powerscore,  a number given to each part you use to balance matches and you see...poorly)
its POSSIBLE to play the game without paying but its a LONG grind and you face this kind unbalanced gameplay the whole way through.  so i define this as p2w since the cash side of this game DEFINATLY effects game balance and player experience 

30fps servers and horrible ping about 50% of the time

finally the event going on,   sigh....a temporary taste of desperatly needed content that they have been holding onto,  they did this same event last year in closed beta but for some reason though they needed to do it again rather than add the content.  now just to give you an idea of how grindy the game is ill drop some numbers on ya as relates to this ""event""

the 13 items available during the event come from a RNG crate.  the crate requires 300 talers (event coins) 1500 scrap metal and 50 copper
you get 1 event coin per victory during the event and a possible 100 if you can complete the daily mission 
you get about 15-17 scrap metal per win and 8-11 or so if you lose but you do have to score some points
the copper is from pve if you win its as follows    20fuel = 5 copper   40fuel = 15 copper  100 fuel = 50 copper  (you can earn a maximum of 15 fuel per pvp victory if you win and survive with fuel barrel intact)   

 that all sound like alot?  well it is!    iv done some math and considering a generous win/lose ratio you will need to play.....450 matches + 1 hard pve raid for the copper,  assuming your very good at the game and have advanced far enough to do hard raids (they are no joke)  3min per pvp match thats round about....22.5 hours of gameplay for 1 RNG event crate

I want to tell you that this game is great, I really do. It has it's flaws and needs some rethinking in certain aspects. I want to say this.....But I can't

I have been around this game since very early development And the one thing that I can say the dev team has continually screwed up is the allowed existance of the player volunteer GMs. Please believe me when i say that these players, and thats what they are, just players are the most annoying, redundant, and invasive bunch of people that should never, EVER hold the power to ban people. PERIOD. There i already a profanity filter in place, there is already the ability to block people. But god forbid if, on top of all of that you say anything resembling profanity. Then these GMs, who by most accounts are the worst parts of that wimpy kid from highschool turned stoodge/hall monitor and if Ned Flanders from the Simpsons tried to be a beat cop, come jumping down your ass. I was banned for suggesting to other players to also write a review about one of the major problems with the game.And let me be perfectly clear it is a problem. I could not play for a day, and still cant use chat for another 5 more days as of me writing this review. Not for swearing, not for any racist comments, not for being mean, but just for suggesting that people get the word out about this problem because you cant say anything on any forum without it being deleted and action taken against you.

 So to you, the potential paying customer, I say this with all sincerity. Do not put money into this game until you see these GMs go overboard with their nonsense to the point where you cant just say anything. If you wondered what it would be like without freedom of press or the right to say fuck once in a while because you lost in a pvp match because of stupidity, then this is the game for you. If this sounds like a complete headache, thats because it is. I myself would love to continue to support this game. But I cant. And I emplore you not to either until you see just how out of control these GMs are. So the harshest thing you can think to say is ""golly gee that was a disapointment"" and lets face it, nobody does then this game is perfect for you. 

But. If you are like the rest of us who pvp and gravitate towards pvp this game will chafe and piss you off due to the overbearing nature and lack of oversight of these volunteer players to the point that you'll also be looking to uninstall regardless of how much money you tossed to targem and gaijin.

Well what could I say. I am really pleased to see this game come back in my library after a few month of chaos. Indeed I was the waiting the OBT wipe. Now it's done so I can play again and what a pleasant suprise to see the manies upgrades the game have received.

More items, more weapons combination and more.

Can't wait to play more to test tham all on the battlefield.

Keep your good work devs, believe in your community and this game will go Gold.

CBT REVIEW :

I do recommand this game, quite fun and easy to build the ""car"" of your dream. It's still EA so, at highter level you'll find yourself fighting against vet players who allready have everything unlocked, but still, even with low level parts you can win a game by yourself, it's all about strat and not being caught by the ennemy team at the wrong moment.

I do enjoyed my first 35h of building and fighting with my strange design.

Surprise your ennemy with a moving wall filled with medium turret is still the best thing i've done so far.

Looking to unlock futher components even is it's take ages to do so.

Now that it is open beta and f2p, the que times are near instant and I can finally enjoy this hidden gem once again
I'm writing this review to explain how it isn't pay-to-win in any way, shape, or form. For a quick ""Do I recommend this game?"" Yes I do. Hands down. Even in its early access-closed beta state, it is extremely addictive and fun. It needs polishing but thats why it is in closed beta, for feedback and improvement. 8/10 (for a free game when it launches, I think it deserves 8-9/10). 
NOW onto p2w. In the game you can purchase ""packs"". These packs simply give you a better boost to starting the game by giving you a stronger starter vehicle, the performance of these cars is nowhere near any higher tier cars ive faced. Other than that slight boost, you cannot buy ANYTHING else. You cannot buy parts with money, cars, or !Coins!. Coins get you anything you want (depending on the cost), if you could buy coins, it would be pay 2 win. But since you can't it isn't even close to pay2win. 
Besides, having a strong car won't even guarentee you a win. You cannot carry in this, no matter how hard you try. Sure, some games you will wipe the whole team, but that is every so often. Otherwise this game does require skill and there are counters in the game for each style of battle. Melee, long range, and sustain as I would lable them. Also due to the limitations in crafting (energy, part limit, and weight: all which can be increased with level and parts to a certain extent) no one can be overly OP. (unless you are using a Leviathan which is No Holds Barred in custimization).
Side Note: The custimization is great. It is truly what I wished the Twisted Metal franchise should have been. 
EDIT: I would also like to add that, yes, during American day-time hours, the game can have low player count and long que times. That is because it isn't very popular here yet, it is a Russian made game so it is more popular in Europe. If you switch servers Europe, that will help you slightly, but playing later at night will help more since that is when Europeans are online mainly. Otherwise, wait until more people get the game, it only just came out on Steam and IS in closed beta, so low player count is to be EXPECTED. When the game is Free, you can surely expect a HUGE rise in the player base.
EDIT2: With the help of the power level system. Even if you bought as much as possible from the packs, you would simply be put with other people who bought the same stuff. So it isnt pay 2 win if you are just against people just as strong as you, making it an even match.",1472279456,1496604931,True,18,1,0.550255239009857178,9,True,False,False

Building vehicles is really great, theres a huge amount of parts and it does feel like u can really make what u want. Theres great variety on the weapons even including things like deployable drones and turrets aswell as modules like scopes and radars to add. 

Parts are shot off of ur vehicle so how u build it is very important to how well it functions. Smart design can really help ur performance.

Has a fairly high level of grind but not uncommon for this type of game esp as F2P. However there are ways to deal with this, for example u can level factions which earns u a lot of parts quickly to get going and completing seasons (a series of challanges that reset every so often) can earn u very good rewards. There is also a player market to buy and sell parts so its possible to sell items u dont want to get the parts u do.

GFX and sound r gd and the game runs really well.

- Building cars with guns and chainsaws
- Driving feels good
- Combat is intesne and is fun
- Lots of potential

- Construction system very simple (not sure if its a true con)
- I would rather just pay upfront for the game but its a WOT milking format
- Leveling system is broken - grind is not worth it - 
- Cannons a bit OP and some definite balance issues but no point in going into that since its beta.
- Weapon upgrading/crafting is a waste
- TOO GRINDY
- Market is not intuitive
- Shaping up to be pay to not drive the same car for 6 months 
- Shaping up to be a serious time sink (not all gamers are kids ya know)

I don't know what more you can ask for. The game has a psuedo pay wall. To craft in the game  you need gold, gold is only obtainable with purchases at the store... but it's also the currency at the player driven market.

So that means the only gold in the game right now is from players that paid money. If you're purely a free to play guy, and you have 0 intention of supporting a f2p game with $. You are going to have to grind your arse off to make it anywhere.

That being said the grind while high is reasonable. Especially if you consider the time you would play in a year worth of play. And hey; if you don't want to wait a year to craft your legendary item that's totally up to you. Don't be such a slouch, chip in some $ and support the game. ;)

TBH I don't mind the F2P model they have right now. The game is based on power score, if you can build something with 2000 PS with common items you are going to stand as good of a chance against someone that tried to down level their tier and using some blue items. They will end up making some very telling sacrificies to come play with you and your rig should be stronger in other area's.... also you shouldn't be trying to play solo.

Crossout, in my eyes, can be broken down into two parts: Things that happen inside the matches, and things that happen outside of matches.

In the matches, no matter what game mode, Crossout is top-shelf material. It's absolutely brilliant. Creative (And some less creative) player-made vehicles, disassembling each other piece by piece with all sorts of fun, impactful weapons.... it's just great.


Now what happens -outside- of the matches is what makes me feel strongly enough to write this.

In short, it's the most vile, disgustingly slow grind i have ever seen in a game. I don't even mind a bit of grinding here and there, but Crossout truly makes you feel as if the devs made sure to design every aspect of the game to make progression as tedious, slow and downright frustrating as humanly possible.

Lemme get into detail. The biggest issue is the crafting system. Now Crossout uses an item rarity system (Common-Rare-Epic-Legendary), complete with the same colour-coding you see in RPGs. This might make you think that the game drops fat loots on you, but oh, you would be mistaken.
So let's say you want to craft a blue/rare item. For example, an ""AC43 Rapier"" autocannon. This is a decent, but not exactly awe-inspiring weapon to have.

To craft it, you need 100 scrap, 100 copper, 2 common wheels, 2 common cannons and 3 common machine guns.
Now if this were a game that throws fat loots at you, that wouldn't sound like much, but here's the thing: 100 scrap is fairly easy to get, because you get that passively in PvP. 100 copper? Well, to get that, you have to play PvE raids. A lot of them.

To get all those common parts? You need to win matches. Here's a fun thing, though: Every match you win will only reward you with ONE common part, and what part that is is effectively determined via slot machine. Oh, and if your team loses a match, no parts, only scrap. (And potentially fuel, but that's another progression hurdle i won't even go into)

So to get these 7 specific common parts, you'll probably have to go through dozens of matches, hoping that A, you win most of them and B, RNGesus has mercy on you.

So, now you've played the damn game all day and what do you have to show for it? A single, blue item.

Now here's the real kicker: You wanna craft a purple? Well, you'll need wires for that, but those, you can just get as a PVP reward (by foregoing part rewards). But those 7 common items you needed for the Autocannon?

Yeah, well, if you want to craft a purple item, you'll need 7 RARE parts instead. In other words, the amount of time you need to craft a purple is exponentially more than a blue. If you want to ever craft a legendary, well, you better quit your job and install a toilet in front of your desk, because you'll have to be playing this game non-stop for..... well, months, probably.

There's gonna be a few people who are going to say one of two things:

1, ""You're just not good enough at the game!"" - Even if you are godlike at this game, with the systems the way they are? You still need to essentially make this game your dayjob if you want to get anywhere.

and 2. ""Well, it'll go FTP once it goes into open beta, so they need to encourage people to spend money!"" - Yes, this is true. And full disclosure? I'm a whale. I don't mind MTs. But frankly, with the state this game's in? You either spend ungodly amounts of money on it, buy everything you want, ruining it for yourself in the process, or you spend just -some- money on it, get -some- nice parts and then still face a grind that makes Payday 2 look positively utopian.

Without paying into any MTs at all? I'd go as far as to call this game unplayable.

Now in all fairness, this IS in closed beta, and massive changes may occur. In fact, i hope they do, because the core of this game, that being the actual car combat, is absolutely stellar, and it's a huge shame to see it buried in this many horrendous design decisions.

The game also has a big, player-run marketplace where you can buy and sell parts, but obviously, in order to buy anything, you need money. To get money, you need to sell stuff (Or buy it directly, once the game goes F2P). To sell stuff, you need to craft the stuff first and yes, to craft stuff, you need to basically go through hell. For several weeks at a time.

I'm sure there's some hardcore fans out there who enjoy this masochistic stuff but frankly, in my opinion? This game's problems could easily be fixed by increasing both PvP and PvE match rewards by a factor of...... x5? Maybe x8? Does that sound extreme? Yes? Well frankly, this game NEEDS extreme changes in order to become enjoyable.

I will happily update this review if the game changes for the better, but honestly, i don't hold much hope. I mean, i just had a big rant about just the crafting system, and there's so many small hurdles i haven't even gone into, such as fuel, the need to rent workbenches, the fact that when you actually get to craft an item, it takes hours of real-time to do it unless you pay to skip it and a few other things.

Just..... yeah. Impressive core game, surrounded by systems that seem specifically designed to stop you from having fun.

first let me say I love the ""IDEA"" of this game but it is majorly flawed.
It is beyond resonable in the grinding to get parts to build with department.
As is until the wipe it is also basicly unplayable for new players to a great extent as even after hundreds of hours you have zero chance to build a competitive rig that can run with the people that not only mount dual lagacy gold items that takes you literaly months to get,but have they have had so many of them as to be able to upgrade them .
The rewards for winning pvp battles is insanely low and offer almost no incentive to try and win a battle instead of just head hunt exp.
The prices on the market is insanley too high and unless you are a addict player you will simply never be able to even compete as you will like most people quit long before out of frustration.

There are al;so huge balance issues in the ps system, for example ,..
you will have zero chance against a person mounting two scorpions w/scope who can one shot kill you from the other side of the map or the guy mounting 3 explosive barrel tossers, until you have played for many hundreds of hours.
They say the match making will be better after launch but unles they change some basic rules of mounting there is no chance it will help.
For example if they only allowed a player to mount 1 leg item per vehical it would go a long long way to fixing thus miss match issue, or set the weapon power usage so high they can only mount 1 per rig.

Frankly they should get rid of the market place all together and simply put all the weapons into the faction rewards as you level.
there is also issues like items needed to craft with that you can only get during clan missions and such , after 800 hours i still can't get into those :/ simply because im not in a clan , but if you want one of those afore mebntioned OP weapons like the scorpion the needed craftingf parts are out of reach to you.

This game would be so much mort fun if they did away with all the crap they have in it that makes it just a boring frustrating grind to get parts.
For example i think most players would be fine with being able to have access to all weapons and parts right away day one,..
that way it is all about building your rig the way you like it and skill as a player , NOT about if you have played hundereds of hours.
especially since not a single player enjoys grinding the missions for weeks just to get to pvp to find you still are way outclassed in equipment .
I really love this game, it could be great,.. but as is , it is a waste of time and simply not fun to play a long grinding frustrating unbalanced game.

The developers are making a huge mistake becuase they can't seem to see that people just want to build and be creativew and fight against others doing the same NOT grind to make parts to craft more parts to grind more to sell buy something...
if given the chance ,.. players would simply build whatever they liked and could fit into the power requirement and actually enjoy spending their time shooting up each other. 

Also it is rather silly to grind 280K worth of pvp exp to get most likely a blue wheel from a container ,
after opening over 300 containers for example the best i got was 1 legacy harvester and a a stack of blue junk that when sold goes for about 50 or so credits.
the fix would be to leave the spinning wheel but as you go it removes the items you have already won untill you have all the ones it offers, in that way the player is assured they will eventually get something out of it of value .
Not much is more rage inducing as to play for 3 days to get 280k exp just to spin a wheel and get the white car jack ,..yet again ,.. and again and again.

To sum it up ,.. this game could be a fast paced fun game that all could compete with , but this is simply impossible to have when you progress at a snails pace.

Like most semi new players i look forward to the wipe and at least a few days of even level game play before the oppresive ecconomy and lack of rewards again crush the game for new players.

 Some might say "" but hey i see you rank pretty high on the weekly ratings blackstone , so why the complaints?""
Answer because after 800 hours im strill limited in what i can build and play to the point where i'm frankly bored to death of playing the same low level equipment and one should not have to ""get gud"" for months against way overpowering opposition  to have access to parts to even try and see if you like them against real players .
AGAIN, most players would be fine with letting ones building creativity and actual game play with that build against whater the other guy dreams up.
Nobody enjoys the grind , nobody enjoys the added crap that really is not needed in this game to have fun and having FUN is the only thing that really matters in a game is it not?

P.S.
please note that there was a responce to my review by a developer a few months ago""Feb 10""
in which he goes on to basicly lie to me and tell me the wipe is comming ""very soon"".

Older experienced players stack vehicle parts of high rarity and literally drive circles around other players while spamming one shot barrages of missles, cannon fire, and bouts of flame.  That is, when you even get games with other players, most of the time you will play against bots even in pvp matches.

Yes I paid to play it in alpha, which if you wait, you can play it for free.  With that said, I'm glad I did get in early.  There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to building an effective build.  Does it take long to learn, a couple of days and watch a few videos on it, it's easy enough to get the hang of, it's just not World of Tanks or such, you have to build your tank instead of just unlocking the next one.

It's fun right now, but when it goes open beta and free to play for everyone, that's where it's going to shine.  More real players, less bots.

If u reach it you have to wait a cupple of days for it to reset to get any more (this ""may"" be for pre release only, even so its pointless to play when your at your limit). This makes crafting a little more dificult seeing as how you need Copper, Scrap, Coin and usuly 3 other item with multiples of them to craft 1 item, that is if its not the ones that need the extra wires, electronics, or fragments to make. When crafting items they have a ""build time"" before you actually get it. Nice idea but a little much seeing as how you only get the required material for a win, if its an item you'll only get 1 (if you lose, your lucky to get scrap maby some fuel if your outfitted for it and you dont die). Geting the item you need it will take a few attempts as each mission has random drop chance with 3 displayed items as a higher outcome. As for geting coins haha have fun (Having a player based market is somehing I dont and never will like).
The AI needs a little love. Here are some examples that you tens to see in mission matches
- The AI frendlys will continuisly push you around 
- They tend to get stuck on every thing
- They will drive past enemy's and not shoot
- They will rush cap making games even shorter 
- The guns and items they have tend to be to high or to low for your lvl (nothing like being rushed by 3+ bots with cannons on them ;P )

I will say this tho, I am having a lot of fun playing the game even with the flaws. like most beta game needs a lil work. I am use to this as I mostly play alpha and bata games. That being said most of the bug will be fixed for when the game is open, untill then everyday will most likely have mix results.

All and al it's a great fun game. If you like building things to destroy other things and see if yours can be the fastest or strongest or more weapons. Pick and chose which weapons you want to use and placement. 

Paying $30.00 not on sale would be a mistake, waite till the game comes out to free to play. 
So at some point the game will end up being pay to win most likely a factor when new vehicles are released.
Money can't buy you skills only parts so it's still anyone's game.

The in game purchases total up to currently about $159.96 for 4 vehicles you get some game coins unique portraits (portraits have no value to any game stats, so mostly show or useless.) The weapon that comes with the vehicle. You also get paints that are for the parts, you could buy them in the in game player market, or get them from crates, lower chance to get the that way. much higher to get the from the market.  So you can get all of this from the player market, the vehicle design, you might need to just look up a youtube video how to make one. 

Match making the bots in the player vs player, or pvp for short. The bots have a much higher PS power score the ranking for each thing we build. The bots most time more than not have a much higher PS with almost 100% on most of these bots, they put bots in the place of other players to make a full game every thing 8v8. This is nice how ever if someone leaves then your down a team mate. Bots in game destroy when a new player is entering or about to to make room, so many times if you join a game fast enough you can be placed into the match. depends on the match and the players latest so far it let me join a mid game match so far was about 30 seconds into match, team was down some players and losing but some times that happens, not to often. more times when it places you in a match it's from the start, if not it's about 15 seconds or less into the battle. Some times it lets you join as a spectator and watch the battle till, you can join the next game. Currently the battles are 3 minutes long, but most matches it dose there for there is about 1 to 2 minutes or less in the battle, most times it's with in about 30 seconds so pvp are fast to join games. 

PS. just stay behind the bots, the go for the closets targets currently, so you still have a chance this is a big help to any current player new or old, or someone about to join the game to play it for the first time.

pve player vs environment / raids. match making is very bad very long waiting times. Each raid can have 3-4 players. 
You receive one free repair kit to respawn you in battle. You can get more repairs kits from either making them in crafting for 50 copper currently, which can only be gotten from doing raids, or buying it from the market.  So if your out of them or a newer player it can make the difference or not. Prices will change since your buying them from the players selling them on the market, so one might be 99.00 the next could be much higher or lower, all depends on the market prices. 

Waiting times is very high. Most times out of 2 hours before they change raids you can only get about 2-3 if your lucky by the normal waiting in the queue to do a raid. If you group up with close in range of PS power score or have 3-4 players you should be ok to start faster. Might also be since the game is in beta and not as many players have the game since it's listed but as free to play but sent released as free to play yet. So lower play base is a factor with the queue system needs a lot of work, for both pvp and pve. 

GM's in game attack you in game if you say you posted or about to post a bad review about the game. When they agreed about the same points you had a issues with. 
When you've been waiting in the queue's and ask others to join you multiple times. Then later on gm attacks you saying you never asked for help when I did dose not seem right to me. 
GM's in game making jokes about them using cheat codes and other to try glitches in the game, showing others how to use the ban commands. Then Threatening to use them on you, not a good community. 

The game is just grind grind grind. Levels, parts, recourses some you can buy and sell on the market to make a good amount. For beta like most it has it's limits on thighs you can get per week. on recourses caps. parts and fuel, copper seems to be the few things you can still get with out any current limitations.",1483666148,1483666148,False,11,0,0.519326627254486084,1,True,False,True

this game has a cash shop but you can earn / trade with in game parts to earn said currency - that said I've never felt that the cash shop offered any advantage to my builds and the game gives you 20-25$ of free cash on start to buy parts with you also get parts from leveling in the 4 factions can get it from fighting chests crafting ect - if you can buy it with premium cash you can make it - also while the cash shop raises your power it also causes you to go in higher ranks as vehicles are grouped by power not player level - so the cash shop won't hurt players who don't use it so no pay to win

the game currently uses a mix of players and bots - players are 20-30x as strong as the bots but they tend to have more armor so great cannon fodder - the games weapon selection and vehicle builds are interesting

   Crossout is an arcade styled build and fight game where you construct vehicles out of scrap parts and battle with other players or AI enemies. Battling rewards you with materials and parts which can be used to create other parts or sell them on a market. The market is very economy based with buying and selling prices. Usually selling parts yields tax which prevents players from exploiting the market. As you level up and build stronger vehicles, you gain affinity with four factions (Engineers, Lunatics, Nomads, and Scavengers). Leveling with these factions allows you to craft stronger parts at crafting benches (which you have to rent out).

[h1]The good.[/h1]
   As of December 2016, the game costs around $30.00 for closed beta access. As the decription suggests; the game may go free2play next year so I dont recommend buying it at the moment, but it sure will be good when it is free. The graphics card usage and cpu usage is quite low for stronger cpus and gpus. This suggests that you dont need a high-end rig to play it, but you shouldn't play it on a potato. The graphics are decent considering the strength of the gpu needed. Battles themselves can get intense as different player designs yields different play styles. One player may have a melee based vehicle when another player may have a sniper based vehicle. There are a great assortment of weapons. from heavy cannons to explosive javelins, this game has so many weapon variants.

[h1]The bad.[/h1]
   Sometimes the game may break and you loose progress or your account and you need help from the developers. Just so you know, the support is very bad. The devs refuse to help you and blame it all on you. If you continue to plea, they will keep denying it and give you false facts. The game itself can get a little repetitive. Build, fight, repeat. It's one of those games you play one hour, then break two hours.

[h1]The verdict.[/h1]
Pros:
-Almost priceless.
-Well optimised.
-Many play styles.
Cons:
-Bad customer support.

One of the main things I liked the look of in this game is the customization, and when I started playing it, it did'nt dissapoint. The amount of variety in this game with parts and literally everything is customisable, placement wise to paint jobs. 

The gameplay is fun and quite easy to get used to, time varies with different weapons because of placement on your car and distance.

There are quite a few maps for a beta too, and to be honest the games don't last that long so you don't really have time to glide through the whole map.

Overall this game reminds me of games like smugglers run & twisted metal. 

The destruction is awesome too!! Have you ever saw a tank been blown up piece by piece to just literally the frame and engine? Well if you buy this game you will.

Oh it also has a market place that functions too!! So you can buy new weapons and frames etc.

If you are looking for a creative vehicle building/battling game i would like to tell you, You will not be let down by this game and here are my reasons.

Pros:

-The game only limits you based on level/rank you can build ANYTHING you want however it may not always be successful in battle

-The game runs on computers from 10 years ago.

-You are rewarded after every match if you win

-It is relatively easy to build a very successful vehicle.


Cons:

-It is an early access game and is subject to LARGE and annoying changed at any moment

-Players entering a higher rank/powerscore will initially suffer from very many losses due to a weapon shift between high end tier and low end

In this game you build a custom battle machine from many different parts and fight other bots that other people have built. unfortunetly your bot wont be very good cause you just started and will be facing people with maxed out parts and weaponry, but dont be worried, after being stomped on by people and AI with much better bots than yours for about three days youll be able to get a new weapon! this weapon will still be shit compared to your competition, but good news! after you get 3 of these new weapons along with 6 more parts, (that will take you forever to build cause you lose about 80 percent of the time) you will be able to build a new weapon! Which btw will still be pretty crap cause you only have 1 purple weapon and no other equipment cause you just used it to build this purple weapon. But have no fear, cause after about 2 weeks of trying to get the parts you want by going through our terrible matchmaking, your stubberness will finally meet its match and you will most likely quite playing it regularly..... but think of it this way, we just made 40 dollers off you! isnt that great! 


Seriously though - This game has potential but is poorly executed

$40 = low player base,
Low player base + bad matchmaking = Getting Stomped on
Getting Stomped on + no team play = 80% chance of loss 
80% loss rate + when you do win theres a 25% chance of getting what you want if you win = Painful Frustrating Grind
Painful Grind x repeditivity = Rage
Rage + losing again and again = F this im going to play something else.


I bought this game cause i was tired of the mess robocraft turned into and was hoping for something like that used to be, but was sadly disappointed, mostly because of the matchmaking.",1477788109,1477788109,False,9,2,0.496014416217803955,2,True,False,True

[u]Day 1:[/u]
[list]
[*] I am trying to play the game without the perks you get ingame for early access, so far it seems alright early game, currently level 6. I have only come across a handful of active players in PvP, which is making PvP missions rather easy right now. [spoiler] As much as I like only versing bots, I noticed a pattern with bots, if you disable their weapons, they are going to try to ram you to death instead of going for the cap point (where applicable, some probably couldnt drive because lack of wheels). Every now and then, a player will hop in and play against me, but so far the meta, personally, is to try to take out guns and wheels on actual players, let the bots kill each other in their weird bloodbath, and if all else fails, earn that cap if possible...I cant tell you how many draws I got just because everyone was trying to kill each other and no one was going for a cap when time ran out. I made the mistake of letting a live player go after disabling his weapons, and they went to cap and ended up losing due to the cap points being 0-1. [/spoiler]

[*]Now my experience with the premium car you get: I didnt drive it, but it looks nice, but from what I see, it will be great on land, but suck on any wet patch as it not only slows you down slowly, but you cant steer...at all, aka hydroplaning. I see 2 shotguns, so its a close up fighter, but doesnt have much armor, so its really great for driveby shooting if you know how to aim while driving by/circling around. You dont want to be standing still with this car unless you want your opponent to shoot off your shotguns/wheels until you die. Is the car itself worth $30? Nah, the game is nice so far and you do get to keep it and the ingame currency you get into the open beta and final release, so it will be a nice car to boost your level when things get reset. Its around 2000 powerscore, so by no means is it OP, I would reccomend for beginners to use the car for a quick level boost, but for mid to late game, I would think building a newer mashine is much better.

[*] The market? I wouldnt bother buying anything from the market right now with ingame currency if you do decide to buy early access, the prices are insane at the moment.
[/list]

[u]Day 2:[/u]
[list]

[*]I tried out the premium vehicle that you get from buying early access to the closed beta of this game, all I can say is if you like controllable powersliding, this is the vehicle for you, and its blue rated mostly-everything-on-it, especially the dual shotguns, well placed shots can quickly disarm/disable your opponents. You will have to be at a angle, since both shotguns cant aim directly behind or in front of you. [spoiler]Protip: Sneak for cap point, get 1 point if all you are playing against in PvP are bots, go for 2 if there are live players, you can rush back to get the 3rd if they try capping your point. Aim for the guns, means of mobility, leave for dead until you rinse and repeat for all enemies, then go kill everyone, ez mode.[/spoiler]",1476393610,1476570129,True,11,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,True

Sublime lost.

Favoritism and ego-stroking.

Borrowed ideas and resources.

In short, it is a waste of time. There is no depth, sure you can add to the frame but there will always be someone there that can add more and ride right over you. It will happen time and time again, you will not be able to advance as you have to win to earn anything and you won't be allowed to win as you will continuously go up against those with better equipement.

I suppose the weak-minded loves this sort of thing and it is those weak-minded fan bois that will laud the accomplishments of the game while down-playing the rest. It is set on a pay-to-win (P2W) structure. You can pay real money and buy boss equipment, that is P2W. The balance is for sh*t, non-existent. Skill has little to do at winning in this collection of a^^hats running around punishing newbies, stroking themselves and the devs.

That out of the way if you ever played robocraft, its like mad max meats robo craft. That is what drew me to this I saw the P2W comments then realised this is gonna be f2p so these just the usual needs an excuse crowd. This game just like other new games Gaijen is helping out like Starconflict has both PVP and PVE going on you do not have to be a master at PVP, like some people think. So to some up, like Robocraft meets mad max, gonna be f2p before year is out, but has PVP and PVE options

Alright lets start with like Robocraft, meets mad max. If you can't tell form videos and what not you can make your own rides thes all kind of look like standard real life cars but in reality its like robocraft they were just built that way, because it works. You get specaly under carrage parts you can make them long and wide if you fee like it. But most don't got wide as you attack head on normally or camp head on its not bad idea to go skinny and long to fit all your parts.

Like Robocraft its based score system but unlike it where you limited on what parts to use, any part you can get your hands on and you do earn armor parts via grind, but can buy, earn or craft ingame all the non armor parts its just a bit of work for the high end stuff. Now the way this works isn't MMO style its a shooter for one, like robo craft its score based every bock you can use has its own score, and stats so you can't make a an armed beast with legendary guns and be in the low level matches you basicly have to be a a pair of tracks, a cabin and a gun to do that lol. Anyways that is how it works.

Now some people new to this think every one who is higher then them must be magicly using hte best ever parts in spades. But you can't do this, you can't rock high end parts with out compromising and using paper armor on most your rig. Now what you do is armor one key spot normally the front people don't get that and shoot that one armored part and think its all a tank but a shotgun or cannon shell to the side and you rip off half their stuff there, thanks to the score system, or just shoot off the gun(s) if you got an accurate weapon like maching gun or aiming with a cannon.

Now I got that covered here is the next part people don't get, this is going f2p all these max levels you may see, I hardly see, a rank 40. These guys are gonna be reset to one just like you when CBT ends, then on top of that tons of new players with out good gear are gonna pile in right 98% of players paid some kind of cash and bought some pack full of nice parts to start with on day one, but there is a whole world of cheap gamers who will show up when this is new with none of that, and of course complain your too op with your 2 shotguns in the steam pack lol.

I warn people of this becuase that freaks them out, yes your are gonna get wiped, but your playing now to learn how to play so one day one, you can b-line for your fave playstyles parts, you can use this time to dink around get killed, kill a few yourself, and look at all these vets builds when you die. Don't run to the garage and rage that you can't reque till your rig is out. You are gonna get wiped anyways, so look at the others when your dead. Make a note of how they did their rigs, how they play the game, and learn so you can try it out. Who cares if you go bust doing it, on day one you are reset as well as the rest of us. I learned heaps from that and now lets play videos of other people with no clue like me, testing and failing or suceeding.

Last bit this has a bit of PVE and PVP the way it works is simple you can't just PVE all day long unless you want work for it. PVE requires gas in your tank, every day I think you get more, but if you pvp with a feul barrel, it cost no energy used for impartant parts like guns and weapong radiators, but catch is you want to hide it and protect it, because its a gas tank it explodes when broken and can tear up parts near it when it goes. But you put that in your build and now every win you bring back some gas, and to make it more awsome it doesn't go in the tank with 200 limit you pile it in your storage with the parts for making your rig. So you can pile up tons of it, and sell it if need be to other players for stupid cheap, not really worth it, or just right click pour in the tank to top it off so I can PVE all day.

And what is the big diff minus the gas PVE gets you coupons, collect 300 and you can make a loot crate. Think of it like those chests you need p2w keys in other games to open but you don't in this. You open it up and its a chance you gonna get a part from any faction in game of blue or purple qulity or small chance you get a cometice. Now the cosmetic you think oh that is lame these give you rep bonus if you use them on your rig, basicly exp bonus and you can sell them to other players on the market who want that bonus, or just want to make a pretty car with it. You get a cap for these coupons every day based on diffculty, You also copper sheets used to make blue quality gear, and some wires for high end stuff. So even PVPers need to do a little basic PVE if they wnat stay ahead.

And that long winded reveiw is basicly what you need to know I didn't share any fun stories or cool stuff like that just basic stuff you should want to know before buying the steam pack. Things people come in and have no idea about. So to sum up again its like robocraft meets madmax, its score based not level. Its gonna be f2p, you could wait till then but then you could also rage about not knowing anything about how the game works first hand, and about people like me using are 2 little shotguns to tear up your stuff, even though I have expeinced guys with common grade lmgs tear them off all the time in pvp leaving me only with the abilty to try and ram before my wheels are shot off next lol And lastly it has pretty decent pvp, and pve system you need a bit of both but could just go all in either one, if you want work a little more, and buy and sell things to get the copper from not raiding, or buy gas because you don't like pvp.",1473024104,1473177883,True,16,1,0.401318222284317017,6,True,False,True

Cons:
- It's closed beta so there aren't a lot of players yet (you could help change that)
- It can be a bit of a grind to buy/craft high level parts (better than having to pay for them, tho)

The play style, leveling etc is very much the same as World Of Tanks, if you enjoy that game you will defo like this one. The difference being is that your vehicle Is crazy customizable, you can literally build your car from the ground up and armor/weapon up however you want and more importantly place parts where ever you want (within reason).

The biggest complaint I have seen is the lack of matchmaking which isn't true. Just like WoT matchmaking is not based on level but based on the the base body/class of your vehicle, the better body you use allows you bigger/better guns etc which in turn puts you in higher ranked matches. However just like in WoT if you try and power lvl into getting the better body's as quick as possible you wont have the resources to be able to equip your car very well so you’re gonna constantly get your bum handed to you. So its very much worth your while sticking with a body and building up resources to get it well equipped.

TLDR; There's not that many players. So you end up Vs. bots a lot. What players you do find are bristling with guns and smack you down in all of 3 second due to guns and being 20+levels on you. 

Also I fell out of a map. 

Full review; 

As far as play, its akin to World of Tanks. Things are a bit floaty though due to the ""build it however you want"" as you can build your car/truck however you want. Want 2 wheels? Sure. Jet engines on a microbus, go for it! 

I made maybe 5 diffrent cars in my hour or so. I added guns, removed them, had 2 wheels to see if it would work (it does), shotguns, etc. 

Then you dump yourself into battle mode. Its either capture (single point) or base capture (you base, their base, more people on it the quicker you cap). Sadly, every game I was in was 70-90% bots. So it ends up either deathmatch, or you rock around to their base and cap as the AI cars just drive around. 

I say give it more time. Currently ... its meh. Middle of the road. But thats only after an hour for me. Rather play with more people, shout at folks, get teamwork going. If you like WoT, you'll probablt enjoy this ... but WoT is free and this isn't.

I came into this purchase with the notation that I'd only play for enough time to be eligable for refund after the whole No Man's Lie Fiasco; i even debated not purchasing due to the fact that Crossout will be a future free to play game, but I've needed something to fill that void in my heart that NMS left there to rot. I digress though; this game is everything it is dreamed to be, and creativity it truly key.

You build your own death machine, piece by piece, and either blast your way to glory or watch yourself get demolished piece by piece. Truly a masterpiece; no more robocraft blocks making you feel like a mere child; here we have real engines of destruction that Mad Max has brought us to love over the decades.

Had a bit of a world of tanks grind about it; but every match is so invigorating that you get lost in the sheer fact that your turning your victims into smoldering bits of scrap metal. Precision is key, you want to dismantle their tracks/wheels and leave them immobilized while you rain cannon hellfire on their head? Or would you rather charge them full-bore with deadly shotguns, dismantling their weapons armaments leaving them high and dry asking themselves why? Better yet, pimp out a full on charging stallion to melee your enemy into smitherines. As i've said, imagination here is the key and the possibilities are endless.

I fully condone supporting this game in its early stages; for only greatness shall come in the future I do hope.

IMO it breaks this game as every other weapon setup is to some degree skill based (wether it be using them or strategy when setting up your rigs weapons). A testament to its effectivness is how many people run with as many of them as they can pack onto a rig and honestly getting one banged by a spam/troll loadout is truly not fun. To some extent this also applies to the design of the uglier player designed vehicles as they are taking advantage of a wonkey damage model.  Im sure or at least I hope they fix that as well as it would be nice to play the game with more ""believable"" looking vehicles and not the rediculous looking monstrosities that people come up with in an effort to gain an advantage based on weak game code.

Pros - Can be pretty fun especially at the beginning stages of your progression.  The game probably would not be as good as it seems if it wasnt for the building mechanic as its pretty rewarding to tweak a few things or build a ride from the ground up and do especially well with it.  The matches are action packed and if there was a decent chat or a lobby of friends it could be pretty epic as far as the teamwork is concerned.

Cons - The balance, good in the beginning at lower levels but absolutly broken toward the latter stages of progression and its to the point where I will not play even though I have dumped money into its cash grab setup.  Thats the other thing and honestly from this outfit I was expecting it, the cash grab ""pay to win"" model.  Yes you can play without spending money but its designed to take it from you as no one will have the patience to play as long as it will take to unlock some of the things in game.  For all the ""I dont spend money"" guys out there think about this...how much total time do you play a game before your burnt out?  100 hours, 500 hours, more?  This is not arma where a fair amount of players have 1k or 2k hours plus and are still playing.  The pay to win model will take your money before you burn out and there probably is an actual estimated time for a customer to do that on any given game...unless you want to get owned the entire 250 hours you play before you leave the game for good.  They know you better than you do which is why the ""pay to win"" model is even finacially viable.

BUT whatever.  Balance would fix this for me personally and I will surely change my review to reflect a more positive outlook on the game if that happens.  Again I will not revisit it until that happens but Ill keep an eye on the updates and give it a try later.",1472258715,1472258849,False,9,0,0.499321818351745605,2,True,False,True

All those shiny high end guns they have? You can shoot them off. Those power increasing generators they have? You can shoot them until they explode. 

The destructability of the cars, in my opinion really negate the P2W aspects. Sure you probably won't fair well in the starter car against a cannon, but its not like you don't have any kind of chance. Shoot off wheels and they will just sit there. Blow off the guns and they can't hurt you from a range. Melee weapons (Spikes, explosive lances and the like) seem a bit OP right now, but at the same time, they have to get really close to use them.

So all in all I reccommend this game. I'll give you a list here so you can just look at that.

Pros
1. Total Customization - Build a vehicle completely unique to you.
2. 100% Destructability - You can shoot off individual parts. 
3. Going F2P - Here soon it will be F2P, you'll have nothing to lose but your time by giving it a shot.
4. Graphics - Game looks really good, thats just my opinion, it is subjective mind you.
5. Optimized - I'm running pretty powerful hardware, but the game seems really smooth, even with everything going on.
6. Market - In-game market makes it easy to buy and sell parts you want.

Cons
1. Grindy - It can take some time to get really badass parts. Like a lot of time.
2. Timers - When you make things, there are wait times. Some of them get pretty long.
3. Match Finding - Parties can only go against other parties and it WILL increase your wait time just because of this. 

Indifferent
1. P2W Factor - It is P2W, sure, but the ability to get premium currency is pretty easy and even though the fancy parts are helpful, they can get destroyed in matches (Not forever mind you, you'll always have those parts unless you sell them) and those factors combined negate it in my opinion.
2. Bots - More than likely, you'll end up in matches that are comprised entirely of Bots. This I think helps reduce wait time finding matches, but Bots are easy to scrap, mostly. 

All in all, I do reccommend this game. Remember kids, reviews are opinions, I find that I like this game, you might hate it for the exact reasons I like it and thats ok.

EDIT: Forgot to mention Power Score herlping to Negate P2W aspects as well. Its basically your vehicle rating. Match making trys to put you with similarly scored players.

It may be because of something from prior to the steam release.  Let me explain why this is nonsense.  You can unlock any part and craft it without spending money.  You can make currency by selling parts you make or selling scrap (used to make parts).  You can buy parts and vehicles but you're going to be stuck with players who match your vehicle's rating.  So it's not like you can buy your way to better equipement than who you're playing against, you can just sort of skip the grind to a small extent.

As for gameplay this game is sort of arcadey driving with pretty good physics, reminds me of driving a warthog in Halo, except steering is independent of the camera.  Rounds tend to be fairly short and you can go from one to the other very quickly.  The vehicle customization gives you a lot of freedom and there appears to be a pretty large diversity of weapons

""Gaijin Entertainment"" look at the feedback from their other games and you'll see what type of company they are but then again who knows maybe hell will freeze over.... 

now wheres that refund button",1472038695,1472038695,False,394,38,0.643622517585754395,77,True,False,True
