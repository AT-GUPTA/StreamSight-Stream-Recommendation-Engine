When I say 'platformer', it actually has a 3D presentation and some depth, but the structure is dominantly 2D with rooms to the right & left where you must often climb or sometimes get to another floor. You can interact with many objects in a physics sim-like environment. It's very well polished, varied, and convincing.

The controls are OK on K+M settings; I had to remap them a couple of times to be comfortable with them. The problem is that you need to constantly press on a key to remain crouched, run, or climb, so it can get annoying after a while, especially since you have to perform other actions at the same time. Overall, it's very satisfying despite a very few frustrating puzzles that rely on agility alone or repetition until you understand what the game's expecting from you.

There's no real story. You stumble through the rooms of a strange boat as a tiny child who tried to escape while avoiding the bad guys. There are some slightly disturbing horror scenes, but nothing over the top. In fact, it's a curious and unique mix of innocence and horror.

The game isn't long; you can finish it in about 4 hours. There's a little replay value if you want to get all the achievements.

I highly recommend The Hideaway DLC, which offers an even more interesting and fun experience, but you can skip the 2 other ones.",1708717620,1708717620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's atmospheric visuals and haunting soundtrack create a chilling and immersive experience. The protagonist, a young girl named Six, navigates through a series of nightmarish environments, solving puzzles and avoiding terrifying enemies.

The game's art style is both beautiful and unsettling, with detailed environments and grotesque characters that contribute to the game's overall sense of dread. The gameplay is challenging and requires players to use stealth and cunning to survive the game's various threats.

Little Nightmares excels at creating a sense of unease and tension, as players are constantly on edge, never knowing what horrors await them around the next corner. The game's narrative is minimal but effectively conveys a sense of mystery and intrigue.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

You get to a section where there are enemies swarming you and are on a time crunch and gameplay becomes go through the same little section and die each time until u figure out the right action to move on to next section. Like a video stuck on replay. Whatever atmosphere, visual design, or story the game is going for DIES, and quite quickly at that, everytime this happens. The controls are nonsensical and clunky, like hold one button to move while holding one button to sprint while holding one button to crouch whiel holding one button so you dont drop what yoiu are carrying. FUN. No option to make those toggle like the lighter, you also dont grab ledges automatically you have to press the interact button to grab and edge. No indication something is an edge you can grab either and the game allows your character to move towards background and foreground. So at times you will die because you tried to grab an edge and were too close to the wrong ""ground"" or will take you longer to solve a puzzle because you had the right instinct as to what was intractable but the clunkiness made you think it wasn't something interactable. FUN.

The ability to move you camera is pretty useless, requiring precision on the y axis when the camera is at a fucked angle is also pretty trash. The game made itself 2.5D for no reason, I don't see it expressed gameplay wise in any meaningful way that isn't an absolute chore or a clunky mess. Also zero explanations, which isn't completely terrible in sections where you are not on a time crunch, otherwise pretty frustrating. If I have mentioned more negative things than good is becasue so far these have made a bigger impression on me than anything else in the ""game.""

Checkpoints dont make a whole lot of sense in how far back they set you. I'm already smelling a ""our-game-is-really-short-so-we-artificially-extended-it-with-poor/none-checkpoint-placement"" type situation. Ok so changing keybindings sometimes causes your character to not respond. Like if i make 0 on number pad my crouch/slide it will let you crouch but not slide, so i have to keep it at default. Really milking game time, cant skip the 20min credits at the end.

Finished game. Good stage/enemy design, they are pretty unique, overall it is average. Would be an exellent game with the aforementioned issues fixed. The story is a little loose, very short game probably like 3 hours without all the trial and error and fighting the controls. 

All in all I do like it, cant recommend it for more than a $5-7 sale though.",1705728704,1708018991,True,1,0,0.493087530136108398,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[b]This review is based on playing on the Steam deck.[/b]
Little Nightmares is a 3D platforming adventure from a 2D perspective that encourages the player to step outside of their comfort zones and unlock their imagination to complete its many challenges and puzzles.
But do you have what it takes to help Six escape The Maw, or is she doomed to be trapped forever?

    [td]🟩 The story has been thoughtfully plotted out and written to give the player freedom to speculate on many aspects of the plot, but a solid foundation to work from.

🟩 Each chapter feels fresh and unique on its own, demonstrating excellent level design and the ability to implement multiple unique experiences into one.

🟩 The visual experience is a little dated but in no way unpleasant, especially while playing it on the Steam Deck. The audio has aged much better, providing an intense atmosphere and solid and gritty animation sounds that will have you gritting your teeth with every moment.[/td]
    [td]🟥 The movement mechanics are frustratingly clunky.[/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]
In Little Nightmares, you take control of Six, a young girl who awakens in a panic after a startling dream about a tall, thin woman standing in thick shadow, who slowly turns to realise her.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3143300160

With Six dragging herself from her bed, you are tasked with helping her escape The Maw that has become her home. Complete puzzles while being pursued by the many residents who wish to seek Six harm, evade your pursuers and help her attain the freedom she desires.

Little Nightmares is a wonderfully designed story experience that is captivatingly innocent and ruthlessly dark, all in a seamless brushstroke. By capturing a tangible yearning to escape the confines forced upon you, this game illustrates a true struggle to survive in its absolute primal form, employing your childhood fears and uncomfortable settings to throw you off and forcing you to question whether the next step will be your last.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]A game of cat and mouse.[/h3]
Six has very little in her favour aboard The Maw. She is small, unarmed and weak to the many horrors that seek her demise. Even in the aspects you would believe would be on her side, such as speed and agility, she still falls short compared to them. The only real option you have to keep her safe is to keep her hidden by hiding in the shadows and embracing claustrophobic tunnels.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3143300269

A task often made difficult by the fact the movement controls are a touch cumbersome and often make it challenging to manoeuvre as you seek your escape.

Thankfully, exploration doesn't play a large part in the experience here, so you won't have to go far off the beaten track often to find items or collectibles.

[h3]Use your head.[/h3]
The only other significant aspect of this game is the puzzle mechanics. There are quite a few puzzles in Little Nightmares that will challenge you to complete multiple steps for your reward or have you try and achieve objectives while being hunted.

These can be quite difficult to overcome, but the reward for your prowess and ingenuity will be your freedom.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
As mentioned above, Little Nightmares does suffer from somewhat dated graphics, but it is far from a terrible visual experience. The journey is still extremely captivating and atmospheric, and it plays like it’s right at home on the deck.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3143300584

The audio hasn't aged as much and remains a solid experience throughout the journey. Animation sounds will have you gritting your teeth against the abrasive sounds you commit to, and the general ambience of the world helps immerse you wholly. The music is also sensational by providing compelling and unique tracks for each new location you visit.

[h1]Deck Performance and Specifications[/h1]
I experienced no issues running Little Nightmares on the deck, and the general performance was well above expectations. A full charge allowed approximately 3-4 hours of gameplay at the default graphical settings.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Very Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
With so much going for it, Little Nightmares is probably paramount one of the best deck experiences I've had to date. Its beautiful storyline, and wonderful world building consistently impressed me, and I'm still entangled in the complex plot it left me with. Only weighed down by its incredibly clunky movement mechanics, which take up a large portion of the experience. This is definitely a must play game for fans of horrific atmosphere and gripping tales.

The game's primary strength lies in its atmospheric and haunting visuals, which create an eerie and mysterious world that is both unsettling and captivating. The attention to detail in the environment and character design is commendable, immersing players in a nightmarish journey through the Maw—a surreal underwater vessel that serves as the game's setting.
The gameplay mechanics are intuitive yet challenging, requiring you to solve intricate puzzles while navigating through treacherous environments. The game cleverly balances exploration, stealth, and platforming elements, keeping you on your toes as you encounter various grotesque and formidable enemies. The suspenseful gameplay combined with the game's ominous soundtrack creates a sense of constant tension, making each encounter a heart-pounding experience.
Moreover, the narrative of Little Nightmares 1 is minimalistic yet intriguing. It relies on visual storytelling, leaving much to the player's interpretation. As you progress, you unravel the dark secrets of the Maw, slowly piecing together the unsettling history behind its inhabitants and the protagonist, Six.

But the control and the camera were unresponsive and confusing. The lack of story made me alternatively feel bored or frustrated to the point where playing was a chore and I had no reason to continue except I've paid for this. I died a lot of times confused about where a platform was,  my character was trapped in a wall walking in the darkness until I had to reload the checkpoint, collisions failed a lot of times killing you, especially in the eye areas. The solution for some puzzles was so scripted that you have to try the exact place a few times until it worked. Sometimes the solution didn't work the first time and let me thinking that i was doing it wrong and wasted a lot of my time.  Going back and forth to the checkpoints for things like those was annoying AF. I was very worried about how the next stages could be even worse when I had to be fast with the terrible camera and control when the game decided to spare me more suffering and crashed with the U4 atlas window.

On the outside chance you’ve found your way here and are yet to play the game, I’d strongly encourage you to pick it up and give it a go. This one is worth the full price, and the developers certainly deserve the support, as they’ve created something that will live in the memory for far more time than it takes to complete, and that, perhaps more than anything else, is the hallmark of great horror.

The atmosphere is so intense, mysterious and fascinating:
Sounds, lighting, mist, colors, a world really comes to life and it literally feels as if you are there strolling around these mysterious, scary places, driven by your curiosity and will to survive.

I love the use of ambient sounds in this game. There are occasional melodies here and there, but most of the time it's just you and the cracking of planks of woods you walk on, the wind blowing and the distant echoes that fill this amazing world. It really is something that should be seen more in videogames.

Moving around and getting your way out of trouble felt so engaging:
swinging while holding onto chains/levers, activating mechanisms, picking up stuff, bringing it with you all the way to the point of use, taking advantage of objects/environment to distract monsters...

I have never seen  such attention to detail before in a videogame: the animations of Six while she interacts with her surroundings are so expressive (she goes as far as raising and sliding her hands on the walls if you walk close to them).

The character designs are truly spooky and the whole setting was pouring with magic. The inspiration from titles like Ghibli's Spirited Away are very apparent.
The final boss felt incredible to take down, and the ending delivers one of the best climaxes I have ever seen in any form of media.

It'll be unlikely to feel an experience as slow and intense as this one again.",1701549613,1704375042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, eventually I found a way to play through the speakers instead of that one earphone. And wOw did that change the way I was experiencing the game! It sounded so mush better and just more energetic and alive. Unfortunetely though, it was very late in the game, and I couldn't experience it like I should have. So, I don't think I can rate this properly since the sound design does really play a big part in what makes this game really just so Fantastic!

The overall atmosphere and character design is beautiful and creepy. The environmental horror and use of space in this game has always been a pleasurable experience to me, even if the first game's level design is a bit bleak at the beginning in comparison to Little Nightmares II. Still, the concept of the Maw and interpretative lore is something I always come back to, I will never get sick of the theories people have on this game. The soundtrack is always MWAH! ♥ Six's theme rings in my head forever - and several zone related music. Little Nightmares II wins on chase music, imo.

- If you're looking for a game that's easy on horror and most of the fear is running for your life, this is that game. I would say that alone can be nerve wracking, but in a typical style of horror it isn't that. Which is good for me, I'm a baby.
- I wouldn't say this game is... too hard? You might die a few times in chases or mechanics but they aren't hard to grapple with unless the finicky character movement gets you. Also, I'd recommend a controller, always.
- This game is half the time of Little Nightmares II, you can complete it in a matter of a few hours.

Inside was my appetizer into suspenseful, side-scrolling horror games, and Little Nightmares was a lovely first course follow-up. Little Nightmares was very similar in that it offered limited or absent dialogue or directly stated narrative. Both games tell a story in their environments and characters, although Little Nightmares leaves less to the imagination. The characters are horrifying and creative and strike a fear that quickly turns into determination to conquer. What we learn about the our protagonist throughout the game is delightful and intriguing, and left me wanting to learn more about the other games in the series. The game itself, while being home to deeply disturbing concepts, is executed GORGEOUSLY. I found myself continually saying ""This game is beautiful,"" which felt odd because of its macabre atmosphere. Although it's suggested to play this game on a controller, it is possible to play with a keyboard. The controls are basic, but suddenly seem more difficult with a grotesque creature breathing down your neck. The gameplay was seamless and I encountered zero bugs throughout my two-session playthrough. The puzzles and situations the player is faced with are so creative, and I found myself wondering what they would come up with next.

A beautiful game with small details and no hand holding. This game is a ""three-dimensional platformer"" - essentially you can move somewhat forward and backward in addition to sideways. I really enjoyed the puzzles, and am glad to have found a conceptually interesting game which doesn't just sell itself on the aesthetic. The game has a unique feel and nice atmosphere/sound scheme, but it still had substance, and you won't just be buying it for the ""flavor"" of the world/the game's looks.

I played this game on the PC with my keyboard, but I found it a bit frustrating and sometimes had to reload simply due to key issues. I would highly recommend playing with a controller. Otherwise, I changed some keys, and I felt that the following changes significantly improved control for me.

Change to the following:
Sprint -> Right shift
Grab -> Right ctrl
Crouch -> Left shift",1703548491,1703590542,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients
large leg of lamb, or shoulder, bone in, approx 2kg/4lb 8oz
3 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
1 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, sliced into slivers
3 onions, thickly sliced
2 red peppers, chopped into large pieces
1 large aubergine, chopped into large pieces
400g tin chopped tomatoes
300ml/½ pint beef or chicken stock
2 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste
3 fresh bay leaves
1 tbsp honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Method
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.

Using a small sharp knife, make a series of small slits over the leg of lamb. Put 2 tablespoons of the thyme in a bowl with the paprika and oil, season and mix together. Spread the mixture over the lamb, insert the garlic slivers into the slits and season the lamb with salt and pepper. Put the onions into a large, deep roasting tin, sit the lamb on top and roast for about 40 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.

Scatter the peppers and aubergine around the lamb. Pour the tomatoes into a bowl, add the stock, tomato paste, the remaining thyme, bay leaves and honey, and stir to combine. Pour into the tin over the peppers and stir. Cover the whole tin with foil and return to the oven for about 4 hours, until the lamb is tender and falling off the bone.

Lift the lamb out of the tin and place on a large board. Spoon off any fat from the top of the sauce. Carve the meat into slices and serve with the vegetables.",1703445883,1703445883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

<3
Here's my impression of the game ""Little Nightmares"" after a brief but captivating gameplay experience.

""Little Nightmares"" is a true embodiment of art in the world of video games. From the first moments of the game, you are captivated by an atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The game not only evokes fear but also creates a unique world where every step is a new discovery.

The graphics impress with their detail, atmosphere, and uniqueness. Each character and level has its own character and contributes to the overall mood of the game. The variety of tasks and puzzles keeps you on edge, and the music and sound design create a unique soundtrack to your adventure.

The gameplay is a separate narrative. Agility and logical thinking are crucial, and each level requires new skills and strategies. It's not just a game; it's interactive art that captivates your imagination and leaves you with plenty of impressions.

In ""Little Nightmares,"" I found not just a game but an emotional and intellectual challenge. It's a work of art that will leave its mark in the memory of every player. And what particularly impresses me is the game's soundtrack, resembling a lullaby at night. The musical accompaniment in ""Little Nightmares"" seamlessly fits into the overall mood of the game and, like a lullaby, has the ability to immerse you in deep reflection, creating a sense of calm even amid horrors and mysteries.

Each melodic touch, adapted to the atmosphere of a specific level or moment in the game, resonates in my inner world, adding even more emotional nuance to the events. This musical approach emphasizes not only the terrifying side of the story but also makes it more profound and emotionally rich.

The soundtrack of ""Little Nightmares"" gives the impression of being in a large, living dream, where melodies intertwine with the visual aesthetics of the game, creating an incredibly harmonious and effective interactive experience. This lullaby symphony becomes an integral part of the impressions from ""Little Nightmares"" and enhances the overall gaming experience, making it even more unforgettable.",1700274834,1700630289,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The environments and art direction are absolutely stunning--it's an absolute delight to look at despite its grotesque themes. The character designs are simultaneously disturbing and oddly charming, in a sort of Studio Ghibli's ""Spirited Away"" sort of way. The animations are fantastic--from the twitches of limbs, to the swinging of loose doors you climb, to the way the fish's bodies reacts to your mass as you walk over them--every little detail really helps to make this world feel alive. Despite the incredible, dark atmosphere however, Little Nightmares never really felt like a horror game. I wouldn't go in expecting to be spooked.

The game is less than two hours in length, which wouldn't be a bad thing in itself, but the final chapter didn't feel like much of a climax. It was way too rushed. You're presented with a new monster (the least interesting of them all) who's been hinted at throughout the game, but you have one brief chase sequence with it before a very simple final fight.

The worst part of the game, unfortunately, is the flow. You will most likely die to something that felt out of your control, maybe multiple times in a row. Near the beginning for example, you're taught to keep quiet to avoid a monster. You transition to a new room while being silent. He follows you in and immediately chases you as if he heard you, despite there being no indication (not even tense music).

The hurtboxes feel inaccurate. I died way too many times to collisions with enemies when I was clearly out of their reach. I must've died to the dining table level at least seven times, which completely kills any sort of tension. I've run into multiple bugs where I got stuck on the environment or an item disappeared and I had to reload.

So basically I wholeheartedly recommend the game. I just wish it had been perfected. It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen, just incredibly frustrating.

Really great game but also very dark and sinister and thought provoking as it, intentionally or not, is about the nwo illuminati, their occult child sacrificing, child sex trafficking and organ harvesting as well as food for the canibals because yes there is a lvl for that sickness too in the real world big game. Its all cleverly incorperated in a game to shine a light on whats going on. or I hope this is the reason. 
But im probably just crazy.

To me this clearly shows the horrors these kids go through displaying the all seing eye (illuminati) and their perversions and take over, spying and copperation with the 'asian' aka 'the chinese' we see resembled in the game.

Or its just a game and I could be wrong and the pletora of symbles and hidden meanings are completely made up and im imagining things because these things doesnt happen in real life, Oprah says so, so it must be true.
Those select few who understand whats going on in our world can relate to the dark themes in the game and applaud the way it was turned into this game without being obvious, to shine a small light on all millions of poor children sacrificed, lost and abused every year and the horrors and nightmares they xperience, while inventing little fantasy playmates.
This is MY interpretation of what the game is about, it can be a pletora of things, but once u know ur symbolics and do ur research u will learn the truth.

Once uve played the Secrets of the Maw DLC even more are unveiled to reference real life nightmares, if u know it u know it.
SPOILERS in the next few lines:

SKIP
Once we finally see the mysterious woman and her reflection in the mirror, we see a very very old lady's face. She then proceeds to 'eat' u which then turns u into a *spoiler* which reveals the the truth about the base game and 2 previous DLC's.

DONE SKIPPING.

The third DLC is a reference to real life elite nwo illuminati,  to andrenochrome and satanic child tourture in specifics. Many of the rich elites in their various occult  and satanic freemason, Skulls and other devil Orders are running our world, kidnapping and buying our children for, as mentioned above, organ harvesting, sex, and worse, as well as to harvest their andrenochrome. Andrenochrome is a psycoactive 'drug' that gives an adrenaline boost, as that organ is responsible for our 'fight or flight' response. It makes these sick ppl, where as most in the top are old, feel 'younger' and 'enlightened'.
Look this up.
All these Little Nightmares is well made and turned into this amazing but dark game which can be interpreted in many ways but if u know, u know.


A prayer for all the innocent victims we turn a blind eye to while we sit in front of our tv eating ourselves to obesity pretending all these Little Nightmares doesnt exist around us and that our children are suffering needlessly.
No, Im just crazy and imagining things that arent there.
A prayer For A Better Day.

I can highly reccomend this game and im looking forward to trying the other 2 out despite the darkness!

If ur an achievement compltionist dont bother with that in this game, Rascal and Not Alone, maybe more, is very bugged and wont trigger for a lot of ppl no matter what we try :)

Santa is a woman and shes black, did u know?

That been said, this is no scary game. There are some unexpected events but they are not scary. That's cool for me, I usually can't handle that.

Now there's one thing that's very bad designed in this game: the controller vibrations. For literally every move that the character makes, there's a vibration. First of all this is annoying, and it cannot be disabled in the game settings. Secondly, there are parts in the game where they really make sense -- for example, matching the heartbeat in tense situations.

I even got to play the DLC blind, and while the final few puzzles were a little bit of a roadblock on occasion, I don't regret sticking through it! The atmosphere, the grotesque imagery, the music, the tension! Before LN, I had made a point of only ever watching OTHERS play through horror games so I didn't have to, and yet even watching footage of the first game: I KNEW I wanted to play its sequel myself!

The story-line is truly unsettling, and, since the story-telling is implicit (there are no cut-scenes, written text etc..) you have to look around to understand what is happening. The strangely comforting art-style of the game combined with its eerie atmosphere gave the game dimension and made me want to keep playing. 

The levels themselves were challenging (maybe it's also because I'm new to gaming), but not to the point that you had to rage-quit. The fact that you have to complete little side quests (which, btw, the game does not tell you about) to get the various achievements adds value to the game.

I do think that this game was intended to be played with a controller, though, as, sometimes, Six would not respond accurately to the keyboard movements. So, if you have a controller, definitely try playing this game with it.

If you are interested in the game because of the vibe you get from screenshots or trailers then I can easily recommend it. If, however, you play games more for the mechanics and don't care as much about art, sound, or story, then you may want to read further.

First, before I list my complaints, let me praise the game a bit more so that it's clear how much I liked it. It really is an incredible experience. The graphics are fantastic; it uses Unreal, but the art direction really sets it apart from other Unreal games. Everything has a very tactile feel, so that every creepy place you venture through feels like you are there. The sound effects amplify the already disturbing visuals, with the noises that the inhabitants make deserving special recognition. Playing Little Nightmares did make me feel both like there was some kind of dream/nightmare logic going on as well as like I was a little kid in a big world that I didn't understand. There are some scary moments (including a few really tense standout moments), but I think my main impression looking back was of being unsettled, uneasy, disturbed, and curious. There is no dialog and nothing is explained, so if you enjoy ""environmental storytelling"" where you have to try and piece together what is happening then this will be right up your alley.

Ok, now for the bad: I had _many_ frustrations playing this game. It felt like the game design was often at odds with the incredible experience I was having, ruining my immersion and making me frustrated and just wanting to get past something to see what happened next.

The camera perspective is such that the gameplay is primarily 2D, with just a little bit of depth. I think this was the perfect choice visually, but the result is that it can be really challenging to accurately judge where your character is in the depth plane. This wouldn't be a problem except that the game has several sequences where this is critical. The classic example of this for me is when I was walking along a pipe, with no enemies or time pressure, and I just steered the character off, falling to her death. This was a one-time event, but there were many (MANY!) times when I missed a jump or didn't avoid dangerous obstacles I had to thread my way through, not because I didn't know what I was supposed to do or mistimed something but because I couldn't tell where I was in relation to other things.

In addition to these (presumably) unintentional issues, there are also intentional issues that are core parts of the game design that lead to frustration. There are many (MANY!) sequences where the required timing is really tight, but also you are given very little time to anticipate or react. The result of this is that I often found myself redoing sections over and over. To be clear, Little Nightmares is not a difficult game, and the skill required to actually complete any of these sections isn't so bad. The problem, though, is that it feels like failure is anticipated or forced; you often can't really know what to do ahead of time until you've tried it and seen what happens or how you fail. Even this isn't inherently bad (if a bit old school), but it is bad in the context of what Little Nightmares is trying to do in terms of mood. It sets up these incredible situations and set pieces where I as a player was 100% engaged and was completely identifying with my character, but then when I failed in that context and had to redo things multiple times they lost all effectiveness. In a game like Ori I think this kind of game design can work, because the focus is on skill and platforming, but in a game like Little Nightmares where the focus is on the tension and atmosphere it felt very counterproductive to me.
(Also, related side note: There is a section where the controls of the flashlight change suddenly and without warning (and with an onscreen hint if you die enough times that doesn't make it clear that the control scheme is actually different). If you decide to play and find yourself getting really frustrated at one point because of the flashlight, just remember that it may be behaving differently from how it has the entire game!)

Again, I loved this game! But it feels dishonest to recommend it without at least giving some disclaimers about how frustrated it made me at times. I can't say enough good things about the atmosphere and what an artistic achievement it is, and if you're willing to look past some gameplay flaws there is a remarkable and memorable experience to be had.",1697997050,1697997050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was mainly a game play and game design issue for me, everything else was spectacular. Tone, colors, grotesque and disturbing characters/plot, that's really what carried and sold the game for me.

But the game play and design...for goodness sake... a little bit of direction would have helped so as not to be lost all the time. I can not tell you how long it took me to realize I was supposed to climb up something, simply because the platform paths are not very ""readable"". On one hand, this is good for the immersion of the game - nothing really stands out all that much and it makes everything blend well together. On the other hand, you often find yourself trying again and again to figure out where you're supposed to go. 

I much prefer things like Mirror's edge's runner vision to show objects you can interact with or even GOW4's yellow painted cliffs/edges to show where to climb. I'm not saying make the paths you are supposed to platform super obvious like in GOW4 or in Mirror's Edge Runner vision, just that SOMETHING to indicate where to go or what to do would go a long way. It could even be something small like things falling to show there is more space above your area or to show a point of interest for the player. The strange depth perception, though unique and a positive trait of the game artistically, does add a layer of difficulty to platforming that can sometimes get frustrating. 

Now, there is also the evolution of the game play. Most games, they stay more or less the same throughout. Maybe you get new gear or learn a new move to keep things fresh as you progress, skill trees are examples of this since they add to the game without changing the overall game play. You'd still be punching, kicking, or casting spells... they just do different things now. But in this game, it kind of shifts into 4 genres and it does that pretty seamlessly. Each chapter is played differently from the next, the first is more like a stealth game, the second is more like a puzzle game, the third is a scrolling runner, and the last chapter is a boss battler. 

I personally had my gripes with this, though I do understand that it is a pretty cool concept to have your game change on you and then to suddenly adapt to the game's changes. (Inscryption is an example of this). The seamlessness of the genre transitions is what makes the game hard, even though it can be enjoyable. For example, after succeeding chapter 1, the stealth portion of the game, you move onto chapter 2 which deals more with puzzles and platforming. Because the way the game is played is now different in chapter 2, you realize that being really stealthy and playing things slow suddenly get you nowhere. In chapter 2, you are supposed to take big risks. This transition I actually did enjoy because both chapter 1 and chapter 2 felt like the same game. 

But come to chapter 3 and it felt like I was playing something different, even though it looked the same. In chapter 3, it is more of a runner-platformer. With far less puzzles, and where stealth is ultimately useless. This kind of felt like everything that I learned and the skills/tactics i developed in chapter 1/2 were pointless and thrown out the window. And so for me escaping chapter 2 felt more like the true ending since it rewarded all the work I did in both chapters. I was scared, disturbed, had adrenaline pumping, and then I was relieved. 

Then chapter 3 happened and I was deeply confused. I had no idea what the purpose of the game was anymore, no idea where I was going, why I was doing the things I was doing, and i had to shift from stealthy platforming puzzle solving tactics to ...running... and I did not feel rewarded after completing the chapter, I just really wanted it to be over because I got pretty frustrated and disheartened when it felt like nothing i learned in the past 2 hours of playing the game was working. It really felt like chapter 3 was only there for a major plot reveal so as to better tie in the story concept - which is already super vague. You can only build inferences on the story with subtle visuals followed by the 4-5 grotesque actions that take place.

I like when stories are like that, instead of huge lore dumps in a note or on the walls, you are allowed to fill in the spaces of the story yourself and it's pretty fun. Are they monsters? Aliens? what do they want with me? etc. If you are looking for something scary, this game is at most a 6/10 of being scary but a 11/10 at being disturbing.",1697965370,1697965370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I confess that the platform game isn’t a type I usually play. But when I succeeded to go across the adventure from start to finish, it gave me a unique and fascinating experience. What is the game about? About a sympathetic character clothed in a yellow raincoat named Six, whose tenacity is to escape from the ship called the Maw.

I consider that has been reflected about the game and a variety of analyses have been written. I’ll only limit myself to describing something about the game and my experience in it.

The game expresses a story and it does so through a non-verbal narrative. All this is realized through its scenography. The elements that comprise a particular scene attain to convey a feeling and communicate a fragment of the story. As the players proceed, they discover the fullness of the narrative plot.

How does it accomplish to perform such non-verbal narration? The game does this through three components that, when put together, create something integral. These are: the soundtrack, the non-verbal narrative and the art. They all depend on each other. If one is missing, the essence of its plot will not be understood. Or, to talk about non-verbal narrative, it rest on art and music, for example.

[h1]The surrealism of flesh[/h1]

The game poses a developed problem, the meat-consuming society. The way the topic is approached is from the perspective of a tot. As the description of the game indicates: overcoming infanthood fears through a nightmarish journey in a world inhabited by corrupted souls. With this premise, the game forms its plot through psychological features where images, allegories, signs and symbols will preponderate. Everything it wants to tell is done in each scenario. The experience is visual, but also aural.

Although the criticism is outstanding, its art also attracts an attention. It's inevitable not to notice the artistic inspirations but it bring about to obtain an original and unique art. Surrealism mainly be conspicuous, although it coalesces with other artistic inclinations and expressions to achieve a grotesque horror scenography in an eclectic way.

It’s true that most of us have a prejudice about how we relate a scene to a work of art that we know. For me, for example, each scene forms a theatrical piece where the character Six is always in a performance. The progressive linear movement of each scene leads to a sequence like a piece of footage. The game is well composed that achieves to convey a message-feeling and, at the same time, an openness to personal understanding reflected in each immersive experience.

The enemies are symbolic and allegorical, deformed and grotesque creatures, causing an aesthetic experience and a unique sensation in the game. I’m impressed by the details. In particular, a feeling of being someone small in a place subjugated by colossal items. The feeling of repugnance, starving, fragility, helplessness and defencelessness is revealed at all times. All of this gives the immersive, uninterrupted experience, in the gameplay that’s seek and hide, as well as solving some small puzzles while dwelling inside the feeling of being caught, cornered or confined.

Although the gameplay is basic, where sometimes the options of running or hiding turn out to be discernible at all times, keeps our breath, fear and suspense by having ominous enemies consigned in our path. SFX, or special sounds, accentuate the tension experienced during such a moment, such as sounds of heartbeats or moans. In this way, the non-verbal narrative of the game is realized together.

[h1]The nightmare waltz[/h1]

I’ll say something briefly about the third component of the game's formula, its soundtrack. Tobias Lilja is its composer. Each piece of music expresses us about the happenings that the protagonist faces, mainly hunger, emptiness and the loss of her infantile.

The music performs the rhythm of the waltz, but takes it to dissimilar gradual tones, namely, light tones to dark tones. The drama of Six moving to the rhythm of the waves swinging the boat. Also it attempts to prove the ladder of Six's journey as presented in the start menu. It’s the ambiguous journey of a shadowy character to the bright peak.

The musical elements are often heard as lullabies but are distorted or deformed. It’s audible at all times and accentuates as a dramatic force in certain parts of the story. It’s ambient, industrial, with electronic music structures, but always focusing on conveying an enveloping atmosphere to each situation as a soundscape for the scenography.

It also relates the plot and, at the same time, affords an intensity to tense the feelings. Sometimes it’s luminous, but other times strident, screaming, strong, dark, funereal and hopeless. It has been realized well in the soundtrack, where it bares the distortion of the protagonist succumbing in a world where corrupted souls live. It’s an excellent piece of music to emphasize the nightmare.

[h1]Little Lost Things[/h1]

As a brief review I discern what I’ve noticed, although many details are absconding. I liked the metaphor, symbolism and allegory of the game, especially the way it begins and closes its plot. It’s beautiful with those opaque, murky and enigmatic tones in the style of surrealism and a drop of pictorial realism.

The game is a unique, original experience with a developed theme that is absorbing at all times. The game is short, but if you halt to contemplate every detail like me, you’ll be in for an agitating surprise. That is, the surrealism felt in the Maw. A world full of paradoxes and contradictions.

You’re unrestricted to imagine and understand what the game wants to say. There’re no theories, but rather a diversity of interpretations, which the game accomplishes to bring about that plurality of understandings and feelings experienced in a grotesque, terrifying, cruel and, paradoxically, beautifully disturbing world.

To complete the adventure, the game contains DLC that intercepts Six's plot. I personally didn't play the mini-game, as I consider [i]Little Nightmares[/i] to be an integrated plot and a complete game. There is no need to add even more to something that’s already well done. Recommended, it’s often on sale.

[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b] Controls can be a little finicky sometimes, but it was never enough to bother me -- only in the sense that some jumps may take a few tries to get the timing and angle right. I never found the 2.5D perspective unfair or misleading when it came to making leaps or deciphering where surfaces were, but a lot of people have complained about that so your mileage may vary; keep it in mind before you play.
[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] None.

Overall, I prefer the sequel story-wise, but this game has a little place in my heart. Additionally, note that the game only takes ~3 hours to complete, so I would personally feel a little cheated paying the current Steam price of £15.99 for it. I'd advise picking it up on sale.",1656169808,1697741004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw that it was on sale and thought 'hey, why not?' seeing as i had already borrowed the second game and gone in blind and had an absolute blast with it, getting every achievement.
At first, i had been annoyed by the pretty scuffed perspective and how easy it is to fall off platforms(compared to the sequel which also has some pretty annoying perspective at times) but, as i continued to play, I got more into it and way more used to it.
Odd to learn, easy to master, kind of a deal.

The narrative's ability to keep me captivated while also being very vague and puzzle-y is one of my favorite parts, especially when i can apply both literal and figurative theories to the game. Is this really happening? Is this just a child's perspective of the cruel world she lives in? Or is this truly about a child on a 'cruise' ship full of cannibals? It's all so interesting!
I do love the themes of innocence being crushed and molded into a rough bitterness just for Six to be able to survive, survival of the fittest and all that. It's a lot how our society handles child care, like with CPS and just blatant disrespect to even the idea of children.

The controller solution worked most of the time, but I still found it to be imprecise, especially during a part of the final dlc where the player needs to aim at moving targets. The controls in this game are rough, given that the game is a 3d sidescroller where you need to coordinate movement with depth perception. Not sure how they would fix that though :<

I want to mention that the aesthetic and gameplay are inspired by two pieces of media in particular which I really love, the video game, Inside, and the film, Spirited Away. Little Nightmares is great in a lot of ways, traversing its interesting and well designed environments paired with awesome atmosphere and intimidating threats, you've got a very good game.

It's a shame as the game looks and sounds amazing, the visuals and designs are all unique and memorable and the sound design is just right. Creaking doors and planks make way to terrifying screams belched out by horrendous abominations. The music is used sparringly but to great effect, especially in the rather memorable finale. Saddly the horrible controls leave much to be desired, such as getting stuck on little pieces of geometry at the worst possible time during a daring escape or failing countless jumps to the very poor depth perception. In fact depth perception or lack thereoff is a common occurance in this game, throwing an object at a button because you can't reach it is frustrating when it's this hard to get the direction right. All this things really add up to make the game feel clunky to play as a whole. It's also really unclear what to do or where to go at times. Since you can climb on some furniture but it isn't marked with a specific color or shine, so in a room with dozens of drawers you have to just guess which one you can climb. This is doubly annoying when you are running away from a monster, as these sequences are made to be very unforgiving, where even a moment's hesitation can get you killed. This took all the horror and terror out of these sequences and made them frustrating instead. I really hoped to like this game more, but in the end the audiovisual aspects aren't enough to alleviate the frustrations and the steep price that would make this game worth a purchase.",1695333336,1695333336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you liked Miyazaki's Spirited Away, you're probably going to like this game. It has very similar vibes, locations and characters.

-- Pros --
    + Great atmosphere
    + Very immersive
    + Great to look at
    + Entertaining

-- Cons --
    - Perspective is a bit wonky
    - Rinse & repeat puzzles. For every time you fail, the game gets more annoying.
    - Story is okay. Not bad, not good, just meh.

I have strong feelings about this game, it’s just so perfect

The music fits too well with the game itself. It’s usually deep and on edge, but it puts you at ease during the gameplay 

The SCENERY is so amazing 
I can agree that they improved on the scenery in Little Nightmares 2, but the scenery in this game is still done super well and is fun to look at while playing.

Literally my favorite horror game of all time, if not, my favorite game.

It's not scary for you, but rather eerie. As if the scary stories that kids told each other at night became reality. Little Nightmares turns you into a child, briefly bringing back the psychology that you dealt with through books and scientific knowledge.

But you can't get rid of the experience you've gained - you still remain an adult, you reflect. You don't see danger in dark rooms.

[list]
[*]In terms of genre, Little Nightmares is a puzzle-platformer. However, one of the key aspects of this genre - controls - was not executed well enough. It's precisely because of the character's unresponsiveness that some sections become painfully difficult to complete. Often, the character gets stuck or jerks when interacting with the environment, and he is unresponsive and incredibly slow.

[*]In this game, deaths are probably one of the most unfair. In platforming sections or critical moments, the controls can be unreliable, and your character might not perform the necessary actions. Enemies aren't inherently dangerous, and they could be relatively easy to avoid, but sometimes it's really difficult to understand when they might notice you. Moreover, escaping from monsters is practically impossible, except when a hiding spot is immediately available, which isn't always the case. In such a case, it would be appropriate to have at least some way to escape, so that it wouldn't be a 100% death and level restart. For me, this just makes the stealth mechanics very annoying. Basically, it's not such a big problem, but it just adds extra inconvenience to an already too short game that's supposed to leave a positive impression.

[*]The environments, no matter how beautiful they are, are difficult to navigate. Due to the odd 2D/3D perspective, it's challenging to orient yourself in relation to your character's plane. When jumping onto a platform, you might find yourself slightly to the left or right of it. Interactive objects blend seamlessly with the environment and are easy to miss. There are many situations where you think you can climb somewhere, but it's actually impossible. This is especially frustrating in chase scenes, where you need to make quick decisions.

[*]At times, the static camera takes very inconvenient positions, making it impossible to understand your character's location. If something obstructs your view, you can't see your character, which is annoying. Strangely, the camera isn't tied to enemies, so there are instances where they can see you, but you can't. While you can move the camera using arrow keys (up-down-left-right), it's more of a crutch. Doing this consistently is difficult, primarily because of the control issues.

[*]Due to the size of the locations, you often have to run from one end to the other for a significant amount of time (and frustratingly, most puzzles involve finding keys or similar items on the opposite end of the map). Here, the problem also lies in the fact that solving such puzzles can be quite lingering, as they are not always intuitively clear.
[/list]

I believe these are the main reasons I personally didn't enjoy the game. I'm sure it has found its audience, and labeling it unplayable would be inaccurate. However, I found it difficult to get positive emotions by playing it, and this review is based on my personal experience.

[h3][i][b]P.S.[/b] In my review I considered the full game with 3 DLCs. So, if you disagree with certain points, it's possible that it might be related to the fact that you haven't experienced the additional game content.[/i][/h3]",1690625954,1693132484,False,37,6,0.601393640041351318,0,True,False,False

The DLC really ties everything together, and I recommend getting them to complete the Little Nightmares experience. I'd even encourage you to play the DLC before the main story, and experience the horror for all it's worth. I've bought Little Nightmares 2, and downloaded the Little Nightmares comics, which I'm super excited to read. 

As a new-found achievement hunter, the achievements are totally accessible (except one). I got all the achievements and beat the game + DLCs in about 10 hours. However, it felt like 60 hours. Completing the achievements can be fun, and there do seem to be lore-related unlocks that you can only get through 100%-ing, but they aren't really explained. I have several scenes in my head that seemed significant, but I just don't understand the meaning. Now, my only complaint about the game is the achievement you unlock for completing the entire game in under 1 hour without dying. It's unreasonable, and just not fun. I didn't feel rewarded for completing it, I just felt desperate to get it done. 

Game is a 9/10, and seems to be heavily inspired by Spirited Away and Coraline — which adds to the dark coziness of this game.",1692400503,1692400620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]Diminutive Frightmares[/i]

[b]Little Nightmares[/b] is an enthralling and atmospheric puzzle-platformer that will leave players spellbound with its hauntingly unique visuals and eerie ambience. Developed by Tarsier Studios, this indie gem takes players on a macabre journey through a nightmarish world that's both unsettling and captivating.

Visually, [b]Little Nightmares[/b] shines. The art style is reminiscent of a Tim Burton movie, with its gloomy and grotesque character designs and intricately detailed environments. The attention to detail in the game's design is commendable, immersing players in a foreboding atmosphere that feels like a living nightmare. The use of lighting and shadows adds to the overall haunting experience, making every moment visually stunning and memorable.

The game's storyline is shrouded in mystery, which works to its advantage. Players control Six, a small, vulnerable protagonist who must navigate through the twisted halls of The Maw – a vast, derelict vessel inhabited by sinister and grotesque creatures. The lack of exposition allows players to unravel the narrative at their own pace, keeping them engaged and eager to discover the secrets hidden within the game's world.

Gameplay-wise, [b]Little Nightmares[/b] excels in creating a tense and suspenseful experience. Players must rely on their wits and stealth to avoid danger and solve environmental puzzles. The sense of vulnerability and helplessness is palpable, amplifying the fear factor and adrenaline rush as players stealthily evade the pursuing monstrosities. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenging puzzles and nerve-wracking encounters, keeping players on their toes throughout the adventure.

The sound design deserves special mention for enhancing the game's chilling atmosphere. The haunting melodies and spine-chilling sound effects further immerse players in the twisted world of [b]Little Nightmares[/b], creating an emotional connection with the game that lasts long after the credits roll.

However, [b]Little Nightmares[/b] isn't without its flaws. Some players might find the controls a bit clunky at times, leading to frustrating moments during high-stress situations. Additionally, the game's brevity might leave players wanting more, as the journey can be completed in just a few hours.

In conclusion, [b]Little Nightmares[/b] is a captivating experience that excels in creating an unforgettable and chilling adventure. With its striking art style, atmospheric world, and clever gameplay mechanics, it manages to immerse players in a hauntingly beautiful nightmare. Although a few shortcomings hold it back from perfection, the game's overall experience is undoubtedly worth exploring for fans of atmospheric and puzzle-driven adventures. [b]Little Nightmares[/b] successfully delivers a unique and unforgettable journey into the darkness.

The way the developers have put this together is genuinely a work of art, each room is designed so uniquely with such a wide range of creatures lurking behind the shadows throughout the story. Playing as such a tiny character in a massive world makes the player feel a sense of vulnerability that can only be understood after playing through the game. The game manages to create such an overwhelming feeling of anxiety for the player due to its great sound design and horrifying monsters all wanting to harm you. As the player you are constantly left feeling on edge waiting to see whats about to happen next in the story.

About the plot: If you play the game in isolation from the comics, the plot may not be clear, because the comics complement the lore, showing and telling us new information.

After passing you will definitely have 4-5 minutes of thinking about the game. Starting from allusion to gluttony to thoughts about the fate of the Sixth and reflections about Geisha.

Gameplay: Essentially hide and seek with puzzle elements. Achievements on find/hug/smash add a touch of excitement to the game. There were a couple of bugs with stuck NPC's, but not critical.

Another positive aspect of the game is that live viewer can be just as engaged with the game as the player themself.

My play time includes watching a 2 hour movie and 2 episodes of One Punch man, so yes, the game is rather short. Around 5 to 7 hours is more accurate to portray the time I actually spent ''playing'' the game. I suppose the main reason why I went ahead and went to do something else is that I find one hit mechanics rather frustrating. So as to not ruin the wonderful experience that Little Nightmares has to offer, I just went and did something else for a bit, and came back with a fresh outlook. 

You will die, and instantly at that, to some bosses... or rather encounters. It can be annoying to figure out what it is you need to do, but once you know, it's just a matter of timing it right and moving on becomes easy.

The story is weird, but in a nice way. Kinda like a grim Tim Burton tale. If you don't know Tim Burton shame on you.

The DLC branches extremely well into the main story and is definitely worth playing (once you've finished the main campaign). It's accessible in the chapter selection menu once you've finished the game.

Review:

I recently had the opportunity to play Little Nightmares], and while I was initially drawn in by its intriguing concept and impressive visuals, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the inconsistent and clunky controls. I experimented with both keyboard/mouse and controller inputs, and although the latter provided a slightly better experience, I still found myself struggling to execute even the simplest of actions.

One of the most frustrating aspects was the character's inability to consistently grab switches or ledges, despite my repeated attempts to do so. It became an exercise in frustration, spending five minutes on what should have been a straightforward task. While I must acknowledge that the control issues were not constant throughout the game, the inconsistency only added to my annoyance. There were moments when the controls worked flawlessly, but those instances were overshadowed by the times they failed, leaving me exasperated and unable to fully enjoy the gameplay.

As a result of these control frustrations, I ultimately decided to request a refund. It's a shame because the potential of the game was evident, and the visuals were truly impressive. However, the control inconsistencies greatly hindered my overall experience and prevented me from fully immersing myself in the game's world.

Overall, Little Nightmares has the foundation for an engaging and visually appealing experience. However, until the control issues are addressed and improved, it falls short of its potential and becomes a source of frustration rather than enjoyment.",1493416624,1689699106,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game presents a beautifully macabre world with its detailed environments, grotesque character designs, and atmospheric lighting. The use of a dim color palette and clever camera angles perfectly amplifies the sense of dread, making every corner feel ominous and foreboding. From the eerie, dilapidated ship to the haunting depths of The Maw, each location is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of unease, further immersing players in this dark and twisted world.

Little Nightmares is a captivating and atmospheric masterpiece that delivers a truly unforgettable gaming experience. Its stunning visuals, immersive game-play, and thought-provoking narrative come together to create a dark and twisted world that players won't soon forget. Whether you're a fan of puzzle-platforms or simply enjoy games that push the boundaries of storytelling, Little Nightmares is an absolute must-play. Tarsier Studios has truly crafted a hauntingly beautiful nightmare that will leave you both unsettled and awestruck, solidifying its place as a modern classic in the genre.
 
Little Nightmares' sound design deserves special mention for its ability to create an immersive and spine-chilling experience. From the creaking of the ship's hull to the haunting melodies that echo through the halls of The Maw, the audio perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, adding an extra layer of unease and tension. The ambient sounds and subtle hints intensify the feeling of being constantly watched, keeping players on edge and heightening the overall immersion.

One of these problems is the somewhat dry and clumsy controls of the game. Of course, this problem is not very severe, but this problem exist in the game, and this sometimes make a simple jump or hiding under a table a difficult task. This problem gets worse when you know that sometimes there is a long distance between checkpoins in the game and there is no lantern or candle on the way to activate a checkpoint yourself by lightning it. As a result, one wrong jump can cause you to have a travel a long way again.

But in the field of puzzles, we see the same creativity that we saw in a game like Inside, in Little Nightmares. It is true that the number of puzzles in the game is not very much, but the existing ones have an interesting design and are fun to solve.

But the gameplay is not limited to solving puzzles or jumping from another platform to another, and one of the positive features of Little Nightmares compared to other works is the presence of the stealth and chase elements in the game. During the game, we see antagonists who just need to see you to be killed. Their presence in the scene is enough to give you a sense of fear and try to take refuge in a safe corner immediately. As a result, in the game, you must first try not to be seen, and then, if you are seen, you must try to escape from the enemy in chases.

But in my opinion, the main part of Little Nightmares game is its story. After finishing the game, gamers will be divided into two groups. Some people will criticize the game because of not very clear and clear ending and some people who have received a certain concept from the game and its ending and will discuss it and enjoy the story.

Little Nightmares is really at a very good level in terms of graphics, both technically and artistically. The lightning of the game are the main positive future of its graphic aspect, which are at the top throughout the game and give a special beauty to this effect. On the other hand, the environments are usually designed in great detail and this also applies to the characters. It is true the main character of the game has relatively simple design, but the other characters in the game all have rich and detailed designs.

In terms of audio, the game is at a very good level, and the voiceovers are well and accurately performed and play a significant role in inducing a sense of fear in the game.

In general, Little Nightmares is one of the best platformer games that can entertain you with its gameplay and it is so rich in terms of story that gamers can have their own interpretation of it and can analyze and enjoy it as they want.",1680938846,1688940126,True,12,1,0.658976912498474121,2,True,False,False

With its unique visual style, atmospheric sound design, and intuitive gameplay, it's a game that immerses you in a chilling and captivating experience.

From the moment you take control of Six, a small raincoat-clad protagonist, you're transported to a realm where the line between dreams and nightmares blurs. The art direction in Little Nightmares is a true marvel, with its twisted and grotesque environments that evoke a sense of both wonder and dread. The attention to detail in the visual design, from the dilapidated furniture to the grotesque inhabitants, creates a truly immersive and macabre world.

The gameplay mechanics in Little Nightmares strike a perfect balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth. Each area is a meticulously crafted playground of nightmares, filled with cleverly designed puzzles and lurking dangers. As you navigate through the dimly lit corridors and avoid the clutches of grotesque beings, you can't help but feel a constant sense of tension and unease. The game masterfully builds suspense, making each encounter a heart-pounding and adrenaline-fueled experience.

One of the standout features of Little Nightmares is its ability to tap into your deep-rooted fears and emotions. The narrative unfolds through subtle environmental storytelling, leaving you to piece together the dark and twisted world you find yourself in. It's a game that invites interpretation and introspection, touching on themes of isolation, vulnerability, and the loss of innocence.

The sound design in Little Nightmares deserves special recognition for its contribution to the game's eerie atmosphere. The haunting melodies, ambient noises, and the subtle whispers in the dark all add layers of immersion and further intensify the feeling of dread. Each creaking floorboard, distant wail, and spine-chilling screech resonate in your ears, creating a haunting auditory experience.

Little Nightmares may be a relatively short experience, but it leaves a lasting impression. The combination of its atmospheric visuals, engaging gameplay, and thought-provoking narrative make it a standout in the realm of horror and psychological games. It's a testament to the power of simplicity and the ability of video games to evoke emotions and create a truly immersive experience.

In conclusion, Little Nightmares is a captivating dive into the shadows of childhood fears. With its haunting visuals, clever puzzles, and atmospheric sound design, it's a game that stays with you long after you've turned off the console. If you're a fan of atmospheric horror and enjoy thought-provoking experiences that delve into the depths of the human psyche, Little Nightmares is an absolute must-play. Just be prepared to face your fears and uncover the unsettling truths that lie within the darkness.",1688489251,1688489251,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The dark fantasy art direction reminds me most of Henry Selic’s works, particularly Coraline, perfectly distilling that uncanny valley of creepy-cute mixed with gothic. Coupled with the dark lullabies and booming orchestral themes it’s easy to become engrossed in the experience. It’s a bit shorter than I’d like it to be, but it mostly serves the game to keep the sections brief and succinct, plus the Secrets of the Maw DLC adds a slight increase of challenge and length that I was itching for at the end of the base game. As with most games the bosses are the best part, each providing a short but tense encounter with some of the monstrous creatures that inhabit the ship you’re on.

This twisted and hilarious adventure takes you through a nightmarish world filled with creepy dolls, grotesque chefs, and hungry monsters.

You'll navigate through dark and eerie environments, solving puzzles while trying not to get caught by the terrifying residents of this bizarre realm.

It's like watching a mini ninja survive in a nightmare circus.

The visual design is both haunting and oddly adorable, with its unique art style making even the most grotesque creatures strangely endearing. Just try not to have nightmares about them after you turn off the game.

Little Nightmares doesn't take itself too seriously, sprinkling dark humor throughout the gameplay. From absurd deaths to unexpected slapstick moments, it's a rollercoaster ride of laughter and spine-tingling thrills.

So, if you're looking for a game that will both scare and tickle your funny bone, jump into the twisted world of Little Nightmares. Just remember to keep a nightlight handy when you go to sleep. You know, just in case.",1687432777,1687432777,True,0,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

Little Nightmares is a short game that has plenty of fun contained. After waking up in the middle of nowhere, you explore as a tiny character named Six. However, there are plenty of creepy creatures and challenges awaiting you. This game is a lot of fun and I especially love the environment and lighting as well as the music. Each component adds to each other equally as well. There is also plenty of lore to be unpacked, though not everything is 100% certain and a lot is just theories. Each chapter of the game features different types of enemies and I especially loved the stealth sections in Chapter 1 and 2. Although the game is short, it makes up for it by maintaining its fun puzzles and interesting exploration throughout. This game also feels completely unique to anything I've played before and is completely its own thing. I would definitely recommend this game, and while it seems like the price is a bit high for the game time, I think it is definitely still worth it. You can also purchase a bundle with this game, the second one and all of the DLC which I am yet to play.",1686685730,1686685730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First time I experienced a game like this is Limbo, then INSIDE. Both great games you should try out

game: side scroller game like limbo and inside, very cool

story: quite vague but you're a small kid in a yellow raincoat named ""six"" and you're traversing through a boat/structure known as ""the maw"" while avoiding all kinds of weird looking enemies. 

graphics: stylised and realistic 

sound design is really good and the feel of the game's theme is shown perfectly 

Theres a DLC too, which you should definitely play as it ties in with Six's story.

424840,139640866,76561198845166494,42,8,17,0,17,1685811672,"Little Nightmares, developed by Tarsier Studios and released in 2017, is a chilling and atmospheric puzzle-platformer that takes players on a haunting journey through a twisted and macabre world. This dark fairy tale adventure offers a unique blend of atmospheric visuals, eerie sound design, and immersive gameplay that will keep you captivated from beginning to end.

One of the most striking aspects of Little Nightmares is its visual design. The game presents a nightmarish world filled with grotesque and unsettling imagery, reminiscent of a distorted child's imagination. The attention to detail in the environments and character designs is exceptional, creating a foreboding atmosphere that oozes with a sense of dread. Each area you traverse is filled with twisted puzzles, eerie lighting, and hauntingly beautiful backdrops, making every step a visually captivating experience.

The gameplay in Little Nightmares is centered around stealth and puzzle-solving. As the protagonist, Six, a small and vulnerable child, you must navigate through the treacherous and oppressive environments while avoiding the attention of grotesque and terrifying enemies. The mechanics are intuitive and easy to grasp, with a focus on timing, observation, and quick thinking. The puzzles are cleverly designed and often require you to think outside the box, adding an additional layer of challenge and satisfaction to the gameplay.

The sound design in Little Nightmares is masterfully executed. The ambient noises, creaking floorboards, and distant echoes create a sense of unease, immersing you further into the eerie world. The absence of dialogue enhances the feeling of isolation and vulnerability, as you rely solely on environmental cues and visual storytelling to understand the narrative. The atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the gameplay, heightening the tension and creating a sense of impending danger.

Little Nightmares successfully manages to tell a compelling and thought-provoking story without relying on explicit exposition. The narrative unfolds gradually, leaving room for interpretation and inviting players to piece together the dark mysteries that surround Six and her nightmarish world. The game's emphasis on atmosphere and symbolism allows for a deeper emotional connection, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll.

However, one minor drawback of Little Nightmares is its relatively short length. Clocking in at around six to eight hours for the main campaign, some players may find themselves wanting more of this captivating world. Nevertheless, the concise storytelling and focused gameplay ensure that every moment is filled with tension and intrigue, making it a memorable experience despite its brevity.

In conclusion, Little Nightmares is a hauntingly beautiful and atmospheric adventure that delivers an exceptional blend of visual design, immersive gameplay, and thought-provoking storytelling. Its ability to create a sense of dread and unease is a testament to its masterful execution. While it may be a relatively short experience, the game's dark and twisted world will leave a lasting impression on those who dare to step into the shadows. If you're a fan of atmospheric and unconventional horror games, Little Nightmares is a must-play that will linger in your mind long after you've turned off the lights.",1686061143,1686061143,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,1,True,False,False

It suffers from trying to be many things at once without being able to nail a single one of them. 

—————


I think little nightmares biggest failure is it's wishy washy refusal to commit to be an adult game. The environment insinuates something gruesome going on, but it's never very explicit. This would be okay if there would be explicit moments, like when you are grabbed and lose. But the screen always fades to black avoiding any explicit gruesomeness. Which makes this game feel like horror for kids, but bland as an adult. Hey, maybe that's the idea and I'm just not the target audience. 

The puzzles are all very paint by the numbers. They aren't imaginative or use moon logic, but they are all very very bland. You always have to do what you'd expect to do, so there's very little thinking involved in solving them. The result is you never feel any sense of accomplishment after clearing them because of this. Basically the game is very linear while pretending to be something else, so if you identify the path and just push through you'll get there.

There are a couple of easy nail the jump moments that because of the camera angle you can absolutely miss. This feels not difficult, more like bullshit camera angles. 

Also and this could be because I'm playing it on hard, I feel that the amount of chase the enemies give (even after hidding under tables and such) can feel like absolute bullshit. This forces you sometimes to just run through to clear the stage... Which just makes the sneaking around feel pointless in many places. The controllers are very clunky, you can't even shimmy left while climbing railings so you sometimes have to drop, move to the side and climb again.

To sum it up, little nightmares falls short from being a horror game because it refuses to get past the Disney horror movie line, it falls short with it's bland puzzles to be labeled as a puzzle game, falls short on its sneak and chase system to be an infiltration game, the platforming is okay but not the best to excel as a platformer. It suffers from trying to be many things at once without being able to nail a single one of them. 

In the positive side the art direction is great, but not enough to make up for how bland it is. And let's be honest, it's the only reason you bought this.",1685883271,1685890859,False,2,0,0.485980004072189331,0,True,False,False

It's so consistently tense and atmospheric. The puzzles and platforming are woven perfectly into the environments. And Little Nightmares kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time, without using any typical horror game tropes or cheap jumpscares, and the compelling story relies entirely on its visually told narrative with zero dialogue.

Despite the great atmosphere that Little Nightmares boasts from front to back, it's not mechanically airtight as a 3D platformer, and sometimes suffers from depth perception issues that can end up with the player dying to something unpredictable. This doesn't create any especially frustrating moments (you usually won't make the same mistake twice), but I definitely got pulled out the atmospheric experience a few times by dying to a long fall because I couldn't tell where to walk/jump.

I'd recommend getting the Complete Edition, as the 3-part Secrets of the Maw DLC (other than some performance issues) is on par with the main game with its atmosphere, creative direction and jaw-dropping ending. I don't think I've ever been as horrified with a game as I was with the ending of the DLC - and it ties into the main game in such a creative and unique way!

It's got a brilliant art style, a killer atmosphere, and enough tense moments to capture those looking for them. It's a shame, then, that the other half of this game is toddling around with Six at two miles per hour being hungry.

Okay, perhaps not, but this game's pacing is deadlier than a bomb-defusing snail at times, and it does hamper the otherwise stellar atmosphere. All the characters you come face to face with are incredibly grotesque, and all the dank, corrupted locales are suitably uncomfortable. Looking at the body of a man whose own face has fallen down off his skull while he paws around with arms about 4 times longer than should properly be is something that strikes you the first time you see it. Although your comfort with horror will of course depend on your experience with the genre, and nothing here is *actually* very scary, every single element in this game is infused with the macabre.

The lair is dark and empty, the implications for the prisoners are unfortunate, spaces unfold in uncanny ways that no logical space would allow, and all the while you're never truly alone. Always watched, always on edge. The unease is truly palpable; you are a small child and in typical fashion the world is out to get you.

The actual plot, following an imprisoned girl trying to escape from an ominous vessel where the rich gorge themselves, is about as standard as you might expect. Every time you ask a question the game is probably just going to put its hands up and say ""Oooh, isn't it mysterious?"" All that is expected of you is to ask why and not require any answers. Because there are none. The game's atmosphere still works wonders without it, and it's a suitable backdrop, but the plot won't make you think about Six's backstory late at night; that's for sure.

The remarkable is mostly saved for the scenery, though, for the gameplay is unremarkable in most ways. You can walk, run, jump, climb, mantle obstacles, and pick up and throw objects. You cannot run too long before running out of stamina. Super basic controls, but the game essentially needs to be this way. If the game had more going on, then it would be limited in the scenarios it could drop the player into (not that there are very many of those, either). Greater depth of gameplay introduces nuances and restrictions which have to be accounted for in the design stage of the levels, thus limiting the possibilities for the encounters. The game [i]needs[/i] to have the player only be capable of basic actions so Six can be seamlessly inserted into whatever tense situation. So while the game will get you very acquainted with running away, picking up objects, and pushing rolly things, I can't be mad at the game for this sort of repetition. It is what makes a horror platformer work to begin with, when its spookiness comes from looking at the game's spooky stuff in its twisted art style. Only in getting the game's most arduous achievement did I find the gameplay undercut by stiff movements and poorly timed sequences that didn't quite cut the mustard when you need perfection. Still, for 99% of players, this won't be a visible issue.

What is considerably easier to be mad about are the mind-bogglingly tedious hunger sections. See, Six needs to eat. And she's really hungry, so she needs to eat once every chapter, on increasingly depraved items. But every time it's the same ritual; a growling stomach followed by slowing the game down to an absolute crawl as you must simperingly quiver along the floor to the edible item, occasionally feeling hunger pangs which stop you entirely. Each time this happens is probably 30 seconds, which doesn't sound like a lot but truly breaks the pace of the game whenever it arises. There is no tension nor fear; only waiting. These sorts of cracks become much more visible when you try to get the ""Hard to the Core"" achievement, which accounts for a little over half of my 20-hour playtime. Every time I died and restarted the game, the hunger pangs were always the portions I dreaded the most. Beyond that, however, I came to appreciate just how truly limited the game really is. By its nature, the danger in this game is illusory. Not that enemies won't gladly kill you if you walk into them, but the game doesn't [b]want[/b] to kill you. It wants to make you feel like you'll be killed. Everything is so precisely scripted that once you get past the malaise, there is no wizard behind the curtain. You need only give the right inputs and walk in the right spots at the right time and you'll have no trouble. So while your first journey through the Maw is perilous, any replays are likely to strip the crusty, peeling paint right off the wall.

On the subject of replaying, you're most likely to notice that the game's bulk fits mostly at the starting end of the game, and this is pretty unavoidable. While the first two levels can easily take 35-40 minutes to clear and scour for collectible dolls and resident cute beings, the third falls to 20-ish, the fourth to 15, and the fifth to only about 10. On the extreme end, getting Hard to the Core requires beating the game in under an hour deathless; I managed it in 45 minutes. This is probably the game's biggest, most banal issue and if you want to equate price with time I'd say Little Nightmares is slightly costly for what's on offer, although I think having such a polished experience is worth it. Of course, if you want to experience this world and have a good time, I don't think the price tag is disgusting.

As an addendum, the three DLC levels are mostly more of the same, although they focus on more creative gameplay mechanics than in the first game and come up with some good variety. They're a worthy addition to the experience by all means. Plus the narrative is a far sight better.

Overall, Little Nightmares is a horror experience which does a suitable job being a horror experience, despite its indie-darling brevity and gameplay missteps. The visual design is really top-notch and the tension is pretty genuine on your first go around, although there's not much there afterwards so long as you're diligent with your collectables. Buy it, play it, have a good time and see if you can manage not to tear your hair out from the hunger.

Just don't spend 11 hours doing a flawless speedrun of the game. That took ages.

You play as Six, a small girl who must navigate through a shadowy, mysterious labyrinthine environment, avoiding grotesque monsters and solving puzzles to unlock new areas.

The game's atmosphere is one of its most compelling features. The graphics are fantastic, with the use of lighting and sound creating a sense of unease that lingers throughout. The game's designers have created a unique, stylised world that is equal parts unsettling and fascinating. The monsters you encounter are twisted and creepy, adding to the overall feeling of dread that permeates the game.

Little Nightmares is also an excellent puzzle game. The puzzles are clever and genuinely challenging, but never impossible to solve. The game does an excellent job of gradually introducing new mechanics and challenges as you progress, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting throughout.

The controls are simple and intuitive, making it easy to jump, dodge, and crawl your way through the game's different environments. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new skills and abilities that allow you to access new areas, adding to the game's overall sense of discovery and exploration.

In conclusion, Little Nightmares is a chilling and beautifully designed game that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Its eerie atmosphere, clever puzzles, and unique visual style make for one of the best games. If you enjoy horror, puzzles, or just want to experience something new and different, Little Nightmares is definitely worth checking out.

Replayable not just for all the little extras you can challenge yourself with, not just for the minutae that tell a story in that oblique and yet perpetually intriguing way, it's just fun gameplay.

It's classic horror gameplay but in that contorted fairy tale quality in which you are tiny, but sharp thing, in a wordless world of monsters. You have no offensive capacity, you can only skulk out of reach but mostly just out of sight away from these gruesome antagonists in a lonely world.

The lore alone is fun to explore on the message boards but it is also a terrifying game both for the sense that anything could come out at any moment and because the moments of chase are heart beatingly tense. The game waits for when you feel safe and confident and then lures you to a moment where you recoil in surprise.

The game play is strictly linear; there is no doubling back or getting lost though it may loop de loop on itself. You can't even carry items.

Completing this game, DLC included, took me about 4 to 5 hours, so yeah its a short game, regardless, the sheer mystery of the world of Little Nightmares is enough to convince people of trying this game, its dark, creepy, and dangerous, which is perfectly delivered by its presentation, from the designs of the creatures, the world, and its OST, all top notch, it really pulls you into it, wanting you to learn more. 

Gameplay wise, its pretty simple, you wander around as you progress through the levels, and you gotta deal with simple puzzles, while avoiding the various creatures, each one working different from the others, like most other puzzle games, its trial and error, and you gotta find out not only how to solve the puzzles, but also how to avoid the monsters, its a fun and tense experience, for those that like ""cute horror"" the design of the creatures will likely remind you of the style of Tim Burton. 

The game for the most part had no issues, but i did ran into one bug where one of the monsters got stuck, but besides that, the game is well optimized and youll likely play with minimal if any issues at all.

Its a good puzzle game, not particularly hard, but its enjoyable, and like mentioned, this dark world is really appealing.

Little Nightmares, a platformer that starts off with simple gameplay, quickly devolves into a maddening and uninspired experience. With the introduction of timers, double jumps, and other challenges that lead to constant game overs, this title is far from enjoyable.

Compared to other games in the genre, such as INSIDE, Little Nightmares falls short and is bogged down by typical game developer puzzles that offer little creativity. Instead of providing a captivating and enjoyable experience, the game becomes an exercise in frustration.

It's worth noting that the sequel to Little Nightmares should also be avoided, as it only exacerbates the issues present in the first game.

I bought Little Nightmares on sale, which mostly happened on a whim. I'm very picky when it comes to video games. Little Nightmares is a nice game but it gets more annoying than scary. The controls are sloppy which leads to frustrating deaths. Part of this is because of my incapability to control the character and struggles with camera angles so the experience might be different for those with a controller. I tend to be quite observant but still got stuck because I never happened to look into the right place - so a lot of trial and error gameplay here...

When talking about the good stuff, Little Nightmares is matchless in its uniqueness, like a fresh breeze in the horror genre that truly stands out. The developers clearly thought outside the box and I appreciate that. With many creepy elements and incredibly tense moments, I’d say this is a solid horror experience. Nothing that deprives you of your beauty sleep, but rather something that slowly creeps its way under your skin, especially the ending.

This game might look innocent and monsters cute but don't let it fool you... Despite not being exactly my type of game, I think this is very worth experiencing as I like the idea of being a small child in a world of huge monsters. However, I have to warn you that if you're a keyboard and mouse user like me, you'll rage-quit pretty often. I don't want you to base your purchase decision on my review, but I can recommend this only if you have a controller.

This game is like a twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, where everything is dark, creepy, and filled with hungry monsters. Seriously, if you thought the Jabberwocky was scary, wait until you meet the Janitor.

But let's talk about the real star of the show here: Six, the little raincoat-wearing protagonist who's basically the Katniss Everdeen of the monster world. She's small, she's sneaky, and she's not afraid to jump on a floating bed and grab a sausage.

The graphics in Little Nightmares are hauntingly beautiful, and the sound design is top-notch. I mean, who knew that a creaky floorboard and a ticking clock could be so terrifying?

All in all, Little Nightmares is a must-play for any horror fan. Just be prepared to have nightmares (pun intended) and maybe skip soup for a while.

Had no idea it was a platform game, but it's way more sophisticated than that. The characters are both charming and creepy and the story is vague and foggy. It comes together at the end, kind of, but does leave you wondering quite what you just played. I googled it on completion it to fill in the creative gaps and all became clear-er. There weren't many prompts to help along the way so you kind of have to learn via trial by error which includes lots and lots of dying, but luckily the auto saves are frequent and sympathetic. This game really has to be played on a controller which did not please me, my preferred method is mouse and keyboard, but I got to grips with it eventually. Trying to play on mouse and keyboard was not responsive enough for this game which runs on absolute precision - and that is the most challenging aspect of the game. Never have I played a game that requires such exacting movements and angles for success, a slight deviation of direction or the loss of a single second during the chase and escape scenes results in continuous repetitive death, and I died a lot, which became funny after a while and lessened the horror of the monster or monsters I was trying to escape. What twisted minds dream up these things I wonder? But I'm glad they do when it results in enjoyable games like this. I was so intrigued, and had such smooth game play throughout, that I went on to purchase the sequel, or is it a prequel? Who knows, I guess I'll find out.I didn't find The Secrets of the Maw DLC until after I had completed the main game.

Escaping from giant monsters while being a tiny girl running on tiny legs and pitty-pattering little feet is actually pretty funny. :P The most shocking scene in the game probably happens when the character has to eat (the meals are increasingly  more revolting).

It’s a true master class in quality over quantity and I wish more AAA game publishers would follow this example. The storyline is relatively short but its so intriguing! Through the entirety of the playthrough I was wishing more cut scenes where just around the corner so I could understand more about six and this place she is running around in. However, the game avoids laying out the story for the player through cut scenes and dialogue, so theses things are few and far between. The story is mostly relayed through the environment so if you want to know more, you’ll have to explore the world around you. This brings the beauty of the game out of the darkness and into a flickering light. The intricate detail of the game is mind blowing so I would strongly suggest periodically stopping to soak it all in. I really love the art style. It reminds me of a Doctor Seuss book but with a Lovecraft twist as everything is very creepy yet somehow child like. 

Don’t hesitate to buy the DLC’s either as they are just as good as the main game. By experiencing this new adventure, the player is given more information applicable to the original story. Making subsequential playthroughs of the game very interesting as you realize how the individual efforts of each protagonist affected one another. This is something I really appreciate because if you want to beat this game multiple playthroughs will be required. Some DLC’s lack a good story but not this one. Its very well thought out and comes full circle. 😉 

One final suggestion. If you play through both the main game and the DLC’s but still feel lost in regard to the story, check out The Leaderboard’s YouTube Video  called “107 Little Nightmare Facts You Should Know!”. It pointed out some really interesting things, that made subsequent playthroughs a treat.

- movement is clunky on PC, no wonder the platforming is not too comprehensive/difficult with these controls

its a very fun parkour and horror game

lore 9/10
cool lore but hard to decifer 
+the end is very cool

glitches 9.5/10
there are some glitches that can get you killed; here is an example:

| SPOILER ALERT | IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED YOU CAN SKIP ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TEXT | ( ILL ADD ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT AT THE END OF THIS TEXT SO YOU CAN KNOW WHEN YOU CAN READ AGAIN WITHOUT GETTING SPOILED|

When you finish the shoe monster sequence Roger/The Janitor is suposed to chase you. tho in some rare ocasions, he' ll spawn before you even get to this point. thus making it impossible for the player to pass through the door without getting killed or having to reload to checkpoint wich, from time to time, can be annoying 


| SPOILER ALERT OVER | YOU CAN NOW READ THE REST OF THE TEXT WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT SPOILERS |

-Great Platforming

*Having played the second game and 100% both, I feel like a bit of a mini-retrospective review comparing LN and LN2*

GAMEPLAY: First off, I don't think either one is objectively better than the other on a technical level, as they both play the same. LN2 has some new mechanics like an AI companion and a ""combat system"", but they're so non-intrusive that they don't really shake up anything. Platforming, interacting with objects, and really most everything else that you do is still the same, which is fine because these games didn't really need anything new gameplay-wise.

VISUALS: If it were a contest on which one had the bigger environments, LN2 would win by a landslide - a sprawling city with labyrinthine skyscrapers and plenty of nooks and crannies to explore for those intrepid enough to find all there that there is to find. Yet, this new environment also kills one of the biggest aspects of the franchise -the horror/suspense. Most of LN2 is just empty space, and in a game where the player is meant to be in a state of suspense, the setting plays just a big a part as the enemies do. Sometimes, bigger isn't better in terms of a horror game, and it's here where LN got it right, with the closed-in spaces of the Maw that are just big enough to hide from its unsettling horrors, but not so big that you can escape them. 
Speaking of unsettling horrors, I would say that the superior enemy design belongs to LN. Sure, The Teacher being able to stretch her neck to an infinite length was something to behold, but when you compare her design with that of the Janitor or the Twin Chefs and you find she just looks so...mundane, I guess?
 Additionally, I feel the enemy mobs outside of the boss creatures in LN2 are more generic and overabundant - rather than dealing with a single unique foe or 2 unique enemies that are thematic to each chapter as in LN, you run from mobs of at least 10 that share 3 variant designs between them, and you run from these mobs quite a lot so you've about seen everything in the first few chases. Now, a horde of similar looking enemies is not necessarily a bad thing (those mannequin creatures in LN2's chapter 3 were really good in my opinion), but in a horror game franchise that emphasizes stealth and shrouds itself in suspense, I often feel less is more.

STORY: Looking back, my complaints about LN's story came from an anger more directed at its short playtime. In all actuality, It was an intense story that left me and several others intrigued, with speculations and interesting theories that kept us eager for what was next.  With LN2, we got a tightly knit story that answers none of the pressing questions we had from the first game; I mean, LN ends with Six getting the power to suck the soul from another being while being stranded on top of a slaughterhouse run by an evil Geisha lady defeated with magic mirrors- did we really need to go back in time and tell the story of a character who had no real bearing on what would become future events?
 With prequels, a lot of the trouble arises as it can create holes in the ongoing story set up in the original, but it's doubly worse when it spends the entire game plugging those holes at the expense of the larger narrative. In short, LN is able, story-wise, to stand on its own merits, while LN2, albeit a nice little experience in of and unto itself, is of little consequence in the greater story.
 
LN is a one best pieces of suspenseful storytelling in recent gaming history in all aspects, while its sequel, conversely, drops the ball in just about every way. It's a crying shame that things have turned out the way they have for this franchise, but at the very least, we can still enjoy the first game on its own.",1493441473,1675294123,True,1,0,0.452297747135162354,2,True,False,False

[i]WHAT IN THE DING-DANG-FLIPPITY-DING-DANG HELL WAS THAT?!?[/i] Sorry about that. Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I suppose it's time to dive into [b]Little Nightmares[/b].

[i]Little Nightmares[/i] is essentially a sight-seeing tour with platforming and light puzzle mechanics where you follow a child [i](apparently named Six, but that isn't really important)[/i] as they journey through what I can only describe as a steamboat to Hell filled with grotesque caricatures of humans that eat what I can only assume is children. Or something like that. Instead of any actual explanation of what is really going on throughout this damned vessel, the entirety of narration is done through performative medium, forgoing dialog and instead relying on a gloomy ambiance and an eerie soundtrack to immerse you into the experience. Because that's really what this title is. It's an experience. The sort of experience that lingers for a while and gnaws at the mind. In that regard it is perfect, which is a rare statement, coming from me.

If [i]Little Nightmares[/i] has any pitfall, it would be that, on occasion, the physics engine and and camera angles don't quite get along. This leads to a few frustrating moments where you may have to attempt to solve a puzzle several times before you finally figure out how to successfully proceed. Beyond that, the puzzles aren't terribly difficult, and navigation through the hellbound vessel is rather straightforward. The level design perfectly illustrates what can be climbed, what looks like a traversable platform, and what may or may not be out to consume your flesh and/or drive you to the depths of insanity where you may never escape.

Now, obviously I recommend this title. At about six total hours of gameplay at most, it does a wonderful job of giving you an experience that stays with you long after you've completed it without overburdening you with tedium and repetitive nonsense. I certainly know that I'll be seeing that long-armed monstrosity in my dreams for some time.

[i]Addendum:[/i] I know it's a long shot that this would ever be read by the developers, but to whomever decided to program the controller vibrations to simulate the pitter-patter of the heart of a terrified child, I simultaneously love and despise you. You made the experience all the more visceral and managed to add a layer of depth to the title I never considered possible.

The gameplay however is very slow and the controls feel a tiny bit off. They aren't entirely unresponsive, just a little off. Sadly it's so much so, that you feel annoyed while playing and even more annoyed, when you die in some passages due to the narrow paths you sometimes have to take, in order to survive. 
Respawns take easily 5-10 seconds, with the character slowly getting up and back to motion every time. This, as well as the sometimes not so well placed checkpoints make the entire gameplay side of things rather.. tideous.
Many of the ""getting chased""-passages are passed by simply running straight to the right, while sometimes you get punished for not catching on to random mechanics straight away. It just doen't feel well rounded.

As much as i wanna love the game, with the base gameplay i just can't and the closer i got to finishing the game, the more i was longing for it to finally be over.

Severed black hand, coffin on a wheels, the unwashable blood stain, the cursed basement, etc, etc? While this game does not replicate those exactly, it definitely takes all those children horror stories as an inspiration.

This game is all about the atmosphere. The atmosphere of an alien, scary and dangerous world of grown up's from the children perspective. And the devs managed to grasp it perfectly. You can literally feel (or... remember?) how uncomfortable it is. Full marks for that.

On the downside - the game is quite short. There is literally an achievement for finishing it in under an hour, while an average first-time playthrough will take around 2-3 hours max. Same goes for DLC (which for some reason has been split in 3 parts, while it's a single linear story in fact).

In overall i think it's a good game, but a bit overpriced for the amount of playtime it provides. Get it on a sale and don't forget the DLC as well, since it loops the story in a neat way.

Not overly complex puzzles, except for maybe a couple, and some repetitious timing puzzles that can get a little tedious, but overall a pretty fun game. It started out a bit slow and I was not quite sure what the heck to even do so was getting a little frustrated, but once I figured out most of the stuff you see is just there to...well see, and is not needed to complete the game, it started to get a lot more interesting. Basically your goal is to just keep forging ahead from room to room and on to the next area. It might sound boring and repetitive but it's not and while most of the puzzles require you to get from point A to point B, there are often different ways to do that. 

The ambiance of the game is really the best part...along with the graphics which both get better near the later stages. The sound effects are very well done too. Just kicking a bottle laying on the ground sounds very realistic. As you meet characters along the way the background music and sounds change to match the scene. I also liked how the cut scenes, or more accurately the transition sequences, are somewhat interactive so you might be walking to a new area as part of the cut scene if that makes sense. Either way it was a pretty cool design element.

The game is just very well done , maybe not super long but well worth the few bucks it cost for Little Nightmares I & II. Very much looking forward to playing the second game.

And another thing that's nice about this particular one in this genre (like Inside, Limbo, etc) is that this one struck a FINE balance between all aspects of the game - some challenges without beat 'beat your head on the wall' hard, decently long without EVER becoming a drag (I actually found I wish it had been much longer), 'secrets' to uncover that don't take sixteen days to find. Not much in the way of 'puzzles'... Just a couple of 'em, and not very hard. But it doesn't detract from the playability and fun. Just all around, this was a PERFECTLY balanced game.

I played it on my Steam Deck, and I'm uncertain if my PC brothers & sisters experienced this, but unfortunately there were a few hard crashes during the play-through while on Steam Deck. It was NOT frequent at all, so I did not find myself hurling the SD out the window in rage, and the checkpoints are fairly frequent, so when it did happen, I didn't find myself losing ninety million hours of progress.

Since this is in the genre of ""drop you into the world without much of an explanation""... Since this is the kind of game that tells the story simply through the atmosphere, events, and imagery... it could potentially be spoiling to openly describe some of the stuff. Also, since the element of horror relies on confronting the horrible and unexpected, some might consider my brief descriptions a spoiler. I'm going to blank out some of the following. Note, I won't include any spoilers such as puzzle-solves, important events, etc. but I don't want to spoil this for anyone.

In this world, you are [spoiler] a little kid in a raincoat, with nothing but a Zippo lighter for light - not even a pair of shoes.[/spoiler] You find yourself in [spoiler] an enormous place - I don't want to reveal what it is even in this blanked out part - filled with horrifying, mutated 'adult' figures[/spoiler] who apparently [spoiler]keep children captive for nefarious purposes[/spoiler]. Your goal is to [spoiler]sneak around through the twisted environment, dodging the brain-dead, zombie-like mutant beings who are constantly trying to kill you[/spoiler]. Along the way, you perform small tasks to earn achievements.. some of which are cute, some of which are odd.

I can tell you this game will probably catch you by surprise. There were a few moments in the play-through I was very much NOT expecting. Plenty of fairly predictable things, yes, but... also things that left me thinking, ""what!? No... no, surely not.""

Again, not a ton of time spent. I'm showing 4.7 hr having beat it.

That said, my usual ""should you buy it full price?"" is a bit of a toss-up. The game is absolutely FANTASTIC. If it were a little cheaper, I would be driving over to your house to click the ""add to cart"" button FOR you. But as short as it is... I very much hate to say it, since I enjoyed it so much, but I could see some folks feeling a little disappointed by the length. I still think it's well worth it, but could see how others might not feel that way.

The graphics, the sound, the playability (minus the few crashes) were absolutely incredible, so if you're looking for a game you can truly experience, one with actual moments of dread and horror, THIS ONE IS IT. If it's on sale, SNAG THAT GAME UP SO FAST you don't even think about it.

The ambiance and mood are spot on, and the lighting and shadows in particular are impressive. That said, this game plays like crap, has no plot, no story, no attention to detail, no continuity. You never know who or what the protagonist is, the design is cute but doesn't really make sense. By the end, you don't even know why you're playing as them. The monsters aren't scary at all, just hideously ugly. Animations are bad and lazy, I kept expecting something exiting only to see something very easy to animate. When a guy gets his arm cut off by a 4 inch thick door, it just comes off as a cylinder instead of being squished on the end, or anything that would have taken literally any time to model. I felt so much missed opportunity. The AI sees you through walls, then loses you in corners. Save points range from basically save scumming for you, to about a minute away on particularly difficult sections. And by difficult, I usually mean clunky and unfair, like a section where you run down a table with people grabbing at you. I think the intention was that most players would get through in a couple tries because of how loose the tolerance to get through is, but because you can't tell how far they'll be able to reach, the fact that the reaches overlap, the hitboxes are longer than the ends of the fingers, and you literally can't dodge the hands without just getting lucky, it becomes a game of random chance that took me about 20 tries. There's candles you can light, don't know why. There's little goblins with paper cups on their heads that you can pick up and put back down, don't know why. Your character keeps getting hungry, even though the whole game takes place with food everywhere. You literally walk out of a room filled with sausage and carrots and collapse to the floor in starvation. I won't even get into the story, it's not there. You learn nothing. The world is pointless. The creatures are pointless. Literally not a single event in this game comes up at a later point. Stuff just happens, your character does things that don't make sense, then the game ends with no climax, no explanation, and 10 minutes of unskippable credits. It's not a slog for the most part, I did finish it after all. I was able to enjoy the vision of the creators. However, I'm genuinely unsure what the makers of this game wanted me to get out of it.
Overall, this is little more than a polished turd. There is definitely a kind of person who could enjoy this, but if you have a concept of how games are made, then it's easy to tell how lazy and cheap this all is.",1673385140,1673385140,False,1,1,0.497925341129302979,3,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the more frustrating parts of the game involve some moderately precise sequence of movements - usually to just barely escape an enemy's clutching fist. The movement is just a little bit too awkward for these parts to be any fun.

Such a fun game, full of puzzles and doesn't need voice acting or text to tell a story. The characters, atmosphere and music all tied together all make the game so good.

I do wish some of the saves for certain parts of the game were a bit better though.

All 3 DLC's are a whole new story that are all related to each other.

The cutest horror/terror you'll ever experience while leaving you intrigued about the grand scheme of what's going on! 
Very detailed and carefull level design with an immersive setting.

Amazingly built puzzles.
Some of them are simple and you just need to pay attention to your surroundings while others will really put your puzzle solving skills to the test and you will need to think ahead.

The base game is a bit short while satisfying, so be sure to play the DLC's. 
They add some new mechanics, new enemies and they really complete the base game.

i had a few drawbacks when watching the trailer because (in opposite to limbo) it uses 3D movement instead of 2D.

the main game was a very nice gaming experience.
a dark, tense setting with nice graphics and a fitting sound environment with nicely changing map types.
the controls for 3D were fine. there was the one or other problem when i missed a platform or a handle jumping in 3D space due to bad camera angles but those were minor occurrences.

maybe highlighting a handle or platform or (optionally) enabling a kind of jumping destination spot (via game settings menu) might reduce this kind of problems a little bit even if the camera angle isn't optimal.

the DLC was great, too.
IMHO a nice addition were that map parts, where you had to do some tasks (furnace, library) to get along.

nice story in main game and DLCs, only a very few control issues and a nice setting, maps and sounds.
a clear recommendation.

For those who are new to this series I'll start of by saying the one downside to this game, because it's a quick answer. The game is short. Now that that's said let me say why I recommend this game.

I think this game would be in the liking of almost every gamer. Sure the game is short, but the story that it tells is very much worth it. You start playing the game knowing literally nothing except that you're a small girl in an eerie space. As you play through the game you'll see fractions of the story here and there and you get to puzzle together just where you are and why you are there and why the Little Nightmares' universe is the way it is. There aren't many games out there with this approach and I myself am 100% sure this game takes the lead in the execution.
If you're not much of a story person and just want to play something pretty or scary then don't worry. I think the game does good, nay amazing actually, with its horrors and scares and definitely its visuals and sound design. The artstyle is something I haven't seen in any game out there. Combined with the beautiful sounds and scares it gives shiverings throughout the body. Just wonderful.

in conclusion, sure the game is short (about 6 - 20 hours playtime if you play it in an enjoyable pace) but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth the experience. My experience with Little Nightmares and the sequel as well will stick with me for my whole life as a beautiful gem of a game. After I played the first game I couldn't wait to play the sequal (last game of the series) and tbh I had more fun playing the sequal. 


IF you're interested in only 1 of the 2 Little Nightmare games, you can choose whichever one you play first. The games are connected storywise, and it is fun to play them both, but trust me it doesn't matter which one you play first.",1671995189,1671995189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Little Nightmares is such a true ""nightmare fueled"" gem of a game. It is not perfect, namely the controls can be wonky at times and so is the camera that gives you a hard time aiming properly but the atmosphere brings this title to another level of creepiness. The art style is fantastically gloomy with some cute moments at times... and strange twists that can tear your heart out!

Ok, so this wasn't an easy rating; the game is good, like really good, with super interesting environments and creature design, as well as fun & creepy gameplay. BUT, you're effectively getting 3 hours of gameplay for $20, which, is frankly quite ludicrous. Yes it has DLC's, but those cost extra and they only add an hour onto that run time.

I'm not usually one who complains about game run time, but seriously don't buy this game at full price, buy it on like a $5 sale (DLC included) because it is far too short to justify that pitiful runtime. For reference, a very similarly lengthed cinematic platformer Limbo is half the cost with about a 4 hour runtime.

Runtime aside, this is some of the best horror platforming around, it feels really tense and every monster encounter is extremely fun, which is probably why I'm so bummed how short it is. Sound design is also amazing, and the story is kept purposely vague so that your mind tries to piece together what's going on in this world. The only complaint I have is the ending, (don't worry, won't spoil it) because of how abrupt it is, it really feels like it shoulda had more to it.

⭕ - Conclusion -:
I wish I knew what game all the people with positive reviews were playing because this one of the worst games i've ever played. The biggest problem is with the camera view and the movement controls as a result. On PC they are awful and a controller really doesn't make them any better. You mostly die as a result of the controls which also seems to be the only puzzle aspect of the game. Also where are the nightmares? All the chapters feel so bland and are just run away from a hungry thing. Just feels like overly boring gameplay. The biggest success of the game is the cool graphic style.",1671649111,1671649111,False,0,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

Game is also short and sweet. Like, *really* short. I didn't try to 100% it by finding the collectables but I did look - not too hard, mind you - and found some of the more obvious ones. I got just under 4 hours playtime. Loved every bit of it, thought.

The storyline is very well made, with the main character, Six, progressing through various levels themed around different rooms, such as the kitchen or restaurant. The creepy and somewhat disturbing character design is definitely something that made me want to play this game, and it genuinely gave me stress when being chased down by a hungry chef. On top of the fantastic storyline, the collectible system is very well designed, placing gnomes and statues, for example, in areas you wouldn’t think to look in. This adds to the level of exploration in the game. If you like a good horror game to creep you out, Little Nightmares will definitely tick the box.

My only complaint is that playing on keyboard/computer is pretty hard to do without re-mapping the controls, due to otherwise basically having to do hand gymnastics to do basic things like running into a crouch. This was easily fixed though by re-mapping the controls and using the right enter and shift for run/crouch.

Like INSIDE, it's a very pretty, atmospheric 2.5D platformer, where you traverse a mysteriously hostile world as a tiny human. A lot of traps await and a lot of things are out to get you, and you have to sneak past them all on the way to freedom (?). The world design is gloomy yet charming and the music adds to the experience.

Like in INSIDE, the journey is at times quite monotonous, with not enough movement mechanics to keep the player engaged physically. Because of the lack of narration and the mysteriousness of everything, it's also difficult to get engaged emotionally, other than ""protect this cute little thing from dem ugly big things"". The puzzles were decent, but most of the time rather trivial, so intellectual engagement also wasn't really a thing. Because of the overall lack of engagement, I simply didn't care about the game most of the way through, which is a shame, because the concept felt like it had more potential!

And I figured I'f I'm going to reinstall to play for achievements it deserves a good review. I absolutely love this game!!! The biggest thing I like is the art style. I can't think of what it reminds me of but it goes perfectly with the horror game style. I also really dig the overall story and plot progression. It definately kept me wanting to go further  to explore or discover all the dark little corners and secrets throughout the game. There were also a couple parts in the levels that truly startled me out of my seat! Lots of fun! The fact that the game was relatively short was perfect for me too because I generally have trouble finishing games all the way through. Another thing I can't forget to mention is the amazing creepy soundtrack, without which the overall ambiance and scariness of the game would be far less intense.  
The game also has great replay-ability as there are loads of secrets and achievements to be found!
I'm trying to think but I am pretty sure there wasn't a single time during the entire game-play that I though, ""Oh well that's stupid.."" or ""I don't like that"", something that is unusual for me, as most games have at least one thing that conflicts with one or more of my disorders.

Little Nightmares is a puzzle-platform horror game, of course. That says a lot about it already but what surprised me most about this game was the ""story"". The game itself reminds me heavily of the movie ""Coraline"", it has very similar vibes, and I think it could be compared to Tim Burton as well. It is that type of horror, no jumpscares at all, nothing trying hard to scare you. You can play this game and not be scared at all, it has much more of a creepy and unsettling feeling, in terms of design and atmosphere. (Which is something that Portal also pulls off extremely well). The game involves stealth- outrunning and avoiding enemies and a lot of hiding, so it definitely gives you adrenaline at some parts. Again, all I could think while playing this was that THIS is what true horror should be! No ""trying too hard"" to be scary, but just quite subtly having creepy aspects, while not being ""overly"" scary, if you know what I mean. The creepiness of this game isn't shoved in your face- THAT is what horror needs to be!

I put most emphasis on my love for this game on its story as I mentioned above. It is an extremely unsettling story, not too obviously told, but something you pick up on by inspecting the environment since there is no speech in this game. It is a silent told story, and a very good one. A lot of Little Nightmares is left up to personal interpretation, like ""what does that actually mean?"", since it's not actually explained and you just watch what happens instead, you can think of some answers yourself. It got me googling all sorts of questions about it and watching lore videos. It's all so creepy, perfectly designed and thought-out, I honestly am in love with it and the amount of questions you have after completion. I just want to know so much more than it tells you!
The art style and design is perfect paired with everything else about it. Honestly, I think the game is a masterpiece. I imagine if I played this as a kid I would've loved it, but it would've also been terrifying!

The achievements are also fun, there are collectable-based achievements(Nomes, lanterns, statues), and some you get from doing small things in the game. And then there's the one where you speed run the game without dying in less than an hour.

It is a short game and can be completed in an hour or two, but I took my time with it and completed it in six hours- so it's all about the personal amount of time you want to spend with it, I think. I didn't want it to be over, it immediately hooked me. I definitely recommend this game. 9/10",1670344413,1670344534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Atmosphere good, rest bad. I respect the game, but I do not like it.

Not even remotely as good as Limbo.

Now for some more explanations: Yes the creepy, horror vibe atmosphere is well done. It even manages to produce some very eerie moments of tension or jump scares and it does that quite effectively. The whole experience is more unsetteling than one may expect and that is good.
I was kinda wondering about the whole ""how can you like Six (the protagonist) after playing"" meme. That I understand. I even marvel at the balls of this choice, but not giving the player any agency in it felt really shit.
Do not spoil yourself, this is possibly the most shocking twist of the game!
[spoiler]I did not want to eat the gnome aka the kid from the DLC. I literally reloaded the checkpoint cause I thaught that I had aimed poorly past the sausage. This sucks very much.[/spoiler]
I do understand the artistic vision behind it, but it really didnt endear me to the protagonist or make me want to keep playing whatsoever. After havin a sneak peak at some of the stuff from Little Nightmares 2 I have decided that I may as well skip that one. It is such a down beat kind of story, you really need to be up for that and I am not. I would love to overcome some hardship, but not at the cost of my humanity basically.

Now, in terms of gameplay this is quite poor. The puzzles range between obvious to the extreme and completely obscure without much in the middle. Often one knows quickly what needs to be done, but the execution is made difficult by the pathetically bad controls. I did not get used to those during the entire playthrough despite them being very simple. Everything feels wonkly, sticky and overall unresponsive to the degree that it made playing a chore.
Some puzzles will only be solved due to the very limited room that you have to maneuver so eventually you stumble over the completely non obvious way that the puzzles works with stuff behaving in a way that it simply did not behave before or possibilities of interaction that were not possible before.

The pseudo 3D works well for the atmosphere, but makes navigation a pain. Add to this the unwilling camera and you have a recipe for frustration.

Overall the gameplay is very poor. I forced myself through it, because I was curious in terms of the story and where it might lead, but I was certainly not rooting for anyone anymore and detached myself emotionally early on. Lucky me when you consider the ending of the DLC which admittedly is balsy and a fantastic sucker punch. I can respect that, but I do not like it.",1670329017,1670329017,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

At first she just seems like a normal kid; a little yellow raincoat hiding a scared child in a strange world beneath it. But as you progress, you quickly realize that six is much more. I won't tell you how much more to keep this spoiler free, but I will say that the devs have done a magnificent job with every aspect of this game: story line, atmosphere, ambiance, and, of course, characters.

I hate this game. The gameplay mechanics are so obnoxious that it sucks the fun out of the game. I've had this game for over a year and I finished the 3,4hrs story just now, because the gameplay feels so repulsive and I've felt reluctant to continue playing this.
How do the mechanics suck, you ask? Imagine getting the gist of where to go in the game. You try to force your little girl of a character to run/jump/grab/grasp things to get there, only to fail 10 times in a row thanks to the subhuman level of gameplay optimization. As a result you get evermore infuriated and the game keeps throwing you more narrow lines to follow/climb with the same dull controls. So much for the ""GrEaT aMbIeNcE"".

Also, the puzzles aren't that great, and have counter-intuitive answers to them every now and then.
In the end your character turns into a walking aneurysm, and you can't skip the credits. I skipped them with Ctrl + Alt + Del.

I have played The Binding of Isaac: Repentance with 637/637 achievements done, so thinking ""git gud"" doesn't cut it. There's a difference between ""hard"" and ""5h!7"", and this game ain't hard. Cope and seethe fanboys.",1669365732,1669365732,False,10,4,0.553881824016571045,0,True,False,False

The world is sort of Lovecraft-esque horror, in the sense that it's impossible to be 100% certain what you are seeing or experiencing. It doesn't outright explain anything at all, it's a bit abstract, and that works so well in the game's favor. Not only was I disturbed by the uncanny nature of things, but being uncertain how and why this world's supernatural systems worked made it that much scarier and intimidating. I could see that what that one thing was doing was bad, but I didn't actually know what it was doing, and that's unnerving.

I suppose I say ""story"" in the loosest sense; it's not a traditional narrative, but rather one about the journey, about the moments.

Our main character, Six, in a yellow raincoat, tries to escape from a ship named Maw, fictionalized with the horrors of our childhood nightmares. Although Little Nightmares resembles Playdead's Limbo and Inside at first glance, with a side-scrolling head adorned with little boy and platform elements, it is thematically different from its cousins..

The carefully designed parts of Little Nightmares, whose tension never decreases, contain different nightmares. Who is not on this ship? For example; A ship janitor with short legs but arms several meters long? Of course. Or a cook who looks grotesque and is always at the meat-cutting or eating ceremony? There is room. An older sister wearing a kimono like from Japanese horror movies? Don't be! The design of every scene we meet with these friends is designed in the quality of a painting where Bob Ross expresses his art: careful and ingenious.

Little Nightmares does not contain any fighting mechanics as we are used to this type of game. When you move from scenes that are designed like a toy house to another, you need to analyze the surroundings well and think about how to get out of the nightmare this time. You always do the indispensable actions of platform games, such as finding movement levers and running platforms, climbing the steps with the help of a box. Of course, your enemies do not collect pears while you are doing these in the nauseating rooms of the Maw ship, such as the room of the cook and his wife, inside the pipes, the garbage dump where the shoes are collected (though the janitor does not collect pear balls with those arms). Taking advantage of the small size of the Six, you should always hide in the shadows and the smallest holes and not appear to the enemies. It's okay to be a fodder to these staff at the slightest mistake.

[b]Are we the Little Nightmare?[/b]

I did not have any difficulties in terms of privacy throughout the game. Once you learn the enemies' routines, it is easy to get past them by staying in the shadows, but the most important thing that makes Little Nightmares unique is the use of the fear factor. Most games and movies try to achieve fear by not showing us what we fear. When we are looking for the key to the locked door with a lantern in a dark corridor, what frightens us is to think about when the enemy will come, shouting at the house boards with his steps. Little Nightmares, on the other hand, always puts the enemy in front of you, turning the factor of fear from when to every moment. In some scenes the main event is outside the camera's angle and you have to move the camera to the edge of the scene using the right-stick to see it. So in a way you are going to the fear you expect. Also, the scripted scenes in the game host perhaps the most terrifying moments I've seen in a side-scrolling / horror game. In these scenes reminiscent of a cat-and-mouse chase, the play's magnificent soundtrack does not do its best to rivet the atmosphere.

I know I haven't talked too much into the story of the game. I do this specifically because Little Nightmares is not a very long game anyway. I was able to see the end of the game over a period of three hours in one sitting. The story goes to very interesting places towards the end. Although my mouth was not open when the story of the game was over, a devilish smile appeared on my face. I'm talking vaguely because I don't want to be too explicit, but if you're playing indie games for their stories, Little Nightmare won't disappoint you.

So I praised the game but why is the score 8? Because although Little Nightmares does very well what it does well, it doesn't have some annoying flaws. Perhaps the most annoying part of the game is the automatic recording system, which sometimes takes very long periods in between. I said I finished the game in 3 hours, I suppose half an hour of that was spent by dying at the end of the episode, falling into the saint of the bad recording system and doing everything over again. Also, since the game takes the recordings before the 15-20 seconds of preparation at the beginning of the stage entries, you have to repeat these non-passed parts in every unsuccessful attempt. Besides that, the platform gameplay isn't that great either. While I didn't have too much trouble, Six sometimes resisted not keeping the item I wanted. Also, pressing two keys simultaneously to climb started to tire my hand holding the gamepad after a while.

Little Nightmares has managed to gather both side-scrolls, horror and mysterious story lovers in the same ship. When the creepy atmosphere riveted with its magnificent visuals and music, a game that would be a candidate for being a classic came out.

[i]Pros[/i]

• The perfect and chilling atmosphere.
• An intriguing and immersive story.
• Oh those visuals! Amazing art design, too.

[i]Cons[/i]

• Some puzzles can cause confusion due to perspective issues.
• Seems a little short? When the game was over, I felt like I was not done with the game.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]

• Little Nightmares is not a game that will shake your world, but it definitely brings a new breath to both side-scrolling platformers and horror games genre.

The world created here is really intriguing and mysterious making you theorize about it right of the bat. The game is creepy in its own way and proves that you don't need tons of jump scares, gore and every other means that are usually used in such productions. In terms of cons, it feels at some points strongly influenced by INSIDE or LIMBO, which is hard to be ignored, but still, it's trying to create something original and for me, it's even more interesting than its rivals, leaving you at the end puzzled and hungry for more. 
The second thing is its controls. I can't tell why it was wrong but in some parts, especially when someone's chasing you, controlling the main protagonist becomes really frustrating and unintuitive. Finally the game length. Three hours it's really not that much, especially that the game doesn't cost comparatively low to its length although I have to say, it does fell like a finished story not rushed at any point. 
Though it doesn't stop me from feeling that they could lengthen it up at least up to six hours. Having said that it's still, in my opinion, a great position that I can recommend to everyone and those who just like to risk playing something different.

-Great atmosphere
-Good graphics
-Very obscurre and with a story that's open for interpretation

Cons:
-Controls are inconsistent and frustrating
-The 3D styles movement leads to lots of moments where grabbing things in the air or going through vents and alike can get awkward as it can get hard to tell just exactly where your character is compared to where the vent is (In intense chase moments it can get super frustrating)
-Puzzles can be a bit too obvious at times, while other times it can be almost impossible telling what you're actually supposed to do

The visuals were fantastic. The theatrical, no clutter HUD and lighting paired with the art style created some stunning shots and sequences.

The gameplay, however, felt clunky, slow, and  frustrating. Balancing on thin pipes is a pain because the camera doesn't give you a great perspective. Momentum is lost the instant you bump into a corner. That'll kill you in any of the many chase segments. And when you do die, the checkpoints are unfair, and after a few cheap deaths, you'll be tapping your foot as you have to wait for the death animation, the loading screen, and the restart animation to conclude before you're placed two rooms back from where you died. I only completed this game because the whole thing is only about 4-6 hours for an average player. Any more and I'd probably put it back on the shelf. All in all, it never really had a payoff for mastering the clunky mechanics and wasn't fun. 

Also, there only seems to be some shred of a story, and from what I gathered, one story thread sees [spoiler]the player character transform into a ravenous murderer. The hunger sequences are themselves a slog to play through as you walk slower and slower all while periodically doubling over in unbearable pain before finally...eating stuff and continuing on your journey. Now the food selection does become more unpleasant as the game progresses, but the final murder and consumption of a well meaning character seems a bit contrived all things considered. Playing as a ravenous murderer is ok, it's just that the transition from helpless  captive to murderer seemed too abrupt and nonsensical, even if the transition is the manifestation of a traumatized child. You'd think the fact that 2 of the 4 hunger sequences involve creatures intentionally stopping to help you during your darkest hour might preserve some fellowship of survival in this hellish world. There was no ""aha moment"" or build up. It just happens, and for that reason I wish it were cut or explored in a more meaningful fashion.[/spoiler]",1668329105,1668329105,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]I guess the art style? But I didn't like it tbh.

[*]The setting, I guess, but at the same time this annoyed me, because It felt like it went nowhere.
[/list]
[b]-CONS-[/b][list]
[*]I found this game boring.

[*]Get ready to run away constantly, but in the very exact and specific way the game wants you to.

[*]So that means also get ready to die a million times until you figure that out the specific thing you need to do.

[*]Over half the 'puzzles' were unintuitive. I would try the solution I thought was the answer, for it to not work, then run around for 10 minutes confused, only to try said solution again.... and suddenly it is working.

[*]To expand on the above, [spoiler]there is a part with a cage, and if you grab the top side of the cage first you can't break it to cut the guys arms off. I tried to break the cage about 10 times, and accepted that it  wasn't the answer, wasted about 15 minutes dodging the arms, tried again, realized I had to pull on the bottom part of the cage first.[/spoiler]

[*]Basically this game is shit at telling you what to do, and has control issues.

Pros:
- atmosphere
- creepy factor is 8/10
- intelligible story despite no dialogue
- Platforming, stealth, run sequences, boss fights

Cons:
- Short: 4 hours to beat. At full price you are paying 5$ / hour to enjoy this for a single night maybe.
- Linear. Most sequences have only one solution, creativity isn't rewarded.

If this game is on sale and you like spooky games I endorse it. This game is probably not worth full price though, I paid 20$ for this, I felt it was worth 10.

What a fun, deep, dark and tormented adventure this game is. Technically this is Little Nightmares 2 - but it was released first and the not 100% smooth controls/actions show it. The puzzles are fun, the concept is neat, and the bosses more creepy then anything else. 
Pros: Enjoyable, short but sweet. Achievement humour is everything for me apparently- Throw food in the chefs cauldron and don't forget to play the piano while you're running for your life :)
Cons (Every game has them): I recently played the smoother, more anxiety filled, and over all much creepier second game. They ironed out some kinks I didn't know were there until I replayed the first one afterwards to have the ""full story feel"". Sometimes the bad guys get stuck and you have to die to un-stick them. You have to carry the keys, which slows you down ever so slightly. The Final Boss is weak.

I never found this game scary, I found it more to be an amazing, grand, narrative adventure. You play as this tiny character while running from giant monsters. For size comparison, imagine you were the size of a rat roaming around a human house. The times when there were jumpscares it was more of just a half assed ""boo"". The monsters themselves have an interesting design but all they do is just waddle towards you which are the ""chase"" scenes. I feel this game should have the monsters thrashing the area to get you as that would make them more menacing and scary, but instead we get an eerie looking monster waddling towards you for 5 seconds and then their dumb AI making them waddle away when you simply go under a desk that they watched you go under. If monsters could interact with objects then escaping them would be heart pounding, but when you realize that you can simply exploit their AI by hiding under something that they WATCHED you go into then that completely breaks immersion. The monsters will just look around like a dumbass and be like ""oh well he vanished"" and then just go about their day not caring. Overall going through the game is indeed fun but I feel they could have been a little more creative with how you would interact with the environment. This game is worth playing for the great narrative grandness. If you're wanting to play an actual horror game then go play Im Scared.

Now for an actual critique of the game. Furthering my point of the game not being scary, when I arrived at part 4 of the game, my first thought was ""mm yes, f a t people"". This part of the game is the best especially when escaping the grubby hands of f a t people, however there's a chase scene where you can easily run out of energy and end up dying multiple times, having to restart the chase just because your character has a dumb energy mechanic. You'll only run out of energy about 2, possibly 3 times in the whole game so there really was not a reason to make an energy/stamina mechanic. I heavily disliked the parts where your character would eat as the whole screen would blast music while flickering the lights, this greatly ruins the important parts where the character eats one of those little kkk members and eats the final boss. Like dude, you want to ruin an important moment? then great job cuz the creator is clearly an idiot that doesn't know how to make an impactful scene without ruining it. These scenes shouldn't have music or flickering lights, it should just be plain quiet while having a clear visual (meaning no flickering lights) so that the player can focus on what is currently happening without being distracted or annoyed by the unnecessarily added effects. The visual is greatly reduced when your character eats the lady(final boss), the screen is practically pitch black which was a really stupid idea.

Overall, good game, but not S tier, I'd say C tier. I'm not replaying this game for a while since it's not very interactive. It had a lot of interactive potential but they didn't fully explore creative ways in making the gameplay amazing, it's more of just the same repeated interactions such as going in an elevator, moving through a tight space, and unlocking a door.",1665772872,1665772872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have little to no complaints about little nightmares I think it adapts the dark tone very well keeping the jump scares to a minimum. No game should ever have to rely on jump scares to be a truly good horror game. This game uses chase scenes and disturbing visuals to keep you on the edge of your seat. Me being a panzy myself I was very tense the whole time playing the game I would really struggle to understand a couple of the puzzles but for the most part without any hints it comes naturally. Not being very long is a savior for the game if it was any longer I think the game would be a lot less entertaining. Whole hardetly believe this is one of the best horror games out there and there is no reason why you shouldn't check it out great play through would recomend to all those horror fans out there.

It also has awful controls. They feel unresponsive, sometimes jumping at a ledge automatically pulls you up, sometimes only when hitting the action key, it does a shoddy job explaining core mechanics (the first enemy will spot you, aparently by smell, anyway, so you think sneaking does nothing)
And long, unskippable credits. Not the most important part but I despise games that do this. 

Oh and I must be too daft for the ""great speechless storytelling"" because there really seemed not to be much of a story if any at all.

However, Little Nightmares features a 3D space with a doll-house view, rather than the locked off 2D play that the other two offer. There is no tutorial or spelled out story, but that started the immersion immediately for me. The story pieced together is very eerie and builds slowly with each level.

However, I did find issue with some of the tracking of movement/grabbing not being consistent. The enemies immediately knowing where the player is upon the smallest hint or even sometimes with no reason at all, is also incredibly frustrating. Some portions took me well over 10 tries, while most of the game was relatively straight forward because of this.

I would still recommend Little Nightmares even with those issues in mind. It was a fun game to explore and unravel. I am excited to play the sequel.",1665430715,1665430715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

Little Nightmares has some marvelous environmental designs, effectively grotesque characters patrolling its world, and a mastery of things like tonal lighting that make even screenshots of it both gorgeous and haunting. Such an effective atmosphere compels you to explore deeper into The Maw, but it seems to thrive on its looks alone. The world does tell a story but the clues either are too isolated to extract much from or leave little to the imagination despite some potential metaphorical implications. Puzzles are often weakened by the fact you simply aren’t given many ways to get the puzzle wrong and the danger of the monstrous beings you must run from is lessened by forgiving checkpoints, obvious ways to avoid them, and some artificial feeling limitations to give them a sporting chance. While the DLC improves on some of those elements, Little Nightmares on the whole needs to be thought of as a lightly interactive virtual horror space or else you risk disappointment when the meticulously constructed setting presents its rudimentary gameplay.",1665005940,1665005940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The in game checkpoints when you die are okay but not great, a couple so far have been quite annoying to re-do. 
But if I exit out of the game and come back to it, I'm sent way way back compared to if I had died in the game?? Would've expected to return to the same place. 
It's not even that the bits I've had to re-do after exiting are super super hard, they're just lengthy and tedious that it kills any desire I had to play the game. Additionally frustrating if I do die before getting to the point I was before exiting the game.
It might not be an issue for most people but I like to play the game little bits at a time because it scares me hahaha

Hoping this might get better as I progress in the game?
Or if Little Nightmares II has a better save system?

I would describe this game as a horror in the sense of lots of tension, not knowing what could happen next, but not the type of horror which has tons of crazy jump scares - which I'm glad about. The main game is really good to play through, however I felt there were sometimes quite long gaps between checkpoints. The graphics are really good and the story line is great! 
[u] The DLC: [/u] Absolutely loved it and the connections to the main game's story, however I would say that areas of this are much harder than the main game. The biggest thing I like about this, is that there are [b] much more [/b] check points so you don't have to go back as far if something happens. [spoiler] Granny is quite difficult to get through at times so might take a few attempts once you get used to her movements... But the Shadow Kids... Oh my goodness are they difficult! Especially with the PC keys, it's incredibly difficult to point the torch at the correct angles, especially in the areas where the creatures are infinite. It's doable, but will likely take a good few attempts! [/spoiler] If you have an Xbox or PlayStation controller, I'd recommend using that even just for certain, more difficult areas.
[u] Overall: [/u] Great game to play, I'd recommend it if you like horror, as well as a good story. Some areas are very difficult (mainly the DLC), but definitely doable. I'd recommend the DLC, even just for the story connections and extra game play. I'm definitely going to play Little Nightmare 2...

The characters in the game are TERRIFYING, which I love about it as it makes the game more fun. The chase is scary, its not too scary but also scary at the same time making it perfect for me (since Im usually unable to finish the game if it is TOO SCARY).

- The bad: movement, vague puzzles, and long respawn times (largely due to unnecessary enemy animations after catching you)

This is one of the few games I think would be more enjoyable to watch a playthrough for rather than play it yourself. The puzzles and level navigation can be quite ambiguous, meaning you end up playing the same little section multiple times to figure out how to get through it. Crucially, this shatters the immersion which is so key to enjoying the best part of the game: its spooky atmosphere. This is something games like Limbo and Inside do very well (balancing atmosphere/challenge/immersion) however this game falls well short.

Basically the gameplay is very easy and is just an excuse to look at the art/animations and take in the world.

And I'm really glad I did. It's such an atmospheric game with a beautiful artstyle that really makes you feel like you're part of the world. I had so much fun looking at everything, and mulling over what each boss might represent. There aren't really any jump-scare moments (i.e. things suddenly leaping out at you), but instead it's more of a constant background dread as you sneak around, with faster-paced sections where you're being chased (these got my heart pumping so fast!)

I died so many times, but by the time I'd finished I felt so much satisfaction in having held my nerve that long.

First of all, the good side of the game is obviously the visual stuff: art style, models, lighting, animations (also little details like wall touching, jump landings, etc.), and world setting (environment, monsters, etc.). However, on visual stuff, the good part ends. Everything else comes with a load of frustration.

An interactive/non-interactive environment is indistinguishable. The most annoying part was on the level where you must walk through a dining table where ""guests"" are actively eating, avoiding being grabbed and killed. The level is known to be one of the game's hardest parts because it leaves no room for error while it requires precise movement and timings. I will not complain about the difficulty of this part: many others already did it for me. I noticed a sausage handing from the other part of the table, and it was interactable. If you would climb up on the sausage, you can effectively skip the whole dining table and save yourself some time and not suffer from hardcore platforming. At first look, I thought: ""brilliant! a hidden shortcut an attentive player could be rewarded with"", later I proved myself wrong. However, you cannot climb it, even though previously you used to do it. Alright, whatever, at least you can swing on it, and there is a chair you can jump on and climb. However, when you perform the action and manage to jump on the chair from the sausages - you cannot fully climb on it (even though it is a similar chair you use to climb on the table on the other side).
I am not sure whether the level designer was evil or stupid, but we got what we got - frustration from a broken promise. At this point of the game, I was already mildly infuriated enough to just pass it. Still, I can imagine how terrible the experience would be for a person who would try to use the sausages to climb on the table no matter what and, after a long time, realize - it was just an interactable level decoration.

The second annoying part was the controls: the game requires precision and timing to move forward; however, the controls are clunky: unresponsive, and unpredictable. So it's just player torturing. Unless developers wanted it, which I am not sure is a part of a horror game, but whatever.
I actually felt a sense of the unknown and that feeling of childish fear at the beginning of the game. However, the more I played (especially moved, jumped, etc.), the more annoying, frustrating, and just busy work the game became - completely ruining the initial vibe. I think it is OK to die by mistake. Still, it is unreasonable to punish when you know what to do and fail to do it because of one millimeter in the wrong direction. I can talk about other nasty stuff, but the game already consumed more time than it was worth.

Besides bad implementation, there are some annoying bugs, like random mouse appearance, which throws you to the desktop if you click on something; teleportation during movement (which killed me once when I was passing the ""guest dining table"" - that was just a top cherry of my experience).

In summary, the game looks good but plays badly. I recommend watching the playthrough on Youtube. It would be a much better experience than actually playing it yourself; additionally, you save your money on it.",1657120126,1657120126,False,2,1,0.48475608229637146,0,True,False,False

- Design and game play are very fun and interactive.
- The atmosphere and the suspense are for my liking. I always kept wondering to myself what is going on and what is this. Obviously the plot isnt written and there are a lot of questions marks but they did it pretty well.
- DLC followed the same direction as the game.

Cons:
- Game is very short. If you do not explore and blast trough the game I guess it will take around 3-4 hours for the casual player.
- The Depth location sometimes is unclear, object that seem inline with you on X axis are actually not. Could be polished more.
- Achievements are unclear, They have a nice title but I had to to wiki the goal of an achievement before I started exploring.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]
I was recommended Little Nightmares by a friend, and the gameplay and visuals presented were certainly intriguing for me. Having played through the main game multiple times, I am quite certain my expectations have been well satisfied, haha.

Gameplay:
Little Nightmares is a horror/platformer and excels at fulfilling both of these genres. On the platformer side, the contrast of being a small child in a place full of giant objects allows for some fantastic platforming puzzles. Can’t find a way up? Try climbing an impromptu ladder of filing cabinet shelves or cage bars. If you need to hide, try looking around for holes in the floor, or gaps below the furniture. It all feels rather mystical and satisfying. Also, being able to fling around bottles and other random objects you find is really fun, and it helps that the physics work really well here. For the horror side, Little Nightmares works its players by pushing you to do more daring and risky actions in order to continue, often throwing you right in the sights of the monsters you are trying to avoid. This works well because it's no longer just the unnerving aspects of the monsters and environments that contribute to the horror theme, you now have to be the instigator! For example, you can easily sneak past the Janitor (the long-armed guy) to the next room…but then you need to pull a noisy crank to continue, forcing you to give away your location. My explanations cannot do it justice. There were plenty of moments where I realized what I needed to do to progress and I just thought “you are KIDDING me…”
To warn you, the levels seem to be designed to punish the uncareful. Players who run headfirst into challenges will get themselves killed more often than not, while those who take a second to assess their surroundings are rewarded at least with a possible solution for progression. Watch out for the electrified door!
I had some concerns initially about Little Nightmare’s platforming challenges due to the forced camera angle, but the game is surprisingly polished with its controls and I rarely had any frustration with controlling my character. There were a couple annoyances where I tried to slide under some cover quickly, but I missed because I couldn’t tell the depth very well and I slid into a wall instead. Such complaints are mostly minor, though.

Story:
From the game description and intro, all you’re given is that you’re playing as a little girl named Six, trying to escape from this weird vessel. A brief cutscene at the beginning (the only real cutscene in the game) shows a mysterious woman surrounded by fog – the main antagonist. And then you’re thrown into the mess! There’s not a single bit of exposition to be found in Little Nightmares, but its environment does a great job at telling a story on its own. You’ll see disturbing recurring themes such as the seeming child factory that’s running on the island, and the general dilapidated appearance of the vessel itself. The stark size contrast really emphasizes the nightmare part of the game, really making you feel the childhood dread of things like the dark, strange giants, and losing your grip. It’s a thrill ride to the very end, to which I might add that Little Nightmares has one of the most memorable endings I’ve ever seen in a game.

Music:
There’s not really any consistent soundtrack in the game; rather, you get the general ambience of the vessel, plus occasional themes which play based on the current events. These still really strengthen the moods of the game, making everything feel more ominous and unfriendly.

Visuals:
The dark and off-putting style of Little Nightmares really helps to make it feel like the nightmare it wants you to imagine, with even recognizable things being disturbing enough to unsettle you. The physics in the game seem pretty consistent, and Six moves and interacts with objects with believable motion. Most of the monsters you encounter are designed to leave an impression, much like an actual nightmare. There’s a couple hiccups where a monster might move through a solid object, but overall the game is pretty polished.

Replay Value:
Despite being short (with the main game being possible to complete in under an hour), Little Nightmares offers such a great experience that’s easily worth revisiting, and the various hidden collectibles offer even more incentive to do so. Even if the game is rather linear, the monster AI is erratic enough to keep you on your toes even if you know what you are doing. The usual $20-$30 dollars can be a bit much, but purchasing this game on sale is a no-brainer.

In conclusion, players who are looking for a unnerving horror experience will enjoy the challenges offered by Little Nightmares, and those who are into platformers could easily find excitement here as well. For anyone else, the short length combined with the puzzling platformer challenges still offers a great experience, if you don’t mind getting scared.


EDIT FOR DLC REVIEW:
The DLC chapters for Little Nightmares are alright and offer more unique gameplay and puzzles, but they are noticeably less refined compared to the base game. Your objectives are sometimes unclear and frustrating, and there's some places in the chapters where you can get stuck unexpectedly in the terrain. They aren't unplayable, but I would recommend buying them only if you really want to extend the base game",1654747319,1655958017,True,2,0,0.551282048225402832,0,True,False,False

This game is all about the atmosphere, it is TENSE! The world is strange and nonsensical, and the enemies are horrifying. But the nomes and protagonist are adorable. It's a very good blend of creepy and cute that is very difficult to pull off, but it's done excellently here.
The puzzles are fun, they story is very vague but fun to figure out. My only issue is that the controls are a bit clunky, and I personally had a hard time with the depth perception, that's especially an issue for the platforming.

I am a firm believer that video games are a form of art, and Little Nightmares demonstrates it beautifully. Every part of the presentation is brilliant, the level, character, art and sound design are all perfect. Playing through this game is a truly wonderful experience, I highly recommend it.
The thing that sticks out to me the most is the character design. The player character is cute, but helps you feel fear of the world around you. Without shoes, it immediately signals that they are unprepared, and its small size makes the terrors of the world seem so much greater. This level of detail is present in every character, with no wasted space or meaningless design. Every part makes you feel uncomfortable when it should and cute when it needs to be. The Chefs are perhaps my favorite, and they feel truly disgusting and horrifying without being gorey or gross.
This game is brilliant, there is no wasted detail. Everything is placed with purpose to make the mundane, a terrifying experience. This is not really a horror game, there are no sorts of tropes that usually drive horror games.

And break the bond in anger
We were once, and once again, are strangers
Piercing me, her eyes have turned to lasers
Create the plot and skew the plot to make her, okay
I hope this feeling in my stomach blows by
You were the only one to read me through my eyes, baby
I was fucked but you made it alright, baby
Now without you a part of me dies[/i]

I thought human nature gifted moral code [b]but I was wrong[/b]
She could kill me now and I would still try to put it in a song
Circulation leaves my fingers while I jot these poems
I feel being hated still holds more than being alone
I've lost too many friends to the same shit I take
Heavens way too full for someone that had willed this fate
The bottle's never deep enough to drown out this pain
And the pills are never strong enough to alleviate this weight

Create the bond
And break the bond in anger
We were once, and once again, are strangers
Piercing me, her eyes have turned to lasers
Create the plot and skew the plot to make her

Break me again
And again
And again
When I'm numb I'll say sorry to my family and friends
I'm on drink, I'm on pills, I'm on ten, I'm on go
In my head, I hear voices telling me I'm better cold

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

I was nervous but I tried to play fine
I feel my pills push down on top of my eyes
But in the 416 I really come to life
Inside of this city, when you cry, it's pure ice
Snow is blinding me in these college streetlights
Oh, what happened to me? I guess in the end our time flies
That’s why I think I'll come and check on you tonight[/b]

So kill me and then love me and then cut me and then stuff me and then dump me in this ditch
I was so damn whipped
You ungrateful bitch
Please just choke
This about people that did me wrong
If you feel me just sing along
I had never felt how I was
On that evening night in that house
But I'm too scared to reach out
So I'll be here thinking about it

Little Nightmares is genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. The worldbuilding, visual aspect, stellar audio, cinematography, lore: it's all so well executed! The style of it is delightfully creepy and really makes you feel like you're in a living nightmare! Plus the stark contrast of the bright yellow Six navigating the dark, nightmarish environment within the Maw really makes her pop out in the best way possible.

It's a game where you're going to fail a lot. The auto-saving checkpoint system is in place, but it is not perfect. More than once, I groaned to find myself set back too far and stuck having to overcome obstacles I had thought I had already overcome. When checkpoints were friendlier, load times had me grumbling in frustration. The ten seconds added up to a lot of waiting time between failures, especially in the more difficult challenges at the end of each chapter.

There are still a few bugs and you might clip to the walls sometimes, or get caught through a wall by an enemy while hiding, but all the mechanics make sense, and it's really enjoyable to play. Many times I just took a breather to appreciate the story or graphics of the environment.

I'm not exactly a good ""gamer"", I've always gotten lucky or learned fast enough to catch on, but that doesn't make me good, and even in this I messed up a bunch of times. It makes you look for different angles to find new solutions to tiny puzzles and it's a great eye-opener.

The graphics are nice. The level design is pretty cool too and the story is dark and interesting.

The bad:

You can only save so often and that coupled with the precise timing required with the not-so-great controls and camera perspectives make for a frustrating experience. I had to look at a YouTube walk through at one point because after jumping to my death like 20 times because I couldn't figure out where I should jump from because of bad perspectives. I knew where I had to jump but kept missing. Where I thought I should be jumping was way off it turns out.

Falling a bunch of times because you can't see exactly where you need too jump, having to start all over again and then wasting minutes just to get back to where you died just isn't fun for me after a few times (in reality more than that, see above). 

Summary: This is one of those games where Steam should have more than just an up vote or down vote. In some ways it is great but other super frustrating. 

I came for the puzzles, story and dark but beautiful art, not the crappy controls and limited perspectives. If you could save anywhere it would be much more bearable. Starting over again and again and then having to get back to where you were gets old after a few times.

I can't recommend because of the frustration.

Plot, level and sound design are just perfect.
Cinematography is astonishing, especially in terms of lighting.
OST is just beautiful.
Every aspect of the game sets the mood perfectly at any time.

The controls responsiveness suits the slowish small-jump platforming style perfectly and they never feel clunky.
The partially fixed camera perspective may prove a little challenging for some at the beginning, but as soon as your depth notion adjusts it becomes quite easy to run through platforms with precision. Floor patterns help.
Definitely meant to be played with a controller and if so I doubt anyone will feel frustrated with controls for too long. 

Main game is in fact short, but the collectibles and achievements will keep it interesting for quite a few playthroughs and all DLCs combined are probably longer than the base game itself.

Definitely recommended, wouldn't change a thing, straight to my top favourite games of all times.

Nothing in the game so far really scary but it's quite psychologically disturbing and always to keep you on edge the whole time. Very clever design. 

Your job is to guide a small feeble creature, I guess projection of yourself as a child, through the maze of what appears to be the bowels of a ship, there are lots of small puzzles, traps and a myriad of routes to cover on your journey. 

What amazed me most was that everything just take a little thought, there's no really tough puzzles to handle you just have to think a little bit. You're kept in constant suspense as to cross from room to room. The viewpoint often changes just a little and takes a tiny of adjustment wash time you enter and exit rooms. 

The whole game is an exercise in the unpleasant nightmares we have all endured sometimes as kids. I well remember many of these elements from my own childhood nightmares, darkened spaces, not able to escape from monsters very easily and the whole eerie nature of your vivid but limited imagination as a child.

I do have a lot of questions after beating it. How and why am I on this ship? Why do they seem to hate little tiny people in rain coats? Is this come sort of cruise from hell? The hell is going on? But to be honest, I don't really care if these questions are not answered. It would only add to the charm of the game if it all stayed a big mystery.

I honestly can't remember what I payed for this game. It may have been a bit too high for the length of play. But then again, this game has more polish that a shoe shiner on wall street. And even though I have beaten the main chapters, there seems to be more to the game...

Little nightmares has had an incredibly large impact on my life for a while now, it's one of my favorite games of all times, it's such an aesthetic that I can't even begin to describe, it's beautiful it's enriching, and it's horrific. I've read the comics I love the story and the world building in little nightmares. The theme I like to imagine is it's about WWII and six is a jew, fleeing from all the bad men who want nothing more than to capture her, but i'm sure you could portray many themes onto it. case and point, it's a beautiful gem, and I hope for more gems from Tarsier Studios to come ^^",1650870476,1650870476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spoiler Alert, This game is sooo amazing and gets you hyped up because:
1. Certain Monsters.
Certain Monsters such as, The long arms, Chefs, Guests, and the Lady, are scary. They also have their own role. They all ALSO want to kill/Eat you (Which makes me like the game) (my opinion).
2. The cameras.
The cameras do an OUTSTANDING job of getting the angles right and making the game so much more amazing. There is also a little amount of games that have cameras like these.
3. The Ending.
The Ending is so twisted. (I'm not telling you the ending... you gotta find out yourself)

The achievements are hard but doable, the game has barely no glitches and the gameplay is pretty fun.

HOWEVER... the only thing I would change is the camera view. Yes, you may turn it left and right but that is not enough to understand the depth of the room making you fail at critical moves. Of course, after some trials you end up doing it right but perspective could have been better.

If I were to describe Little Nightmares in one word: Masterpiece. Absolute masterpiece.

The minute details, the graphics, the soundtrack, the character development, the absolute HORROR, the physical panic I felt whilst playing this was impressive.

I have NEVER been freaked out by anything in the horror-media realm, and I watch a LOT of horror.
but THIS? This got my heart racing.

For the FULL experience, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out SuperHorrorBro's youtube channel for theories, and for a deep dive into the storyline and monster's storylines.

this game is exquisite. I have probably annoyed my partner by talking about it constantly. It's incredible.

Review for both I and II (spoilers)

Absolutely breathtaking game. Gorgeous cinematography, design, feeling. Was challenging for me and often aggravating, because of the keyboard controls and the askew angles. But probably mostly my fault, because ill admit i'm not that good at video games!!

 I thought the story was pretty good and intriguing, although left me with a lot of confusion. Like, why are these children in this monster world? Why are there no human adults?? Have the adults of the human world turned into monsters?? No, because it seems to me that this monster world with big furniture and cruise ships has been established for a while. Why are all these other TV obsessed towns-folk monsters different from fat ugly doctor monster and long neck teacher monster?? Plus the thin man and geisha girl like...why?? I probably dont make sense...my point is that the lore is all over the place and doesnt make sense to me and scrambles my silly brain",1647205665,1647575494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The simple thrill of evading larger than life monsters is infinitely more compelling than shooting wave after wave of enemies.

Also, dear reader, if you do decide to play this game, know that the game itself sucks. I mean, sometimes the camera angle is weird and you fall off, or the scripted enemy glitches weird and you die, or like, sometimes things are just bull crap, or the puzzle they want you to solve is not particularly obvious.

Some things to know: In chapter 2, there is a mechanic where you want to be quiet. As such, don't step on things and walk on carpets! I went through the entire chapter the first time not understanding that. In chapter 3, things are based more on sight, but you can still make sounds to get in trouble. 

In my opinion, play this game. But this is one of those games where if you get stuck for more than a few minutes, probably go look at the walkthrough (there are several good ones in the guides section!) and more than likely you will go ""Oh I am so glad I did not spend all day trying to figure that out."" 

Also, the achievements / hidden nomes / jars to break / stuff to do: This game is not impossible to get the achievements, but they are obnoxious. The nomes are pretty easy to do, as are the lights. There are some that are super easy. The one where you put all the food in the pot is extremely frustrating, and most of the ones in the DLC are not ones you will figure out or notice, so again, refer to a walkthrough if you want these (Again, some very good ones in the guides section). 

In summary, great game, I can't wait to play Little Nightmares 2, and I wish I had played it a long time ago. I ended up being mad at the game by the end of my first playthrough, but for some reason, the game was magical enough to make me want to play multiple times, including doing the speedrun / no death achievement. The game is not hard, but do not be surprised if you are just sort of frustrated by something that feels kind of bullcrap. But it's worth it. 

DLC - The DLC levels were pretty good, however, one thing to say here: OMG THE FIRST ONE HAS SOME ANNOYING MECHANICS. It's worth it, just keep reloading and you will get it, but I did not like it really. The story of it is amazing, you should not spoil it, you should play it. The base game story is great, and the DLC I was more meh on until the last bit and it is totally imo worth the few hours to play through it all.",1645894884,1645894884,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Little Nightmares worked its way into my dreams because it's just bright enough, just safe enough to make me let my guard down.

Yet here is my Steam review after having completed it.

I decided to purchase Little Nightmares after viewing some of a Let's Play of Little Nightmares 2.  It was a puzzle-platform-adventure with a very dark theme.  I've played games like it before (LIMBO), but LN2 was so well done that I decided to play the first game for myself.  It was conveniently on sale, as the Lunar New Year Sale 2022 was ongoing.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/

Little Nightmares definitely looks like it was made before Little Nightmares II.  The production values aren't as high, but the things that fascinated me about LN2 were still there.  This game combines feelings of grotesque, cute, exciting, shocking, and mysterious.  There were moments of slowly sneaking, and moments of running for my dang life.

The girl I played as never said a word, showed her face or revealed any of her many secrets, but I genuinely felt affection for her and wanted to help her through this journey.  The way she is animated is so masterfully done that it was enough to build that connection for me.  Animation quality and detail is generally a strength of this experience, though Little Nightmares 2 was even better.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/860510/Little_Nightmares_II/

I lead the girl to death many times in this.  The game does have some challenge and isn't always obvious.  But death is expected, and after returning to a checkpoint (generously placed), the girl calmly gets up from an apparent rest.  Such a great touch!

That Let's Play that I watched is the only reason I overcame my assumption that Little Nightmares was just some game that would be of little interest to me.  I was wrong to have ignored it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ5L_RTXpr4&list=PLYkzrVLtM-oC_yGedT_xQEiRjKm-9nQyL&index=1

Little Nightmares was extremely short, but I have recently gained an appreciation for games that offer brief, but complete and satisfying, experiences.  I had purchased the Complete Edition, so I have a few more levels I can play next.  Great game!


Post-script: I experienced this game in stereoscopic 3D with my virtual reality headset.  This was possible with the vorpX VR injection application, which  has a built-in profile for it.  I usually only play games with vorpX if geometry 3D mode works correctly, but I found that Little Nightmares looked pretty good with the Adaptive 3D mode.  In fact, this is the first time I have ever used Adaptive 3D or Z-Normal with vorpX.

To be clear, I did not experience Little Nightmares with immersive VR.  I played it as if it was on a giant screen 6 feet away from me.  Even so, being able to perceive the depth of characters and the game world added a lot to my enjoyment.  2.5D platformers look surprisingly great in stereoscopic 3D.",1644548421,1644548421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: Good
Clear Time: 3 hours
100% Time: 5+ hours
Summary: A unique take on the spoopy genre, this puzzle platformer creeps you out and looks great doing so. Unfortunately the controls and movement are the true horror of this game but they don't take enough away from how interesting the game is.

[i][b][u]What is it?[/u][/b][/i]
A creepy ""2D"" puzzle platformer where you take control of a small child in a very dark an ominous place interacting with objects to hopefully escape the grotesque monsters around you. I say ""2D"" because you can run both towards and away from the camera to explore but ultimately you'll be running left/right.

[i][b][u]What I Liked[/u][/b][/i]
The game has the whole ""show, don't tell"" methodology. There's a small intro cutscene, then you wake up in a suitcase and that's the entire story you're given. It's the environments and the objects that are meant to tell the story and I think it does a good job. The game also doesn't rely on cheap scares; infact this game (to me) is NOT a horror game as it isn't intended to spook you, it's only meant to creep you out and make you curious. Otherwise, the game looks fantastic and the environments are a joy to explore. The soundtrack is fantastic and at a short playtime of 3~ hours it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

[i][b][u]What I Didn't Like[/u][/b][/i]
The biggest problem of this game is the depth perception. Because you can run towards/away from the camera you will often get a false sense of position: jumping to grab onto to a ledge only to realise your character was not at all in line with it. This happens ALOT in multiple instances. You're also going to [b]constantly[/b] get stuck on objects and the corners of objects which especially sucks during chases; it feels like the hitboxes of inanimate objects are larger than the object. There's one section at the end of Chapter 3 (out of 5) where you have a split second to line yourself up for a jump onto a moving object. Most of my deaths in this game were from missing that jump because the camera angle is so wonky it's impossible to line yourself up. There is also a few unskippable story moments that throw off the pace of the game but there's only 5, they're annoying after your first playthrough.

[i][b][u]What I Would Add/Change[/u][/b][/i]
Some meaningful collectables would have been nice. Notes written by inhabitants that explore more of who they are, or notes on the environment, anything world related would be fantastic. I wouldn't change anything although I wish the above issues would be fixed.

[i][b][u]Personal Thoughts[/u][/b][/i]
I liked the game alot, and if I knew how short it was I would have completed it in one sitting. I don't know if i'll play the second but this game definitely does something unique and I have to give it props. I found trying to speedrun the game more fun than the base game; knowing what is coming up gives you time to explore the environments more thoroughly instead of wandering around thinking about how lost you are.

[i][b][u]Achievements[/u][/b][/i]
Easy except one. Most rely on completing the game/getting collectibles/interacting with certain objects. The only hard achievement is to complete the game in under an hour without dying. This would be much easier if the depth perception didn't make you jump into a pit 100 times forcing you to start again. I read guides saying it was tough and you'd only barely make it at best, but I clocked in at 45 minutes so it I had alot of time to spare!",1642747708,1643962106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't say it is incredibly scary, but I don't think that is what they were going for. It has an incredibly well done creepy and mysterious atmosphere that has you questioning who the real ""bad guys"" of the story are. Despite there being no dialogue, the mystery of everything going on is incredibly captivating and has you speculating as you play. My only real complaint is the final chapter is very short compared to the others, and as a result you don't get to see the enemy associated with that chapter all that much. Also, the controls can be a little finicky at times, but you get used to them after a bit. These are only minor problems in the end though.

Don't skip out on this phenomenal experience, even if you aren't into horror games very much. You'll still find lots of enjoyment in the narrative and puzzles!

However, I only see beauty in the consistent grim environment and character design. The story is so obscure that has no meaningful insights to be told. The developer did not even try to explain those mysteries throughout the game. Some people like obscure plots cause they seem to have some deep thoughts behind. But the most common situation is that there is no thought at all. I feel like the developers just drew some strange monsters and characters as well as some grim maw and then stitched them together without thinking the reasons of the relationships between characters and why they fit.

The first time you play through it's addicting and some part can give you quite a scare, and with the addition of the mysterious atmosphere and lore behind the game, you have to replay to find all the little details!
The achievements and hidden collectables make this game replayable and still incredible enjoyable with its atmospheric environment and absolutely INCREDIBLE sound design! 

Some downsides though are this game does include quite a bit of trail and error, causing a bit more frustration than necessary.

Overall though this is an incredible game that I highly recommend more people play, and I cannot give enough credit to this games amazing sound design and atmosphere!

While this game is a Horror title I will say that it's not extremely scary, I feel it's more of a Psychological Horror. It keeps you on your toes anticipating a scare. Being chased by some of the creatures definitely gets your blood pumping (specifically the janitor and the hoard of hungry people). The puzzles are relatively easy. I only got stuck on a couple of them. I couldn't stop playing until I beat the entire game. I'm considering beating it to 100% completion.

As much as I want to give it a thumbs up it's ultimately a poor man's INSIDE. The art is visually amazing but feels like a low hanging fruit conceptually with lore that forcefully attempts to feel 'deep'. The game design itself is severally lacking. Game-wise it's just a platforming game with poor mechanics and almost no puzzle elements. An annoying checkpoint system makes you cross redundant sections instead of restarting from where the action should start. It's a 6/10-7/10 in my book but Steam ratings skew it to seem like an exceptionally good game, which it's not. Get it if discounted or free.

Perhaps finer controls and less cumbersome checkpoints couid have helped.

Mechanics are very similar to the grossly underappreciated ICO from the early PS2 days, with the main objective to navigate from one room and area to the next, minus the need for battle (which is other a plus or a minus, depending on your perspective). No real story and some of the challenges are fairly simplistic but the controls are intuitive and the atmospheric visuals and character models are quite beautiful.

Little to no gore, and nothing outright terrifying like in your face jump scares, but it is a horror game for sure. Very eerie atmosphere, always keeps you thinking about what you need to do next and keeps your brain moving to make smart moves or learn from your mistakes. Allows some exploring for the cool hidden achievements and collectibles, which is really fun. It's like a big hide and seek from monsters that always had me anxious to go around the next corner. Highly recommend. I bought the DLC and played all of it after I finished the story, and I have to say, I actually teared up a bit. Another beautiful thing about this game is the story. Sure, most of it is up in the air for people's personal interpretations, but I find it a very intriguing and meaningful story.

This time they chose to fight on the same level as Playdead (known for Limbo/Inside), but did they succeed? Let me be very clear with you: I believe they succeeded at creating something unique, but not at doing something as good and meaningful as Inside (which is a little masterpiece of analysis and sense). Little Nightmares (which is a terrible title) is a kind of typical dark tale of children abuse and monstrous ogres, played in a 2.5D puzzle platformer exactly like Inside, made of stealth, chase and terror. The scenario is dark and gory, without any surprise: the building up is so obvious that you just fear to reveal a truth you already guess. The platform is alright, nothing very new, and sadly sometimes a bit buggy (guessing where the depth of the 2D is makes it a chore sometimes). The visuals are fantastic, as always with Tarsier: a mix of ultra realism (the textures!!) and dark fantasy (Burton/Psychonauts style). Music is discrete and fine, scenario is gloom and okay.
However, look at my playtime: it took me less than 5 hours to finish the game (without getting the hidden goodies of course). That is very short... and there is nothing to analyze like in Inside when you are done. Actually, when I was done, I thought ""so... what was the big story? that does not answer anything"" and looked at the chapters... 3 of them were locked... you guessed it, because I had to buy DLCs. I do not believe this is a proper thing to do. If I have to buy 3 DLCs or even Little Nightmares 2 to understand the story, then they failed in narrative skill what they achieved in mercantile scheme. I might purchase the follow up later, hopefully they put more content into it.
Still! if you can get it on big sale, and feel like a little dark tale for an evening, Little Nightmares is still an enjoyable little game.",1640159174,1640159535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Amazing atmosphere.

4. Short and sweet.
Cons:
1. No written story. (who is this little nightmare? what is with the ""people"" and the ship?)

3. Too short (game is great but when you are encouraged to finish it in 60 minutes for an achievement, what does that say about the price for the game & DLCs)

I played the game to the end in just 3-4 horus. I payed more than 10 Euros for this.
I thought that its a good game puzzle wise? But the movement is crappy, instant death and you get back to a checkpoint that far away. Nearly no story, I hate open ends like dafuq is it about?

The story revolves around six, a young child who must venture through the vessel known as the Maw and must try and escape the horrors that lie within it. The characters are so well designed, making them look as if they have more to hide more than their creepy exterior has to offer. The story itself is really nice as it allows for the player to make their own interpretation about the on goings of the ship while giving a vague narrative to move the story along. 
The setting of the Maw is really impressive as it may contain the main departments that a ship would have, but twists them into its own visual design and keeps the player guessing on what will come next. From the Kitchen where the chefs reside, to the main food hall that the visitors devour in, each area really compliments the enemies that come with it and adds to their characters and mystery that itself may hold. I also love the fact that the settings are held in doll house like sections which adds more to the child like nature of the game.
Visually, its stunning as the imagery is done in a Tim Burton-esque style with it being really creepy, but also childlike in its essence. Graphically, the game is really impressive with the lighting being on point and the textures being high quality for the player to examine themselves. 
Sound and Audio are superb as the Soundtrack really adds to the atmosphere and is made to feel nightmare-ish with it being dream-like. The audio as well is fantastic as the sounds of enemies, them chasing you, and Six's interactions with objects feeling authentic and fit the overall theme of the game. 
In terms of gameplay, its really fun to control. The main thing you will be doing is traversing around the Maw, using object to help progress through the story and hiding/running away from enemies. The game is done in a 2.5D style which i though was going to be tedious in terms of platforming, but turned out to be really smooth and easy to navigate around. Jumping, running and grabbing are really nicely done as well and it doesn't feel like any of them are lacking or under performing than other mechanics. The enemies in this game have their own mechanics and ways of capturing you, such as the Janitor with his long arms and his sense of hearing instead of sight. The one thing i really wish was for this game to be longer as i really had a great time experiencing and just wanted more. 
Overall, Little Nightmares is a brilliant indie game that, even thought i got it on sale, i would have payed full price for an experience such as this and i would highly recommend it to everyone wanting a gripping horror/thriller experience.",1613706687,1639488295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Atmospheric and beautifully realized, [i]Little Nightmares[/i] combines some solid platforming with an environment that breeds dread without resorting to cheap scares. While pretty short in length, the game packs in a good variety of scenes, narrative, and characters to keep each level fresh, challenging, and unique.

[h1]Six Michelin Stars[/h1]
I think the thing [i]Little Nightmares[/i] does best is it's ability to send the player through a revolving door of mechanics while never feeling repetitive. It nails the pacing between nail-biting boss encounters and slower-paced puzzle sections; when to close in on the player to force quick reactions and when to hang back and let the player drink in the scenery. Trial-and-error is still your primary tool for learning how to progress through the game, though the difficulty has been turned way down. If you're looking for a die-hard puzzler, this isn't going to be your game. [i]Little Nightmares[/i] has turned a lot of the hurdles of puzzle-platform and replaced them with speed bumps so that the player can progress at a reasonable rate while still having enough challenges to overcome so the game isn't just a walking simulator.

If I had to make a comparison, I'd say that if you took [i]LIMBO[/i], gave it an element of depth, and turned down the puzzle while upping the atmosphere, then you get something remarkably similar to [i]Little Nightmares[/i]. Indeed, the gameplay is remarkably similar to many other entries in the ""small child scary world"" genre of Indie games. However, while the gameplay explores no new fronts, it's undeniable to extra time and attention when towards crafting a grotesque but visually fascinating world for you to explore.

[h1]Breakdown[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[olist]
    [*][b]Bad Dreams:[/b] [i]Little Nightmares[/i] features some excellent checkpoint systems throughout the game. Deaths never set you back too far so that forward momentum keeps going.
    [*][b]Lights & Nomes:[/b] The game has two sets of hidden ""collectibles"", lanterns to light and Nomes to hug, that really rewards players exploring the environment without being excessively challenging to get.
[/olist]
[b]Cons[/b]
[olist]
    [*][b]Twitchy Legs:[/b] The nature of the game and controls means that precision platforming is quite inconsistent and the few sections that relied on precise movement (such as one section running across a table) was quite frustrating.
    [*][b]Sticky Fingers:[/b] A sort of weird decision in terms of controls, but the fact that the player needs to constantly hold grab for Six to grab a hold of ledges was quite annoying since in most platformers characters will automatically grab on to ledges or ladders or environment set-pieces when appropriate.

Story is Great and Surprisingly suspenseful even if you're solving puzzles. We also bought all 3 DLCs and we had unexpected revelation in the end. 

We hope that they produce the controls in PC version easier. It's kinda hard to move around. One more thing that we didn't like is the save point. Sometimes we need to start over when we reload it.

Yes, the visuals a good, the soundtrack is good... but that's about it. The puzzles are quite lacklustre, escape sequences are annoying and the platforming is very clunky. It's not scary at all, just atmospheric. Getting one-shot by every mob is also annoying, especially with the ill placed auto save / checkpoint system. You may find you have to do an entire area again because you made a tiny mistake, like being a split second late to press a button. The puzzles are very basic, climb up this, go through there, fetch this, place this here - nothing innovative and interesting at all; basically a glorified fetch quest. As for the platforming, you have to time your jumps and angles correctly, otherwise you'll fall and restart. The camera sometimes skews itself, which makes moving even harder, especially during escape sequences and when walking on thin platforms. Often on these thin platforms, you don't know which button to press because if you keep holding it in down, you'll fall off, so you need to hold down two buttons and do this weird dance to stay in the middle.

I can see why people can like this, if you can somehow forgive all the bad gameplay mechanics. You'll like this game if you're a big fan of platformers, you like a little adventure, and through in some puzzles here and there. In a way, it's like a cinematic, with extra steps. However, I don't recommend the game. There are much better platformers, much better puzzle games etc. out there.

I'm recommending the game but it comes with a big caveat, so first a WARNING: It's very short! I finished it in about 4 hours but I've seen speed runs of it under 40 minutes. Do not buy this at it's full $29.99 price. Despite everything else about the game being great at $29.99 it's not good value for money. Get it on sale when it's between $5 and $10 instead.

Now, for the good parts.
First, the visuals, it's beautiful. It has the look and feel of a Tim Burton movie. The level of horror is also pretty much on par with something like Nightmare Before Christmas so if you're not into horror games, don't let the game's title deter you. It's creepy, atmospheric and fascinating.
The sounds of the game bring it to life. Directional sound is a must so I recommend headphones.
The game is also meant to be played using a controller so it's definitely recommended. I played it with mouse and keyboard and definitely died quite a few needless deaths because of it.

There is no dialogue in the game but the story it tells is great and seeing as this is mostly a kind of quick time platformer the journey is the most important thing the game offers. In that department it really shines taking you on a suspense filled ride through a beautiful and creepy setting as a seemingly harmless and vulnerable little humanoid.

With little need for dialogue, Little Nightmares successfully tells a horrific story worthy of empathy and acclamation. The ghoulish lore sets the tone for top-notch gameplay right from the opening moments through the DLC expansions, which tell an interleaving tale of their own.

The eerie art style and sound have been masterfully crafted to seamlessly immerse the player inside [i]The Maw – an underwater vessel inhabited by corrupted souls looking for their next meal.[/i] The environments instil the fear factor organically.

The gameplay is comparable to that of INSIDE, but with relatively simpler environmental puzzles and refreshing mechanics. The game is rather short and plays optimally with a controller.

Overall, Little Nightmares is definitely worthy of recommendation. I would suggest getting the [i]Complete Edition[/i] that comprises the game and the [i]Secrets of The Maw Expansion Pass[/i] which would get you the story DLC and would support the brilliant minds over at Tarsier Studios.
As a whole, Little Nightmares is up there sharing the throne with INSIDE, and is a genre-defining experience in itself.

I really loved the level design and environmental art of this game. The overall color palette as well as lighting and shadows play a huge role creating the atmosphere for the game too.

Maybe the only thing I can complain about is the checkpoint system because even if you fail a level at %99 through, you will be starting from the beginning of that level again.

Other than that, the game is charming and I would recommend everyone to play it with a controller.

TL;DR: A nice puzzle platformer with a great story and atmosphere, with puzzles that are (intuitive?) but some parts have difficulty spikes leading to rare pacing issues.

[h1]Preface[/h1]
My viewers recommended a bunch of horror games to me especially after how bad I felt Layers of Fear was, but knowing my own personality, and that I don’t get scared very easily (which isn’t very good streaming for most horror games…) I decided among the suggestions to go for a more story oriented rather than jumpscare and react kind of games, settling on this after seeing the trailer.

[h1] Review [/h1]
Little Nightmares is a story puzzle platformer with a very unsettling atmosphere.
 
Its art style is realistic but slightly off, with the entire environment easily understood, but there’s always just something that’s a bit off. This along with the constant movement of the screen (spoilers) leaves the player feeling uneasy, and even with your guard up, tends to make you unsettled. For this, I can applaud them, but fear is not exactly something I feel in this game.

The platforming is very simple and easy to grasp making this a great pick up and play immediately without having to spend quite a lot of time learning the controls, the movement, if a tad bit floaty and the lack of camera makes some jumps a bit hard to judge. It does at times feel a bit of a nuisance, as there is a specific puzzle [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/HardArtisticYamOneHand-uv7RIbzKR7GxIi1E] Mild Spoiler [/url] that basically had me trapped for 10 or so minutes, this, along with one of the last ‘run’ scenes are the kind of pacing issues that I feel go badly in horror games, as it takes you out of the experience very quickly. However with those as exceptions, most of the puzzles are very well crafted and intuitive, it requires basically no handholding at all because of its amazing game design, with usual and subtle hints that make you feel clever more so than following around a ‘quest’ or pointer.

Since this is more of a one of kind of game, with little replayability, it’s better to not talk much at all about the story, though one thing to note is the heavy emphasis on themes. Spirited Away fans, please pick this game up. I swear it’s worth it for the references alone. 

There is also a point in the game if you have basically any pattern recognition, that you can very very easily predict what will happen, but that does not do anything to soften the blow at all. It’s that kind of building up of characters, that don’t even speak, impressive.

(6/10) Decent as a game, mediocre for the genre, redeemed only by lack of jumpscare and decent atmosphere",1636462799,1637047586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1][b]🚪 Introduction[/b][/h1]
[hr][/hr]
A sandbox story is a category I use to classify games with the likes of LIMBO. When a game presents characters through silhouette forms with nearly no information about what's happening around them, it all hinges on the player's imagination, based on his interpretation of the provided barebone elements in the coalescence. In other words, the player comes out with a story modeled by his own fiction derived from his experience in the game. At first glance, I thought that Little Nightmares shares the same concept, but after a deep dive into it, it seems that I was mistaken.


[h1][b]🎮 Single-player[/b][/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[b]💠 Where Is the Plot?[/b]

It's inside a hidden pot. After an oracular intro, the game starts; things go on with no clear source for valid information. You're playing with many questions roaming your mind. You don't know a thing about the protagonist or her role in the story. So? Will everything unwrap at the end? Nah, the curtain falls, and still, I don't have a clue. Is it a Sandbox story? I asked myself. Let's search the internet to be sure. WOW! There is a Little Nightmare universe, and its characters have names and vital roles in it. Additionally, I've learned that the protagonist's name is Six from an external site after I've completed the game for the second time; heh, imagine that!

[b]💠 Raconteurs[/b]

How did you get all this info then? There are 2 storytellers: the first being the little details in the game's environment, and the second one is [url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.bandainamcoent.LNDC&hl=en&gl=US][b]Little Nightmares Comics[/b][/url]. After connecting the comics with the game, it comes out as a very compelling tale. Why not include the comics in the base game? Doing so could've avoided impairing the experience. Comics based on games work well when they add extra details that weren't there before, not present an entire story that should've been there in the first place.

[b]💠 The Little Nightmares[/b]

There are fascinating details that create hints related to the main plot, but they're all prone to false or inaccurate theories. The death mechanism in this game carries a brilliant meaning to it. Every time you die, you restart from checkpoint as Six waking up from a bad dream. It means every death that happens is just a nightmare for Six when she takes a resting nap before actually going to that place. It weaves the entire story of Six as a death-free adventure full of little nightmares that wake her up from resting naps to continue going on.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2614831239
[b]💠 The Unknown Little Journey[/b]

You play as a little girl in a cryptic world, where everyone wants to eat her for some reason. Maybe she's a delicious and nutritious humanoid living candy? Who knows? Anyway, this game is weird enough. Basically, your gameplay consists of platforming, solving straightforward puzzles that do their best to seem clever, and some creepy chasing action. Mostly, puzzles revolve around: platforming, searching for items to advance progression, and stealth sections. In addition, there are collectibles like breaking statues, hugging Nomes, finding message-carrying bottles (DLC), and lighting lanterns; finding them will unlock concept arts and the Rascal Mask. The campaign may take you roughly 3 to 4 hours to complete, assuming it's your first time.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2615111333

[h1][b]🛠️ Technical[/b][/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[b]💠 Big Nightmares[/b]

The irrational relative scaling between objects and characters creates a creepy art style that stands in the middle of being realistic and cartoonish. You see the protagonist, a nine-year-old girl, as tall as a bottle of wine; oversized freakish humans with ugly faces and preternatural postures; objects that fit the protagonist's hands and others that go well in size with the freakish beings. It creates an ambiguous capturing atmosphere that defies logic but gives the game a distinctive artistic taste. Add excellent lighting and sound design to the mix, and here you have a sublime audio-visual flavor.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627206913
[b]💠 Is It Raining?[/b]

No. So why are you wearing a raincoat? You'll uselessly confine yourself with it. It's the same as confining a 3D platforming game through stupid camera angles. Sure, you can pan the camera to look around the fixed angle, but still, it doesn't help much when your character is not in the same line with the targeted platform. You'll feel this problem when you fail a jump between platforms, slide to the wall instead of its crawlway during a chase, fail to maintain a straight movement on a narrow board. All these misses will make you look like a complete jackass, BTW. Also, if Six gets behind an object, she becomes offscreen, where you control her blindly.

[b]💠 Parkinson’s Patient[/b]

Adding insult to injury, controlling Six can get unresponsive at times, where you need to hit the button multiple times for her to respond or grab something. It happens very few times but can lead to maximum frustration on certain occasions. Maintaining a balanced run on narrow platforms can be annoying with the WSAD keys; an analog stick is a much better option for this task. I strongly recommend playing this game with a controller. In terms of game performance, unfortunately, I've encountered 5 random crashes with a fatal error message as well as a few annoying glitches.


[h1][b]⚖️ Verdict[/b][/h1]
[hr][/hr]
I am very disappointed; I expected a masterpiece. At first, I wasn't going to recommend Little Nightmares, but I think it deserves a try. Its appealing art style, decent sound design, and compelling hidden [spoiler]story[/spoiler] saved it from drowning. I hope that other games sharing this captivating universe offer a much better experience than this.

The story is short and sweet (takes about an hour to finish the entire thing, 2 max if you really take your time and die a lot) not including the DLC, which is about another hour. 

Mechanics are really clean and the game feels super well made overall.

Also, this game is wonderful for achievement hunters. They're difficult enough to make you feel proud when you ace it, but easy enough to where you can get the hardest one in a handful of tries if you are willing to do it (beat the game in under an hour without dying). 

Overall, 10/10, especially for the price of 5 dollars. If i bought this for the full 30, id probably give it an 8/10 just because of how short the story is, albeit good.",1636164300,1636164300,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

If you want a seat of your pants, squeaky-bum anxiety inducing platformer, then this game is perfect for you. It manages to be terrifying, horribly eeire, and utterly engrossing, and all without a single line of dialog. It's environments are escher'esqé, redolent of the darker work of Tim Burton, and it's puzzles are challengingly simple, but effective at making you think. It's main character, the child you play as, is... Complex, for a little mute monster. And it's monsters are just the right amount of utterly repulsive. Most of them, anyway.

I love a game that can tell a story w/o needless dialog that goes on and on. I also love a good puzzle game that adds element other than pure puzzle, which generally enhances the game. 3rdly, if that's a word, I like games that are gruesome and games that turn reality up on it's head and scream at you THIS ISN'T RIGHT, the person that made this isn't right in the head. It doesn't have to be gory and bloody (although I prefer it personally), it just has to grab you and shake the shit out of you. Games that make you stop and say WTF. 

This game game does that! Originally I thought this game was kind of for kids due to the main character being portrayed as a 'little kid running around in a grown up world'. But very early on in the game you see that it isn't for kids. Instead, in my opinion, one of the most disturbing games I've played in 20 years. 

Again, I'd like to point out that the entire story line is done with visuals...and not a big long back story that weaves in and out and has a bunch of crazy twists and turns. The amazing story is all unveiled in front of your face.  BEAUTIFULLY done! I cannot wait to play v2 and, if you haven't, you should too.

Go get this, play this, enjoy this. And if you get stuck, look up a walk-through and keep going til the end. Personally, this game was a little harder than my IQ is capable of, so I had to look up a walk-through a couple different times but that's better than not being able to finish a game and then turning it off forever and not ever seeing how a game ends.

They both share some similarities; they have an ambiguous story and awesome atmosphere. But gameplay-wise, while those games are 2D, this one is 2.5D. It has 3D movement, but depth is limited, so you mostly play on a 2D plane. Of course, that doesn’t make a game bad.
But the controls are awful. First off, some actions are binded awkwardly on the controller. Secondly, a lot of times you want to do something, but the game says no to you, especially during trickier jumps, grabbing stuff or ledges or carrying objects. And while I can appreciate the game for what it is, I can’t deny all the frustration I had because of poor controls.
The game is short, clocking around 3 hours, but the DLC combined adds another 3 hours (yes, the DLC is as big as the main game). But it’s intense. It has exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, hide-and-seek and escape sections. It’s very good at creating tension. The DLC is harder but makes up for an easier main game.
Despite the controls, I can recommend the Complete Edition on sale. It can get frustrating at times, but it’s a good experience overall. Just don’t expect a Limbo or Inside clone, or you’ll be disappointed.",1635796391,1635796391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art style is somewhat cartoon-like in a way, though that may not be the right word, and it helps paint a weirdly grotesque view for the horrors you come across.

People seem to commonly bring up [i]LIMBO[/i] and [i]INSIDE[/i]. It's clear the game has some inspiration from those games, but what's designed is a bit different.

The sound and music overall are strong in painting a creepy atmosphere, along with the difference in dimensions between yourself and everything else. You are so tiny while the rest of this world is large and looming, and you'll find distorted humans and other odd creatures.

The story of this game is not too clear. It's somewhat of a mystery though there are some metaphors you might be able to glean from what you find. The DLCs (particularly the last one) does answer a question or two that you might have had, but I would say that they're a bit weaker in quality because the first two retread some of the same areas and don't bring a whole lot new to the table. But it's still probably worth a run through those if you're interested.

And of course, there is [i]Little Nightmares II[/i] now, which I think is a very strong follow-up; but of course this is a review for the original, and you should definitely play this first, in any case.

The biggest problem I have with this game is some of the platforming sections, especially due to the depth of view with the camera. You may end up falling off places where it's hard to see your movement, and your interaction with some objects can be a bit finicky. But none of it is a dealbreaker by any means.

The last thing to note is that it's length is somewhere around 3 to 4 hours, depending upon your speed through places and if you do all of the collectibles. My overall playtime is from going back to get more collectibles and also doing a speedrun.

Altogether, I think you should give a quick glance at a screenshot or two, and maybe a part of the trailers, and that should tell you whether you're interested in the way this world looks. Then when you play and hear the proper audio alongside the visuals, that should hopefully reel you in.

I certainly enjoyed my time in this creepy world, and I was interested enough to go through its DLCs as well as the second game. I'd recommend most people to do the same.",1635634512,1635635859,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

With that out of the way this is a game i can truly recommend with the atmosphere on point and the artwork almost ripped out of every child's nightmare. The gameplay is simplistic but takes a degree of mastery if playing with keyboard and mouse (Game completed with K+M) The puzzles and the utter suspense will keep you going and keep you on edge not knowing what was around the corner waiting for you. Completely worth the full price and a gem that will be timeless with its horror theming and a story that borders on everyones deepest fears.

As I do with games I'm really interested in, I stay away from any and all promotional content (screenshots, photos, trailers, etc) to not be spoiled in the slightest. With that said, while playing Little Nightmares, I couldn't help but notice a strange familiarity I had towards it. And it's not from having played Limbo before, the two play completely different.

The controls are a bit wonky, but are easy to get used to. Graphics are stylized and visually stunning at times. Sound and music are superb. Credits are an unnecessarily long 15+ minutes (but that's what happens when your publisher is AAA and they feel the need to credit every one of their employees throughout the world. I'm looking at you too, EA).

While the game is creepy in its own right, some parts and sequences genuinely creeped me out.

Without revealing too much, definitely pick up this game if you can.",1563854312,1635056236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
