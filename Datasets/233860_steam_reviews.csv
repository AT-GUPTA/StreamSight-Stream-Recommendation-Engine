This game's bad, don't let all the fanboys who can't admit they wasted years waiting for this terrible game gaslight you into playing something that looks like runescape and has more bugs than gameplay

Bad: 
-Unreasonably difficult combat execution without xp boosts, mechanics are cool, but the execution just falls flat on its face as you watch your group of 10 guys stand in the middle of a group of 5 and all die. Instead of maybe, surrounding them? or flanking them? Or doing literally anything at all that isn't charging headfirst at the nearest enemy and slamming heads until one dies?

-Convoluted and confusing UI to accommodate screens and buttons that you will never use

-LONG XP grind for every skill (2-3x xp mod is mandatory imo)

-No real story (unless you count ""quests"" given to you by clans/guilds, which are more vauge goals)

-Mining and selling bandit stuff is the only 2 things you can do to make early-game money, and they are both SLOW

--On top of that, there's no real way to make any serious money (outside of end-game power to fight bounties, hash is the only thing in the ENTIRE game that has more than a 150%~ markup, and that's only in SOME cities)

-Bad economy mechanics, actually there's no economy mechanics at all. This town will pay you 500% markup on hash. Why? Who knows. Do they have a DEMAND for hash in this town? What about an ample supply? Doesn't matter, 500% until the entire town runs out of money; Then you wait 24 hours and do it all over again because it's STILL 500%

-Bad AI and even worse pathfinding; The insanely difficult fights (minimum 8 people parties you will ALWAYS be fighting against, no one is ever solo)
Seriously, you will give move orders, and it's very common to just find them stopped randomly somewhere waiting because the pathfinding decided it was impossible to move around the boulder in the road


Good: 

-The world is interesting, how the apocalypse happened, all the stuff you can see. None of it gets elaborated on because of point 3 on the bad, there's no real story

Summary: My curiosity got the better of me, and I wasted 25 hours on a game I could have returned. Don't be like me, play games that are actually fun with good AI, mechanics, and gameplay; not 1/3",1707699335,1708927284,False,1,0,0.405654579401016235,0,True,False,False

I fell in love with the game instantly when I realized how well it embodied the ""fail forward"" design philosophy. When you start this game, even a single one of the weakest enemies in the game will likely kick your ass straight into the dirt, but the twist here is that getting beaten in combat is usually not a death sentence. Most enemies are content to loot your stuff and move on rather than outright killing you, so  what would usually be a game-ending failure state in other games is instead a learning experience for you as the player, and literal toughness training for your character. Getting beaten up makes you stronger and more able to withstand future punishment. Every situation that does not end in death for your character can be considered a small victory because they improve themselves with every action they take. Running away from enemies trains your athletics which makes you even faster. Fighting them trains your combat skills which make you better at dealing and withstanding damage. Eventually you will save up enough money from scavenging for resources and selling them in nearby settlements that you might be able to afford to hire a companion to join you on your journeys. Now that you've got a wingman to watch your back you are in an even better position to take risks in the game because if one of you is incapacitated the other one might be able to drag them back to safety. Eventually you might grow your band of companions into a group large enough to start thinking about creating your own settlement where you can start to grow your own food or produce weapons and armor to equip yourselves or sell to other settlements for a profit. As your community continues to train and improve their skills and equipment you can start to explore more dangerous areas of the world in the hopes of scavenging some ancient technology that can be researched or repurposed for your own ends. Eventually your band of once-starving wanderers will be able to thrive, and with enough training and the right equipment they may become a force able to exert influence upon the world or explore the ruins of ancient civilizations in the hopes of learning more about the forgotten history of the moon called Kenshi.",1708674593,1708674593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I rank it 7/10 in general lore, 10/10 in the design of Skeletons, specifically the concept of Robots who broke free from slavery, but didn't cause an ""AI Uprising"" and who aren't ""So OP humans struggle to fight them."" giving them a humanizing aspect that makes them great. 10/10 Hivers are the most pleasant to look at and bad ass silly and cool bugman race I've played as in a video game without being over designed.

The game has flaws. Flaws Mods cannot fix. But yet it is still a treasure. It is endlessly replayable. It's not afraid to ruin your plans, it's not afraid to let you break it. A Triple A studio could never dream of recreating this amazing game without softening it up, or overcommiting to the ""difficulty."" It provides a curve of experience that happens both IRL and In game. You AND your character get stronger together with new game knowledge, and new Toughness XP.

It's Grimdark done right. It's a Sandbox done masterfully. It's only true flaws are the bugs, or shoddily implemented systems due to the Ogre Engine. But if you let yourself get immersed. Push past the bugs, the reloading because you got bodied at toughness level 1, and the relatively slow grind, you will find a game you will truly love.",1708658275,1708658275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Definitely more in the ""story generator"" vein where you have to make your own fun, but much more clunky than something like DF or Rimworld because of the character perspective rather than the ""god in the sky"" perspective you take on in those games.
EDIT 2.21.24
Most of Kenshi's mechanics ARE in its settlement building, but the game is so so so so much more than than that. If you go into Kenshi with an imaginative mindset (and liberal use of the wiki and workshop) you will find a living breathing world unlike anything I've seen in gaming. A breathtaking atmosphere full of hidden lore and fun secrets.
 It's built-in modding tool is quite intimidating at first, but very easy to learn with a friendly community on discord willing to answer any questions the wiki can't. Then once you have a grasp on the Forgotten Construction Set, you are free to play around in Kenshi's guts as you please. Make your own factions with their own worldview and unique characters.

Well that was Kenshi for me. This game is like 9 games in one, stat based rpg, base building sim, base defence, trading sim, farming sim, boss fights, Faction conquest. I love the absolute shit out of it. There's so many different  starts and playstyles, wanna be a beefy martial arts god soloing everything, you can! How about you get a million goats and destroy an evil slaver empire, its got that too. Hell even the early game when youre weak is really enjoyable, they somehow managed to make being a slave into interesting gameplay. I cannot reccomend this game enough for the gameplay alone.

And then the story and setting. The atmosphere and unique cities and zones is absolutely mindblowing for how simple the graphics are. Some zones are dark and bushy and annoyingly hard to see in, namely the swamp, but most are awesome and have unique features. So much of the story is told simply through enviornment and then the rest of it is buried in item descriptions and unique dialouges from rareish characters. From a dark souls fan, I love the ambiguity of everthing youre told and knowing some characters may be lying. And once you start putting things together it gives a whole new meaning to many of the zones you visit, although you may have to go on the wiki once or twice to really understand things.

PROS:
- being a random weak dude, getting beat up and slowly getting back at the people who beat you up is a major factor in this game. In other words, stat building (str/dexterity/weapon skills etc.) really hooked me up. But i will also mention this in the CONS section as its a double edged blade.

- world is large. Kinda empty, but large. It drives you to go out there and look for the ancient books and items that can help you research new techs. New techs open up new defenses, improve your production etc. 

- combat feels increasingly good up to a point. (if you have a uber character as i had, it gets boring super fast because you won't be able to watch the action, it will be over in 2-5 seconds most). Animations are between ok and good. Some weapons like katana or unarmed combat have better animations than - say polearms. Too bad katanas suck at endgame since you will be fighting armored opponents all the time.

- blood / bleeding effects. just damn. seeing your enemies actually bleed out on the floor is just satisfying. But its also kinda ""shocking"" if it happens to you.

- endgame is what you set it to be. you can go after abnormally strong NPCs, or faction leaders. If you kill an emperor, his city will crumble.


CONS:

- stat building really feels like a grind at some point. It already made a bad habit on me to train every single one to become a compotent fighter but it really is not fun while doing it. I suggest you to get a mod for training and restrain yourself not to exploit the game to enjoy it.

- world is TOO large. you can go anywhere you like, but there is nothing there that catches your atttention after you get to a certain tech level and have good weapons. Because you don't have an incentive to look for anything.

- there are supposedly ""world state"" events that happen when you kill a certain important NPC of a faction. But its so minor gameplay-wise (some buildings of that city get destoryed and a few set cities in border zone -not all- switch town guards to the opposing faction) that i felt disappointed. You can't really destroy a faction completely by eliminating their leadership, they just  keep ""sandboxing on"".

- combat feels like a minor annoyance after you get 70+ stat chars (i had 10 characters as a hit squad all with high level weapons and armor and could take down anything). It's not fun to watch people jumping all over the screen for 5 seconds. Although money is hard to come by at the beginning, you wont even bother looting your enemies at the midgame.

- i know game advertises itself as ""become a warlord"", but you can't actually. Sure you can have an outpost full with people doing labour/farm work, training etc. but your actions won't get recognised by the factions. You can be allied to a faction and thats it. You can't really rule anything in this world since there is no real interactions with the npcs (or factions). 

CONCLUSION:
I like the game. It made me play over 200 hours which is already self-proving. But it lacks replay value for me because of the mentioned cons.",1605863030,1708465305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kenshi laughs in the face of mediocre AAA titles with it's one-of-a-kind story line, systems, and gameplay loops. Forget the labels, there is no other game like this. The story is not spelled out for you. You are not the main character. The world of Kenshi is HUGE. Your victories are earned and your knowledge is gained through your will to seek it. Yes, the graphics aren't the best and there are some glitches, but the vast lore and compelling combat systems unfolding before you make it all worthwhile. The integrated Steam workshop and constant updates have the potential to fix most/if not all issues you may have, plus it's always fun to have something new to suck you back into another play through. 

Speaking of which replay-ability is extremely high. Want to become a lone Bounty Hunter Assassin? Do it. Become an illegal drug kingpin? Slave liberator? Slave Master? Business tycoon? Band of warriors? Band of b--witches? Yes to all! Perhaps do it all in one go. Do whatever you want. The world of Kenshi is harsh at first, but once you figure out how to survive and thrive, thriving can look like whatever you want it to be. If you like open-world styled play with a little bit of survival and base building mixed in, give it a try, it's probably cheaper than that OTHER game you like. 

WARNING: if you're the type that needs training wheels or guard rails up when you're gaming, this one's not for you. If you like popping wheelies and ripping those rails off to create support beams for your next ramp -- get this game and have fun breaking it!

Actually, let me edit this review: this game has been on the steam store page since 2012 apparently, as an early access. It hit full release 2018. Why? It had a single developer.

No, it IS a passion project, and one successful enough and projecting enough potential to build a SMALL STUDIO and a second game off of.

So the game is very buggy and janky and the dev has expressed that they're taking the game to a new engine for Kenshi 2(which I think will be what this game should have been?).

There you go that's your warning.
You're not the chosen one you're just some guy who's gonna get his a** kicked.

Why is kenshi hard ? Because it doesn't give you a story so you don't know who is hostile to who or what zone is dangerous.It also has a few mechanics you need to be careful with mostly food and limb condition.
The game is VERY grindy.You have to be either patient or like pain.

Kenshi has bugs is incredibly difficult and has horrible graphics so if you watched a video serie on kenshi and thought ""I wanna try my hand at it"" just be warned you will get your ass kicked a lot before you can have a fair chance at enjoying the game.You can look for informations about the game before buying it.

So why is my review positive ? Well despite all the crashes the bad path finding and its difficulty kenshi has my attention because it's an open world its difficulty is also a charm it's aesthethic is pleasing and it has mod support to make things a LOT easier.

Overall this game is about recruiting people give them a fighting style equipement and challenge various bosses or factions.Defeating them and if you want roleplaying your own story in the world.It is pretty fun to see your 40 soldiers charge into a city and spread absolute chaos but it's probably boring for most people.",1699634087,1708292483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OG REVIEW:

Kenshi is a game that you must give time in order to fully enjoy. And don't watch any tutorials or stuff, just explore the game yourself. It is hard and unforgiving, but once you get the hang of it it becomes extremely addicting.

There is no goal so you must make your own, I suggest you just play the game as is without mods and any help first. This way when you discover the game world yourself you will fall in love with the game. You will make your own memories and find interesting things you will love to return to in other playthroughs.

If you are new to the mods, I suggest better minimap mod, squad size increase and recruit prisoners. This way you wil be able to do literally anything in the game.

I am currentlz on my 4th playthrought, love this game, infinite replay potential. 10/10.",1686690620,1708213910,True,2,0,0.538258612155914307,0,True,False,False

Despite having no defined story or quests to take on, the game has a staggering amount of lore to uncover as you realize that you are living in an age long after the rise and fall of two separate empires, and most organized civilization is only looking out for themselves.

No need to save scum when things go poorly.   Lost battles make you tougher, lost limbs can be replaced with mechanical prosthetics (and are usually superior to meat-based appendages anyway...) and recruits that get eaten alive by the fogmen can be backfilled with drifters you find in bars.  Got caught stealing and thrown into prison, or maybe you made the mistake of pissing off the Holy Nation and find yourself a shaved-head and shackled slave on one of their farms?

THE GAMEPLAY makes it worth ANY price, the freedom given to the player is unmatched, the landscape is absolutely stunning, the graphics are mediocre but something about the design has you awestruck, I've been using a mod that reduces the texture detail for faster load times and yet the game retains its unmatched in the emotions it stirs in me.

I don't know the word to describe the aesthetic but I absolutely love it, it's a kind of imposing desolation that throws endless questions and intrigue your way, the entire world is this giant puzzle for you to explore and ponder to your hearts content. 

The mechanics are awesome, there's enough room in the combat system to sacrifice going full meta and allows you to stylise your armour and weapons, but also still a challenge that is always pushing you to improve. Every time you venture out a little farther the world just begs to be explored, usually I just enjoy being a trader in games but ended up just getting addicted to venturing out into the world.

You can choose exactly how many characters you want, play RPG solo, or a few more, or a whole army RTS style. Many ways to play the game, be a drug smuggler, steal with stealth or by fighting, bounty hunt, smithing, farming, base building(it is possible to play with no base).

Extremely in depth & amazing progression & combat that is very satisfying, hard to explain everything, but you will quickly understand when you play. Many ways to down or kill, Health bars for every limb, blood meter, you can down people by hitting their limbs or using sharp weapons to drain their blood, etc. To outright kill people you will have to be pretty strong and have high combat stats.

The different weapons are amazing, each weapon & martial arts(fighting unarmed) can all be used to train different stats and all benefit from different stats and each weapon has strengths and weaknesses. Some weapons and Martial Arts can deal massive damage but require multiple stats, full body training to use well. While some weapons like Katanas need only few stats to use and low level characters can use effectively.

There is no artificial requirement lock that needs you to be a certain level or have enough stats to use it, heavy weapons need high strength, you can use the best weapon in the game, Falling Sun(heavy weapon), highest quality version will be the heaviest, on a new char but he will hardly be able to swing and will have slow movement from being overburdened.

Too many good things to mention, just play it.",1707627218,1707881252,True,2,0,0.516331613063812256,0,True,False,False

It's a game where you can start as a one-armed, half-starved nobody in the middle of nowhere and end up... well, probably still a one-armed nobody, but with a slightly better hat!

Picture this: you're wandering through a desolate wasteland, avoiding deadly robots, and trying not to get eaten by giant bugs while carrying a dude who lost his legs in a tragic mishap with a giant hamster wheel. And you know what? It's freaking awesome.

Sure, the graphics might not be cutting-edge, but who needs photorealism when you can build a fortress out of cacti and watch your ragtag band of misfits fend off hordes of cannibals? Plus, the soundtrack? Let's just say it's the kind of music that makes you want to lead a band of warriors into battle... or maybe just go to the grocery store, whatever floats your boat.

In ""Kenshi,"" the world is your oyster, and by ""oyster,"" I mean a hostile, unforgiving wasteland where everything wants to kill you. But hey, where's the fun in playing it safe? So, grab your rusty sword, kiss your social life goodbye, and prepare for a rollercoaster ride through the weirdest, wildest, and most wonderfully messed-up game you'll ever play.

You start as a character with no skills, and you must grind to improve every stat you want to utilize to experience your journey through Kenshi. 

As a result, the base game is a bit bland in terms of role playing. There's a ton of fun world building, but there isn't much in the way of questing or missions. There are bounties that you can turn in for money, and there are alliances you can make. You can build a base. You can recruit people to your party. Some of them have personalities and a backstory, but for the most part, there is no story in Kenshi other than what you decide upon. 

Kenshi takes place on a moon that has undergone an apocalyptic event. The setting is post apocalyptic, and people have described it as sword punk. Do you want to open up a market and sell goods? Firstly, good luck. Secondly, you can do that with a lot of hard work. Would you like to be a mercenary or a bounty hunter? Again, good luck. But you can do that. Would you like to attempt to start your own township? Good luck. But you can do that. Would you like to form a crew of runners to smuggle drugs out of the swamps? Good luck. (Yes, you can also do that). Would you like to enslave people and just be a general, all-around piece of garbage to others? Yep, you guessed it. You can do that (good luck).

Here's an example of one of my journeys - I spawned into a section of the map ruled by United Cities (forgetting the name of the empire, only now returning to the game after a year, and I'm writing this review before starting up the game - SUPER EXCITED). Anyway, I spawn in, and my character doesn't have anything. I travel around the desert for a bit until I find a small community. Surely I can steal a few supplies, because I'm hungry and malnourished. I'm losing weight quickly, and I'm practically nude. I approach the village, and unfortunately it's a small settlement owned by slavers. They spot me stealing, chase me down, and then lock me up in a cage. 

Now, I know this is crazy, but I refused to quit. I was trapped in those slavers' cages for 78 in-game days. Every day I would practice picking the locks until one day my lockpicking was good enough to free myself. Unfortunately, the cages were high up in a tower right in the middle of town. I would have to sneak my way out of the tower and through the small settlement. I needed to train my sneaking skill. So I did. I'd hide in my cage during the day, and I'd hop out and practice ""sneaking"" until I got my skill up a bit. Then, I decided to make my break one evening.

I sneaked out of the tower, but I found myself face to face with an evening patrol. Bam. They sent me right back to the cage. Again, I picked locks. Again, I did some sneaking. Again, I was caught. And right back to the cage. There were other prisoners in the cages alongside me, and we were all wasting away as potential slaves. Who knew what these slavers were going to do with us. They barely even interacted with us. Maybe they planned to use us as meat during a famine. Or would sell us to one of the empires.

But then it hit me - I can unlock these prisoners' cages too. So I did. I waited until evening on the 78th day. I unlocked two prisoners' cages, and they bolted down the stairs of the tower and out into the settlement. There were only a few guards watching over the town, and they gave chase. Now was my chance to sneak out, and I did. But it wasn't over yet. I had to make it somewhere safe, and I had no food, weapons, or clothes. Just a set of rags they were kind enough to give me. 

I unlocked my shackles, so my slave status wouldn't draw attention, and I made it to the nearest town. I was fortunate that these people were treasure hunters (or engineers? they're looking for lost technology, I forget). Anyway, they didn't care who I was, and I was able to find a bed to rest. Stole a little food to eat, and I recovered. 

That was just the beginning, though. And for whatever reason, I was hooked.

Anyway, here are my pros and cons, for simpler digestion:

PROS:

Unique premise
Really enjoy the world building
Really enjoy the setting 
Really enjoy the potential stories and mysteries that can abound
Really enjoy the aesthetic 
Enjoy the difficulty, but (see CONS)
There's a dedicated mod community, and many of the mods are amazing
Strangely addicting

CONS:

Poorly optimized 
No story, really
Difficulty is definitely a hindrance
Reliant upon mods to flesh it out into something greater


I really wish there was more, but there's something special about Kenshi. I put 400+ hours in, and I want to go back to experiment with different starting scenarios or making my own stories.

Anyway, I hope this review was legible. I didn't edit much, as I'm excited to hop into the game, but I felt like sharing my excitement in the form or a review. If any part of this interests you, you should give Kenshi a shot. Especially since a prequel is in development. I'm excited to see where this series goes.

All of this happened in about 13 hours of gameplay, with no story, no quests, just me playing, with my own goals, in a massive world, meeting random characters. I should say that this game is an amalgam of things I dislike: I don't like slower stat based rpgs, I don't like real time strategy, I don't like survival games, and I find apocalypse games such as fallout to have extremely drab and ugly environments. Yet despite being all these things and more rolled into a giant meat taco, kenshi has me utterly captivated in its gameplay. Everything happens in a fairly non scripted open world/sandbox environment where a lot of the fun is simply experiencing and living in the world. 

No game has ever had me so connected to my character (And ironically, there is no given story to your character) as the only way for your character to improve in something is to experience it for themselves, want to get better at fighting? Go fight then. Want to get tougher? Get beat up more and survive. Want to do anything? Keep failing until you get it right. Whatever doesn't kill you will make you stronger and that is how you progress in this game, the high difficulty comes not from the actual enemies in the world (though they are quite tough) but instead knowing what fights you can and cannot take, all of those stat points mean nothing if your character is dead in the wasteland, and this raw feeling of survival gives you such a will to live and a want to grow to be the strongest, no other game has ever come as close to the feeling of intensity for me as kenshi has. 

Steam says I've only played about 13 hours of this game so far but those 13 hours were so special I felt the uncontrollable urge to post a review. While reading the reviews for this game I was highly skeptical of the freedom it claimed to have as I am used to having controlled freedom such as in a bethesda or rockstar open world game; in games like that there is a huge, lush open world to explore but the story or side quests are only happening in one little dot on the map. This is not that, this is a true open world experience with unbridled freedom where you make your own story, interactions and personal experiences. Not that there is no dialogue, there is some written for interactions in towns that are often deadbeat ironic statements that I find extremely hilarious, and depending on the race/gender of characters in your party they have special things to say to each other about places they visit and things they do in passing that can be an informative or comedic reprieve from the desolate and violent wasteland that surrounds them. 

Despite the world of kenshi being very run down and barren from an outside view, the game still feels full of life and action, even though all that surrounds you is an ancient, utterly destroyed world. While I dislike drab environments with little in them where simply walking around makes me want to throw up, kenshis world is so captivating and deeply atmospheric that I've actually come to like the visuals for the most part. About 99% of the music is also amazing. There is one track (Or maybe its some sort of sound effect) that I find incredibly irritating and loud, but other than that outlier; the simple, haunting melodies which sound like exploring a ghost town perfectly match the atmosphere of wandering and surviving a wasteland alien world. I've only spent a few hours in the world of kenshi so far, but its left more of an impression on me than most games I've put a hundred hours into have. I look forward to exploring more of this world in its vastness; until then, see you space cowboy.

Edit: I've played 30 more hours since this review, my opinion has not changed on this game overall, but there is so much more I could say as I've gotten into it. I would buy this game again on a different account just to review it again

Edit 2: I'm closing in on 300 hours as of right now, I've had many playthroughs, I've died, lost limbs, starved, been enslaved. But I've also been rich, been a master smith, destroyed empires, raided towns, waged war, and been the best in the world.

I've been complaining since the late 90's about how games are losing their flavor & are too similar. It's all hack & slash or first person shooter. Same controls. Same goals. Same look. Same feel. No soul. 

Why can't they make a 4x game where you micromanage all your cities to the point that even the economy & peasants matter (Crusader Kings 2), but you ACTUALLY have to mine the materials AND farm the land AND trade for resources - ALL while building your structures with wood, stone, copper, etc. Not just a 1 click battle/build? Why can't this game also make a battle simulator where you need to fight your armies with flanking moves, battlefield commanders that you need to train, veteran units that level up, need gear purchased for them, & tactics like false retreats & pincer movements?

Why can't they make a Diablo 2 game where you add the elements of an entire party, & train & skill up more than a basic tree? Throw in Runescape like training but without the boring tedium of just sitting there watching an axe chop a tree for 598232721 hours? Make the training mean something like when I'm carrying my firewood back to base I'm getting stronger? Ya know.... LOGIC? The shopkeeper KNOWS me because we do good business together? I live in that town. I pay my taxes, etc. 

I've often dreamed of this kind of game. Kenshi isn't EVERYTHING I've ever hoped for but it's damn close. It has most of these elements & more devs need to look at this & make a bigger, more detailed, smoother style version of this game (mods probably help some), so that you actually have a fully immersed real world experience where every action matters & every character you come into contact with lives & dies along with you - remembering your every interaction on a tribal, local, regional, factional, & national scale. Play the political game, go solo, make alliances, become the most hated man alive, take over a town, be a simple farmer, or merchant, whatever it is Kenshi allows you to mostly do that. 

Like I said - it's not perfect - but it's the FIRST game that is similar to a game I would have made myself if I COULD make a game. I hope we make 100 more of these instead of League of Legends, Call of Duty, Halo, Fortnite, Palworld, & other trash.  Gamers born from 1960 to 1995 UNITE!!! WE CAN DO THIS!!!

Pros:
It's not easy.
It's not perfect.
It's got Beep.
No plot, pure sandbox.
It's a one of a kind game ... 4X ULTRA.
Comes with game editor & a workshop full of mods.
Lo-Fi still patching (2024)

Cons:
Bugs.
Rage.
Frustration.
Potential time sink.
Everything wants to eat you or rob you.
Play for over 100 hrs and only then realise you should have been playing in a borderless window to get the right resolution aspect ratio. 

It's not going to be for everyone so watch as much as possible on YT/TW, but if you like playing god until a bigger god or a small red spider crushes your dreams then it could be for you.

For me it's one of the best games on Steam to invest your spare time into.

Must Buy.

If you answered yes to any of these questions, Kenshi is the game for you! Be warned, however, that Kenshi is completely unforgiving and unfair. You will die, you will TPK, and you most definitely will suffer. However, because Kenshi was designed by one man on an outdated game engine, it is exploitable. Exploit the game to gain uber stats, to buy all the engineering research you could possibly need, and to reset shop inventories when you inevitably decide to sell bricks of pure THC in order to fuel your crippling addiction to forcing people to read engineering research for hours on end.

Most importantly, however, ignore everyone who says you're playing the game ""wrong"" or that exploiting fifteen year old bugs is ""not playing the game properly."" Kenshi is an RPG, yes, but like Rimworld it is also a story generator. Every playthrough will be different despite several guaranteed characters being placed in the world, as combat and theft all work on RNG.

Also skeletons are broken, play all skeletons if you want it to take hours to recruit new people. Or just use mods that allow more random skeleton characters to spawn. Or use the recruit prisoners mod to reprogram a certain skeleton army that is just waiting for another skeleton to find them. Or use both. I don't care. Having a company of hardened robot badasses is far more entertaining than being a squishy human and starving because you grew your faction too big too quickly.

Want to become a humble trader? Go right for it. Want to join one of the three major factions and help take down their enemies? Absolutely can. Want to be a solo wanderer, building your own legend and fighting powerful, mythical figures? You can, but you'll struggle to build your strength to start. Want to be a warmongering ruler that brings all to their knees, peeling the skin from their flesh, feeding the corpses of your enemies to the bone dogs and burning their cities to the ground? Go for it.

On top of all of that, there's a large amount of history built into the world. Wondrous sights, eerie locations and chilling sights. It wont be handed onto you on a silver plate though, you'll have to find it for yourself by exploring every inch of the world, digging through ancient ruins. Maybe that skeleton companion you recruited will have a unique insight to a location?

All of that to say that if you're desiring a game that lets you run free within the world that was made for you to play in, absolutely pick it up. At any price.

You will watch the carnage too long, not yet realising that the robots now have one singular goal - to kill you. Eventually you will lead the robots through enough cities and innocent bystanders that they are no longer a threat. You will find crab people that refuse to sell you anything as you are one of the disparaged ""crabless"". Best you purchase a pet crab first then. You will look up from the screen and it is now 4am.

It's not in a perfect state, but it has thousands of hours of amazing playtime to offer if you can overlook some blemishes. I've only explored about 5-10% of the world so far (my Steam playtime is a lie as I've spent about twice as long again playing offline). I have just hit day 100 in-game.

What I've found is that when anything buggy happens with path finding, hit Ctrl+Shift+F11. If that doesn't fix it, save and reload. If one of your squad gets stuck, you can save and load then check the ""Reset squad positions"" checkbox to move everyone to the selected characters position.

I was aiming for an actual post-apocalyptic experience, hence for instance ""Attack Slots x3"". I don't see why starving thugs should wait to fight you one-by-one.

In terms of caveats from this selection of mods, I guess you could Zerg Rush through the game if you built a huge squad as soon as you work out how to recruit prisoners (assuming you could afford to feed them all). Just show restraint with recruitment, especially if you want to go for even more attack slots. More attack slots makes very early game much harder, but once you have enough dudes to vastly outnumber enemy squads, it makes it much easier.

I still haven't figured out how to sell slaves and I haven't needed to (perhaps Bounties Galore! is all you need).

Feedback about my selected Nice Map mod is that it's a bit spoliery seeing region names first play-through. I didn't really pay that much attention to the region names on the map to be honest, but having the roads was very useful. Perhaps disable the map mod until you feel the need for it.

I feel like ""Let's Talk"" made it easier for me to recruit prisoners by ensuring the dialog was always available, but that may have been because I didn't understand how the prisoner dialogue was triggered. The author has published a google sheets document which explains the technique to use on each faction to recruit them.",1706893864,1707046441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However as it stands with the simplicity of simulated economy and faction , the extremely dated  graphics, the horrendous performance and the general shortfalls of what are great mechanics incomplete its just not worth the buying price.

Since I bought this game there was not any other thing i was thinking of. 
Now i breath kenshi, i played more than 800 hours in less than 2 months. I think as if i am one of them, like i am beep (I am dumb in real life but there is only a few shadowed memories of that time i was on the real world). 

This kind of innmersion is what i really really like about this game. This game is unique, it is like founding a diamond nail in a wheat (or wheatstraw I should say, since I am starting to implement the kenshi local language to my normal speak). 

I even started making kenshi food to sustain myself (foodcube its not that disgusting irl). This game changed the way i feel games. I consider this game far more of an especialist game, it is even a masterwork. 
After 4 years of having this game pirated, i decided to bought it since i really knew  where my money was going, i cant wait for the kenshi 2 release, to get los in it's incomprehensible magnitude, to start feeling that feeling only kenshi made me feel, its a mix of nostalgia and hope, of excitement for what's going next.

Newbie Advice: So after several attempts and three retries I figured out the best way to play is to roam first then build your base. Strengthen a small crew and build their stats, and choose your location wisely. Different areas offer different factions coming to your base and demanding something. The easiest starting location would be next to the hub and away from holy nation. So far only bandits come to my base which are easier to deal with. Next thing you want to do is to make sure you start farming asap, esp cactus and wheat, so you can make food. Food is such a huge constant in the game, even the bandits who come to your base try to steal it. Attack animals who roam to your base and take their meat. You can cook uncooked meat in a camp fire or cook station, camp fires cost nothing to build.

Other tidbits: Bugs aren't affected by acid rain or acid water but will be attacked on site by the holy nation if they roam close to their territory. Every race has some interesting flaws and perks. I honestly think the bugs are the best race as far as perks go. The slave route is the best way to get early and easy stats. Robots require no food, but they steadily lose health stats even after repair. You might have to replace limbs at some point if they get too weak.",1594622048,1706965679,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You really do make your own story and the world its set in needs books written about it. Everything feels so alive and like you're just one small cog. 
I haven't even used my sword yet and my character doesn't even know how to.

It has Dune vibes but I wouldn't say it really hits that mark all the way.

EDIT: 800 hours later... Now I am playing Star Wars, last week I modded it into Warhammer with the FCS and a couple mods. Game is the ultimate sandbox game. You can't really get ""bored"" but burn out comes and goes. Kenshi is my choice for ""If you had to pick one game as the only game you could every play"", even if the base game gets boring I can use blander, paint. net and the FCS to making and overhaul the game into whatever I can dream of. I have made factions and quest lines and stupid companions with insane dialog. This game is a masterpiece and  even with it's limitations stands out from the crowned in the modern gaming world. There is no other game like Kenshi.",1602113443,1706896038,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Very rough around the edges, but with mods I've wasted 500+ hours of life on it....Really should not have said that out loud about a single player game, but for real it is an amazing world, concept and simply needs patches, co-op, side quests to flesh out SOME people in the wastelands and of course, more consistent AI logic. They can get angry for no reason or sometimes just KNOW you did something naughty. That means you die.

Skip base building (needs work), instead explore! Lots of weird places to visit and enemies to die from (Elden Ring ain't got nothing on the Hungry Bandits)

Also, a co-op mode would be super appreciated. Seriously, even playing with 2-4 people would transform this experience, as well as actual side quests. I know the game is supposed to be about survival, but not having any direction other than survival is disorienting and, to me, not very motivating =(

Kenshi is a harsh and brutal world, and your characters are far from special. Hell, most of them start off so far below average that the first few hours involve a LOT of running from malnourished paraplegic bandits because they WILL mess you up.

It's not like Dark Souls in the sense that you can't lose. You can (and probably will) enjoy a lot of total party wipes at the start. But it is VERY Dark Souls in the sense that the only real way to lose is to give up. If you persevere, your characters can come back from almost any setback. And there are plenty of setbacks; Starving bandits, Cannibals, colossal monsters, unreasonably bloodthirsty goats, famine, loss of limb, slavers, fanatical religious bigots, lethal remnants of fallen empires and more are out there to find.

The world is huge and varied, although arid deserts do tend to dominate the continent. Finding a regular source of food that's also safe is a challenge, as the lush biomes are filled with dangerous creatures too. AAt the start you'll want to stick close to the big towns for protection, and you can make easy money scavenging the corpses of bandits that tried their luck against armed guards. Maybe buy and renovate house there, turn it into a little base, and you can upgrade it with research and crafting benches, beds to heal in, maybe a shop counter to sell loot.

At some point though the cities will become suffocating, and you'll want to establish your own. There is plenty of desolate unpopulated land out there, each biome with unique bounties and hazards. Build walls, mount defensive crossbows on the gates, expand your capabilities with advanced buildings, farmlands, refineries, even sophisticated electronics (some of those fallen empires were VERY advanced) Enjoy visiting traders selling you all kinds of cool stuff (and buying yours), repel attacks, fix up and imprison the survivors and tempt them to join your cause. Develop some of your people into master smiths and outfit your best fighters with weapons and armour you might never see on sale in the cities.

Your group can become a world-changing force, with patience and calculated risk. Maybe you'll topple all the factions that endorse slavery? Or finally break the cannibal hordes threatening all societies? Or become the ruling tyrant of your own fearsome empire? To say Kenshi is open-ended isn't really doing justice to the scale and breadths your ambitions can reach.

So yeah, extremely positive recommendation, with the caveats that it is difficult, unforgiving, and a bit janky. It's an astounding game and deserves your attention.",1706638141,1706638141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kenshi to be straight, is no Palworld, its poorly optimized, laughably ugly, and full of odd holes in the lore and flavor of the game despite there barely being any to begin with.  Polished is not the word Id use when talking about Kenshi and the loading times and graphical issues in the game can be brutal. 

All that being said, my only recommendation to avoid Kenshi is if you value your time at all. Losing entire days to this game has been a bad habit I've been needing to break. So let's talk about all of the things Kenshi does superbly

- Very few to almost zero bad bugs, many hilarious good bugs.
This game works, in 90 hours almost nothing has broken my save despite an odd city failing to populate correctly like once, and this is easily fixed with a simple import. On the other hand, this game is notorious for its exploits, most of which the developer almost certainly has left in on purpose, such as rinsing stolen tags with an Item furnace, or the various nonsensical ways of power training most stats. Kenshi is one of the few games the average player exploits as if its a core gameplay feature and doesnt feel even a shred of guilt due to how grindy and difficult the game is otherwise.  I would go as far to say that I actually feel a sense of accomplishment after exploiting this game, because most exploits require a ton of setup to even pull off.

- Incredible world design, getting lost in the huge variety of the games zones, insanely conflicted in which region I want to develop my base in. The game has over 20 zones and I find myself wanting to build a base in all of them. Sure I could just build a base in the ideal places like Shem or the Border Zone, but Im oddly fond of building a base in places that no sane player would try to build.   The Swamp? Between the worst load times in the game and those absolutely diabolical, devilish, fiendish abominations known as Blood Spiders as well as the crop eating Swamp Raptors,  you have to have the patience of a saint to build your base here. But alas, The Swamp has not only access to some of the best Hemp farming in the game and a great base for a Hashish drug operation, but you have some of the most fun world interactions of any region with the ""Gang Wars"" setup of the Swamp and the fact that you can enlist the massive Hounds gang as your own secondary fighting force for your base to help defend against raids.   Verge? The sky shoots beams of fire at all your non skeleton characters, so naturally, an all Skeleton base it is! The upshoot? Literally no raids will ever attack you in Verge because no bandits are insane enough to go there.

I could yammer on more for hours, but ultimately this is one of the most truly unique and wonderful experiences Ive had as a gamer of 25 years, and I can't wait for the 2nd edition with a bigger budget.

The game's vast open world and unforgiving nature make every decision matter. The freedom to shape your own group of nobodies, that get eaten on the first playthrough, from building a massive outpost to leading a band of busty shek lady warriors, is fantastic. 

Kenshi's depth lies in its complexity – the learning curve is steep, but once you figure out the crafting and bounties system everything clicks into place! The dynamic world, filled with diverse factions and ever-evolving events, keeps each playthrough feeling fresh and unpredictable.

While the graphics may not be cutting-edge in the vanilla Kenshi, mods and ReShades fixes up the limitations OGRE engine.  AND THE ATMOSPHERE.....omg.. The game's soundtrack complements the desolate beauty of the landscapes, enhancing the overall experience.

Combat is both brutal and tactical, requiring thinking.. The constant threat of roaming bands of Reavers and Crabs and so on will leave you on the edge of the seat, and never leave your squad travelling on 3x speed unattended. The sense of accomplishment in overcoming challenges is very satisfying.

Kenshi isn't for everyone, especially those seeking hand-holding or a linear narrative, because Kenshi doesn't have a story, the story is yours to make. And if the idea of carving your own path in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world sound like your jam, go for it.. 

Kenshi stands as a testament to the potential of indie game development and dreams of Chris Hunt. It's not just a game, it's an adventure that leaves a lasting impression long after the 450-hour mark.

I have issues with CTD with Kenshi.  Sometimes I can barely get the game to run, others it will be solid for hours.  Mods or no mods it makes no difference.  I stay on current drivers for the ARC drivers seem to have issues with DX11.

Two biggest of the fixes have been to enable virtual memory for the drive that has Kenshi installed.  It shouldn't matter, but it seems to.  It also slowed load times. :( Relocating the install folder to a SSD helped with the load times.  The other is to find the steam article on Kenshi mod load order and follow it.

Even with all of the issues that I have had, I have still racked up nearly 250 hours, of play time, in a month. I'm not sure that I could fully tell you why though.  I enjoy the relative freedom, the early game struggle, and the ability to automate some of the more onerous tasks.

i would recommend anyone to give this game a chance cause it can be hard to play and might be difficult when you get killed so many times and discouraging when you buy 5 recruits but then they all die........ but it feels really rewarding when you can finally beat those enemies but then harder enemies destroy you.............................. hahahahaha anyways its an amazing game and deserves more recognition.

It's been a while since I have played, but sometimes I still think back to this strange world. A ruined continent on some forgotten dustball spinning around a distant star. The shattered remnants of an ancient empire imploded by its own transgression of all technological and ethical bounds. Bizarre alien beasts and sentient hiveminds sharing this hostile landscape with who can only be described as descendants of human colonists as well as certain species which share uncanny resemblance to earthling fauna, though perhaps altered long ago by twists of natural selection or mad science. It is eerily beautiful. Or is it beautifully eerie?

The gameplay is distinct as well. There are several unique starting positions for a new 'campaign.' You can play as any of the sentient races of this world, with several clans or classes within each to choose from, each with their own inherent strengths and weaknesses. You can begin as a naked one-armed beggar or as a magical-sword-wielding warrior hunted by cultist zealots. You can be an immortal robot, or an exiled hive drone. You can control a group of characters of different races. It is an exploration-survival game. Your character(s) can get hungry, they need to rest or repair when they get injured. You can get melted by acid rain, eaten alive by bloodsucking spiders, or robbed and left for dead by ninjas. You can even lose your limbs, cursed to crawl the dunes on your belly, or wield only one-handed weapons, but perseverance in spelunking some sunken ruins can reward you with cybernetic legs that will carry you faster than any enemy, or arms that will enable you to wield the most powerful weapons without impediment.

Yet there are still pockets of civilization. Villages, towns and cities you can crawl back to if you can stop the bleeding and keep from starving, where you can purchase cheap prosthetics and a loaf of bread. The locals will pay for a job well done, and the soldiers will remember your face if you help them in battle, or get caught doing wrong. Most of these societies practice some form of caste system and/or legal slavery. Some of them strongly dislike outsiders, to the point where the locals will insult or harass you or your party, and in extreme cases their soldiers will attack on sight, beating you unconscious and enslaving you, or just outright killing you. In the most 'liberal' cities, the soldiers will arrest and enslave you if you don't have enough money to prove that you are not a beggar. To reach the free towns where no tyrant dare send his minions, you must outrun deadly beasts and death machines, fend off slaver gangs and cannibal hordes, climb lonely peaks and seek hidden valleys. Yet even among these far-flung outposts, a name carries weight. Offend a faction badly enough, and they will hunt you forever.

You will meet many potential friends along your journey, who may at first appear as fiends or foes, to recruit for your own party. You can roam from town to town as a mercenary band, or you can settle down and establish a base of operations. You can even build your own village out in the wastes and set dozens of characters to work. Become self-sufficient and venture out across the jagged plains, the acid swamps, and the ashen wastes to uncover pieces of powerful technology lost over thousands of years of environmental chaos and civil war.

Tame a pack of wild dogs and maybe a herd of goats. Smuggle drugs and bootleg liquor. Free the slaves and befriend the insane. Assemble a robot army, or raise a band of warrior priests. Murder everyone, burn every village, and stamp out the light of civilization. If it pleases you.

With hundreds of hours invested, I find myself continually drawn back into its vast, unforgiving landscape, and the allure of the unknown never ceases to captivate me.

One of Kenshi's crowning achievements lies in its unparalleled depth and complexity. In a gaming industry saturated with generic titles, Kenshi emerges as a breath of fresh air with its unique and original concept. The game seamlessly blends elements of survival, strategy, and RPG, offering a gaming experience that is both challenging and immensely rewarding.

What truly sets Kenshi apart is the absolute freedom it grants to players. In this expansive sandbox, the choices are yours to make, and the consequences are yours to bear. Whether you choose the path of a trader, a slaver, a hunter, or something entirely different, Kenshi accommodates your ambitions. The open-ended nature of the game allows for boundless creativity, turning each playthrough into a personal saga of triumphs and tribulations.

The world of Kenshi is not just a backdrop; it's a character in itself. The harsh, post-apocalyptic landscape is rife with danger and opportunity. The ever-present threat of hostile factions, the diverse array of wildlife, and the dynamic weather system contribute to an immersive experience that keeps you on your toes. The depth of lore and the intricacies of the game world add layers of intrigue, making every discovery a moment to savor.


In conclusion, Kenshi is not merely a game; it's a masterpiece of player agency, offering a canvas for your unique story to unfold. If you seek a game that challenges your strategic prowess, rewards creativity, and immerses you in a world where every decision matters, Kenshi is an absolute must-play. Embrace the freedom, chart your own destiny, and discover why Kenshi remains a paragon of open-world excellence.",1705850634,1705850742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead of holding your hand Kenshi slaps it away, stabs you with a rusty wakizashi and throws you to the wolves - or sometimes to cannibals. Yet despite all the clunkiness, my all-time favourite game with incomparable emergent storytelling, screenshot-worthy sceneries and some of the best gameplay I have ever experienced (for newcomers, [F1] shows gameplay tips!). The modding community has done an amazing job expanding the gameplay and lore - and sometimes just joking around. 

Starting options are widely customizable (+mods) but usually you begin as just a weak nobody who gets thrashed by a single starved thug or a random baby goat. Beaten by slavers and spending the rest of your days labouring in chains may even be preferable to getting literally ripped to pieces and eaten by the more horrifying local fauna. Not that the game cares, sandbox world just keeps going even when all that is left of you and your potential friends is a pair of sandals, slowly buried into the sand. 

Kenshi's philosophy is that doing something will make you better at it. Obviously crafting, sneaking and such work this way but also taking punches only improves by getting hit, bonus EXP if you are already coughing blood and missing an arm. Learning to fight efficiently is a constant struggle of seeking battles you can win just barely - and then survive long enough to recover and try again. As long as you live, limbs can be replaced in an inventory screen much like other equipment and every battle will make you stronger, but it truly is pitiful for a mighty warrior to collapse in acidic rain out of hunger or bloodloss, having spent all the food and bandages despite hauling a backpack full of lost technology valuable enough to buy a city. Quicksave is a lifesaver, especially when your characters get stuck in terrain. 

[b]Story[/b] is a vague concept as the world is vast and there is no main quest. Explore at your own risk, talk to people (also at your own risk) and always stay alert. There is an immense amount of interactions, dialogue and quests but they all need to be found - and sometimes even getting near them is simply too dangerous before training just for that purpose. Find or buy some muscle, though you may need to train and equip them as well. [i]""Go on new recruit, get your legs torn off by that little spider so I can slap these faster robot legs on you!"".[/i] Many wondrous sights await and I will not spoil them, just be ready to run away when needed. 

[b]Combat[/b] is kind of turn-based and in vanilla game, only one entity can melee attack another at one time leading to either a hit, a miss or a blocked attack. But the time windows before another entity can attack are short indeed and outnumbered side needs serious skill superiority to win. This formula is skewed by hitting someone ""by accident"" as even fists have enough range to hit even three targets at once, where your intended target may defend itself but the two accidentals can't - though they may also have attacks queued at you. This creates some incredibly frustrating situations when a big enemy bodies 5 of your best warriors due to poor positioning. And sometimes your last man standing manages to swing an absolute homerun and chop multiple enemies down by sending their legs flying, saving your entire party. And then there are rather overpowered crossbows that don't care about your silly attack rules and just headshot you in the middle of a duel. Hilariously becoming better at not hitting your friends in the back gets easier only when shooting them by ""accident"". Luckily/unfortunately it is completely random what body part each attack hits. 

[b]Base-building[/b] is at minimum a campfire and a bedroll, at most a completely self-sufficient farm/factory fortress capable of creating the best meals, armour and machinery known to the continent. Also awesome weapons, though you can never surpass the legendary Meitous made by Cross and scattered across the factions. Starting a permanent base of your own is bound to get noticed, so be ready for a fight or serious bribery. Some weirdos even attack you just to have a good scrap. 

[b]Visuals[/b] are both ugly and beautiful: Animations look clunky but sometimes sync wonderfully, and the weapons hitting hard really feel like they hurt (my personal record is scattering 6 limbs high into the air in one swing of a plank). Textures are definitely dated and unsightly. But the scenery and especially night skybox are often so gorgerous my wandering party has a lunch break while I am busy taking screenshots. And then I take more screenshots as they do everything they can to survive another unfair mess I just got them into.",1705823298,1705823298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can adventure solo, recruit a small army of playable characters, be a stealthy assassin or a heavily-armored samurai, build your own small city or be always on the move. You can take on hordes of cannibals, go bounty hunting or just rob people in the street, get captured into slavery and find a way out,  and depopulate entire cities if you are strong enough. Be a human, robot or a stick-alien person. There is no magic or skill system besides basic stats that affect stealing, blacksmithing rate and quality, farming, cooking, strength, speed, toughness and so on.

The game has deep steamy jungles, sand dune deserts, rocky wastelands, outlaw swamp cities, ninja fortresses, high-tech bunkers, beautiful temperate landscapes and so much to see. The game ""doesn't care about you"" and you are not the chosen one. You can easily get beaten by starving bandits and left bleeding on the side of the road for days to either die slowly or become a slave. You'll have to choose battles wisely and you may want to hire a sidekick early on to hide nearby and carry your broken body to safety. On the flipside your character gets tougher by just getting beaten, so if you can deal with being crushed into the dust a few times, you'll eventually be a force to be reckoned with.

There is some tedium in the game if you have a lot of characters at once, it is not fun to build a camp and make sure each person rests to recover the health after a bloody battle. The recovery is very slow and tedious to manage one by one. The experience also goes up very slowly. If you don't have much time to play, you can get mods that increase healing rate and experience rate which makes the game more fun. Also it helps to have a smaller gang to alleviate the tedium of managing beds and orders.

The base building is fairly involved and you'll need to get research books, build defenses, build a power source, mine resources and farm. You can assign in job priorities so people automatically work, including having them opportunistically get meat and skins from animals your guards have killed.

There's a lot to explore and do, but you have to make your own fun in a way. It's somewhat of a sandbox type of game that feels a little empty if you're used to games telling you what to do all the time.

Sometimes the AI (for the characters I'm in control of) frustrates me beyond belief. Sometimes pathing is unpredictable. Some things are frustrating due to design flaws.

The basic concept of the game is that it's the best f****** I've ever f****** played. It's beautifully combined top down strategy themes like resource farming and city building with RPG elements that make you feel your character is a real person with a real effect on the world. I mean it's just absolutely incredible. You can just train a few people in your party and become almost anything you want. You can run a base out of a city in one of the many amazingly written NPC factions, or you can build your own settlement and run your own resources and defense.

Everything has its consequences. If you build within the safe borders of a great nation, they may come make you pay taxes or ask for food tribute. But if you build in the wastes then bandits may come get you. There aren't just universal bandits either. Every place has its own factions with their own incredibly well written interests. You feel like you're in a genuinely living world when you play Kenshi. You can change the political landscape, or discover storylines that feel absolutely ancient. The lore and history make you feel like this is a real place, and you're a real person living within it. The living world affects you, and you affect it.

I mean seriously, my f****** god it's the most incredible game I've ever seen. It's literally a kind of game I've been fantasizing about for YEARS. So many games tried, but Kenshi actually did it. It's like open world, fully completely open world, but once you get a feel for it there are also storylines you can get involved in. Unlike bethesda games (which I love), it doesn't feel like anything you do is a meaningless story. It's not like you go help some inkeeper kill the biggest rat that respawns later. You go capture the leader of the region's bandits, and then less of those bandits spawn. You take down the leader of a major faction, and the other factions take over those cities.

I could go on forever. But get Kenshi. You'll be frustrated by some of the unpolished stuff. It can also be super hard, but if that puts you off look up some walkthrough stuff.

Kenshi can be very brutal, especially starting out. It never holds back and as you encounter new activity, it explains itself and that activity via pop-up messages, but then leaves you alone to discover the world of Kenshi and the many ways to survive and thrive within it's world.

Kenshi is a true sandbox survival experience, where you decide what your goals are and how you wish to confront the post- apocalyptic Kenshi world.

Have fun, explore, survive it's challenges, and thrive in it's world.

I've now compiled a 99-mod collection that I thoroughly enjoy playing. With the help of a Kenshi mod manager tool created by members of the Kenshi modding community, fans of the world of Kenshi can safely configure their mod list order fairly confidently now. Plus, with the use of the Re-Shade software, can have an amazing graphics experience within game.

There is a learning curve, which is mostly learning how to not starve to deathat the start and how to avoid death that is around every corner.  Once you get the hang of the game it becomes more easier to keep alive.  Got to love a game that rewards getting beat up by thimngs in the world as leveling your toughness,  where losing limbs gives you a chance to add an upgrade for the limb.   Nothing like throwing your pack animal on your shoulder and running across the desert,  being chase by bandits to level your toughness and strength, where you can feign death, to avoid further damage, just make sure they aren't carnivorous animals or canibals though.

I also found exported characters into a new game closing out and loading an old save seem to fix minor issues.

The play style you must except: Some of you most important skills come from running from battles and getting knocked out over and over again. if you keep that in mind you will enjoy the game.

I first saw this game when it first came out in early access it never really stuck with me from all the videos I watched I thought it was a indie dragons age or something like that so never invested and boy did it pay off.

So much to do and so much to explore 100 hours and I still haven't gone to any of the far reaches yet was just kind of experimenting with what I can and cannot do and this is rare for me atleast but it's one of the few games I don't mind playing without mods which is insane in my mind.

I would recommend playing without mods for the first sessions.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Even though this game is pretty old it is still super addictive and fun. There seems to be always something to do weather it's fighting other factions, building up your squad(s), or navigating and exploring the world, the possibilities are endless. Now there are things I would like to see in the sequel that would make the game in my opinion better. (This only concerning base game, I am not talking about any mods that can be added to the game)

THINGS I WOULD ADD/CHANGE
1. the ability to dual wield weapons
  - Now this is a minute detail but I think it is weird that I am able to equip a character with two weapons as their primary weapon but they don't duel wield. I would suggest that if a stat like martial art or something is high enough you should be able to dual wield.

2. Giving us the ability to name buildings/have signs
  - When I walk in town in the world of Kenshi I see that different buildings are labeled bars, armory, general shop, and police stations. However us as the player are not able to do that(as far as I know), which I feel we should be able to be able to. We are able to label our town / city why not buildings too. this would make organizing a lot easier and we would be able to distinguish what building is for what like having a building to just make weapons, another for Armour, robotics, a general shop just to sell things.

3. A better way to sell goods
  - I love how in this game we are able to sell goods, but I see it is not a reliable source of income to me. Now it could just be how I am playing the game but people don't really buy things consistently. the only thing that consistently sells it's grog, but thing like Armour, weapons, robotics barely sell. I think it would be good Idea to get a list of who roams your city and what they are looking for to maximize profits
4. AI cores easier to find
  - Now don't get me wrong I am not trying to make this game to easy but I feel like there should more reliable/guaranteed places for these things to spawn. I hate going to a ruin and seeing that it's empty and basically wasting my time. I get not making to obvious but there should some sort of pattern or scheme. (Maybe there is but I haven't realized it yet)
5. Easier way to ally with factions or turn in bounties.
  - for this one I just suggest a quest system or once you find some one of not they tell you where to turn them in. I think the way bounties work now in Kenshi is kind of confusing and hard to find the these people.
6. More hairstyles please.
  -I get this game was put out a long time ago but for the next game new hair styles would be dope. can we at least get the generic Afro lol.
7. dog/goat back packs. 
  - I just find it dumb that they have back pack slots but can't give them back packs. (I know there is a mod for this but would like in the main game)
Overall this is a great game and definitely worth the money. glad that this was the game to truly start my PC experience.",1704688763,1704688877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
233860,155528780,76561197998908791,0,9,2092,0,2092,1704254357,"This game is definitely interesting. If you've read other reviews and you're excited, do yourself a favor and try it; you'll probably like it or at least have a memorable experience. However, if you're on the fence, here's some reasons why you might want to play something else:

- It seems like the most effective way to make money in the game is to get aggro from one of the bandit/slaver factions, then lead them to a town and have the guards beat them up so you can loot the bodies. This is both not that fun and also not that realistic.
- While being able to survive a fight is cute at first, in practice it means there's often not any consequence for losing a fight. Either you die / get enslaved and load an old save file or you take a bunch of damage and then wait a while for your people to heal.
- There's a lot of waiting in the game. Waiting to heal. Waiting to walk to your destination. Waiting for your crops to grow.
- There are some pretty bad bugs in the game. I one time walked into a town and it was completely empty of NPCs. I've also had land ownership carry over between save files of completely different characters. 
- There's very little in the way of unique dialogue like a classic CRPG and it makes the world feel very robotic.
- If you do try base building, prepare for an onslaught of raids constantly interrupting what you are doing and forcing you to wait several minutes as your only engineer recovers in bed.

If you're looking for an open ended RPG with several distinct regions and cultures and an emphasis on survival and looting, try Outward instead.
If you're looking for a base building game where you have to fend off enemy raids and avoid starvation, consider Rimworld instead.",1704683691,1704683691,False,1,0,0.475763022899627686,0,True,False,False

Started my journey as nobody with rags. Looted ruins for some money doing many runs to and from to sell scraps for money. I stole from shops and accumulated a squad.

We made a small farming outpost and we're doing well selling our produce while I sent a thief to towns stealing (often getting caught at the start). Unfortunately, the holy nation didn't like the amount of women and other nationalities at our outpost and declared war on us. We barely made it out, but had accumulated some wealth at the outpost.

We moved into the swamp and built a fortress with six mounted turrets. We have been defending against three waves of raptors every harvest cycle. Waves of spiders and bandit attacks. 

We have missing limbs, walls that need to be repaired, and we are all dying of starvation. 43hrs well spent struggling to find a home and survive.

This game is very difficult. Will play again!

Oh yes. And all of it the glorious expression of a mind that maximised the 
computing capabilities of a period many years ago and so far beyond 
the sum of its parts that it has still today few real peers in its genre.

""Kenshi for PC is an incredible game that throws you into a post-apocalyptic world filled with endless possibilities. You can explore ruins, build empires, and forge your path in a way that's entirely your own.

The mods for Kenshi are a blast, adding tons of fun and new elements to the game. But I'll admit, finding and managing mods can be a bit of a hassle. The community's creativity is awesome, but the organization of mods could use some improvement.

Despite that, Kenshi is a must-play. Its freedom and depth, combined with the modding scene's offerings, create an unforgettable gaming experience that'll keep you hooked for hours.""",1703734003,1704394638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I looked at it initially years ago and thought that it looked like an MMO, never bothering to properly check what the game was - rather just assuming I wouldn't like it.

It's one of the few games out there where every mechanic you see in the world can be replicated. Cities that are established can be taken over by you but not in the way where 'hur dur I do 5 quests and the city is mine' but in the sense of you have to have manually recruited and trained up an army large enough to do it. The training aspect? You have to get beaten to near death to increase strength, it is phemomemal lmao. Highly recommend watching a playthrough just to see the levels of mechanics and systems involved because there's a reason it's compared to Dark Souls levels of unfair and its so addictive.

It's the most raw 'do what you want but you aren't special' type of game that I've ever played. You're not the dragonborn, you've been afforded nothing. You start from zero and that aspect of the game made me enjoy it massively because its Skyrim's magic of exploring a Souls-like world with that level of difficulty involved without having ANYTHING handed to you because 'you're the chosen one' - you are no one.

Other games have covered many of the core gameplay mechanics, but never quite in this combination, or with this kind of execution. The roaming nutjobs that will chase you and scream nonsense at you remind me of borderlands. The nuclear wasteland / cyberpunk vibe is reminiscent of the fallout games. The combat resembles the top down dungeon crawlers such as diablo or torchlight, albeit without any instancing or map changing (though there are frequent loading bars as the game will pull assets as you travel). The variance in skill and progression reminds me of the elder scrolls games - usage increases competency. But the way in which these systems and world building interact with each other makes this quite unique. 

Lo-Fi games nailed the tone - The world feels desolate. Starving bandits are skinny, and if you get knocked out they will steal food from you. Much of the world looks like it was cobbled together from trash out of necessity. Dangerous creatures look menacing and deadly. There are a variety of 'biomes' with different environmental effects that make me feel like I live on a planet which has suffered - and often morals go flying out of the window. I should feel sorry for the starving bandits,  but I don't. I'm too busy worrying about where my next meal will come from, or avoiding that group of cannibals to care about if they will collapse from starvation on my next town cycle. 

Levelling feels organic as difficulty ramps up and you take on more challenging foes, but will brutally punish you if you wander into a lethal area under-equipped or unprepared. That said, as long as you don't outright die then most situations can be recovered from - even the loss of a limb can be offset with robotics, and this can even be beneficial if you are able to acquire a masterwork limb and maintain it with the pricey repair kits. 

There is a tutorial (of sorts) that will explain the UI, menus and some basic mechanics to get you started, but this game will not do any hand-holding for you. While the learning curve is fairly steep (especially given the complexity of this game), and you will likely be incapacitated, incarcerated, mutilated and/or murdered working out what you can and can't do, you won't ever be pestered to go here or do that before you can make progress. This offers a great deal of freedom to get started -Want to be a trader? perfectly possible - get started with a bit of mining, sell to the local store, buy a pack mule and start your trading empire. Want to lead a squad of crack martial artists? hire some bodies in the local towns and pick off the bandits, work up to bounties, and crack some skulls. Want to start a homestead? build a base, put up walls and defensive turrets, and start manufacturing the things you will need to survive. Want to be night-prowler and rob the place blind? sneak around at night, and empty the shelves of all their goodies. Sneak to the next town over, and sell them at a profit. Oh, then steal back the thing you originally stole, for good measure.

I had a rough start, but once I hit Squin and bought a house, making money and training was easier. Just stole armour and weapons, deposited them into containers to remove stolen status, then sold them back. Kinda broken, but fun.
I do recommend the game, but also it lacks a lot of features I'm used to, so it can be pretty frustrating in places.

Game doesn't appear to have a compare items option, so you have to manually sift through armour and weapons to see which is better. Character customisation doesn't give you much freedom, and I primarily love building, however building an outpost early on gets you raided and murdered on the regular, so you're kind of bottlenecked into being badass before you start playing with all the games features.

I didn't enjoy it in the beginning and was considering refunding it, but when you find cash and training loopholes affording everything is easier, and stealing is literally a necessity if you want to get anywhere.

The immense freedom game provides is similar to Morrowing (2004). I usually benchmark the taste of freedom & RPG elements of a game to that experience. 

It has gathered all the build / craft dynamics of modern Open World Survivors (i.e. Rust, Minecraft, Valheim). I should not say all, as the build/craft system is only one segment of the game and it serves the overall purpose - which is the freedom to explore and exploit the world as you see fit.

In my first run I started out as Kefir Bey - a local nobody. I established a manufacturing outpost in the safe lands of the Holy Kingdom. Even though not much of a believer the fear of God puts middle class at its pace and it provides security - which is very much needed for industrial activity. Eventually I managed to create a weapons & armour manufacturing operations and created sales channels for my industrial output with the  capital of Holy Nations - Blistering Hill.

For the next 100 hour game play my goals are to automate the existing sales channel & turn it into a full trading route with safe access for caravans. Once this trade route is setup I would like to invest in a new asset where I can train ""Blades of Kefir"" - a covert group whose aim is to infiltrate, sabotage & run intelligence operations throughout the known world.

The game's design story is also fascinating. Yet another single developer with no background in nothing creates something that would take a game design team with Million Dollars of budget to fail. Congratulations to Chris Hunt - whoever he is.

One last thing about game engines; Kenshi was designed & devleoped within Ogre. Which was one of the earliest 3D game engines available to open source back in 2000s. 

Kenshi 2 converted to Unreal Engine. This would bring in much higher visual quality & I exciting about it.

The game's seemingly endless landscape fails to reflect the diversity of cultures and identities that make our world so rich and fascinating.

From the characters to the factions, Kenshi falls short in representing a wide spectrum of backgrounds and experiences. The inhabitants of this post-apocalyptic realm feel like mere variations of the same template, leaving much to be desired in terms of cultural depth and authenticity. It's a missed opportunity to create a truly immersive experience that showcases the resilience and diversity of humanity in the face of adversity.

Furthermore, the game's narrative seems to ignore the stories of marginalized groups, relegating them to the sidelines or erasing them altogether. In a gaming industry that is increasingly recognizing the importance of diverse storytelling, Kenshi's failure to embrace this shift is both disappointing and out of touch.

While the harsh desert landscape may be a central theme in Kenshi, it shouldn't serve as an excuse for the game's lack of inclusion.

There is literally no direction given to you in this game, no explanations about the world, and certainly no handholding on the gameplay. Basically, you showed up. Now what? So go answer that.

Should also be noted that the community is awesome when it comes to mods, guides, and general advice. 

Downsides?- The game can feel a little empty without mods to fill in the gaps (this is negated by the modding community and all it's glory). The game can be a time sink if your goal is along the lines of ""build a maxed out base"" or ""have my character be the strongest combat-wise in the game"".

You will find good and evil characters, you have to make tough moral decisions at times.  I don't mean scripted ones, I mean decisions that just arise from living in the world. It runs beautifully once it's tweaked, even with mods. I've done a lot of real exploring, pathfinding, and looking out for people in the desert, and this game sort of captures the feeling of scouting your way and keeping an eye out.  I'll be coming back to Kenshi for years, this is bound to be a classic game that will stand the test of years.  I never care about game lore, but the lore here is great.

There really isn't much going on. Some simple building, resources gathering, and very rudimentary combat and farming. The rest is exploration where you just find the same sorts of things with different skins and dialogue.

The barren landscape looks like a super VGA game from the early 2000's but that's not the problem. The issue to me is that the features of the landscape don't contain anything exciting. For instance, I found I giant tree as big as a house. It was replete with nooks and crevaces big enough for three men to walk abreast. Except the game doesn't  let you enter them. 

Most of the landscape is like this; vast expanses of hills and vines and trees but nothing else. Everytime I found a spot on the map that looked interesting was just met with disappointment when I arrived. It's one big featureless canvass painted to look like it's alive. For instance, building on top of a cliff or on an island gave no strategic advantage over building a fort in the middle.of a plain.

There is a very small number of different creatures roaming around as well...maybe just a handful. Everything just roams around in packs either ignoring each other or attacking one another. Ad nauseum.

Leveling your characters up consists of getting beaten up by roving bands of people and creature. You literally cannot get tougher without getting beat on by enemies. The game sends enemies to your location no matter how well hidden you are as well because it is scripted this way and on a timer. They destroy your walls, break down your doors and knock out/kill all of your folks. The only way to survive consistently is to send one coward to run off into the hills to return when everyone is bleeding out to revive them.

I ready wanted to like this game but I don't. The people posting these elaborate stories must have some really good imaginations.

170+ hours later: I had to go to Nexus mods, do a massive graphical overhaul and manually inject all sorts of plugins and shaders and stuff to make this game palatable. It looked 300% better after I got done with it. After this I slapped on about 50 Workshop mods and had a playable game. I enjoyed my time after this; but I am still leaving my review negative because nobody should have to do all this work (and yes, the Nexus mods were hours or work and fiddling) to enjoy a game they paid for.",1566515161,1703998196,False,27,7,0.500425279140472412,0,True,False,False

Kenshi took me by surprise in the best way.  I had it in my library for a while, and for whatever random reason decided to give it a spin and see what it was about.  And man was I blown away.

Have you ever watched Road Warrior, or Fury Road, and thought to yourself ""fuck I wanna be a raider, damn they're awesome""?  Do you like The Sims?  Did it piss you off a bit that Fallout 4 just doesn't let you be a baby stomping raider badass?  The blasted moon of Kenshi has your opportunity.  

In Kenshi, you take the role of a random person plopped down with barely anything and made to find their place. While there are different starting options, they're more mechanistic than narrative; how you got here doesn't really matter, what matters is you're here, now, with whatever you've got on you.  Your character will get better at things by doing them, similar to old TES games, so you set yourself a goal, get to it, and then leverage your newfound power to get to the next thing.  What ""the next thing"" is, exactly, is where this game becomes profoundly interesting.

You're free to be what you want.  Wander the desert, become a master swordsman, or, get some friends and go adventuring together.  Keep gathering friends and you can scale up, to a labor group, a caravan, or go even further and build out a settlement.  Once you do, that settlement operates like any other in the game.  Traders will visit you; bandits will attack you.  The other factions will gradually become aware and launch their own operations for/against you.  You can keep scaling up, going from an outpost, to a fort, to a fully self-sufficient city, if you want.  At any time, you could gather all your people, grab the important stuff and abandon the place, possibly making it open for a new group to take over and  operate.

The beauty of Kenshi is that its world turns with or without you.  Factions will war and change, your position in society can climb or fall wildly, different groups have different priorities.  The world is old and a lot has happened.  The world is populated with who remains after an apocalyptic cataclysm, *and* with some who lived through it.  Kenshi presents not just a space for play but a world with history, where different people played big roles and what happened in the past carries implications for the future.  You can uncover the full story, but you are not required to.  There is no quest, no grand role for you to play except that which you craft for yourself - the world is built to react to you, but not for you.

Mechanically, it's a wonderful game.  Playing as an individual character/small squad, it feels a lot like Neverwinter Nights.  As you scale up, you move from NWN into The Sims, and from The Sims into SimCity.  If you stick with a single party, you can explore the world and become a prolific adventuring party.  If you scale up, you can become the biggest settlement/faction on the map if you work at it long enough.  Either way, you'll have an experience you can craft into a little story, your own Main Quest, and when you get tired of it you can pick a different thing and get right to it.

Characters progress by doing things, and the game does an excellent job of letting you know which things raise which skills.  It's easy to piece together now different systems interact and build out things like automated production loops.  The Job system is sometimes difficult to work with, but overall provides an immense benefit.  You can have your characters carry on in their work on their own, directing them occasionally when need be, and they'll return to their jobs when that is done.  It's easy to flip between inventories and move items around, though it does take a bit of practice to get just the right procedure for it.  The world is *massive* and full of all kinds of weird things, so regardless of the approach you take, you're in for a unique experience.

This is a game that I know I will play forever.  I may grow tired of it from time to time, but there is so much to it that I will come back.  There's always more to do, lots of options to tweak and change, room for a new way of playing it.

When playing in windowed mode on a standard resolution (e.g. 1440p), it does not properly contain the mouse, resulting in clicks outside the game screen. When this happens, I am unable to recover the mouse in the game (i.e. the mouse no longer works in game).

Honestly, it did look like a game I'd end up burning hours in despite the jank. Perhaps I'll try again if I go back to a standard 16:9 monitor. Nevertheless, for now, given the technical limitations, it's a no from me.

Edit 2: I just remembered why [  ] Allow Comments is disabled by default. I simply left it on in the event the dev wanted to respond with a fix so that I could try the game again. Would rather save myself the headache of responding to illogical comments. Now, can we all get back to gaming.

Edit; [b]an explanation for those bitter about a thumbs down:[/b]
Guys, the game has a 90%+ metric total, no need to get defensive over one thumbs down. 

You can also take it up with Steam for using an absolute thumbs up and thumbs down style review, instead of a star / numeric based system. I'd have probably given it a 2/5 stars or similar, because that would be closer to a neutral, but poor sentiment. Like I clearly state in the last line, it's a no [b]from me[/b]. Unless you're bee-brained and have a problem with individuals outside your hive having personal opinions on things, harsh or otherwise... (also, are you not seeing the irony in your critique of my review?)

The rest of this is mostly optional reading, for the melodramatic. 

Let me breakdown an explanation for those who have a problem with a fair negative opinion about something you enjoy, and why there's no such thing as a perfect product no matter how much you want it to be so.

1a. The product doesn't work on my system when the product should work on basically every modern system given its publication date. Regardless, the product did not work as expected by the buyer, and that should be all that's needed for a negative opinion. I'm not ""irritated"" by that (though I am very irritated by people who baselessly and insistently contest an opinion derived from one's personal experience), nor am I insisting that it should work because I spent money on my system - it's just a fact of the matter that it should work on every system but it doesn't, and that mars the experience for at least some buyers.

1b. As an analogy for why you have little right to lambaste anyone's review, lets say you go to the best and most value for money restaurant in the world but you didn't like your experience there, the environment and ambiance, or how your food was done or served. Then, it doesn't matter if it had a 100% approval rating until you came along - your impression was negative and your opinion will follow suit when you give it; it'll be a thumbs down if you only had 2 options.

But if you remain unconvinced of that line of thinking, find further rationales below.

2. There is a technical flaw here that needs to be addressed or fixed, or otherwise acknowledged in a very visible manner on the store page so that potential buyers who may encounter a limitation can make an informed decision. At the very least, [b]my thumbs down might help anyone with an ultrawide see that the game probably won't work well on their monitor[/b].

- My constructive feedback here is that the devs need to publish a highly visible notice that the game does not work by default with some monitors.

3a. This type of resolution stretching issue is something I haven't seen in a game since the late 2000s, maybe early 2010s. How does any modern day developer fail to ensure that all offered resolutions work as intended? 


3b. Otherwise, if the devs knew their product wouldn't perform on ultrawide resolutions, how did they fail to lock the resolution and aspect ratio and force black bars instead? I have never given a game a negative review for locking me into 16:9 with black bars on my monitor, if that was the judgement call of the developers for how their game should be experienced. 

- My constructive feedback for point 3 is that the devs need to lock the resolution options and force black bars so that it can work in fullscreen at 16:9 even with alternative resolution monitors.

4. Failing the former, how does a modern developer fail to ensure that the mouse can be contained within a borderless window and/or resume its normal functionality when the game comes back in focus after a click?

- My constructive feedback for point 4 is that the devs need to address and fix this technical bug.

5. I already attempted to circumvent the issue by trying other available settings. - I wanted to give the game a good shot. As a customer, may I retain the basic privilege of expecting that a product I paid for works as intended in its default state and, at the very least, within the options offered in its own settings? Do you think a buyer purchases something hoping to be disappointed and raring to leave a negative opinion? That's an incredible waste of time and resources for all.

- Not feedback, just a statement that I didn't blindly and blatantly want to leave negative feedback for something I was hoping to enjoy.

Given these [b]personal sentiments[/b], and the unplayable state that I found the product in, do you really think the logical and fair thing for me to do was to give the game a [b]thumbs up alongside negative comments[/b]? Because that's a level of blind fanboy foolishness I would prefer to disengage from.

PS: for those who think the issues are occurring just because I have multiple monitors, to clarify, the issues occurred on a single 1600p ultrawide (AW3821DW) monitor pushed by a 4090 (both of which aren't particularly special and both of which are entirely current hardware). I don't see why it should encounter issues related to multi monitor setups.",1703723079,1703850197,False,3,2,0.382803291082382202,8,True,False,False

As you wander the unforgiving wastelands, you'll accumulate more bruises than a banana in a blender. But don't despair – with each beating, your toughness meter inches higher. It's like the game is saying, ""You can't make an omelet without getting your face smashed in a few times.""

Sure, you might get enslaved by ruthless overlords along the way, but that's just a side dish to your main course of character development. With determination and perseverance, you'll turn the tables on your tormentors, going from prey to predator.

Unfortunately, the UI is so broken & so non-intuitive, after merely 1.2hrs of play, I knew this game wasn't for me. Now, I don't suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome; nor do I know how advanced chronic carpal tunnel syndrome is normally treated.... 

BUT! I do know that if I were to have continued to play Kenshi for as long as many of Kenshi's other reviewers have, I would most likely have developed advanced carpal tunnel syndrome so severe, the only legitimate treatment I can think of would also mean my entire arm would have already been completely amputated from my body by now. & That is just something I would really prefer not to have to deal with right now.

So, unless you have really built up the strength in your wrist (~daily, vigorous training) OR unless you have no issue spending an unknown amount of time to (possibly) fix the controls the developers, for some reason, found acceptable..., then there is just no way in good conscience I could ever recommend this game.

The world is vast, the possibilities endless, and the soundtrack? Well, let's just say it's the perfect accompaniment to the symphony of battle cries and occasional screams.

It is also an old game running on an old and inefficient engine. Requires entire pc setups to play.

Which makes it impossible to play on laptops or low end setups for playthroughs that exceed mid-game, just travelling between two neighbouring regions often crashes the game.

I started as a Rebirth Slave, escaped my imprisonment during a slave rebellion I instilled. I escaped with a Shek brother but my true brother Halsit was stuck at Rebirth for months while we hid in Holy cities till the patrols lost wind of us. As time passed we eventually established a base in the heart of Okran's Pride in order to produce lots of high quality hash for the United Cities. Although we did not approve of the United Cities use of slavery, they did accept our drugs at high prices so for the time being they were an ally. Once enough time had passed Halsit was no longer being fed and was left on a stick to die. When night fell over Rebirth, Halsit broke from his bindings, freed some slaves and attempted a last ditch effort escape, in which he succeeded, but was so malnourished that he would passout multiple times along the journey, I made sure to rush to his aid as soon as I got wind of his escape, I picked his withered malnourished body from the ground and returned him to our now anti-slaving society/base, Reborn as we called it. Halist recovered fully at Reborn, and became my best drug producer, a sort of Heisenberg if you will.  Our endgame wasn't just to profit, it was justice, and vengeance against our unruly ex-masters. I charged Rebirth with 200 men at my side, all captured and enslaved Holy Nation Paladins, High Paladins, and the Inquisitors who weren't known generals. We sacked Rebirth and freed every slave we could, we made sure no man survived that day, and that not a single person there die quick, but most importantly to make sure that the master is taken alive for personal reasons, he was. Once I had returned home to Reborn with my army, we made sure to put the master in a cage, in slave garbs, with no arms or legs, as my personal pet, next to my throne. Made sure to never let him die so that he could be my personal slave forever. I eventually took my army and over-threw the holy Nation entirely, leaving no survivors except the remaining leaders as personal pets. Once I made enough money to be the richest man a thousand times over, we eventually over-threw the United Cities as well, freeing all their slave encampments along the way to the head of the chicken. All in all an amazing experience, this game is a favourite of mine and I shake in excitement for the second release to come eventually",1703354617,1703354617,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Important side note; if you plan on playing the machine race (the skeletons), LOTS of factions dont take kindly to ""tin men"" trying to come into their place, and will attack you unprovoked for ""religious reasons"" i think. skeletons are tough, but even at the highest level, you should still be wary of who you approach.

I wrote a review some like 40 hours into the game. I am now hundreds of hours in and I feel like I haven't even made a DENT in what there is to do as I am just now learning how to build my own settlement after owning this game since the beginning of this year. When I first got it I actually almost refunded the game and aside from sobriety keeping this game and continuing to try to understand it was the best decision I EVER made because once it all clicked I was now enveloped in a world which not only operates on its own and I am not the center or focus of it, but that I, personally, may choose the narrative for anyone I recruit as the story is told through the world, not through narrations and cutscenes.

Whether you are an RTS fan, city building fan, action RPG fan or simply have an appreciation for gritty graphics and old world apocalyptic scenery, this game has something for anyone and everyone. That is, IF you can get past the initial stages where simply surviving is an agonizing task, as the number one rule of Kenshi is that you have to use real life logic to encounter situations (like you can't simply kill a pack of goats with a stick when you are a skinny puke with a stick and a series of towels around your legs, or removing corpses from a town so that they dont attract predators). 

Now, this game is NOT for everyone. The gameplay is somewhat comparable to the Sims in that you give each character you can play as tasks, from walking to a spot or researching freaking hydroponics, so if you're looking for a low IQ (I mean that endearingly) bonk em shoot em game this is not gonna be that. Don't let that turn you off though, because the level of freedom that you have is unrivaled and i think even if you dont understand what's going on at all you will still find something to enjoy about the world of Kenshi itself. Its allure and mystique is hard to resist. 

There is also the matter of which this game touches on hard topics, such as slavery and hunger. There are plenty of games which have these things but not only is this a core part of the world but the way the slavers speak to and about the slaves and the fact that as you starve you get skinnier and skinnier until you wither away can be pretty triggering despite the graphics being very gritty. If you are sensitive to those kinds of things I might recommend you give this one a pass because slavery and starvation are unavoidable in this game, whether it's you or someone else its happening to.

To conclude, this is not only one of the best games ever made, with all its imperfections and setbacks, but it is one of the most creative, well thought out and ambitious piece of art I have personally witnessed. If there is ever in the future a museum for video games, I believe from the bottom of my heart this is the Mona Lisa of gaming and 30 dollars is nothing for an experience of this scale.",1688939828,1702959535,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

You're not a hero, there's no grand quest, your just trying to survive (and possibly prosper) in a cruel world. The stories emerge from the experiences you have. One game may result in some new recruit managing, against all odds, to knock out the final enemy in a fight, and healing up the dying members of your squad before passing out from blood loss and being revived by them in turn. Another may end in a prosperous base falling to a cannibal horde because your defences were inadequate and the bulk of your fighters were exploring ruins too far away to get back in time to help. It leads to unique stories that change with every game.

You have the freedom to play however you want - from a lone swordsman to a giant squad defending your own custom base - they are all viable play-styles in this game thanks to the combat system. 

What this game does better than any other game I've played, though, is the sense of progression. You start off as literally the weakest creature in the game. Anyone or anything will beat you in combat. But, as you increase your skills (by using them), and start to gear up, enemies you used to sneak by or run from on sight, soon become less then a bump in the road on your way to tougher enemies and bigger loot. More importantly (assuming you don't use exploits or mods) this power progression feels earned and satisfying.

Yes, the game is old, and buggy, and you'll probably want to run it on a SSD, but its one of the few I still feel the urge to play about once a year. That's more than I can say for most games.",1702939413,1702939413,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However with how Steam reviews work you can only Recommend or Don't Recommend. Personally while I think Kenshi has a lot of cool aspects to the game and I can see why people love it I personally don't think I would recommend the game. 

Kenshi is a game that is right up my alley. I love open world RPGs that allow the player to role play who they want to be and I think the idea of not being the main character who has to save the world is such a refreshing concept. I also love how the game does not hold your hand. On paper Kenshi sounds like a dream game to me with it's promises in all the different ways you can role play for example be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, etc. However I am finding it hard to role play and getting immersed because this game is missing one core feature and that is quests. 

The game does have some bounties but for the most part the game doesn't really have quests. Now from what I have read the idea  behind this decision is because you create your own story and you are not supposed to be anyone special in this world. The world is not supposed to revolve around you and I get that. However I don't see how quests take away from these aspects by not having quests it just makes it harder to role play. For example in other games like Morrowind I can join a guild of fighters, I can join a guild of wizards, I can join a gang of thieves, or join a group of assassins, join religious groups, etc. In Starfield I can start working for a company, join the military, join a group of rangers, and join a group of pirates. Just like as a regular person in real life you can go to college, join a company, join the military, and make a ton of other life choices. Other quests you can find in RPGs are basic under the table kind of work like maybe helping a store owner with thieves or helping a farmer being harassed by bandits. None of these things are main character activities they are something hypothetically a regular character with the appropriate skills could do in these worlds. I get not having a faction quest completely revolve around you or a main story that revolves around you saving the world like other video games. However not being able to join factions and do ""quests"" or jobs or what ever you want to call them and interact with NPCs in meaningful ways does not make the game feel more immersive. Neither does it make you feel more like just an average person in the world because just like in real life an average person in the world would be able to do these kind of things.

Kenshi having basic faction quests, basic quests to help out a local farmer, etc. would have went a long way for immersion but it is hard to get immersed in a world when you can barely interact with people in meaningful ways. The game promises to be an ultimate RPG but with the lack of quests it fails to do that for me.

There are a lot of other cool aspects in Kenshi and I can see why people love it but for me personally with the lack of this feature it's hard to role play and get immersed in the game world so sadly I would not recommend this game.",1702839178,1702863312,False,28,2,0.627667486667633057,0,True,False,False

This is my FAVORITE RPG game. Here are the pros/cons:
Pros:
[list]
[*] Create your own character
[*] Can gather allies to help you
[*] Your character(s) get stronger the more do a specific task
[*] Plenty to see and do
[*] Various factions and how you play has consequences
[*] A lot of mods that add neat stuff
[*] You can build your own bases/camps
[*] You can play exactly how you want. Play a warrior, a trader, a bounty hunter, a farmer, a miner, a craftsman, do everything with one character or have multiple characters who are specialized in certain things.
[*] You can literally carry around a corpse of a defeated enemy and use them like a backpack to carry things
[*] You can lose your limbs, but fear not, you can replace them with better mechanical limbs!
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Honestly, it takes some getting used to, since there isn't a tutorial
[*] New players will die a lot. Kenshi is unforgiving and you can easily lose your character if you pick the wrong fight
[*] I'll be real with you. The only real cons are that you'll struggle as a new player coming into the game unknown. But once you get the hand of it, you'll fall in love with it.
[/list]

So give it a try. It's amazing. Don't let the brown and dusty graphics fool you, the game's great. If it is a bit too pricey for you, wait for a sale. It goes on sale a lot so pick it up then.

I still find myself thinking of certain characters, locations, and factions years after last playing it. The lore behind each could maybe only fit on one to two pages of a wiki, but still it finds a way of making them each feel interesting and unique.

The combat is uninteractive unless you manually kite. Even then, it's highly unlikely you best anything with better stats than you unless you have the patience to kite until one of your strikes lands. Yet, 100 hours later, when I steamroll the bandits that once beat me up and stole my lunch money, I feel an incredible sense of accomplishment. 

Kenshi is all about the slow burn. Grinding stats can be as repetitive as you want to make it, but it's almost always more enjoyable to just explore and build them up naturally.

As Skins is laying there, he thinks back to all his Friday nights of WoW, Mountain Dew Code Red, and Pizza Rolls. Being 33 was the best. 

He thought about how his mom kicked him out all because Skins' new step-dad wanted to ""toughen him up"". 

Skins layed there, ready to sleep the great sleep. Then, a lovely group of travelers patched Skins up, and told him of this really fun camp. Skins never got to go to camp as a kid so he was super excited. 
They gave him these really nice anklets (they were a little heavy, so that made Skins whine a bit.). After traveling through the world for a few days, we made it to ""Super Fun Happy Camp Time Forever"", but they called it Rebirth.

They told Skins he had to get rid of his really hip, not neckbeardy small ponytail and gave him some camp clothes. Skins met a nice robot friend named Wee and they talked. Wee said he was there for a while and was tired of having fun. He asked if Skins would help him. Skins never had a real friend, so he didn't want to screw this up. Wee told him to unlock the anklets, and skins complied. He really liked camp, but didn't want to lose his only friend. 

Skins and Wee started to walk away, but the camp counselors didn't like that. They used ""happy sticks"" on wee and Skins until they went to sleep, then sent them both to time out. Skins and Wee tried a couple more time, even though Skins kept complaining his body was hurting. And each time, the counselors used happy sticks many many more times. Each time ending up in a time out. 

he tried so many times, his body ran out of fun and went to sleep forever. 

All in the first half hour of gameplay.

From the sprawling deserts to the war-torn landscapes, every corner of this vast world is teeming with danger and opportunity.

The game's open-world design is both a blessing and a curse, providing the freedom to forge your own path but ensuring that every decision comes with consequences. The depth of Kenshi's gameplay is staggering, from building your own outpost to training a diverse group of characters with unique skills. The learning curve is steep, but the satisfaction of mastering the game's mechanics is immensely rewarding.

Kenshi's graphics and engine may not be cutting-edge, but the attention to detail in its world-building is commendable. The soundtrack complements the desolate atmosphere, adding an extra layer of immersion to your struggle for survival. The modding community also deserves praise for continuously expanding and enhancing the game, giving players even more ways to tailor their experience. They truly are heroes of the digital age.

While Kenshi might not be for everyone due to its challenging nature and lack of hand-holding, those who appreciate a true sandbox experience will find themselves deeply engrossed in its harsh but captivating world. If you ever find yourself in a bind just ask yourself: What would Beep do?

Every time I enter Kenshi's world there are new characters, challenges and adventures just waiting around the corner! Graphics are good, though maybe a little dated, and the sound direction really adds to the dangerous atmosphere of the world: sombre silence interspersed with exotic and varied musical pieces.

As mentioned, there are some limitations to the game: The UI and navigation can feel a little clunky at first. Moreover endgame content seems a little spartan after a few playthroughs. Good news is that if vanilla content is not enough for you there is a very active modding community offering a smorgasbord of mods ranging from quality-of-life updates to new areas, quests, characters and whatever else you may be looking for.

Kenshi's best aspect is how different each area is in terms of both what inhabits it and the weather of the landscape. You have zones containing endless acid rain, barren wastes with lasers piercing from the skies vaporizing anything caught below, or simple fog hiding untold dangers.

The cruelty you can encounter goes deep. Being beaten and robbed is about the most benign outcome to expect. There are far worse fates for those unlucky enough to experience them.

Kenshi is a unique, true sandbox game made by a madman with a vision. And yes, we're talking ""true sandbox"", not ""linear RPG set in an open world"". Pick your start, jump in blind, and you've got a whole world to explore. Most people in this world will completely savage you while you try to find your footing, but Kenshi runs on Dragonball Z rules; when a fight doesn't kill you, you become stronger. It's pretty merciless and plays into the ""claw your way to the top from nothing"" trope, but if ""dying is fun!"" isn't your scene there are PLENTY of community mods, and the Forgotten Construction Set (FCS) can be used to create your own mods or save edit.

And I need to make this extremely clear, the existence of the FCS is fantastic. Just beautiful. It's an exceedingly user-friendly modding tool that lets you tinker with virtually any aspect of the game. It takes a bit of learning, but if you're like me and enjoy fiddling with everything that isn't nailed down, you can fine-tune your Kenshi experience to blissful perfection. If you're willing to put in the time, you can even create your own NPCs and factions. Love writing dialogue, me.

I love Kenshi, cannot wait for Kenshi 2, cannot wait to see what our lad&co cook up, I desire more.

Oh yeah and anyone who doesn't want a tall, buff shek mommy/daddy is a coward and can't even lift a fragment axe. Those Okranite curs know not what they forsake.

Let's change that.

This is easily one of my the most unique and interesting experiences on any platform. It's obviously a labor of love, and I love it nearly as much.

I started playing quite a few years ago when it was still in EA. In fact, only half of the map was out at that point. Still, it had most of its bones, and it was immensely fun to play even then. It's gone through a lot over the years, so forgive me if anything I mention is no longer applicable. Better yet, comment to that effect. 

The soundtrack is iconic (Admittedly with a few incredibly annoying, unskippable, and irremovable tracks), creating an ambiance that becomes a part of you as you play. 
The visuals, while not on the level of some AAA titles, often offer strikingly beautiful sunsets and vistas.

The combat is quite unique, with separate armor values (blunt resistance and cut resistance) and health for each body part of each character. Not only that, but most characters can succumb to bleeding as a separate mechanic from the 7 different body parts. 
There's also a cut-to-blunt mechanic that, while really intriguing, doesn't really work well to my tastes, so I modded it out of my game years ago and haven't looked back. Basically, on top of having separate blunt resist and cut resist, armor also has a percentage of cut damage that instead becomes blunt damage. Imagine hitting a helmet with a sharp sword, and the impact rattles your head a bit. This is great! Very unique design, and I love it! The problem is that the new blunt damage completely bypasses the blunt resist of the next layer of armor. Meaning in some instances, you could actually take more damage from wearing low efficiency outer armor than from wearing nothing in that slot. That just didn't sit well with me.
Wounds to the various body parts have consequences beyond just bringing you closer to death. Arms lose their strength until you can no longer wield a weapon. Legs become slower until you have to crawl. Damage to the head reduces perception.
Healing takes time and rest. Applying a bandage stops the bleeding, but doesn't immediately heal wounds, making the outcome of every fight have weight. Even if you survive, there's a cost. And if your limb gets badly damaged enough, you can lose it. And if you bleed out, RIP.

Base building is both satisfying and frustrating in equal measure. It's very fun to build a base, but they never quite work as intended. To this day, gates are occasionally permeable even when shut and locked , enemies saunter right on in unmolested by either your melee units or your turret gunners up on the wall, and everyone pretty much ignores threats until they murder either your farmer or your turret gunner. Or both. To top it off, pathfinding gets wonky the more you build. I've never found solutions to any of these issues, but I keep coming back year after year.

The biggest draw, though, at least for me, is how easy it is to write your own stories with this game.  No two games are exactly alike, even if you play them pretty similarly. It often plays like Game of Thrones, focusing on the guy you assume is the main character only to show you how little the world of Kenshi actually cared about him. But then the focus moves to the character he previously saved from cannibals. Or maybe the whole camp of slaves he saved, who are now building a thriving community together. Or only your mute character survives and has to continue on without the ability to barter. Or you conquer the entire world for the Hive.

It's the one game I think of when I want to make my own story.",1702093838,1702093838,True,2,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Eventually, curiosity drew me back. The experience was just as challenging as I remembered. Desperate and starving in the game, I attempted theft, only to be captured and enslaved. A failed attempt to reload my game forced me to navigate this predicament on my own.

Life as a virtual slave was grueling. I spent countless hours trapped in forced labor, perpetually hungry. My attempts to steal food only led to brutal punishment and confinement. Yet, I refused to let the game defeat me. I began sneaking out at night to hoard food, gradually becoming proficient in lockpicking. Emboldened, I decided to free other slaves. Our escape plan was foiled, but a few of us managed to flee into a foggy, monster-infested region to the west.

The first night of freedom under a starlit sky was exhilarating. I had reclaimed my freedom and identity. Fueled by anger and a desire for justice, I transformed into Starving Jak, leading my group, the Ronins of the Mist, in a revolt.

Hundreds of gameplay hours later, I can proudly say I have defeated every slaver in Kenshi, liberating every soul in the game.

When I finally escaped, I thought it was a good idea to pick a fight with a few garu and they ended up biting one of my legs off.  After lying unconscious for about two minutes, I spent the next 20 minutes dragging myself over the ground to the nearest place where I could buy a cheap prosthetic, and used that to hobble further away to a place where I can get an actually decent prosthetic.

I used the skills I had learned while trying to escape slavery to knock out the merchant and steal all of his high-quality prosthetics, so I now had a masterwork prosthetic leg and plenty of money.  I used that money to buy the best armor and weapons I could find, and after discovering an exploit that allowed me to use this missing leg to skyrocket my toughness, I trained myself up until I could go back and free all the other slaves.

Used all my money to buy the freedom of slaves and the ones who wanted to stick around helped me mine. Used the money to buy labor from the local inn. Had a whole team of people mining.

Day 1 of full operation my Iron ore squad got wiped out by a giant bug, by the time the copper squad came to the rescue it was too late and every single character including Nettles and his four legged friend Brick were downed, but not dead. A young lady by the name of Little who wanted to become a swordswoman bled out.
Local slavers ended up healing the rest of us, but then slapping shackles on us afterwards. Marisa a human freed slave, Twitch a hive laborer, and Fall a disgraced hive prince, were all shackled and carried off. Nettles dragged behind because of his limp, while Brick was not too far behind still unconscience. Nettles defiantly picked at this shackles, thinking he was safe since the slavers werent near. Sadly this angered some nearby Samurai and they proceeded to maul Nettles, severing his leg.

Not long after Brick awoke and stayed close to his owner Nettles, as his primer operative was. At this moment Marisa, Twitch and Fall are being dragged to their fate and Nettles dies, unconscience while his friend Brick waits nearby for the work to continue.

As I finished writing this I took a quick gander back at the save and now I see Brick now dying alongside Nettles with a bunch of slaver bodies. It looks like the slavers returned to obtain their ""property"" and Brick wasn't having any of it.

You can have several characters and control them as a unit or individually for more strategic attacks. I.E. Hide your archers behind a hill and have a runner lure out the town guards.

I cannot contain my frustration with Kenshi, a game that shamelessly includes sand without providing any warning for those who suffer from sand-related anxiety. As a person with a severe sandphobia, I was utterly appalled and distressed by my experience with this game.

The sheer audacity of this game to inundate me with this nightmarish scenario without my consent is beyond infuriating. Kenshi offers no respite, no escape from the ever-present sand. It's as if the developers went out of their way to create a virtual world designed specifically to torment those of us who despise this natural element.

Kenshi, I demand that you acknowledge the needs of players who suffer from sand-related phobias. You should have a dedicated warning for these individuals and, if possible, an option to modify the environment or disable sand entirely. To ignore the legitimate fears and concerns of a portion of your potential player base is nothing short of neglectful and disrespectful.

Kenshi is an absolute disgrace for its failure to accommodate the needs of players like me. I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy, let alone someone who shares my fear of sand. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Kenshi if you have the slightest aversion to sand; this game is a desert of despair that should come with a massive, glaring warning sign.

The gameplay itself is equally infuriating. Sandstorms are a constant threat, and they intensify my anxiety to an unbearable degree. Trying to navigate the endless desert feels like a never-ending nightmare. I thought I was signing up for an adventure, but instead, I found myself trapped in a hellish sandbox of torment.

There is no friendly, happy, bunny mode.  You begin in one of the scenarios you choose. i.e. your starting squad and loadout, and instantly begin in an unforgiving world of sand ninjas, samurai, and desert drifters.  How you choose to proceed is up to you, and if you choose unwisely, you will die/fail.  No one to blame but your past.  If you don't rush into the desert wastes, put some thought into you development, and plan, there is a great chance you will succeed ... or at least not be bludgeoned too bad by hungry bandits.  Wait and amass a squad and income before trying to form your own town and you will be okay; if not you will have to fight like clint eastwood in an old western, but without the guns.  

Great game for those with the patience to play it and overlook the occasional bug.  On this issue, updates are constantly coming out, and fixes come out even faster.  The Dev is doing a great job for it's small operation, and if you can handle the occasional stress of dealing with a bug and at the worst having to revert to the newest save or auto save, there is nothing too flawed about the game.

What I mean is, there's virtually no restrictions on what is possible, excluding things like research for crafting and construction.

There are multiple basic starts that can be picked, from literally nothing in the desert, to five friends finding a place to bunker down. Going places isn't limited by anything but how harsh the areas are and how capable the party is.

It's a massive map that's pretty much dominated by arid enviorment. There is swamp and green enviorments but they are just about at select locations. I definitely wish there was more green locations, as farming is defined by what area the outpost is in and it can be very difficult to get anything else, until much later on with better technology.

The enviroments themselves are very nice, areas are sectioned off as biomes with general themes or a certain aspect, like [b]Screaching Forests, Spider plains, Black Desert[/b]. However, there's very little flat land. Virutally none. What little there is, is nearly the most hostile places to be. So anything planned on being built that's larger than an outpost is going to be jagged or hold off until the party is at higher stats. People may like that, I don't. Most of everything will be built at an angle or built in weird spots.

Also progression is really nice for the game. Skill stats such as combat, crafting, building, survival all advance the more they are done and benefit from other stats. So crafting medical supplies boosts medical, which makes it faster when patching wounds. mining helps with labor, athletics, and strength. Strength boosts heavy weapon usage, while dexterity is with lighter weapons. It can be a very purposefully slow game or modded to be sped up.

Even further, modding is not that difficult really. I've made a few custom starts for myself, one being just over the top so I could explore more and see more of the map and others for more roleplay options.


The developers are very nice and understanding people. There's a small group of them working on this game. Whenever issues happen, they are pretty quick to fix them when they are able to. They've started working on the second game, but haven't abandoned the first.


I do wish to see more games like this, that are genuinely open world with very little guidance that simply states ""be free with whatever.""
Possibly something like a more natural medieval or fantasy based, not just Far Eastern. Same concepts, different themed games. It's a type of game not really explored and should be.


I did accidently burn myself out quickly as I pretty much played the game for weeks whenever I had free time, but I definitely enjoyed it and will come back to see major updates.

Edit: The game is finished, and I've played a lot more recently. There's definitely a lot more to the finished product that I learn to enjoy, and try attempts in. Of course I learned a lot and make a pretty easy run going. I enjoy the upcoming of a playthrough over the final portion, so restarting is often a fun concept for me.

- you need the game to hold your hands, tutorials will only explain certain game mechanics
- you expect the highest graphics fidelity, the graphics in this game are in no meaningful way bad to my tastes, but I realise they won't be to everyone's liking
- you can't stand a challenge ...

Cause what this game WILL offer you is in fact a challenging world in which it is up to you to survive & thrive. Starting out your first few runs, expect things not to go your way, cause there's plenty of 'things' out there, looking to beat your characters to a pulp, after which, they can be left to die, eaten alive, enslaved, ... However, as you're coming to grips with how it all works, you'll get a character/squad going, after which the surviving part'll be easier and you get the real freedom to go and explore this world on offer.

This is not Kenshi.  
No game i know offers the freedom found in Kenshi. It truly deserves the label 'sandbox.'
There is extensive lore to discover. A world to explore. Characters to meet. Battles to fight. Treasures to acquire.
This will be difficult. You will not always succeed.  But you will always be free to decide for yourself. 
Even starting as a slave in Kenshi, i feel more freedom to explore a personal journey than any other 'sandbox' i know.

Kenshi is a unique open sandbox game that offers a world of possibilities. The freedom to explore, build, and create your own story is undeniably fun. However, there's a significant downside to this experience - the painfully slow character progression.

While the open sandbox aspect of Kenshi is undeniably enjoyable, the journey of leveling up your character feels like an eternity. It's a slow and often frustrating process, which can be a major drawback for those seeking a more rewarding progression system.

In summary, Kenshi is a game with immense potential for enjoyment, thanks to its open sandbox design. Still, the excessively long and often tedious character leveling can be a major turn-off for players looking for a smoother progression experience.

Developed by virtually one person, Kenshi is an RPG game with RTS elements. In the game you can start as a lone wanderer, citizen of one of the nations, trader, group of lowlifes and many more. You have to embark on a grand adventure to... to do whatever you want, really. And that's the beauty of it. The game has no goal, no aim. You make of it whatever you want: you want to be a trader and earn lots of cash? You can do that. Want to gather a bunch of followers and build a thriving city? No problem. Become a slave uprising leader and destroy one of the nations from the inside? You bet you can do that in this game. The world is your oyster!
Although the game looks nice, graphics is not its strong suit. Sound design, however is where it's at. The music is very atmospheric and the main theme is truely a masterpiece.
The game has also a very thriving community that creates plenty of mods. After you finish with vanilla, you can easily mod this game to your heart's content and start the whole journey once more.

Original review:

[spoiler]Kenshi is a good game, and has a lot of potential, but I simply cannot recommend it in its current state. It feels like an early alpha or tech demo, as it doesn't have a lot of content for such a massive world, and is extremely buggy.
In just a few hours of play time, my characters got stuck in every single piece of geometry on the map, lagged behind when a move order was issued, and even with 64 GiB of RAM, and two SSDs on a RAID setup, the game would struggle to load things quickly, and it never used more than 4.7 GiB of RAM, preferring to unload the map whenever possible.
Don't get me wrong, it was fun at times, but it feels unfinished, and the bugs make it nothing short of unplayable. I can't recommend this.[/spoiler]",1658484027,1700617814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Open world rpg, no storyline, no quests given, you make your own story, and you make your own goals

I love the very eastern asthetic is has, as well as the races that dominate it. Every corner of the world has something cool to see!

A variety of weapons and a fun idea of starting out as a literal nobody. You have to work super hard to get ANYWHERE in this world.

World is populated with different groups. One of my favorites is the Gorillo bandits, imagine if a bunch of zangieff lookin dudes from streetfighter formed a gorilla karate gang, led by an even buffer dude.

Is slow, but I like it! If you know what you're doing you can speed it up significantly

This game is nuts. It's a roleplaying game in the truest sense - it just throws the player in and lets them do anything, with all of the consequences that entails. The fun comes from learning how things differ between each of the factions and just trying to exist in a brutal world that frequently tries to crush your character. 

Every nation has their own rules and standards, and then the no man's land is survival of the fittest. Learn to pick your battles as you navigate creating a life within the desert. Failure is often your greatest tool - so long as you don't die. 

Between having a unique health system and squad-based combat, death is rarely an outcome for a crafty player. The stories that unravel as you narrowly avoid destruction time and time again will keep you coming back. And you will be richly rewarded for your time. 

This game doesn't let you come back from being an inch away from death for nothing. You will steadily grow stronger, and once you hit a certain point, your progress will grow exponentially. Everything you do is worth it because it will add to your abilities. The progression system works well enough that you can go it alone and still become a god-like figure.

The sky above you presents with two alien planets visible at all times. This is not Earth. As you traverse the odd, dusty landscapes you quickly find that you are not alone. This world is alive with humans, several humanoid species, and dangerous beasts. Trading in goods of all kinds, even in people is prevalent, and wars wage between bandits, slavers, starving nomads, religious zealots, cannibals, traders and homesteaders. This is the world of Kenshi, a world that asks of you only one question; Who do you want to be? What is your goal?

Indeed, there is no set goal or storyline to follow in the game other than lore books, conversations gleaned in towns, and the relics of a fallen civilization all around you. At first this lack of direction could seem bland or daunting to those expecting the typical experience of an overstated plot to hold your hand and shove you in the 'right' direction. There's no right or wrong in Kenshi, though. If you want to spend your time in game as a trader building up a caravan and selling common goods or weapons to every town you pass through, you can. If you want to be a wandering loner simply exploring each biome as you see fit, go for it. Want to build your own farm, or establish your own town and preside over it as some sort of mayor or king? You can do that too. You can be a thief, a bounty hunter, you can sell your foes into slavery or let your pets (if you have any) feast on their corpses.

The possibilities are endless. Make no mistake, there is a learning curve to this game but not in the way you might think. You only really understand the way Kenshi works when you realize your character(s) -will- be defeated. A lot. And being defeated is necessary to become more powerful. Even losing a limb in battle has its advantages, as you can eventually replace it with a more powerful mechanical prosthetic. As long as your last remaining character does not die, you can play until your heart's content. And if everyone in your control does die? It doesn't change a thing. No game over screens. The world keeps going around you until you start a new game. 

In other words, Kenshi is a truly unique game in its design. Simultaneously unforgiving but incredibly rewarding. While graphically things may at first appear a bit dated, you can still find beautiful cliff-side vistas, areas of lush green, foreboding and dangerous badlands, the bones of long dead massive creatures or robots and plenty more eye-candy.

If you're a patient gamer who values a totally unique experience, there's no reason not to buy this one! I've never felt better about a gaming purchase in years. Give it a go!",1700474480,1700474480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's not a snobby, neck beard, Dark Souls fan-esque, ""This game is too good for most people to appreciate!"" statement. The game is just genuinely unapproachable. The world is hostile, the UI is confusing and unintuitive, there is no real objective to guide you in the right direction right off the bat, no tutorial, no real easy mode, no hand holding. None of that. I must have watched 20 hours of videos describing and explaining various things about the game and I still feel like I'm stumbling in the dark half the time. 

All of that being said, there is one thing this game does better than any game I've ever encountered, and its ultimately the one thing that keeps me coming back every time. The stories you make. The game has ""quests"" technically speaking, they are different from how most games do them. you don't run up and talk to a character and receive a five minute exposition dump, or a cut scene. Instead you are given small tidbits about that character and the world, and the rest is intentionally left for you to infer and speculate. Because of that the world is a little bit different for every player experiencing it. On top of that, the things that happen dynamically to you shape your own unique story on the fly. You might rise from a newly captured slave to a highly sought after bounty hunter, or start out as a wandering trader only to be drawn in to the lucrative profits that smuggling offers, and your story will feel real and personal because you'll be there to experience it every step of the way, rather than a cut scene telling you how much of a bad ass you are or how lowly of a position your character started in. All of this comes together to make me feel more attached to any given Kenshi character I've made over any other scripted RPG.

To sum it all up, hiding behind Kenshi's VERY rough exterior is perhaps the most immersive and genuine experience I've ever had in a game. Do your research and know what you're getting yourself into, but if it seems like something you can handle, you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.",1700450254,1700450254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game barely functions as you play it longer and longer so i can no longer recommend it (old review below), the ai stops working including simple things like move orders, humans refusing to eat until they die standing next to food barrels not even stuck on turrets, people follow crawling enemies but refuse to attack even when specifically right clicking the enemy.  This is just scratching the surface, the number of reloads needed and crashes that happen after roughly the first 20 hours of a save is ridiculous.

(While I would recommend this game it comes with a huge asterisk.  It has a lot of problems, some of which can be fixed with mods but not all, such as mobs pushing themselves through your defensive gates and then once inside your base instantly stealing all your food stores (even unfinished food like bread) despite never picking or breaking your gate.  There are a lot of problems like this, most of which pertains to bases, walls, and buildings in general.

We got the bad out of the way now lets talk about the good.  This game has a lot to like about it from the little details like guards being suspicious of an open door at night but not during the day, to the sense of progression you feel with each character as they build up their stats (which happens really fluidly).

A typical character begins, dirt poor and clad in rags, with essentially no meaningful skills. You're easy pickings for anyone to rob or kill. It seems like the game is setting you up to fail, and you'll quickly find that scraping out a meager profit scavenging corpses and mining copper ore, and retreating to the walls of the nearest city at the first sign of a threat is just about the only thing you can manage. It's hard to see what anyone would enjoy about the experience.

The key to finding the fun in Kenshi comes with the realization that combat experience is based on how overleveled a given threat is to you, and many of Kenshi's threats will leave you unconscious but not permanently worse off. Once you discover what doesn't kill you (usually) makes you stronger, you'll find yourself eager to jump into impossible fights, knowing that losing is just as valuable as winning.

And gradually, you will start to gain ground. You claw your way up to even footing with the packs of emaciated bandits that beat and rob you. You gain a small party of fellow adventurers to even the odds. You replace your rusty blades and wooden sticks with razor sharp masterwork weapons. You establish a base of operations and build up its defenses. Threats that were once insurmountable become frustrating, then fairly mundane, and finally trivially as you advance from a hopelessly outmatched nobody to a legendary swordsman who can single-handedly take on an army.

Beneath Kenshi's hostile exterior is a game about the grueling march towards self improvement, and the satisfying look backwards to find that all your hard work has paid off.",1700338529,1700338672,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

Things I don't like:

     Long pauses for load times.
     Physics engine glitches, characters stuck or set to the moon.
Things I like:
     Straight forward game play, do the things to be better at them.
     Your decisions / actions matter, some of the things you do will effect the world of Kenshi.
     Can build your own base / town, if you want.

Kenshi will not hold your hand.  You do not start as the hero, you have to grind that out yourself.  The Hero / Villain you are is up to you.

I can see how this could be fun but, I don't have the patience required to master it. I love the game-play and ""do or die"" play style but, between bugs and the requirement to spend a lot of time researching game mechanics: i can't recommend this unless you really have NOTHING else to do.

Kenshi, the brainchild of Lo-Fi Games, stands as a testament to the brilliance of open-ended sandbox gameplay. In a gaming landscape often dominated by linear narratives, Kenshi emerges as a refreshing anomaly, providing an immersive and expansive experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional RPGs.

The hallmark of Kenshi lies in its unparalleled freedom. From the outset, players are thrust into a vast, desolate world with no predetermined destiny. The absence of a linear storyline liberates the player, allowing them to carve their own path in a dystopian universe. Whether one aspires to be a noble trader traversing perilous landscapes, a cunning thief navigating city streets, or a fearless warlord leading a band of misfits, Kenshi accommodates every playstyle with seamless fluidity.

The depth of Kenshi's world-building is truly awe-inspiring. Every blade of grass, every ruin, and every character contributes to the game's rich tapestry. The game's lore unfolds not through scripted sequences but through the emergent stories that players create with their choices and actions. It is a living, breathing world where the consequences of decisions ripple across the fabric of the game, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving narrative.

The squad-based mechanics add an extra layer of complexity and realism. As players recruit and train their band of characters, witnessing them evolve from vulnerable greenhorns to seasoned warriors is a gratifying experience. Each member of the squad possesses a unique backstory and skills, making every playthrough a fresh adventure. The game's AI-driven economy and ecosystem ensure that the world is in constant flux, responding to the player's actions and creating an environment where adaptability is key to survival.

Kenshi's visuals may not boast the hyper-realistic graphics of AAA titles, but it compensates with a distinct and immersive art style. The barren landscapes and dilapidated cities evoke a sense of desolation, underscoring the harsh realities of survival in this unforgiving world. The game's soundtrack complements the atmosphere flawlessly, shifting from haunting melodies in desolate wastelands to adrenaline-pumping beats during intense battles.

The game's modding community deserves a special mention. Lo-Fi Games has fostered an environment where players can shape and enhance their Kenshi experience. From graphical improvements to gameplay overhauls, the modding scene has breathed new life into the game, showcasing the developers' commitment to fostering a community-driven experience.

However, Kenshi is not without its challenges. The difficulty curve can be punishing, demanding strategic thinking and careful resource management. Some may find the lack of hand-holding and guidance daunting, but for those willing to invest time and effort, the rewards are boundless.

In conclusion, Kenshi transcends the conventions of traditional RPGs, delivering an unparalleled sandbox experience. Its expansive world, freedom of choice, and emergent storytelling make it a masterpiece in its genre. Whether you seek the thrill of combat, the intricacies of trade, or the solitude of exploration, Kenshi invites you to forge your own destiny in a world where every decision matters. It's not just a game; it's an epic journey, an odyssey of survival and self-discovery that will leave an indelible mark on the soul of every adventurer who dares to enter its vast and treacherous landscapes.",1700015335,1700015335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have a pretty high tolerance for jank/bugs but I've considered dropping Kenshi multiple times for the sheer frequency of characters bugging out and getting stuck in walls. The game is also very unbalanced and several systems appear to be semi-broken or pointless. At the same time, the variety of environments and the extremely interesting world kept me coming back. Even though some parts of it don't make sense, this is very different from other ""management"" games I've played like Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, etc. Overall Kenshi is like the Alpha version of the greatest RPG ever made. It's inconsistent, buggy, frustrating, and extremely interesting.

Edit:
After my characters became stuck in a wall for the 500th time and I had to recall everyone back to my base I decided to change my review to a not recommend. There's a lot to love here but the lack of polish is so extreme that it just is not worth fighting the game to see what it has to offer. It's really disappointing because I really enjoyed parts of my experience, but the game is just borderline broken. 

There really is a fantastic game under all this mess but it is just so clunky that 2/3 of game time will be spent wrestling with poorly designed mechanics, engaging in tedious micromanagement (For your own sake use the bed healing speed up mod), or finding workarounds to bugs. I really wish the game would get out of its own way and let me explore this weird and fascinating setting.

Kenshi is a game with no story, you have to make your own, it's like a table top RPG with the game mechanics acting as the dungeon master, perfect for introverted nerds like myself. 
As in real life, this game doesn't care about your character, you're not the hero, if you die the game will continue to play without you just to show you how little concern it had for you. No game over screen here.
Put some effort into creating a story for your play through and you'll be rewarded though, I laughed when High Inquisitor Seta was defeated and carried off by slave traders, cried when my loyal pack of bonedogs were butchered in front of me by starving bandits and proud when Beep joined my team.
Sure, you can grind until you're OP then defeat all the bosses but that's easy and been done by so many other games time and again but this game offers you the chance for so much more, this game offers the chance for a completely unique story every time you play it because you make the story and no one knows where that story will take you.

Kenshi is an interesting mix of sandbox RTS, and an old-school MMO despite being single-player only.
You can control 1-30 characters, shape them in any way you see fit, and use them to explore an interesting post-post apocalyptic world.


Everything that a character does is tied to a stat. From fighting and sneaking, to simply running. 
So, everything a character does will improve over time. 
As a result, Kenshi has an incredibly satisfying feeling of progression - which is even further emphasized with how difficult the early game can be.



For better or worse, Kenshi has the absolute bare minimum in-game direction for the player. 
When starting a new file, all you will be greeted by is a scary looking HUD, and some barebones tutorial popups. 
After that you're all on your own.
Mix this with a difficult early game, and Kenshi can feel very impenetrable at first.


However, if the game sounds interesting to you in the slightest, I'll repeat, it's extremely worth pushing forward despite its jagged edges.

=========================================================


[b]THE GOOD:[/b] 
+Very unique RPG experience.
+Extremely moddable. VERY modular experience. Play how you want.
+You will spend a lot of hours on it if you like it.

[b]THE BAD:[/b]

-Modding is low-key required to have a smooth experience late-game.
-The game runs like a dumpster fire and you will have to accept this.
-Open world feels empty. There's nothing interesting to find that isn't marked on your map as you approach.

[b]THE INTERESTING:[/b]

>No in-game direction for the player. A true sandbox RPG. It's very easy to fall into your own 'campaign', and have it play out naturally. 
However, if you have difficulty making your own fun, you will have problems finding motivation to continue playing for long.

Rating: ★★★★★

Kenshi is a hidden gem in the world of open-world sandbox RPGs, offering a brutal and unforgiving experience that rewards patience and perseverance. Here's why Kenshi deserves a solid five-star rating:

Vast and Unforgiving World: Kenshi's post-apocalyptic, sword-punk world is massive and unforgiving. It doesn't hold your hand, and you're free to carve out your own path, whether it's as a warrior, trader, thief, or farmer. The world is filled with danger, opportunity, and mysteries to discover.

Freedom of Choice: You have the freedom to shape your character and your story. You can recruit companions, build your own base, start a business, become a warlord, or explore the world as a lone wanderer. The game doesn't impose a predefined narrative, allowing you to create your own adventures.

Complex Economy: Kenshi features a deep economic system, where your actions can impact trade routes, faction relations, and the prosperity of settlements. Whether you're a merchant or a raider, your choices have far-reaching consequences.

Unique Characters and Factions: The game is populated by diverse and unique characters and factions, each with its own lore and goals. Interacting with them adds depth to the world and creates dynamic and often challenging relationships.

Challenging Combat: Combat in Kenshi is tough but rewarding. You'll need to train your characters and employ tactics to survive battles. The game's limb damage system adds a layer of strategy and realism.

Modding Community: Kenshi has a passionate modding community that has created a wealth of user-generated content, from quality-of-life improvements to total conversion mods. This extends the game's replay value and customization.

Ongoing Development: The developer, Lo-Fi Games, has continued to update and improve Kenshi since its release, addressing bugs and adding new content.

While Kenshi offers a remarkable gaming experience, it's important to note that its steep learning curve and initially harsh difficulty can be intimidating. However, for players who enjoy challenging and deep sandbox experiences, it's an incredible journey into a unique and harsh world.

In summary, Kenshi is a masterpiece of emergent storytelling, offering unparalleled freedom and depth in an unforgiving post-apocalyptic world. It's a must-play for those who appreciate the complexity of sandbox RPGs and the thrill of creating your own epic adventure in a brutal and immersive setting.",1699446166,1699446166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So if you want to push, I'm a shove
If you want to spar we can do it no gloves
And if you're gonna run at me you better do it hard
Cuz I fear no fall, no brawl, no scars
I'm too past wrath that I'm calm
Got two last laughs in my palms

Now see a wise man learns from your mistakes
And lets the blunders of his brother serve to fill his plate
So best be on your way before the tidal wave breaks
Cuz you don't want to come to meet the Ronin that awaits

Cuz trust me when I tell you you don't want that tooth 'n claw
And you don't want to see inside the mind of a savage kind
But if you do decide that you are gonna play that hand and try
Just think before you act because your actions don't rewind

A man with intent on his face

Let it be known I won't hesitate

Or maybe you won't. Maybe even with your increasing lack of weakness you'll remain on the sidelines. They'll come to you. They'll be the ones who makes YOU care.

Smith the strongest weapons and armor, replace the weakness of your limbs with the strength of steel, and stockpile enough food to last longer than you could hope to live.

This game is unforgiving, demanding, beautiful and rewarding. And the world is alive!
The AI NCPs are not static statues, as in other PC games, who wait for the players action to react. 
Its a living biodome! Totally interactive and changes with not only each action you take, but each action the NCPs do {even off screen}.
The graphics are now somewhat outdated, but still amazing when watching dozens of individuals fight each other in a battle. Each with their own animation, individual style and custom look -according to what armor, clothing or weapons are equipped.
If you like RPG strategy adventures that don't give a f*ck if you are face down in the dirt... if you are trapped in a cage for weeks {because the guards forgot you}, if you cant outrun a giraffe from Hell that will eat you alive into permadeath... or capture prisoners of your own to torture in blissful payback, kidnap world leaders, collect heads to sell for profit or build an epic city of your own with a post-apocalyptic, steampunk, feudal Japanese, wild western Sims vibe, THIS is the game for you!
Play vanilla or add a few mods from an extensive list available {recommended}.
For the price of a pizza, you too can spend almost 700 hours playing this masterpiece!

After breaking off from mainstream market games (fps/moba) and heading into more niche games like this, playing Kenshi is way more fun. There is a huge world to engage with and a plethora of mods that expand upon it even more. If you want to play as a solo character and try to take on the world's toughest enemies, it's definitely possible. If you want to micro-manage a squad of 100 people and designate them each an individual job, go for it. This is a great game for people who enjoy Rimworld or The Sims.

     In 2023, the graphics are a bit outdated and it's not as optimized as newer games, so it can take a bit of time to get the settings the way you like. The game, plus 30-40 mods, won't be bigger than 20GB which is nice for lower end PC's.  I'd suggest putting it on an SSD even though it is older. But, nonetheless, I recommend you try it out. Grab it on sale at the very least.

Pros:
In-Depth Character Customization
Animal/People Trading
Colony/Squad Management
A Vast World to Explore
Minimal System Requirements To Play
Cannibalism

Cons:
Loading/Rendering Time (for everything)
No Tutorial
Can Require Mods To Fix Some Issues

This game is MIGHTY addictive. My very first playthrough attempt ended in disaster as I was jumped by a gang of bandits the second I left the town I spawned in. Turns out your characters WILL get their asses kicked most of the time to begin with, and the wonderful automated combat means there's nothing you can do about it. Lessons were learned.

On my second attempt, I made a hasty getaway from the previous ambush spot, only to be eaten alive by an evil brontosaurus thing. Again, nout I could do about it. More lessons were learned... Mostly the importance of running away.

This, combined with having to carefully plan out your base building, makes up for an experience that will constantly keep you on your toes. Or maybe you don't want to build a base, and prefer to join a band of mercenaries? That's cool, you can. Don't fancy killing, and want to be a humble trader? That's great. You can.

Either way you choose to do things, something WILL go wrong. Most recently, I was knocked unconscious and shanghaied by slavers. Planning my escape just gives me one more thing to work towards.

The game is a bit grindy though which is really the only negative I have about the game, that you have to grind before the game even becomes enjoyable. But the game does allow you to play how you want.

City building whilst fun I feel like the tech-tree is just really going through the motions, yes the more advanced techs require you to go looking for special items, these can be looted easily though if your stealth is high enough so the city building isn't really a challenge and I would in fact urge against doing it too early as it falls into the same annoyances as RimWorld and StarSector fall into where its just wave after wave of annoying enemies which is nearly always mitigated by designing elaborate kill boxes to game the system.

The world of kenshi is amazing though, its a very unique world and the art for the game is really well done and suits the style. It has a very unique look to it. I love the alien characters the game has which would all fit right at home in star trek or star wars.

Certainly one of the most unique games you will ever play. I highly recommend. Fair warning though it can be a bit buggy with characters glitching out and falling through the ground.

- Bad UI
- Terrible visuals
- Awful load times
- Weird camera
- Lack of meaningful dialogue or characters
- Base-building is only feasible late-game
- Any amount of mods makes the performance even worse than it already is
- Descriptions of character stats that are just wrong

And lastly, the best way to do anything is way better than the alternatives by a lot, so as soon as you know them, the game becomes stale.

But Kenshi's brutally difficult progression and world spark my imagination like nothing else, so I still love this game, but man...

I still recommend this game. It's more interesting than anything else in the genre (open-world rpg sandbox), and if you're the right type of person this will be your favorite game, but I'm done until Kenshi 2 comes out in 2035.

Don't waste your money. This game have no economy. You would spent hours reloading to train assasination/stealing/lockpicking and after that just walk in shops, disable everyone and steal items you want.

Vendors have limited amount of money, so you wont be able to sell expensive stolen items.

And what would kill you interest - endless spawns of mobs/fogmans. 
Fight one godzilla? ok! fun. two? challenging! endless stream of godzillas? ty but not.

Research ends when you'll need an ancient books.
Who needs a game you'll need to google everything to learn?

The reality is Kenshi is one of one in my mind. When you look at the ""More like this"" section of it's store page, as a person who's played Kenshi you realize how unlike Kenshi all those games really are.

Kenshi is possibly the greatest sandbox that exists in gaming. It's a true do whatever you want game, the freedom feels unparalleled, and while you begin the game as nothing, you can conquer this world with enough time, patience and a large enough group.

There is lore, and things to discover about this mission, and there are a handful of missions/quests you can find out in the world, but there is no real narrative or goal/objectives for your character outside of survival and trying to carve out a life in a harsh world that does not care whether you live or die. 

You will watch your character bleed out as characters walk by ignoring you, hoping that one NPC might care enough to bandage you up before they walk away.

The graphics aren't going to blow you away, and even on higher end PCs there can be optimization issues that create frustrating frame rate issues that you will feel you shouldn't be running into, but there is literally nothing in this game that would keep me from recommending it to anyone who finds it at all interesting.

But that was when I had ten hours. This game has really grown on me now. Maybe you won't like it at first, but it definitely gets better the more you play.

I still have problems with the lack of fast travel. I still don't like watching characters run for 15 minutes when I'm crossing the map. Also, the constant loading if you run at 3x speed (which you will). And for many aspects of the game, you'll want to be doing something on your phone while the game does its thing.

However, my opinion on all the other aspects has very much improved. There's a steep learning curve, but master that and you can start your playthrough off well. Training your stats can be grindy sometimes, but grindy in a good way. Seeing your characters progress is very satisfying, especially when they go from weaklings incapable of fighting of a starving peasant to being able to take on entire squads of armed soldiers with just three men.

The game is totally open ended, and you can choose to be literally anything. While many games that advertise themselves as ""open ended"" have a lot of restrictions on just what you can be, Kenshi does not (mostly, at least). If an NPC can do it, you can do it with enough training.

I could keep going, but I honestly don't feel like writing any more. Point is, Kenshi is a good game. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's an amazing game if you do end up playing it. I eagerly await Kenshi 2.",1672697718,1698077070,True,0,0,0.535120785236358643,0,True,False,False

  HOWEVER, it is entirely ruined by what I can only describe as an extremely contagious mental infirmity. Everything revolves around weebsticks. 
   There is this rich space age sci-fi setting, with robots, spaceship debris, mechs, alien life both sentient and non sentient, all wrapped up in a dystopian setting; and instead of anything even remotely related to any of that: the focus is mindless non strategic weebstick brawling. 

    ""What about the xbows?"" I hear the mouth breathers ask. Well, they are bait, plain and simple. The Ai is so completely fucking stupid that upon any single enemy getting within a half football field, the xbow incest products switch to weebsticks and charge like a bunch of mouth breathing weeaboos after watching japanese cartoons for 2 hours. No, there is no way to give orders related to tactics or strategy. It was made that way by design. The ""stealth"" run animation is really all one needs to see to reach this conclusion. 
  The ENTIRE point is weebsticks, which is a really damn shame. Such a waste of potential and talent.

   
   The whole premise is that thousands and thousands of years of war have ravaged a once great society..bla bla bla. Therefore, guns dont exist ect ect. Its flimsy at best. Just having the mere knowledge that guns exist/existed, well, read about peter struedinger. guy made a fucking shotgun while in jail and escaped with it. You also mean to tell me that every faction decided it was best to cease all RND and not invent ways to get a tactical edge? The first gun recorded was used in the year 1364. I'll let you do the math as far as how long modern civilization has been around.    

  So..the game. By itself, I wouldn't bother with this shit cake on a plate if it was for free.
  But what about mods? Can mods save it? Make it the way it should have been on release? Not entirely, but by the gods does it help. 
   For instance, gun mods, and proper stealth animation mods, and mods that allow the use of ranged weapons while hidden...yes it actually takes a mod to implement that. pathetic.
   I've personally been having a blast micro managing one character with a shotgun. Google JonTron shotgun vs sword, should be a 51 second clip. Pretty fun. as for the other npcs that decide to use guns? well, lets just say that an armed society is a polite society.

From what I had seen from the trailers it didn't seem like things got any better, so I decided to stay around the city and try to find a good way to make money.

I started by mining at a iron vein near by the city. It was a pretty rough start since my first try I got instantly attacked by a bandit while on 4x speed. Needless to say I barely got away with my life.

Eventually things started going my way. I got a few hundred cats worth of iron, sold them at the shop, and started getting some gear. My plan was to become a bounty hunter, mainly because I held a grudge against that bandit that attacked me and his entire kind.

Things were going well. The area around the city was relatively safe and explorable and the city was always a safe haven if I ever got into trouble. Then, one fateful day, an entire army of bandits walked straight into it. I decided this was a great way to get loot for free, so I incited a fight that eventually turned into a large battle. There were at least 2 dozen bandits, and the only dedicated guards the city had were 3 ninjas, so I was somewhat worried it wouldn't work out.

However, despite being outnumbered more than 5 to 1, the ninjas absolutely decimated the gang of bandits. It was admittedly pretty cool to watch them hack and slash through the hoard, fighting while surrounded on all sides on a flight of stairs.

At the end of the battle, the ninjas sent the bandits packing, having only lost one of their own. I got a ton of great loot from the bandits, but I made a big mistake when I looted the ninjas' dead companion. Apparently people in this game don't take kindly to you when they see you wearing their dead friends clothes. This wouldn't have been too much of an issue, there aren't too many problems in the early game that you can't outrun.

However, after the battle, by some bug or feature (probably a bug) the ninjas seemed to have completely taken over the town. There was a ninja standing where the old shopkeep used to be, and another one always watching outside the bar. The city was unsafe, and more importantly, unprofitable. I had to leave.

The main issue with this is that this city was the only one really that was marked on the map. To find another city I had to go somewhere else, but I didn't know where. I wasn't gonna look it up; I'm no dirty cheater. Unfortunately I probably should have. I went north, the wrong direction apparently,

I wandered through the desert, becoming more and more desperate in my search for another city as I began to run out of resources. I came across a few outposts, but none of them had a place to sell my loot (I was overburdened btw) or buy any food. 

I was forced to become an outlaw, causing chaos and stealing food while guards weren't looking just to stay alive. I had become the very thing I had swore to destroy. 

Things only got worse. I was now a wanted man by the massive empire of religious zealots that I was apparently in the middle of. This became the least of my worries as I was jumped by a group of hungry bandits in the middle of the desert. I managed to escape relatively unharmed (thank whatever gods there are in Kenshi that I was sensible enough to buy some first aid kits at the first town before things fell apart), but my left leg was critically injured.

Eventually I was no longer able to walk, and had to crawl my way through the desert while I began to starve. I realized that my only hope was to find some civilization in this wasteland. They were probably going to lock me up on sight, but at least they would feed me. Hopefully...

Things seemed hopeless as I continued to crawl north, but just as I was about to give up I saw a weird looking outpost on the horizon. I was saved! I crawled towards it with the tiny bit of strength I had left in me. Guards rushed out of the gates, beat me up a little, then immediately hauled me to their prison. Things were looking up.

Not only did the guards save me, they even healed me and put me in some weird hunger stasis spell so that I wouldn't starve to death. This was so kind that I decided that I would wait out my entire sentence without trying to escape. I decided I would try to start a new life and try to become a soldier for the kingdom. Maybe one day I could become a lord or something.

[hr][/hr]
(the following part of the review pertains to a bug that I was somewhat able to fix and is no longer relevant)

Unfortunately, this is where my cool Kenshi story ends. Because, once my sentence ended, no one came. I waited another 20 minutes on top of the 30 I had already spent to serve my time (at max speed btw) and no guards came to free me. Apparently this is a long lasting and relatively common bug in the game, which is WILD considering getting locked up seems to be the most common thing that can happen to you in the world of Kenshi right behind dying. Escaping isn't really an option either, my leg is still completely busted and even if it wasn't the outpost is apparently a unique outpost filled with a type of guards that are even stronger than normal, making sneaking past them impossible and fighting them even more impossible with my low level character. Oh, and on top of that there is near constant acid rain around the outpost which I have no protection against and will very quickly injure me even if I do manage to make it outside. It's a perfect prison.

So I'm basically softlocked. I really wanted to like this game, and believe me Im going to try to like it whether it wants me to or not. I'm not giving up yet; I'll try a couple ideas to try to break out of the prison, the most extreme being dropping basically all of my possessions just to get a little extra stealth and sneaking out during a brief period of no rain. Feel free to help me out in the comments if you want. As soon as I get out of this I will update my review but as of now I'm leaving the game as a thumbs down because this situation is ludicrous even for a game that is supposed to be buggy.
[hr][/hr]

I found the only good way to fix this softlock was by soft resetting the world basically. Something kenshi lets you do with the click of a button which is nice. I believe that the infinite jail time bug occurs most commonly at outposts, so pro tip avoid any outposts where you are wanted at all costs unless you are confident you can escape. Unfortunately though, since my character was dropped back at the world spawn the entire story from above is...non canon I guess? The review has been changed to a positive but would definitely be a mixed review if possible, since its a perfect example of how some problems in this game can seriously ruin the immersion it creates. Still a recommend if you can put up with high amounts of jank and potentially frustrating issues, since its a really unique game.

Years later I realize how wrong they were about Kenshi. Not only does this game care about you, it wants to protect you from yourself and keep pushing you forward to success. Dying is actually kind of difficult unless you tweak the settings or act like a complete idiot. Yes, in fact, this game cares about you so much that you are REWARDED for failing. You grow stronger with each battle and even earn more xp for losing. Even with all the settings cranked up to be the most brutal, bandits will never steal your equipped items if they beat you unconscious and rob you, and even if you get imprisoned, the stuff they take is locked away in a chest and never despawns. This game does care about you, in fact, it wants you to succeed, like a stoic parent that knows you need to grow up to be strong so you are prepared for the brutal world ahead of you. It will punish you for stupid mistakes, and reward you for clever strategies, and even if you get beaten nearly to death, you will come out of that experience stronger than ever. In fact, the best way to get stronger early on is to let bandits repeatedly beat the piss out of you. There are so many ways to make money and so many safety nets to pull you back from the brink of losing it all. Even being maimed and losing a limb isn't the end, because you can buy or steal robotic limbs that are as good if not better than what you had before. 

I held off for years from buying this game because I believed the top review at the time telling me ""this game doesn't care about you"" and I took that as ""you can lose everything in an instant because this game isn't fair"" but that just isn't true.

🔸At the beginning the world is far stronger than you. Your character just sucks as you start from very bottom (You will die a lot). 
🔸Play cautiously. Hit spacebar for pause. You will have time to think. Don't try to be a brave guy. 
🔸Save scum. You may find yourself in the middle of the fight suddenly or you might be attacked by neutral factions for something that you have triggered (in towns expecially).
🔸This game is buggy af. Expect crashes, weird things etc. You can import your save file for the last resort.
🔸Border Zone is probably best location for beginners since it has less dangerous bandits and creatures and also it is close to two major factions.
🔸Well you may think that buying a fine weapon and a shining armor set should make stronger you. Remember that actually in Kenshi, literally everything is about your characters' SKILL. Even a decent sabre will do fine job with your op character.
🔸Travel and discover as much as you can. Kenshi is a rpg game that has tons of things to discover. Don't miss the content.
🔸The world Kenshi is unforgiving and brutal. Don't trust anyone.
🔸LOOT, LOOT, LOOT!
🔸There are major factions and they have some kind of set of rules. Learn them and obey their rules if you are penniless weak mfker. And they are waging wars. In fact, in every corner of the world, people kill each other. 
🔸You can set up a base but don't do that at early. It is mid-game content and when you do, you will have to defend your place.
🔸Weapons and gears have pros and cons. You should be saying which one is the best, which one is good for x? Well, it is the learning curve of the game. Search about it and get the overall idea.
🔸You should want to use some backpack for carrying extra stuff. Kenshi offers wide range of backpacks (also for your domesticated animals). If you need huge carrying capacity, then forget about fighting. A small backpack is also usable for ""I want carry stuff and also fight"". Btw, the more you carry, the less speed you'll have while running, and running is everything.
🔸You can find different shops in towns that you can distinguish them by their sign hanged. Night time they are closed. Don't disturb them or else you will be attacked by town guards and then get arrested.
🔸Bars are the places that can you find people for your gang. They will be weak too. Some unique recruits Low-mid range of skills tho.
🔸Food. You will need much food. Buying is easiest way but gathering meat from animals is cost effective (you are not killing them, they will be hunted by who knows. You will just loot the meat).
🔸And finally, prepare a long time-consuming game!",1697727538,1697730421,True,68,0,0.817476093769073486,3,True,False,False

Do not forget that there are a lot of mods, so the game will be interesting for a very long time, and creative people will always have something to do.

All the building blocks are there, it has every feature you could ever ask for and a massive interesting world. But it is the definition of a ocean wide and a puddle deep. I still havent seen everything in the game, but once you see something you basically know everything about it. And it does feel like the features are lacking in alot of ways, for instance there are basically only a handful of armour sets worth using, if you want heavy armour there is samurai armour or there is samurai armour or maybe you could try using some samurai armour (Or I guess crab armour if you want to make your character bad). There is exactly zero interaction when it comes to combat except maybe manually dodging attacks by moving your character but this isnt intentional, stealth is somehow less deep than skyrim, trade is as simple as X city pays Y amounts for Z markets dont change in any way (no way to influence prices by raiding trade caravans or anything like that), the ""evolving world"" is about as complex as if you kill X character Y city becomes destroyed no actual changes in factions no interacting with characters to cause civil wars or take power or change factions in any way, I can count on one maybe two hands the amount of NPCs you can talk to that are more then just ""Give me your money"" or ""Give me your money for Y"" or ""Do X for me"", the game doesn't even have a charisma skill so you can tell how little role playing there is to do in terms of interactions. Etc etc list goes on

Yet somehow for some reason. This is the single most captivating RPG ever made even in its half finished, broken, barely interactive, hardly functional state. Whenever I start a new run a entire week of my life vanishes. I just snap out of a trance with a character that has 90+ in every stat and has single handedly killed what realistically should be the entier population of the island three times over, and just realize that I havent done anything else for the last 5 days and I cant remember the last time I ate dinner. I dont think any other game can make running across a desert for 6 hours straight with 200kg of iron in your backpack to train strength somehow fun. Or just whole sale slaughtering essentially land whales for multiple days in a row and then spending another 5 hours straight of running around the world just to sell those 10kg pearls just so you can get a amount of money you dont actually need. And that is somehow engaging game play. This satanic curse the game somehow puts on me only seems to ware off after I have accomplished some absolutely ridiculous stuff for equally dumb reasons. like ""Oh I want to get to 99 melee attack I guess ill just destroy the entirety of the united cities and holy nation so I can grind my stats a bit more"". ""I want $1 million for no particular reason. I guess ill kill every single bounty in the game with my solo character"". I do not know how or why this game does this, I dont even usually think much about it, but whenever I decide to start a new run for no particular reason this just happens and it really is not okay.",1583743263,1697375805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Trips to where few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where the roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire, seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm
In blood sworn to glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by the unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches' blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitch's leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise into apocalyptic skies
Beware, God is watching
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

All I was doing was roaming and figuring out how to play. I struggled badly and I didn't understand until I got a feel and just did things my way. In Kenshi, you can become a lot of different things and partake in different events or roles. I specifically decided I wanted to do whatever I wanted. Fight any factions, steal from whoever, and just roam the lands as a person with no goal but to do what I want. Instead of having a goal, I just roam and figure out what I wanna do on the spot. I've joined and fought against so many different factions. The main character I've been playing for a while now is named bruhman. He is very special too me in a way. Bruhman is a martial artist, and for awhile I've been getting him very strong and trying to have him reach too the top in Kenshi. He's super good at lock picking, stealth running/walking, and thievery. My main way of getting cats for him is too just steal and sell. All these people are making farms and that's pretty cool but It's just easier for me too steal from shops and resell to tech hunters. I know I said I didn't have any goals, but I've been coming up with goals for bruhman. Too be the best martial artist, the strongest, and just dominate the terrifying lands of Kenshi. So far that's been going well. I hope whoever is reading this plans on getting Kenshi, if you truly understand the game, you won't regret it.

You have a couple options but you're new so you go to the only building you see nearby with the word BAR out front.

Food, weapons, bounty posters, books, random materials, etc. But you'll also notice something else, you can barely afford lunch let alone a weapon, so you buy yourself some food and maybe some bandages if you spot them and head out of town to try and figure out how to make money to get equipment. You'll probably see the iron resource nearby or if you're clever the copper ones a little further away and start mining, but it's slow and boring, so you speed up time. After watching for a little bit you probably get bored take what you've mined and sell it for scraps. maybe if you spent a couple hours doing this you'd get enough money to gear yourself but that's boring, so you go off to fight something. Maybe you got a weapon, probably a low quality katana or a saber and looking for a direction to go you look at your map and see a location called Squin. So you right click and watch, then you run across a group of hungry bandits. Now, you're not an idiot and you know you cant 1v10 a group of bandits even if they're starving so you run. You manage to outrun most and now only one is chasing you, now surely you're character weak as they are can beat a malnourished bandit so you send them to fight the single bandit. You lose.

Its borderline for me to recommend because the game is really hard work. But hard work in a good way if you stick with it.

Its taken me 20 hours to actually click with it. Multiple restarts, giving up early on and not playing then the other day i decided to give it another try. I started as the enslaved guy and for some reason this gave me a purpose and got me playing, trying to escape.

The game is really unique in how hard it is, giving you little to no help and zero direction so you have to make your own adventures. But once you figure it you can have a cool experience. 

So far in my  new game ive recruited a good band of 4 (plus me) and tried to set up a base, this was captured and taken over and i had to run for my life. Had near death with beak things, luckily ran into some beserkers who killed them for me, and as i went to heal their leader as thanks the jumped on me, so time to run again all the way back to the city. 

The game works best if you tentatively explore but be ready to run, take some fights nearer the cities but keep a man in reserve dont commit everyone, because if you all get ko and badly, no one will wake. 

So far this seems to work well for me and im loving the game. Just raided an old cache of old tech and got ""rich"" in my terms of over 20,000 gold (To mine a day you will  make about 3 k with 2 or 3 people to put that in context. My guys are secure with food in their bellies, semi decent gear and learning new skills.

The downsides to this game are really hidden storytelling and world building. There are small books which give really limited info in pubs. Some people give you one or two lines of conversation but its really limited. At first this is cool but later it becomes frustrating as you dont know why anything is as it is or who is doing what. They should have put more books into the world for you to read and made the characters in town have longer conversation lines and such, the system is capable of doing it. Just something simple like a guy who describes whats going on in that faction or a guy who you can ask questions but there is very little of that.

As an example in one town you can ask ""you want an alliance"" to which they say why would i ally with a guy with a rusty sword? And then you can say well what if i kill blah blah for you? But who even is this blah blah? I dont know who im offering to kill or where they are?  This side of the game is severly lacking and would be really really simple to remedy... If i  knew how to make mods and a bit about the lore i could even do it. 

Other than that the radiant events that happen are what make the game great, and watching the computer create moments. These ultimately save the game if you are willing to keep trying and get through the early stages.

Another great gameplay moment I had for example was seeing a group of guys in an outpost, Kralls Chosen. The guys are tough for me but i noticed a big fight between them and some traders. The fight was so close and i ran in to try to help the traders, backing back out when it was going badly. The traders won and i managed to get the leader of Kralls chosen who had a 30k bounty!!! This is insane early game. I grabbed him and my other team mate who had her leg wrecked and so my team of 3 (this was early game) headed to the nearest city to turn in the bounty. 2 running with one friend one enemy on their backs. Then when i was almost there a group of wolves attacked me. I had to drop the body and fight for my life. The whole team were downed and as this fight went on the bad guy got up an limped off lol!! I managed to get one companion up, and he dragged one of the others back to town and then came back for my main companion who was comatose but the enemy was nowhere to be seen just blood, so wether the dogs got him or he escaped who knows. 

But thats an example of the ""radiant"" kind of events that can happen and what makes me give the game a positive review despite its flaws. I would say maybe wait for a sale and maybe be sure you can put the effort in and it will reward you. 

Sorry if this review is a bit long but i had to explain as its not simple.",1697205960,1697205960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i was having a great time to build up my own dojo - after some years of traveling the whole world solo -
forming my own army and returning home after weeks of conquest.. feels just awesome.
Try some mods :)

Can`t wait for Kenshi 2!!!


some of my wishes:

1. thirst                                  
(a desert with no need to drink..?)

2. moral / resolve      
(selfpreservation, maybe add some kind of hunger/ thirst total madness maybe for motivation, so we know why the 5 naked guys attack the 20 samurai)

3. social skills
(charisma for trade, bribe, haggle, maybe leadership radius ""moral+"")

4. advanced boni from your gear 
(show your wealth for better trade / spread fear with rare armor, weapons)

5. moveable bases - ships would be awesome. 
(and a tool for auto camp building (set group of tents, fireplaces, palisades etc. == save/load layout)

6. on/off advertisement for players faction, make people come to you for a better life - 
maybe even deserters of existing other factions 
( let the player choose what race for what jobs are required etc. - let slave traders visit me when i am in need for manpower and everyone knows me for having money)
(when new recruits die in masses, less people should join - maybe some sort of faction fame/food/honor rating stuff)

7. make money a physical thing existing in the gameworld! would love factions really collecting ressources/taxes

I was drawn in by the sheer ambition on display. Base building meets squad management meets dynamic world state! Non-linear storytelling with no level scaling! These are big, exciting features, and with people comparing it to giants like [i]Runescape[/i] and [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i], my interest was piqued.

The incredibly strong aesthetic helped grab the attention, too. Kenshi presents a wholly original vision, a post-post apocalypse setting chock full of poignant scenery and surprising dangers. The environments and music are simply stunning, and the sheer scope of the setting gives the game an eerie vibe that ratchets up the immersion nicely.

Sadly, being pretty and ambitious isn’t enough.

Though it delivers on many of its promises, Kenshi is held back by a pacing problem. For some, the incredibly slow pace of the game is an attraction. The argument goes that being a hero is more rewarding if you spend lots of time as a zero first. Though I appreciate the logic, getting anywhere and accomplishing anything takes [i]forever[/i], and attempting to speed the process is a great way to get yourself killed and sent back to square one.

This laborious, raise-stats-over-days style of RPG has largely fallen out of vogue, except among people with a huge amount of spare time. They’re just too much effort for most people when there are better returns on their time investment to be found elsewhere. If I want to fantasize about being a post-apocalyptic warlord, there are games that will let me do that without 80+ hours of grind.

Beyond the pacing issue, Kenshi’s systems suffer from a bad case of ‘video game logic’, and are often poorly explained or implemented. For example, base building is a mid-game activity - do it too early, and you’re dead. Trying to run a shop only works under very specific circumstances, and is absolutely not a good way to make money. Despite offering a non-linear, player-directed story, Kenshi has pretty specific expectations of you, and until you learn to write within the lines, it’ll kill you a lot.

Finally - and this is simply a matter of personal taste - the ultraviolence of the setting failed to capture me. Kenshi’s world is a canvas of human misery, hacked off limbs, slavery, and subsistence farming. The chaotic sandbox is designed to encourage and reward a tribalist mentality. Props for setting a vibe, but I found it too unrelentingly grim.

If you’re gaming on limited hardware, have a compatible kind of neurodivergency, and/or have unlimited free time, Kenshi could be the game of your dreams. It’s unique, brave and impressively deep. The sad truth is, despite these qualities, I didn’t enjoy my time with it at all. Not recommended.",1697002174,1697003138,False,4,2,0.454571813344955444,0,True,False,False

------------------------------
This is an Update to the kenshi review as I was only a few hours into the game (100) at the time of writing I have around 588 hours so here's my review
1. the game is amazing brutal, hard, painful and stressful but still Amazing this game is basically Sisyphus but your actually making progress up the hill with instead of a boulder an entire island (and beep) replacing it
2. the world from deserts to tropical forests to fog eating men to Slave working cities Kenshi has A LOT of things to explore however this doesn't mean I have some nitpicks with the world like Dreg and screaming forest at the very least some kind of town would of been nice or coastal village with a few cool NPC's to chat to like freed rebirth slaves or escaped HN women
3. the weapons from kenshi are pretty nice as they both have ups and downs, want to be a quick samurai go with a katana wanna be a Small personal with a BFA (Big fucking axe) be my guess kenshi has alot of weapons and grades to defend yourself from the various factions same thing can be said for the armor alot of cool shit to find and wear
4. the Lore in kenshi is fun as hell to uncover which I won't say much but its basically Fallout Dust, hell is back with different factions roaming the island",1605629840,1696792500,True,1,1,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Extremely open ended, almost to a fault, it allows you to write the story from the start. Solo rogue/thief? Mining company? Rampaging bandits? You can do all of those things and more. 

I will say that things started to feel stale towards end game, when the game design requires highly repetitive grinding, especially on the combat side. I'd suggest modding the game from the start, especially some of the QoL and stat building mods that help speed up the mid-game (where you spend loads of time leveling skills). Also, the squad management tools/design is sorely outdated and very buggy - you spend a ton of time fighting the actions of individual minions. 

Anyway, total recommend but your mileage will vary. I'm nearly done for this push at 160 hours, though I could see myself coming back to do a completely different path next time.",1696791191,1696791191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Examples:
#1: You build two building sites close to each other, [this is natural as one area might have something the other lacks,] The two then join and suddenly you are closer to a town so you can no longer build on one of the sites.
#2: Workers won't use stuff automatically from animal backpacks.
#3: Walls built on hilly terrain often split so you can't walk on them, and you have to spend a literal half hour to hour just making the game work as it should from the get-go fixing the walls. [If you can't walk on walls you can't man crossbows, which are literally the only counter you have against the huge bandit waves that pop up from day 1 and attack your settlement].
#4 Can't build stuff too close to eachother. If you could build ramps more freely it would be fine for the aforementioned as you could just patch up the symptom instead of addressing the problem, but even the tiniest clip will prevent you from placing things.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game but I will change my review to positive when the game improves the building system so it doesn't literally give me depression. This whole game is about dealing with setbacks and improving on them but I can't  deal with the trash bugs and flaws in the building system on top of that.
If you decide to build in this game, I recommend you only pick a site with everything you need close together [good luck finding that lol] And on completely flat ground. Note that you will likely never find an aforementioned site as stated previously that would circumvent some of the pain I feel with this game.
Also a brightness setting would be good as it's hard to see at night if you have windows open.

Edit: I got a jester emoji for pointing out the bad building interface? I mean, if you like spending 2 hours trying to fix walls more power to you. Go build a base on hilly terrain and you will see what I mean. Or was it for my window comment? Lol",1694264164,1696789320,False,17,1,0.619766056537628174,0,True,False,False

It's the only one I have for Steam actually - I've fallen down the MMO hole before and this is a nice RTS inspired RPG sandbox. There are a lot of things I hope they're improving for the sequel. Many of the systems seem well executed but ultimately need fine tuning and further exploration. What I would hope for, but is not coming, is an alteration of the Ogre Engine to update the reliance on a single processor (which I think was what it was doing) to multiple processors so that everything would run like a modern game. The only things to be desired are the before mentioned expansion of features and a graphics upgrade for sure - is that a bandit in the distance? Sure looks like a speck of pixels dancing in the distance... haha. Kenshi is my favorite - actually it's the type of game I've imagined could exist, as far back as my first time playing Starcraft as a kid. I think the way forward is to turn Kenshi's world and game experience into a Elder Scrolls type of game, in the sense of depth, graphics, interaction, lore and freedom - without  losing the RTS controls. I also wish for a Kenshi experience that incorporates online play, but maybe only local online gameplay with friends. I don't think Kenshi should have a heavy RTS competition mode, but it would be an interesting thing to experiment with. RTS was more or less a sport in the past - I think the RPG approach is better - however the things that Kenshi may lack is the feeling of being truly threatened by a thinking, strategizing opponent, whether that be another person or a machine. I could nitpick on all sorts of details of the gameplay/systems/features right now, but the game is amazing for something a single human being has developed on their own from an indie perspective.

SD-9 was my first solo skeleton play-through and I immediately decided to make my way up to Worlds End to make a temporary foothold in good territory. I came across a myconid named Paras that could only... well, say Paras. Paras had no ability to trade with store owners, talk to NPC;s, or interact with them in anyway except physical. This made Paras a prime candidate to be my first martial artist. 

Standing at about 1m Paras was quiet, deadly, and would yell ""KYAAAAAAH!"" whenever he got a good blow in. The little guy was a boxing, break dancing fiend.

But even with him and my massive Skeleton marksman it wasn't enough as Kenshi often proves. I picked up a few skeleton hirelings, got them trained up on a myriad of combat and non-combat abilities, and began heading north. Much of the playthrough consisted of raiding labs, getting clapped, and having to heal my boys between running away. But then I met Rabbit, and my game changed forever.

I had never messed with prosthetics in previous playthroughs, and decided Rabbit, a spindly skeleton with skill in martial arts, was going to be the Logan to my weapon X project. After successfully removing all of Rabbits limbs (making sure to have medici bots on standby with a bed) I attached two masterwork sword legs I had pillaged, and two chainsaw arms. Rabbit became a beyblade dervish of death, and the little bugger saved my salvage crew multiple times including beating the ever loving frack out of a leviathan. 

I had a massive skeleton named Brick that was trained to take no damage single-handedly wipe out two Okranite raiding parties. He still stands guard, occasionally beating the living daylights out of dismembered foes with his trademark spiked bat. 

I made drugs, sold drugs, and built a large facility as an outpost where I intend to make the worlds best weapons and sell them at large across the world. I intend to wipe out all the Okranites and supply the enemy forces with top grade weapons and armor to do so. 

Long live Blade Baron Works. Long live Kenshi.

Mount & Blade has a similar place in my heart, it’s a real piece of love you will never find in a regular studios product. Chris Hunt (and everyone at lo-fi studios by extension) deserves their success and Kenshi 2 is one of the only games I’ve been seriously waiting and looking at news for. 

The reviews saying it has all the ingredients for not so great games is true, it’s grindy, slow, punishing in a way that feels not fair sometimes BUT ITS EXCELLENT in spite of and thanks to these elements. You win one fight or make it to the next town and you’re legit happy to make it and explore a new zone or just rest at a bar. Like how Star Wars Battlefront or Kingdom Come Deliverance was fun because you get to be a single lil guy in a larger conflict and can become a force on your own that same feeling exists here but WAY better. If you’re a beast you earned it, if you get fucked you earned it. 

Mod community goes hard, base game is good but the community really elevates the experience for everyone. Idk what else to say the game is fucking cool dude give it a try.

- kidnapped and slapped a fat lady in her folds before redistributing her meaty fat to the poor before burning down another farm and made them starve more
- got on my breaking bad on with a “funny lettuce” delivery system and made more than I ever did as a copper mining company
- accidentally release a worse threat to the world then the more of the groups I’ve killed

Set up an outpost (don't do this early-game though, my mistake) and was constantly attacked by roving bands of bandits whom I could down, but you can't execute enemies in this game for some fucking reason??? which led to a literal horde of unconscious bandits that piled up quicker than I could remove from my outpost. This led to them constantly waking up and just beating the shit out of my characters over, and over, and over, and we were too hurt to run away fast enough from the first few fights. Then, again, with a completely new save and character I was just chilling in a shop and got murked by the entire town guard for NO REASON. 

Me being murdered in those two situations was obviously a bug and completely unintended, but I was just using the game's systems (selling slaves and items) and got punished for it. I also find it completely ridiculous that a game renowned for being brutal does not allow you to execute downed enemies, yet my characters are constantly left bleeding out for 20 minutes of REAL TIME at max game speed after every fight.

Now lets talk about the GAME...

The gameplay is crap. Poor optimization after...whut....5 years in EA?? No tutorials except pop ups ( which seem to lag the game...ie..optimization). 

Everything is a chore, which includes keeping your head on the proverbial swivel if you travel 20 feet from the starter city gate.

Inventory management is laggy and confusing. 

Again....I bought Kenshi YEARS ago and NO progress has been made AT ALL to improve ANYTHING afaik.

I assume the dev(s) either took the money and ran or is as slow as R R Martin ( may have to google that)

I would advise passing OR get on sell and moniter updates ( if / when they come)

I wish the one-man studio were 4 or 5 instead. I wish they had a solid team of devs on it. I wish they had they had more and better artists. I wish this had AAA build level...

I wish I could play game in the mind and dreams of the developer. 

This is a concept master-piece, painted in a cement wall with a broom for a brush and dirt for paint... I cant stop wishing it was better, but I also cannot stop returning to it.
Congrats to the dev for the guts. For the sweat, tears and blood poured into this game. It's the product of stubbon love... and I love it.

This, released with full functionality, with modern visuals and tech would simply kill the market. (a very simple storyline wouldnt be bad either).
DO NOT touch OST, is the best i've heard in a long time.

Now you can disregard all the rest.

___________________________________________

I've installed the EXPERIMENTAL version and, guess what, 70% less bugs!... The world is a little ""off""... Some things are missing, the npcs routines within town are weird, but hey... it's an early access, it's the ""test"" version, so i guess it's supposed to be this way. At least the game is playable enought for me to change my rocomendation... Enjoy the rest of the review (... or not... it's boring! :P)

This is actually a very unique game, with some features that make it (or could make) an addictive game. So, why did it got my negative review? Well... Let me start by decribid the good about this game (in my opinion).
So this is a 50-50 mix or classic RTS with RPG, you play and control everything from an aerial perspective. It takes place in a desert world filled with other NPS, and factions, and cities, beasties, robbers, cannibals. All have their own individual agendas. You can start with a single charcacter or with a small group (the game gives you hints about the ""game style"": more RTS or more RPG...), and once in the game you can do everything that comes to your mind or become almost anything. The rule is, if you see it hapening, you can do it too (wich is nice!).

At first you can make money by trading (there is a very dynamic and responsive economy) or you can scavage the land, steal, kill some baddies and take their stuff. Later you can have a hole bunch of people at your service (you recruit over time), build a citie or your own, found a faction, develop relations with others, extract materials from the land, transform them into valuable items.
Combat is very simple (just pause click click unpause wait) but very tactic. You can win or lose based on you strategy.
Each member of your group takes a specific role and you can train them to become more efective, give them ""jobs"", equip them (very oldscholl RPG, also nice!). After some time you have pretty complex production lines and organized tasks within your citie(s) to get everything working like a clock (very RTS).
If you are more of a warmonguer yourself you can orient all you production to get weapons a armor and train a hole bunch of ""soldiers"". Attack other faction (u crazy?!?), get rid of some cannibals, hunt some laaarge beast...
Every task you set to do gets an epic proportion because the game lets you ""micromanage"" almost everything. And because the world is so dynamic you always have to expect the unplanned. That makes everything so much interesting!

Example: u assemble a team of 6 proud warriors, well trained and better equipped, and set out to the nest of some very big, ugly and smelly beast to steal their valuable eggs and precious leather. U get to the nest, and after and epic fight you manage to kill the beast and take your prize. You barely escaped with you lives but your pockets are full you feel like the kings of the universe! You bandage and head back home. On your way back, you are ambushed by a fairly weak group of bandits, wounded and weak you fall to their blades and they take your hard earned beast-prize... After a while you group awakes, one brave champion had not resisted the injuries and would not wake again, you mourn the loss and..... REVENGEE!!!!! heheh
Get the point? The game doesnt have a main story and doesnt particulary gives you any objective at all, and yet it manages to give you a a proper scenario for all this little tales to take place and after a while you have a story of your own.
The world doesnt depend on your actions to progress, it has its own dynamic and its own agenda, you and your faction are just another element of it.

""THEN WHY ARE YOU GIVING A NEGATIVE REVIEW?"" you ask...
Simple, i love all of what i just described and the game would be perfect if I could play it for MORE THAN 3 MINUTES WITHOUT A CRASH, a misscalculated stat, a forgotten status, a corrupt savegame, a reset of squad status, a reset of the economy...................
It just makes it impossible to not want to break the PC into thousands of pieces and then burn the pieces and bury them.
I love my PC so i'll just stop playing this. I've waited 1 year, and the bugs just kept increasing. Let's just say, i lost my faith in this project.

NOTE TO THE DEVELOPER: please just focus on stability, then focus on game data loss (like character status, and character stats loss, or even training benefits loss or reset...) I have waited more than 1 year since i bought the game to try it and be fair with it in my review. In that year you brought some fairly interesting improvements to game features (i admit that, yes) but also a gargantuan number of annoying bugs that made it simply unplayable.
I promise to check the game again in 2 months, and i'll gladly change this review.",1456074221,1695473618,True,0,0,0,4,True,False,True

Would you like to set up a base? Go * Yourself.  You will be raided non-stop until you go download 19 mods to make the game playable since the SLIDERS IN THE OPTIONS TO SELECT NEVER DOES NOT WORK!  No matter how you set the raid and attack options, it makes no difference whatsoever.

Would you like to wander the wastes after super power leveling the crap out of your character to all 90+ stats? Go for it!  We'll just have you miss 19 dodges in a row and be ""rarely"" decapitated by a STARVING WEAKLING with a strength of 4, a death that was decided BEFORE the starving waste of life was even spawned in! (Tested, had a save before anyone was spawned in, around the corner was one single starving bandit that was already injured, killed me every time I loaded no matter what I did, gameplay tested!)

Would you like to clean up your base?  Haha, go choke on someone else's cares, you dumb *.  Because another group of Dust Bandits are spawning just outside your vision and are going to attack while you are still trying to remove the corpses from the last attack.  We dont even give a * that you killed our King and claimed the bounty and now the Demands cannot happen, these are WANDERING spawns, so we get to cheat because our single person dev doesn't give a crap about you.

Would you like to properly defend your base with common sense things like patrol routes or guard positions, the way the AI already does it anyway so why would it be a big deal?  Why are you still trying to have fun?  No Sir, you need to download 3 MORE mods to add this functionality because the dev is too lazy to do it.

Not to worry, though!  The dev did build in one super handy tool that they ""claim"" fixes everything!  Just Import your save.  What does it do? Deletes all your stuff on the ground!  Tired of all those messy materials or backpacks you dropped or those weapons you removed from the 300 dead bodies piling up ready to crash your game?  Just Import your save!  It's so easy, all you have to do it exit the freaking game completely and re-launch it because the option to import is on the main menu and we hate you so we did not allow you to get there from inside a game, neat huh?  Careful not to hit the Continue button by accident, because then you have to re-launch it again, you stupid * piece of....

So that's it.  If you are into ridiculous levels of modding in order to make a game even marginally playable, Kenshi is your game!  Otherwise, go * yourself.

TLDR: Terrible planning, execution, support, development, and coding.  Only play if you are very proficient at modding.  Unplayable without severe overhaul.",1695251506,1695251506,False,5,4,0.417916566133499146,0,True,False,False

Within just a brief hour of gameplay, this game effortlessly shattered my expectations and swiftly claimed the throne as a temporary favorite. It is an absolute masterpiece, albeit not without a few inherent drawbacks that can easily be rectified by mods.

I wholeheartedly endorse Kenshi as a game that deserves recognition from everyone. However, I advise players to equip themselves with mods before embarking on their journey. These modifications effectively address and resolve most, if not all, of the game's limitations, propelling the experience to unprecedented heights. Kenshi serves as a beacon, an exemplar of what open-world games should aspire to be, catering to a diverse and enthusiastic audience.

The game resonated with me on such a profound level that I am compelled to bestow upon it a rating of 9 out of 10. This stands as a testament to the developers' unwavering dedication and boundless creativity. I eagerly await their future endeavors, eager to see what they have in store for us next.

But that's not the worst part. The real challenge was trying to micromanage a group of characters with the attention span of a goldfish. I lost count of how many times I had to run back and save my characters from certain doom after they decided to go on a walkabout by themselves.

If you like a challenge, this game is worth checking out. It is a grind, that is certain, but as someone who doesn't generally like grindy games, this one actually struck home for me, for some reason. It feels rewarding, watching a character's stat increase by even a single point, especially with how easily that character could be maimed, slaughtered, cannibalized or forcefully amputated. By the time I had my first proper base established, I was feeling pretty high up, my squad even defended their home from one of the big factions that we upset, with aid from the allies we'd made. 
Yet, Kenshi didn't let me ride the high for very long, and soon it humbled me by cutting off my main man's left arm, to remind me of my place in the natural order. BUT, now he sports a mechanical prosthetic in its place, and it's made him even more dangerous than before, despite being one of the lower end arms.

I tried to look for these ""Building Materials"" and could not find any, and after about 10 min I was ambushed and enslaved. sOoOooO mUcH fUN!

That absolute nonsense aside, the graphics are absolutely horrendous, and the controls are annoying and clunky.

If you ever wanted to play a survival game with precision control similar to one of those Claw Machines, that looks like it was made in MS Paint, this is perfect for you. If you want to play a game for fun? I'd suggest passing on this.

Hard to leave review for a game you cant really compare to any other game.
Game feels like it's set in post apocalyptic desert environment like mad max but with Japanese feel and stile.
You fight with hand weapons only (maces, cantatas, swords, bows, shields ...)  and your actions improve your skill that you are using, there is no levelling. 
Example: running while carrying heavy load improves your strength, fighting with cantatas improves your cantata fighting skill ect...
You have to play for a bit to learn which enemies are weaker and which one you should run from. There is no easy way of knowing who should you fight and who not to.
You can lose your limbs and get robotic new ones. You can be enslaved or have bounty on your head, you can also play it as a strategy building game and control your new built settlement.

It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. 

Here's a tale from my experience with the game;

This is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. 
Near the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.
Peace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... 
And from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.
Things were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.
The Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.
All but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.
I could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.
Jump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.

There is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.

In short, get this game. It is just great.",1677448155,1694635907,True,0,0,0.452272325754165649,0,True,False,False

While there isn't much direct story, and mostly in the background for the setting, learning as you go. The game may have a high learning curve, with a somewhat janky UI and learning can be a brutal process, potentially frustrating if you are not invested enough to put the effort in. I do recommend any new player put themselves in the proper mindset to push through that part.

However, throughout that process, I discovered one of my favorite games of all time. Kenshi is a game that can be enjoyed in elaborately different ways.

-Do you want to play a single-character focused RPG? 
-Do you want to play a settlement simulator similar to Rimworld? 
-Do you want to play a real-time CRPG focusing on a single party/squad?
-Do you want to play a squad management focused game, managing resources and different objectives you create for yourself?

All of these things in this glorious sandbox, are various ways you can enjoy and play the game. To make the story yourself and play it in anyway you want. Not to mention, the elaborate Mod Community. A personal favorite of mine is the Star Wars conversion mod. 

Please give this game a chance, and you'll enjoy an incredible experience unique to this game.

Kenshi is one of my all-time favorite games and is one that I find myself returning to somewhat regularly. I think the reason for its success is captured in it's mission statement: player agency and decisions. While there are a couple of optimal ways to play, there are many viable ways, especially when you consider that there are no predefined win conditions. There are quite a few categories of stats that can be worked on, some of which work well together, while others need to be focused on separately (you're not going to level weapon smithing while being a ninja). You can run a solo character in a game that feels like a more traditional RPG (which is still put together very well, even by itself) or play with many characters within a faction in a playthrough that feels almost like an RTS (not quite as fun as a dedicated RTS imo, but adds greatly to the rest of your options and can support your other goals). Mix, match, and enjoy! When you need to freshen up your experience, head over to the workshop, where there are many great mods that add to or overhaul the Kenshi experience, giving you more things to do, people to meet, items to collect, and enemies to face.

This may all make Kenshi sound like an easy game. It isn't, but that's part of the fun, since you know that if you meet a threat stronger than you (which is most of them at first), there is a very good chance you'll have the living daylight beaten out of you and you'll end up bleeding out, wanted by the law/serving a prison sentence, eaten, or enslaved. However, as any Kenshi player knows: anything that doesn't kill you gives you XP. In this way, the game is brutal and forgiving at the same time, which greatly adds to the enjoyment. Keep trying, and you'll make it, and you'll get a real rush when you finally solo a group of enemies that used to destroy you one-on-one.

I only have a couple of minor criticisms, which don't bother me too much, but I thought I ought to bring them up:

1) The game is kinda grindy. The only way you'll get stronger is through practice, and this goes for every skill. Also, your character(s) are garbage at doing things at first, so you'll lose most of the time early on. On the other hand, basically anything you do other than sitting around will get you XP in some category.

2) While Kenshi is open-world, it's not entirely seamless. Moving between different segments of the map entails some loading.

That's just the way the story unfolds. The first time I played this game was years ago, my first playthrough was when the map had maybe... 1/16th of the map open at the time, if even that. I started as a guy with a dog, walked out of the small waystation it spawned you in, got my ass beat my bandits, they butchered my unconscious dog for food, and left me unconscious in the desert until I died from blood loss three days later.

-The AI felt so realistic with how they interact with you when first encountered, their prompts are hilarious to see. I still like them a lot. 
-Lore and how it fits into the gameplay is nice.
-Skeletons

Cons:
-Loading world chunks is frequent and annoying, thankfully the loading is not slow.

- I was expecting a thrilling experience judging from the reviews and what do I get? Whacked around wherever I go.
Just a lazy way of telling you ""the game is hardcore""

- The lore in the game? Yeah, it's not as interesting as people portray it to be ... I can tolerate mundane lore but kenshi in my eyes seems to lack any depth to it. Once again, don't get the hype.

- User interface/Controls or Learning the game? I swear I had an easier time learning Everquest project 1999 as a newbie.

- The world environment? Vast emptiness that's got nothing interesting to offer other than a load of mobs/factions trying to maul you. (Except the swamps, the swamps were cool to discover so thumbs up to that)

- Quests? Pffft yeah, virtually none existent in my short time of playing this game.

- Combat is trash. Simply put trash. I understand the aspect of trying to portray your character as being worth nothing and be an absolute good for nothing nobody but at least give me a fair chance of deciding my own worth in combat for god's sake. (Out come the fan boys telling me that if I micro manage my positioning and my block/attack ratio about 1000 times per each combat session + grind my combat/toughness skill I'll be able to take on an entire squad of 16 people or some sh*t)

- The grind. I've played enough RPGs/MMOs/Survival games, can we please stop normalizing grinding in games? This is yet another piss poor excuse of prolonging 'gameplay'. There is nothing fun/engaging about it and usually the satisfaction time you get out of it is minimal at best.

- Graphics? I personally do like them, just a shame that there is very little sight seeing in game to enjoy them. (Unless as previously mentioned, you're in the swamps)

I get it. It's a sandbox game. There is not meant to be any goal within the game other than to 'survive' really but at least make the game SOMEWHAT interesting other than throwing in cannibals and skin stealers to entertain the empty void that this game provides. (HURR DURR DURR MODS)

TLDR; Severely disappointed, would not recommend to anyone unless they're big into games like HOI IV or CK III/Europa Universalis and that's a big stretch in itself I believe. Tried to force myself to play it and it ain't clicking chief.

> Manage to make enough money to buy a good load of food rations. I  go to the tavern outside of town to trade the fruits of my labour when it is suddenly ransacked by a group of bandits. They mercilessly slaughter the shopkeep and his guards. I managed to make it out in time but they gash up my leg. It's a good thing I bought a first-aid kit.
> Continue to mine every day to earn as much money as I can. After I've bought up a good portion of food, I set out for Squin, a Shek settlement a few miles away. As I approach the gate, I come across the rotting corpse of a starved bandit, his hand reaching towards the gate in desparation. Poor devil. Feeling a bit guilty, but in need of good clothes to protect me from the elements, I take his shirt and pants. He won't be needing them anyway.
> On my way towards Squin, I am harrassed by more bandits who knick me in the head with a bolt, but I manage to outrun them and make it into town. The guards slaughter the bastards. I patch up my head and make my way to a nearby Inn to rest up.

> I decide to take a break from mining and explore the surrounding areas with my posse. After some travelling, we come across the reeking Swamps south of Squin. We venture into the swamps to see if there is anything of value.

I ended up regaining consciousness, unlocked my shackles and limped back to the hub - only to be finished off by yet another group of bandits halfway there.

Building a base triggers and event where gets attacked by OP bandits who will take it from you.

From the moment I stepped foot into the harsh landscapes of Kenshi, I was utterly captivated. The depth of the world-building is simply astounding. Whether you're a lone wanderer or a leader of a thriving faction, the immersive storytelling keeps you engaged at every turn.

One of the most remarkable aspects is the freedom of choice. You're not tied to a linear narrative; instead, you forge your own path. Want to be a wandering trader? Or perhaps a fearsome warrior? The game accommodates every playstyle seamlessly. The intricacies of the economy, survival mechanics, and base building offer a level of depth that's both rewarding and challenging.

The characters you encounter are richly detailed, each with their own motivations and stories. Whether it's forming alliances, recruiting companions, or facing off against foes, every interaction feels authentic and meaningful.

Graphically, Kenshi's distinct art style paints a post-apocalyptic world that's both bleak and beautiful. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny speaks volumes about the dedication of the developers.

While Kenshi's learning curve can be steep, the journey is undeniably worth it. The sense of accomplishment as you overcome hurdles and grow stronger is unmatched.

In conclusion, Kenshi is a masterpiece that offers an unparalleled sandbox experience. It's a world where you're not just playing a game, but creating your own saga. If you're seeking a truly immersive, challenging, and endlessly enjoyable adventure, Kenshi is the game you've been waiting for.",1692921487,1692921487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, after talking about the game for so long with a close friend of mine, I decided ""Heck it, I'll give it a try."". Little did I know how quickly this game will challenge me. Being dropped into the middle of nowhere. Choosing what is considered the worst race to start with (Not knowing that at the time). Feeling completely helpless and lost in the already intimidating and desolate landscape right smack dab in the middle between the United Cities and Holy Nation warring area. Needless to say, yikes!

In my honest opinion, it took me quite a bit of time to get adjusted to how this game played. It is unforgiving, relentless and punishing for anyone new to the game. Having to be very careful with your fragile character(s). Stealthing around, gauging your attacks and knowing when to flee (or play dead, if unfortunate to run away and you miraculously survive). This game single-handedly gave me an amazing experience that I am pleasantly surprised to have. It has a lot of depth, working mechanical parts. Everything feels like it has meaning. The landscape, the combat, the interactions — pretty much *everything*. This game has a lot of downtime and you will park your rear just healing a lot of time until you become more familiar with the land, more geared up, more experienced and tougher. Oddly enough, it's not discouraging. If anything, it encouraged me more to press forward in this ""survival of the fittest"" landscape that also has some of the most dangerous endemic life or even simply the people who run any town(s). 

I really can not express the level of detail this game has. It has really become one of my favorite games. It is very odd considering it is an RTS but hey, when a game is good, a game is good. I really hope when Kenshi 2 comes out, it is just as engaging and enjoyable as this is and I look forward to what Lo-Fi Games comes up with.",1692497727,1692497727,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

NOW ALL NEW PLAYERS, 
I want you to know that at 19 hours played i'm still new, to explain further. 

At 19 hours I just:
1. Expanded my crew to 7, it was at 5 and it was kinda rough some days cus food was hard to come by. Making it to a city and then earning cash to make food was sometimes a chore; its like real work, but its so rewarding.
2. Finally found a secure way to make a good source of money, all I'll say is that it revolves around mining and an efficient way to do it. I don't want to spoil it to much cus honestly it was the most rewarding feeling ever to fiqure that out.
3. Started winning fights vs the bottom of the barrel gangs, aka the hungry bandits. I will say, the learning curve is massive, i'm still learning and I feel so achieved just where i'm at now figuring out a strategy to handle big fights with my 7 guys. Skill is everything, numbers isn't. THOUGH that doesn't mean go fight some massive gang cus sometimes them numbers get real lucky, but you want less people at first so they can actually level up.(and you can afford to feed them)

That's all ill say for now, but the game is definitely worth it at full price; this is the most fun i've had with a single player game in a long time if i'm quite honest!",1692262764,1692262764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nope, It's just death and slavery and to do anything else you need to install mods.

I would start off slow with just mining copper and selling it at a town and use that town as a [base] until you have at least 5 people,oh and i would get the medical bed mod to help heal your people faster other wise you well be watching everyone sleep for 15+ mins.",1687313575,1691876434,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

There's a lot working against this game. I bought it well over a decade ago, wrote it off, only to find out the madman making it had worked on it for the entire time it took me to graduate college, work in my industry, realize I hate it, and go back to school, and finally they released it in 2018. It's full of jank, built on ancient technology and after all that development time pieces still feel like they are obviously missing. It refuses to explain itself beyond the bare essentials and does not respect your time. It's incredibly easy to make a decision that will take you hours to implement and then hours more to realize has doomed you. It's simultaneously punishingly difficult and incredibly exploitable if you are so disposed. It's unapologetically dark and full of cannibals, slavery, drugs, and murder. It's a workshop heavy game, with all the stress that comes with that. It is NOT for everyone. 

But dagnabbit if you are the type of person to persist past all of that does this game suck you in. It has the open world and oblique world building of an elder scrolls game combined with a degree of freedom and self-determination that I can't think of seeing anywhere else. It feels like a fully realized world that is having a conversation with you. It tells you you are weak by throwing hordes of starving bandits at you who pummel you into the ground but the very act of standing up again makes your people stronger. It tells you that you are inconsequential, sends taxmen to shake you down, runs you out of town, until one day you come back trained and armed and kill the leader of a faction and throw the entire world into chaos. It smites you with acid rain and orbital lasers and raids by bloodthirsty slavers even as you slowly build up a city of your own construction into one that rivals any of the established communities on the continent. It has crab tournaments!

I have simultaneously loved and hated this game at times, but I haven't been able to get it out of my head, and probably won't until I have asserted my dominance over this weird, slow, complicated game world. I sit at work thinking about my little team and what on earth I should do with them. Are they strong enough to make a pilgrimage north to defend some depressed fisherman from their resigned fate slowly being whittled down by the privations of cannibals? Should I send them into the fog to cut their teeth fighting endless masses of crazed queen-less insectoid cults? If I set up a base are they strong enough to defend it? Where would I even want to settle? What is my 10 step plan to getting strong enough to overthrow Holy Lord Phoenix and his racist misogynist army of zealot slavers? AND HOW DO I BEAT THE CRABS?

I appreciate that this game exists and I think it stands alone and unique, such as it is. It is a flawed masterpiece. Look before you buy to make sure it's the kind of thing you'll be into.

Se trata de un plato típico en diferentes regiones de Colombia y Venezuela hecho a base de maíz, choclo o “chocolo” que se doran en aceite o mantequilla y se rellenan de mucho, mucho queso. Son ideales para desayunar, cenar o simplemente disfrutar como merienda.

A diferencia de las arepas colombianas de queso que se hacen con maíz blanco y son saladas, las arepas de choclo están hechas con mazorcas de grano maduro, por lo que tienen un sabor y textura completamente distinto. Éstas se asemejan bastante a los hotcakes, son más bien dulces y esponjosas, y cuando se juntan con el queso, crean una combinación verdaderamente deliciosa.

Ingredientes para las arepas de choclo
Maíz: Puedes usar granos de maíz tierno fresco, enlatado o congelado para hacer estas arepas. Eso sí, si usas maíz dulce enlatado o congelado, asegúrate de retirar el exceso de agua y secarlo antes de usarlo porque tendrá mucha más humedad que el grano fresco.
Huevos: Además de aportar nutrientes, los huevos aportan volumen, estructura y la esponjosidad a nuestras arepas. Utiliza huevos pequeños.
Leche: Muchas recetas utilizan leche entera. Sin embargo, nosotros nos decantamos por la leche en polvo ya que no queremos añadir más humedad a la masa.
Mantequilla: Necesitarás mantequilla derretida para dorar estas arepas caseras y conseguir una capa crujiente.
Harina de maíz: Para contrastar el sabor del maíz y añadir un poco de textura a la masa, hemos incluido un toque de harina de maíz blanca (la misma de las arepas). Esto hace que nuestras tortitas sean un poco más densas y no se quiebren a la hora de asarlas.
Panela: Estas arepas son dulces así que utilizamos panela rallada. Puedes reemplazarla por azúcar o tu edulcorante favorito. Es completamente opcional.
Polvo para hornear: La levadura química nos ayuda a conseguir unas tortitas súper esponjosas.
Queso: Puedes usar cualquier tipo de queso fresco. Te recomendamos el queso blanco, cuajada o queso campesino. También puedes usar queso mozzarella.",1685840887,1691780860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, grab your shit snorkel, because you're about to drown in a tsunami of unadulterated frustration and misery.

Imagine this: you fork over your hard-earned cash for what's touted as an ""open-world RPG masterpiece."" But what you end up with is a colossal dumpster fire of broken mechanics, half-baked ideas, and enough bugs to rival a termite infestation. Congrats, you've just been royally fucked over by Kenshi.

Oh, and let's chat about combat, shall we? Get ready to witness your so-called skilled warriors flailing around like stupid morons in the middle of battles. Bandits? They'll make mincemeat out of you. Wild animals? They'll maul you into submission before you can even say ""Why the fuck am I playing this?""

But oh, the pièce de résistance: the AI. Your party members will showcase a level of idiocy that defies the laws of nature. They'll charge headfirst into danger, get stuck in the most fucking ridiculous places, and come up with innovative ways to off themselves, all while you're left swearing up a storm and contemplating launching your computer out the fucking window.

And don't think for a fucking second that the world of Kenshi is any better. It's like traversing through a shit wasteland of monotony, where the highlight of your day is probably counting the grains of sand that make up the shitty desert.

But wait, there's more! Brace yourself for crashes and bugs that could only be the result of a %@&@ developer's twisted sense of humor. You'll be lucky if you can go  minutes without the game crashing and shattering whatever thread of sanity you had left.

So, go ahead, be my fucking guest. Dive headlong into the abyss that is Kenshi. Bask in the glory of its broken dreams, its shattered promises, and its relentless assault on your patience.

It can have a slightly steep learning curve if you just try to figure it out for yourself. However, I was always drawn back to it's bleak, lonely, dystopian atmosphere, and now I have to say this is one of my all time favorite games to play. Mods keep it continually interesting, and if you enjoy a challenge, this game is for you. It can feel very, very, very difficult at first while later on you may find yourself to be a complete bad-ass, but there always seems to be someone, or something out there, whether it be new NPCs or factions or simply bad situations you can get yourself into to keep the thrill of being alive... well alive! After multiple play throughs, I have to say the journey from weakling to formidable influencer is extremely rewarding. Best part is, even after you have been established you can continue to recruit weaklings and start the cycle over again of leveling up characters if that's what you enjoy doing.

In my opinion this game is fairly unique in it's styling. I've seen people describe it as simply a base building game. It does have that aspect, but that is only one. You can choose to play it however you want. Whether it be more a role play style or base / army and faction building. You can choose to be good, or bad, or both (I mean in reality isn't good and bad really full of mostly grey areas). It's basically a shite world, and you start with basically nothing, and try to make a go of it. You can even choose to start with a big fat smelly shite sandwich if you want to make it extra fun. If you don't know what to do when you start, you'll likely get a beating and stain the sand with your blood as you slowly lose your last breath with a mouth full of dirt.

The controls? Well, they're as clunky as a broken-down dune buggy held together with duct tape and dreams. In this world, where every decision might land you in a cannibal's cauldron, elegance isn't the name of the game.

You'll curse its name as you fumble through its intricacies, and yet you'll find yourself drawn to it like a moth to a bugzapper.

In the end, ""Kenshi"" is not a game for the faint of heart or the stable of mind. It's a wild ride through the savage landscapes of the digital abyss, a fever dream that blurs the lines between reality and the deranged fantasies of a chemically-altered psyche.

The land was a wasteland, where the remnants of civilization clung to survival amidst the ruins of what once was. Born to parents who had known nothing but suffering and struggle, Atritiusoinus was destined to carve his own path in this unforgiving world.

Atritiusoinus had been a slave in his early years, shackled by the chains of oppression, forced to toil under the rule of a brutal warlord known as The Phoenix. But as time passed, a spark of defiance ignited within him. Atritiusoinus saw others around him, those who had managed to break free from their chains, eking out a dangerous existence as thieves and outlaws. He yearned for his own taste of freedom, no matter the cost.

One fateful night, Atritiusoinus managed to escape from The Phoenix's grasp, slipping through the shadows like a phantom. He knew the wasteland like the back of his hand, having observed it while toiling away in the warlord's encampment. His newfound freedom fueled a desire for revenge against the tyrant who had held him captive for so long.

With a small band of like-minded individuals, Atritiusoinus set out on a path of crime and rebellion. They became skilled scavengers, plundering the remnants of the old world for valuable artifacts and supplies. They learned to navigate the treacherous landscape, avoiding mutant creatures and rival factions that sought to claim their spoils. Atritiusoinus quickly became a charismatic leader, inspiring loyalty and courage in his comrades.

As their reputation grew, Atritiusoinus and his crew began to challenge The Phoenix's rule directly. They launched daring raids on his outposts, disrupting his operations and striking fear into his heart. Atritiusoinus used his knowledge of the terrain to outwit The Phoenix's enforcers, leading them into traps and ambushes.

But the life of crime was not without its sacrifices. Atritiusoinus faced moral dilemmas and internal conflicts. He saw the impact of his actions on the innocent survivors caught in the crossfire between his band and The Phoenix's forces. The wasteland had turned him into a hardened outlaw, but he still held a glimmer of compassion within him.

Amidst the chaos and danger, Atritiusoinus forged unlikely alliances. He encountered a skilled gunner named Truth, who had her own vendetta against The Phoenix. The two formed a bond born of shared goals and mutual respect. Together, they hatched a plan to bring down the warlord once and for all.

Their plan was audacious and dangerous, requiring every ounce of their cunning and bravery. Atritiusoinus and Truth orchestrated a massive uprising, rallying the oppressed survivors across the wasteland to stand against The Phoenix's tyranny. The final battle was a fierce and brutal struggle, with lives lost on both sides.

In the end, Atritiusoinus faced The Phoenix in a one-on-one confrontation that would determine the fate of the wasteland. It was a grueling battle of wills and strength, with Atritiusoinus tapping into reserves of determination he never knew he had. In a climactic moment, he emerged victorious, ending The Phoenix's reign of terror and bringing a semblance of justice to the shattered world.

With The Phoenix defeated, Atritiusoinus faced a new challenge: rebuilding and restoring hope to the wasteland. He and Truth, now his partner, worked tirelessly to establish a semblance of order, forming alliances with other factions and providing aid to those in need. Atritiusoinus had come a long way from his days as a slave, transforming from a symbol of defiance to a beacon of hope in a world desperately seeking redemption.

And so, in the midst of a desolate wasteland, Atritiusoinus's life of crime and rebellion evolved into a noble quest to bring light to the darkness, proving that even in the bleakest of times, the human spirit could rise above and forge a new future.

And then he got killed by bonedogs

I wish there was more content in that you could speak with more people or do more goal oriented ""quests."" The cities and NPCs are super vacuous, which can make things feel pointless. You also get no context for the world, the factions, the history, nothing. You really have to entertain yourself with this game, but you are given enough freedom and options that that isn't hard to do. It's like building a model train set in a digital, hostile world. 

It's cool that you can find a niche for yourself in the harsh world of Kenshi in a somewhat organic way. For example, I ended up starting a base surrounded by the extremely hostile and powerful beak things, mostly because it was isolated from humans, and had good resources available. Although the beak things constantly posed a threat to my squad, we learned to live with them, and over time we used them to attack bandits, we scavenged equipment from the humans they killed, and we got good at killing them individually so they would provide a consistent source of food. 

I felt it was cool you could use the dynamic world of Kenshi to thrive in creative ways. However, because everyone else is so aggressive and strong, most of those ways mean turning your enemies against each other and scavenging. This is not necessarily super fun, and in a way doesn't give you the freedom that the game promises.   

Glitches happen, but my game has only crashed a couple of times. 

Edit after full release:

I was a fan of this game before, now it's one of my favorite games ever. My complaints have been largely addressed, while what I liked about the game is even better now.

Edit after 500 hours:

Now I have to say, by sheer amount of hours, that it is my favorite game. It's almost like a hobby in itself, you can always work away at a play through in little bursts. But I think now I've finally exhausted the content, after multiple play throughs, and have enjoyed it a great deal. And who knows, perhaps I'll pick it up again someday, if Kenshi 2 does not come out soon enough, just to wander through the beautiful wastes of Kenshi again.",1520435112,1691634521,True,4,0,0.581463932991027832,0,True,False,False

Despite being a sandbox game there is a surprising lack of anything you can do. All you really do is go mine rocks or loot dead people until you yourself get killed by a giant group of raiders in the middle of the desert. I'm sure there are some things to do once you get going, but the journey there is super boring. All you do is click on a town on the map, and sit for 10 minutes in 3x speed while your character runs to it. Good luck if you actually try to loot anything because you'll be moving half speed. Once you actually make it to a town, every type of trader sells the same 10 items.

There is also save importing. From my own experience so far, bugs are minor and the ones that I found were very amusing. (Got stuck in an outhouse once, I decided to make a character sit on it but got stuck when he tried to leave.) I save often so it was a minor inconvenience. You can use another character to pick him up if you have one.

Pros:
You can tweak the game settings to allow for as many npcs as possible. You will be able to witness and participate in large scale battles that can spread from a small valley to a whole plateau.
Got a character killed? Use another! Training multiple characters is like making backups. Just remember to train and equip them.

Cons:
Game was made by 1 guy. Don't expect AAA polish.
Sometimes parts of the game bug out. I had a bug once where a whole town didn't spawn npcs so it was a ghost town that others still visited but did nothing. Shops were locked.

     It is The Sims for the players ability to create characters that you must manage in order to have them properly live a healthy life.
     And it is Skyrim for it's fantastical open world and freedom of what your can do, but Kenshi surpasses Skyrim in its freedom, there is no great threat you must stop, there is no war you must fight in, those things are there in Kenshi, but you have more freedom over it. You can claim bounties for cash, or become the bounty and destroy all of those who stand in your way.
     There's plenty of battles in Kenshi between the factions, and you may partake in them, but you can also start wars, rebel against powerful leaders and take their throne.
     But not everyone is up for the task of starting a rebellion, and you don't have to, you can just be a farmer who grows crops to trade in for cash so they can eat, or a miner who sells ore to the local populous. The possibilities are quite possibly endless, if you can pull it off.
     Even if you're a little tired of getting your ass kicked by starter game bandits, you can always get mods that make you start out with maxed out stats and OP gear. Kenshi truly has something for everyone.

80 hours in and I am absolutely hooked I wish all games had this level of weird immersion kenshi does.
Never really liked rts games so I thought the RTS-RPG squad based elements would turn me off but it's actually the funnest I've had with a game since Dark Souls in 2012.

EDIT:
Almost 1k hours in this game and now Kenshi is for sure in my ""Top 5 games of All Time"", send help.
No idea how some guy in a basement and his sister made one of the most captivating game worlds of all time on a 70 year old game engine but they really did.

I think it's the authenticity of it's world.
Kenshi is the only game I've  really seen that really explores the darker aspects of human societies and psychology. It's really the only game I've seen that accurately portrays why things like racism, imperialism, sexism, and slavery are bad.  It actively throws you in a game world rampant with it in the triple post apocalypse and allows the player to see the very real effects it has on the world and why these types of ideas and mindsets even surface.
Kenshi is a hit-piece on human nature, and It's probably the best game that explores human nature I've ever seen. It's a very ""realistic"" feeling world in a way.

If you like anime like Trigun or Samurai Champloo and think concepts like ""Corrupt ass samurai fighting for food in MILES of desert"" is cool, you'll like kenshi if you can get past it's frightening UI and systems at first",1654065479,1691081051,True,2,0,0.498489409685134888,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately that minimalism seeps into places it doesn't belong; the lore's a bit thin, the AI is often too simplistic, too much important info is buried in easy-to-miss book items (like the rules of the violently-luddite Holy Nation) or just not well explained in game (you'll be doing an annoying amount of google), and the game gets too quiet later on, as the majority of characters are silent outside a few one-time quips.

AI pathfinding is bad enough to deserve a separate mention, I often have to micromanage my squads just to keep them going in the same direction or not get spread halfway across the map, and it (along with the clunky UI) makes multiple squads or large armies nigh-impossible to handle.


It also lacks any hint of polish - the absolute mountain of bugs, spelling errors, poorly tuned physics, the clunky UI and clunkier base build system make it feel like it never really left the dev stage. I particularly dislike having to frequently use the 'import tool' - a sort of save-repair tool - to fix things that go wrong, as it resets NPCs you've killed.   
Some design decisions left me scratching my head, and I was also constantly running into features I expected to exist - like setting your own squads to patrol as the other NPCs do - not being present, and instead having to go dig for mods.

Additionally, there's quite a bit of loading lag going on; I haven't had an issue with it personally but for those with less powerful PCs it might be a sticking point.

Now despite all that, you could still find enjoyment in Kenshi; if you're the sort of person who sees a bug in a game and sees an opportunity for a new mod project rather than a point of frustration, or spends hours on hours slapping mods into a game before you even start your first save file, welcome to Kenshi. It'll happily eat up all your time.   
But the average person isn't going to have the patience to dig through the buggy dumpster fire part to get to the game beneath, so it still gets a 'not recommended'.


Also, using the naruto run for sneaking characters is an unforgivable sin.

You will quickly get your money's worth, just make sure you look up guides first, and make sure you don't spoil yourself because this game has a lot of surprises in store for you.

I recently had the pleasure of diving into the captivating world of Kenshi, and let me tell you, it was an absolute joyride from start to finish! Kenshi, developed by Lo-Fi Games, offers a unique and unforgettable gaming experience that sets it apart from any other game I've played before. From its open-ended sandbox gameplay to its post-apocalyptic setting, Kenshi delivers an immersive and challenging adventure that keeps you hooked for hours on end.

One of the standout features of Kenshi is its open world, which is truly massive and feels like a living, breathing world. The sheer freedom the game offers is refreshing, allowing players to forge their own paths and shape their destiny. Want to be a humble trader or a merciless bandit? The choice is entirely yours. This level of freedom ensures that each playthrough is a completely different experience, adding tremendous replay value to the game.

The depth of gameplay mechanics in Kenshi is mind-blowing. As you start with a single character and build your squad, you'll find yourself faced with numerous challenges and opportunities for growth. The character development system is well-crafted, and every member of your squad can specialize in various skills, making them more proficient in combat, crafting, or other vital aspects of survival.

Moreover, the world of Kenshi is harsh and unforgiving, which may seem intimidating at first, but it's one of the game's greatest strengths. You'll face hostile factions, dangerous creatures, and scarcity of resources, forcing you to strategize, adapt, and make tough decisions to survive. The sense of accomplishment you get from overcoming these challenges is truly gratifying.

The graphics and art style might not be the most cutting-edge, but they possess a unique charm that complements the game's post-apocalyptic atmosphere perfectly. Additionally, the sound design and music enhance the immersion, pulling you deeper into the world of Kenshi.

The developer's commitment to the game's community is also commendable. Regular updates and patches demonstrate their dedication to addressing issues and improving the overall experience. The modding community is thriving, allowing players to customize and expand their Kenshi adventures to their heart's content.

In conclusion, Kenshi is a masterpiece that captures the essence of what a true open-world experience should be. Its sprawling world, deep gameplay mechanics, and freedom to forge your own destiny make it an incredibly rewarding journey for any gaming enthusiast. If you're seeking an unforgettable and challenging adventure, look no further than Kenshi. Embrace the wasteland, survive, and thrive in this post-apocalyptic gem!",1659159360,1690748509,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However where those 2 games differ, is missions. Kenshi has no missions and no set quest lines. This game is at its core, just a world. Your character is spawned in and is now just another miniscule cog in that world. However if you want, you can become an even bigger part of the world and collide with some of the biggest factions and take over the world. Or you can stay as a lowlife and scrap with bandits and never really settle down. There's so so much more however. The world is extremely explorable and fun to live in. Tons of groups and factions along with 150 unique characters in the world you're able to interact with and learn about as well as potentially fight and explore together. This game took 12 years to make mostly by one guy and you can tell how detailed and passionate this story creator is. The game is great and personally I love the RPG element behind it which is the only thing that might hold this game back for some people. Personally though, this is probaly the best RPG you're able to play. The world is unforgiving and terrifying. The world does not care about you and couldn't give a shit less what you have to say or do. They will enslave, beat, mug, eat, mutilate, stab, and skin you. It's terrifying and thrilling. Enjoy every moment.",1594436420,1690686670,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yet, beneath its rugged exterior lies a profound philosophical narrative that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. It is a testament to the human spirit, a digital canvas that paints a vivid picture of resilience, adaptability, and the relentless pursuit of meaning amidst chaos.

The game thrusts you into a desolate, post-apocalyptic world with no clear objectives, no hand-holding tutorials, and no promise of survival. It is a stark reminder of our own existential condition, a reflection of the absurdity of life as proposed by Albert Camus. Like Sisyphus, we are condemned to an eternity of struggle, pushing our boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down. Yet, it is in this struggle that we find our purpose, our joy, our defiance against the indifferent universe.

Kenshi's open-ended gameplay mirrors the philosophy of existentialism, emphasizing freedom, choice, and personal responsibility. You are not a predestined hero, but an ordinary individual, carving out a path in a world indifferent to your existence. It is a poignant commentary on the human condition, a nod to Sartre's proclamation that ""existence precedes essence"". In Kenshi, you exist first, and it is up to you to define your essence, your purpose, your values.

The game's brutal difficulty and unforgiving nature serve as a metaphor for life's hardships. It is a crucible that forges character, a trial by fire that echoes Nietzsche's sentiment: ""What does not kill me, makes me stronger"". Every defeat, every setback, every loss in Kenshi is a lesson, a stepping stone towards growth and self-improvement. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a celebration of our capacity to endure, adapt, and overcome.

The social dynamics and moral choices in Kenshi further enhance its philosophical depth. It forces us to confront the ethical dilemmas and moral ambiguities that permeate our existence, echoing the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the ethical dilemmas posed by utilitarianism. Every decision, every action, every alliance in Kenshi has consequences, reminding us of our agency and the ripple effects of our choices.",1685436157,1690684432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game that left me speechless, and my thumbs sore. First things first, Kenshi is not your typical RPG game. It's a harsh, unforgiving, and merciless world where you have to claw your way to the top, or end up dead in a ditch. The game starts with you, a nobody, wandering in the vast desert world, with no resources or guidance. The sense of isolation and desperation is palpable, but trust me, it only gets worse from there. The game is so hard, that it makes Dark Souls look like child's play. You'll die, and die again, and die some more. And each time, you'll learn something new, something that'll help you survive for a little bit longer. You'll scavenge for food, water, and weapons, and avoid any hostile faction that crosses your path. And when you're not running for your life, you're building your base, and recruiting other survivors to your cause. But what makes Kenshi truly stand out is its sheer depth and complexity. The world is alive, with its own economy, politics, and history. Every character you encounter has a backstory, a purpose, and a reason for being there. And the game doesn't hold your hand, nor does it spoon-feed you information. You have to explore, interact, and experiment to uncover the game's secrets. And speaking of secrets, Kenshi has a lot of them. From hidden treasure troves to secret factions, there's always something to discover. And once you do, you'll be rewarded with new gear, new allies, and new challenges. The game never gets stale, and even after hundreds of hours of playtime, I'm still discovering new things.

Of course, the game is not without its flaws. The graphics are dated, and the combat can be clunky at times. But honestly, that's part of its charm. Kenshi is not a game that tries to impress you with fancy graphics or slick gameplay. It's a game that tries to immerse you in its world, and make you feel like a survivor.

In conclusion, Kenshi is not a game for everyone. It's hard, it's complex, and it demands your attention. But if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it's also one of the most rewarding and satisfying games out there.

So, if you're looking for a game that'll test your mettle and your patience, give Kenshi a try. Just be warned, once you start playing, you won't be able to stop.",1679645923,1690667257,True,53,3,0.728847682476043701,9,True,False,False

Well, Kenshi might just be the game for you. On a moon in the far-out universe, you experience life on a planet that was once home to an advanced civilization; I say once-home because there have been multiple catastrophes in the time before your arrival which have practically left this place uninhabitable.

You might be figuring out how to keep your small band of invalids from starving to death somewhere out in the desert while, across the continent, nations of slightly less-pathetic peoples wage war.

I have a list of numbers, stats, and general strats burnt into my mind.

I have killed countless men, spent countless cats. Taken entire cities head on with only one character. Destroyed all 3 major factions and then destroyed the factions that tried to take over the cities left behind. Made vast walls and a huge prison room with as meany different units as could find to be a sort of zoo.

And yet i am still playing this game, even after anything that made it a challenge has been lost, i still love to play this game. And i don`t think that will ever change. This game has been my friend for 4 years and it will stay that way even after Kenshi 2!

Only five were left in what remained in the once quiet village in Verge. Jentai, a woman whose strength and height alone brought a commanding presence. Leo, a thinly built young lad whose whose quick planning allowed for himself and the others to survive. Skell, the only skeleton in the area who is in search of a new master. Twitch, a born fighter who wishes she could have done more. Battai, the only Scorchlander in the area who is often quiet with his appearance covered. Without a home or an allegiance to the neighboring kingdoms, they had become nobodies. 

The five set their sights to the north and entered the desert. Battai kept an eyeful watch as Leo forewarned the dangers that lie ahead. Reaver platoons could be seen from the far distance which sent the group sneaking and hiding out of sight. Jentai developed a growing concern seeing Leo stagger in the hot sand and having trouble keeping up. Taking it as both an opportunity to help and gain her strength, she grabbed hold of Leo and carried his limp body over her shoulder. While this in turn ended up slowing Jentai down, she still felt empowered by the act and confident about protecting him. 

At about 15 paces away, Twitch was suddenly leading the pack as she discussed the next destination with Skell and Battai. Their only nearby options were Black Scratch and Brink, both under the United Cities rules. Skell was indecisive on the matter where as Battai gave a slight nod upon the mention of Black Scratch. All they knew of the locations was their positions on the map. Brink appeared to be larger, but Black Scratch was closer. Battai then pointed to Black Scratch on his map in which Twitch relunctantly agreed to. 

The five approached the gates and greeted by the guards. They were allowed entry without question, even if it became apparent the group was without money or even a shirts. Leo was seemingly asleep and still perched on Jentai's shoulder as she observed any opportunities for shelter. Battai signals for the group to follow and they spot an abandoned home to take refuge in. They camped on the floor, but were wary about staying there over night. Staying there was technically a crime. 

As Leo came to, he suggested that they must find ways to make money in order to stay here. The group then discussed opportunities such as mining, farming, crafting and looting. They each revealed their past expertise. Leo's ability to craft clothing would net them large profits if only they had access to a machine. Skell's knowledge of making weapons would also prove fruitless. Jentai who farmed and mined for most of her life mentioned an iron mine just outside the village. Battai and Twitch while inexperienced went along as they had the strength to carry the materials back. 

Leo and Skell would keep watch as Twitch, Battai and Jentai went hard at work. Twitch begin to vent her frustration about the Reavers destroying their homes and being unpunished. Leo shouted something and it was at that moment, a group of Reavers appearance in the distance. Twitch was for a second overwhelmed by  the sight of their numbers as Jentai was quick to raise her fist. Brink guards quickly intervened, getting in between the two groups. After a quick battle, Brink was victorious and walked away from the remaining Reavers who laid there dying. 

Twitch removed a sword from a Reaver's hand, claiming it as her own. Skell listed a piece of armor and calculated it's worth. The idea then dawned on the group that looting and selling this equipment might raise enough to buy their home. Three days past between mining and another skirmish at the gates. Jentai would start to participate in these battles which inspired confidence in Twitch and latter Battai  to do the same. Each night, Leo would dress Jentai's wounds who noticed her body being stronger and harder each time.

There are elements of complex crafting (almost on the level of SWG), survival, RTS, automation, exploration, hack and slash looting, stealth assassinations and thievery, trading, and base-building, but being in a huge sandbox world means you can play or not play it any way you like. Not to mention the huge number of mods and reshades available to further customize the game.

I hesitated for years on buying this game because of 'the look' and finally bought it on sale, just to try out and return it if I didn't like it in the first two hours. I should have bought Kenshi years ago. Less than three weeks and I'm already 184 hours into my first game.

Kenshi is one of a kind in very many aspects. It scratches a very unique itch for RPG players, especially hardcore survival types. You can't really get this gameplay anywhere else, closest would be something like 3-D Rimworld but Rimworld has more depth and is much more fleshed out. Rimworld also has it's focus on a story generator which lends to always having great stories despite their being no actual written story or dialogue. Kenshi is very very similar in that way, you make your own story, it's there to find if you search for it. The characters just don't really distinguish themselves except through backstory and lore. Really good lore too.  
So why this instead of Rimworld? The action and animations of course. It hits all the areas that Rimworld doesn't hit, namely the combat and the exploration. This game is one of the greats in terms of power creep, progression, and balance. But then why wouldn't it be a perfect game? What's stopping you from playing it all the time? 
As I learned more about the game I became disappointed in some of the games more frustrating facilities. Things like frequent crashing through certain biomes, no notifications on attacks, needing to load your game to make your characters work, enemies spawning on you on game load, entire houses being useless because characters can't enter due to placement bugs, poor pathfinding sometimes right into an enemies sword.(its a topdown rts) Unfortunately it's a growing list. Despite the annoyances and how frequent they are I would say Kenshi is a great game that's got some annoying things in it. Overall my 1000's of hours would say that's worth it. Then I realize how little progress my characters have made despite me power leveling 6 hours a day for the last 4 days. And I start to feel the time sink and I feel like I've spent way too much time on something I get very little from.  
Then my wife comes in and says ""Oh my god your still training?"" or ""Is this like a training game or what?"" And I realize that not all that time was spent on fun gameplay.
 I just spent 30 actual hours training to 70 skill across the board with 6 characters on triple speed. That's the kind of time sink your looking at. And if that character dies, load or cry you just lost a legend lol. 
I think most would see my 1000's of hours and say ""This must be a good game."" I would say, watch a LOT of gameplay and see if it's something you want. Then make sure you have a LOT of time set aside. Your about to watch those characters crawl towards success only slightly faster than you do in real life. 
All in all great game, one of a kind, with some frequent annoyances that can probably be ignored if you don't take it too seriously.",1550947814,1690395104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got a katana, a nice one for where i was at back then. I decided to leave feeling armed and confident. I settled on some bad land unfortunately. Got into some trouble with a group of mega racist religious people. Scared, I decided to recruit 5 recovering alcoholics I met at various bars and forced them to undergo extensive and brutal Shinobi training. Unlike that religious group, racism was inconsiderable for me. We accepted all those whom possessed alcohol issues. My squad grew stronger, it became larger, and most importantly, it grew more and more diverse. I'm talking Robots, orcs, humans, and believe or not even women. As one clan, we were slowly growing unstoppable. except for the problem of having to feed all these fat bastards in the middle of an arid desert. jokes aside, this game by far has the most captivating lore of any video game or even media i have ever consumed. i fucking hate reading when i want to play a game, but HOLY SHIT the story this game has in store had my jaw on the floor at times. the dialogue humors me a lot.

I highly recommend giving it a try. Check some gameplay on youtube if you are not convinced.

Update 2023:
This is still a great game with an increasing amount of mods for your own entertainment. The harsh world makes it a great process to rise from the mud. And finally getting over one mountain top, only to notice that there is a bigger one ahead. I've extremely enjoyed playing this game with and without mods. But I do recommend mods, as they bring even more to the table. For me essential mods have been camping beds and skeleton camping beds free to build. And 8x recovery speed for beds or something like that. Recruitable prisoners mod is a must have, but can make your game too easy if you go overboard.

or just jump in blind. that's what i did.

i spawned in some desert town, did odd jobs until i got enough cash to buy the katana in a store outside of town. i had no decent weapons.

go into store to buy the katana. there's a gang of raiders already in the store. i wait to see what happens. they start murdering everyone, including me.

i run outside and someone chops my leg off, so i start running slower.

the independent robot-police respond, attacking the raiders until they retreat and run off. a robot walks up to me and beats me into submission with a stick.

I strongly recommend it, actually playing it is completely different from watching it. Avoid save-scumming if you can, it takes away from the magic.


My first every run I started off as a slave. A simple scorchlander, who was captured by the Holy Nation. I was unsure what exactly to do, so I stayed a slave for 80 in-game days. Approximately 9 hours in real time. I did my duty, and trained various skills such as sneak, lockpicking, and toughness for when I got my ass beat. Slowly but surely, I started to dream of escaping. I began stealing and stockpiling food in the building where my cell was. I began sneaking out at night, and unlocking other slave's shackles. The slaves were starting to try and revolt/escape. This caused havoc and chaos in the slave camp. However, there was still way too many guards. So I continued doing this, planting the seed of rebellion every night. I recruited 2 other people and together we were going to escape. 

The day came when it was now or never, angry slaves by the dozen started to revolt against the Holy Nation. I saw this as my opportunity and took all my food. The three of us began to make a run for it, we were got pretty far but then the guards took notice. We had about 20+ guards chasing after us. Luckily, my main guy was FAST. I trained and did sprints everyday while in the slave camp, in hopes that I would one day be able to outrun the guards. My other two friends however were not as fast... We got to the exit and ambushed by a patrol right outside the gate. I lost my arm!!! My damn arm was cut off by these bastards. I noticed my two other friends were knocked unconscious and carried back to the camp..... I ran into the desert without an arm and clueless on how to survive. I vowed to return and rescue my two friends. 

130 hours later, I had recruited quite the entourage, and we built a camp about 30 miles to the south. We were growing strong, and the Holy Nation took a notice. My main guy who started it all eventually lost every limb through combat. I replaced his limbs with the strongest prosthetic limbs in the desert. I was a deadly martial artist. The time had come to wage war against the Holy Nation. We began leaving our camp and hitting patrols and capturing key leaders. Crucifying them on front of our fortified camp. 

We eventually marched back to the slave camp with 15 warriors and slaughtered the Holy Nation, freeing all the slaves. Where were my friends? They were nowhere to be found.....Maybe they made it out? Or maybe 2 years of excruciating labor killed them. I wish we reunited and I could of told them tales on what I've seen out there..

This is merely one small slither of the story. In between escaping, was hundreds of struggles and adventures.

have played the same thing keeps happening as if it is insanity. either intentional or unintentional they give the play a buff. even if its not first obvious. either you move faster or that you do more damage or even as slight as you have more health points. or even, just a step further, you have a idea of the opponents weakness. even dark souls, and yes i am going to say it, has some not so obvious leads to a bosses weaknesses or even most opponents you fight in it. yes dark souls is still challenging, but you are basically given the win some times, constantly capable to return to the same boss and learn. kenshi does still have this learning curve but its if you can survive to learn or you have to restart. and each time you restart you make every thing change unintentionally. like you may have found a weapon seller who sells a good enough weapon to help you train the states you want, well the seller is no gone and has been replaced with a much poorer seller who just sells iron sticks for weapons and they are poor quality. it gives a sense of generations but each generation is rest to the original point before the player has met them. the lore is expansive enough that even though i have played 315 hours i still haven't learned everything. sure i could go to YouTube or google it but i want to learn it myself. have all the knowledge or opinions of other people try to sway how i am viewing the world, now i am not saying that they don't have fair points or have rights to the own opinion. it just that my brain likes to jump from my own information and opinions that i have made while playing and trying to make sense of a almost non sensible world, to some one else s information and opinions because they will make more sense that i was try to make and my brain will not allow myself to return to the original point or even remember it. but I am sorry that was unneeded but i am gonna leave it. but still the game gives you a sense of dread or hopelessness if you try to have a one man army until you get that one man army to the point that they could take five beak things out. and that's another subject beak things are the ultimate hunter is the world of kenshi yes there is most factions that can handle them but the need a squad just to proficiently handle them. but by themselves they are almost useless against them. i have done extended research about this trying to test how far this game is. everyone are equal, its just some of those everyone have to rise above the others but still everyone with time can grow in strength. they can still have better attack or defense or strength. or toughness or dexterity. and if that squad continues to fight and grows then they could single handly bring down cities by themselves and all you have to do is just watch and five united cities or shek kingdom warriors conquer the holy nation. and or bring down catlon. i also love the skeletons who keep information away from the other races, it fascinating because skeletons are practically the top of technology, and they probably see any other race as lesser beings just like the high elves in most fantasy games or movies. i kinda see most skeletons are trying to keep the knowledge they know away from the other races because give anyone an inch they will take a mile. i wonder if it was possible that skeletons remember how to make fire arms other than crossbows. and if they do know that is the reason they keep the world in a possible endless modern medieval Apocalypse.  and if they needed to or wanted to they could just mass manufacture  those weapons and turn them towards the other races which would only have swords and spears and axes and crossbows. that's basically shooting a fish in a barrel. but i love how much information this game gives and or just lets the player themselves gives a reason to this world. its kinda as if the world is repeating old transgressions. like slavery if the world was civil they would not need slaves, but because the world isn't civil and is chaotic it allows slavery. no the shek kingdom does not need slavery. its only goal is battle and honor. which they see slavery as useless because they only need they're own strength to do things. the hivers are just that hives, they aren't slaves, they are organisms that have a duty just like an ant colony. you have the one queen and then you have the tiers of units, workers who do everything from collecting, hunting, building, scouting, and even protecting (if the need arises) and then you have the warriors who live and die protecting the works and the queen  and the hive all together. warriors do help with hunting if the workers can not take on the task of killing what ever they are hunting or if the pray is to strong. now the princes is almost new to hive like structures civilizations, but is still not uncommon. some hive like creatures when the give birth to the next generation have a chance to give birth to both a new king and queen, or because the current queen is still alive, the prince and princess. which will fly off and start their own colonies and operate from that link from the queen. which i have seen how the hivers in kenshi live and have a kinda accurate representation for the western and the southern and the fogmen. the western are more like more passive black ants. most blacks are or can be passive unless provoked, and the southern hive is just a swarm of red ants or army ants. now the fog men, it is not actually uncommon for a cannibal like hive to appear, but without a queen is not as likely, but then again from how the hive queens look they look to use the mechanical bits to make more hivers, so i could only think that the fog men are making more fog men by using the corpse of the queen to make more and because they do not have a main pheromones from the queen they have become insane and within time i can see fog men could be tought to come back to sanity but it would take generations of fog men and teaching them constantly to change their animal instincts to go back to the ""original"" instincts. but then yet again animals evolve to best help their species survive. like if you were to kill the two queens they become fog men. which they have basically had to cannibalize and hunt other things like humans and shek and other hivers. they go to more animalistic thinking. which consists of survive, eat, drink, sleep, repeat. now because drinking isn't apart of kenshi it is just survive, eat, sleep, repeat.

The hardest part is learning the very intricate systems (armor and armor stats, weapons and weapon stats, weight, attributes, counters, sneak, taking prisoners, being a prisoner, food harvesting and management, factions, rest/recovery).  It takes a while to get the hang of it.  Once you reach the point you start to grasp how the systems work you're either gonna be hooked, or you're gonna pass.  

The game is very unforgiving, there are going to be countless trial and error attempts at understanding and/or executing certain plans.  This is a game that is not going to do too much hand holding.  You live, you learn.  You die, you learn more.

The best part: Once you get the hang of it, you realize just how much replay-ability this game has.  Countless hours.  

The worst part: You'll constantly be learning new systems and how they interact, IF you pay attention.  There are penalties or buffs that are hard to spot or understand if you don't read/study carefully.  Also leveling up different attributes can take time depending on your methods.  

If you are one that finds the systems and sandbox world to be interesting and worth understanding, then this is a game (like most) that can be insanely exploited, or thoroughly enjoyed.  Or, in many cases, both.

PS. There are definitely power spikes at certain points.  You'll start as the weakest creature in existence but you can eventually become insanely powerful with a band of the baddest warriors on the map. Throughout the leveling process the world slowly begins to open up and then quickly gets bigger.  Eventually, you realize that you've crossed that threshold needed to explore the world semi-safely.

Watching your character get shredded & unlock new kinds of attacks and evasions as they progress is just amazing. Learning the lore of the world as your squad chit-chats while traversing the vast wastes is organic narrative perfection. 

In youtube or written reviews, commentators often seem to find this game visually unappealing, I just can't wrap my head around that.  Kenshi is a beautiful game, the landscapes, armor, clothing, characters, weapons, everything is consistent & it all comes together to create an amazing overall aesthetic.  

I was a child before the internet, I have extremely fond memories of playing with action figures and staging epic battles for hours. I was just moving figures around in my back yard but in my mind great struggles were being fought out, defeat or victory were never assured.  When all I had to rely on was my imagination it went wild, Kenshi gives me almost the exact same feeling. 

The ONLY complaint's I could make are almost certainly just engine limitations, load-times when travelling & some self destructive pathing (please don't swim through that lake of acid my dude).

If you can look beyond these flaws, Kenshi offers a very unique and fun experience. The game offers you a lot of freedom, being able to start off pretty much anywhere and in varying situations. You get to create your own journey and (to an extent) shape the world around you.

Started out as a wandering loner, got beat up by pretty much every enemy group I encountered, ended up with a missing limb. Resorted to thievery to get enough money to be able to acquire a new robotic arm, and felt pretty good about it once I did, only to find out that the Holy Nation apparently hate anyone with robot parts. I quickly got into trouble visiting one of their outposts, got the tar kicked out of me once again, and promptly got taken into slavery. All that in the span of a single day. Kenshi is wild.

There's a bit of a learning curve as far as the game mechanics go, but it is not so bad, there are also a lot of mods available in the workshop worth checking out.

With these people, she fought tooth and nail for their lives against the raging Holy Nation, the patrolling bandits and the god forsaken beak things and they have always triumphed. 

On a calm night in Shark, Kat turned restlessly around her bed.  She tells her comrades that she is tired and wants to settle down. Her comrades stared at her in disbelief. ""Kat? The lady who drinks the blood of bandits, great gorillos and Holy Paladins alike? Wants to retire?""

A long silence casted upon the crew until one of them broke the silence with laughter. ""Then a home we'll find!"" and the calm night turned into a frenzy of laughter and happiness.

As the crew settled down, they have built their houses, tended their crops and raised their walls... unbeknowst to them, a group of cute herbivores walked into their settlement and earned their hearts and minds...

Until they saw the crops. Turned rabid did the herbivores as they feasted on the crops. Kat and her crew tried to stop them, the herbivores turned their attention to them instead and soon an onslaught begun.

Here lies Kat and her crew, their lives lost to the wilderness of Kenshi, not from the bandits, the Beak Things, or the Holy Nation... but to the horrors of the Herbivores, the Raptors.

It is a harsh world, where suffering is around every corner.

Are you willing to embrace that you're going to get assaulted and left to die, over and over again? Embrace that the world doesn't care about you and will take everything from you, even your freedom?

If you are, you will eventually get back up, become stronger, find powerful weapons, Recruit new allies, build your sanctuary against the onslaught, wage war en discover what happened to the world that was before.

In my opinion, Kenshi is the best game to ever come out of early access. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games likes dark souls, Mount and Blade, Baldur's gate, Age of empires and everything in between.

The map is huge but very empty, with so little of interest, uniques, so few secrets or treasures. Almost no interactions with anyone or anything, not even the basic stuff, not that much to do, the world doesn't feel alive, everything is static. Nothing changes if you come back to a place after 2 months. Ruins don't get rebuilt, destroyed houses stay rubble. No faction war. The immersion takes a hit. You will just encounter groups of humanoids roaming around regularly with generic gear and carrying no coins. On that topic the gear you will find is quite poor, nothing stands out, a lot looks like makeshift scraps, there is a lack of variety. Cities are tiny and don't have much to them, a few stores and a bar most of the time. A couple of houses maybe. The game economy is not interesting to partake in since it's fake (timed shop refresh). I didn't see any missions/quests (without joining a faction) except bounties which are not that many, one or two per (major) area.

I like sandboxes and i don't particularly care if there is no story no plot guiding you when the game has deep mechanics and you can participate/influence the world (like X games). Making your own fun is often better but here the game just doesn't provide enough, it feels like an old solo mmo but without the quests. You can't even capture buildings/bases or cities without mods, and from what i've seen it's still limited and disappointing. The antique engine is really struggling to run the big map, with regular loadings while travelling. Some areas are very stuttery, like it's loading something every 2s (on max distances). The sound design is nothing memorable.

The targetted/localized damage system is quite good but it is ruined by the impossibility to finish off someone or keep attacking them after they lie down unconscious. They'll just keep getting up several times after a few mns and attack you, they can even sprint with critical wounds (other than on the legs). This is especially a problem when you are trying to clear an outpost and they just keep reviving and shooting from the roof mounted harpoons at impossible angles.

I gave the vanilla experience a fair chance but mods seem to be a requirement to fully exploit the potential of this game.

Edit : with a dozen mods and particularly Universal Wasteland Expansion, (which alone is half the size of the game !!!) most of my issues with Kenshi seem to be addressed. The game goes from feeling early access to a competent full release.

I have played this game for 120 hours now. In that time I have hardly explored the map and my squad is at mostly a decent stat level around 20 for most squad members on important skills. The biggest drawback to this game is the amount of time you must grind to get more skilled. This is a core component of the game which can make it a hit or miss. To me, it is both good and great but depends on your desires and circumstances. Training can take HOURS and HOURS of time which is really really frustrating! Why I have such an issue with this is that I can play for hours and only make a margin of progress. This is only worsened by the fact I have made the mistake 2 to 3 times now of trying to start a base too soon. The game doesn't discourage you from base-building early on but makes you learn the hard way-- being raided, time and time again. Raids are extremely frequent and will absolutely obliterate your squad if you are not ready. Asides from this problem of base building, base building removes the power the player has of being a nomad if you are not self-sufficient enough to protect yourself. When I expanded my squad, I have always had to CONSTANTLY manage between all my characters. This has been tolerable during the start, but later it just becomes mind numbingly tedious and greatly disrupts the immersion and pacing of the game.

Overall, if you are considering purchasing this game, I strongly advice you wait until getting a decent sized squad with strong stats before you ever build a base. Additionally, I also recommend exploring the world just for the sense of discovery and the loot you can find which is much better for arming your characters then gathering weapons and armor through trade.",1640146923,1689226753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review:
Kenshi is an extraordinary game that defies genre conventions and delivers an unparalleled gaming experience. Developed by Lo-Fi Games, this open-world sandbox RPG offers a captivating blend of freedom, survival, and limitless possibilities. From its vast and unforgiving post-apocalyptic world to its deep gameplay mechanics, Kenshi stands as a testament to the brilliance of indie game development.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Kenshi is its immense open world. Set in a harsh, desolate wasteland, the game allows players to forge their own path and make their mark on a ruthless, dynamic environment. Whether you choose to be a nomadic trader, a warlord conquering territories, or a humble farmer trying to survive, Kenshi provides the freedom to pursue your ambitions with minimal handholding.

The level of detail and realism in Kenshi is astonishing. Every character, from the protagonist to the lowliest bandit, has their own agenda and goals. The world is alive and ever-changing, with factions waging wars, economies fluctuating, and towns rising and falling. This dynamic nature ensures that no playthrough is the same, fostering a sense of immersion that is hard to find elsewhere.

The gameplay mechanics in Kenshi are both deep and challenging. As you start with nothing but your wits, you must gather resources, recruit followers, and train them to survive the harsh realities of the wasteland. The crafting system is intricate, allowing you to build anything from small shacks to sprawling fortresses. Combat is unforgiving and realistic, requiring tactical decision-making and skill development to prevail. The learning curve can be steep, but the satisfaction that comes with mastering these mechanics is immensely rewarding.

Graphically, Kenshi possesses a unique aesthetic that perfectly complements its gritty and desolate atmosphere. While the visuals may not rival those of AAA titles, the game's art style and attention to detail make it an aesthetic treat. Furthermore, the soundtrack sets the tone masterfully, enhancing the feeling of isolation and constant danger.

One of the greatest strengths of Kenshi is its dedicated and passionate modding community. With an active modding scene, players can customize their experience to suit their preferences. From quality of life improvements to extensive content additions, the modding community has expanded the already vast world of Kenshi, ensuring countless hours of gameplay.

In conclusion, Kenshi is a true gem in the gaming world. It pushes boundaries, challenges conventions, and rewards players with a unique and unforgettable experience. Whether you are a fan of open-world RPGs, survival games, or simply crave a game that allows you to create your own narrative, Kenshi is an absolute must-play. With its limitless freedom, deep gameplay mechanics, and ever-evolving world, Kenshi sets the bar high for the potential of indie game development.",1689037645,1689037645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some ragged bandits came and beat me unconscious and killed my dog, the future looked bleak for my first run until some slave traders came about my body and patched me up, but mercy wasn't their intentions. They took me back and sold me off, but I was able to break free with some fellow slaves. It was just us out in the lands, and so we started a humble farm, but I had a deadset goal to stomp out all bits of slavery in this world. One thing led to another, and we started selling rum. One thing led to another and we started hiring people. One thing led to another and we started hiring mercs. One thing led to another and we soon realized that if we wanted an army, we needed it to be of soldiers. One thing led to another and we started sending mercs out to knock out wanderers and drag them back to the farm. The farm grew into a city, but it needed defenders. One thing led to another and we started practicing our combat skills on the prisoners we captured, beating them unconscious before sending out the medics to fix them up and throw them back into their cages, waiting for the next round. 
 
I still want to end slavery, but I'm starting to think the lengths I'm taking to abolish it are arguably worse than the enslavement itself. This is for you, old pupper.

It controls like a CIV game, which I like, but everything else is not user friendly at all. Now I'm no stranger to hard/obtuse games. But this game is just...wow. I drop in as the wanted outlaw. I have some legendary sword that has few rivals. Cool. Guess what...I barely managed to beat a little pig. Then out of nowhere, a holy knight comes after me in the middle of the desert and wipes me out. Legendary sword my ass.

I knew full well going into this game that you have to build yourself up. I get that. I like it when games start you out as a weakling, but only when it's well balanced. There's a BIG difference between starting off as a weakling that can 1v1 enemies in starting areas, vs starting off as a weakling that can barely handle a small pig. We call that bad balance.

I want to like this game. I REALLY do. But the clunk + enemies just slaughtering you and it being extremely difficult to build yourself up is a joke. And just because ""you"" who has 1000+ hours says it's ""easy"", doesn't mean it's easy for someone starting out with the game after being used to games with decent to good balance. The squad system hooked me in, but the clunky design and unforgiving start cut the line. 

If you like this game, good for you. I'm happy that you got around the aids that is the beginning. It's a no from me. If you started out with a squad/were a little bit stronger/enemies were a bit weaker, then maybe I'd still be playing. And I'm sure there are paths that allow you to start with a squad instantly, and I know you can lower the difficulty sliders, but A) that defeats the purpose of playing a game for me, and B) if I have to lower the difficulty that much off the bat, I don't think your game is well balanced. I'm not a Dark Souls cringelord, but I'm not a mobile gamer either.

The graphics and UI are the highlights for me, as well as that squad system, but if there's a bad smell in the air, I can't enjoy them. It's a no for me. Go ahead and clown me. Waste your points.",1686759158,1688871020,False,7,0,0.457181781530380249,0,True,False,False

Kenshi has the perfect amount of tutorials where you don't feel lost, while also letting you get your ass whooped

The save system prevents the game from truly being difficult as you can save scum everything, but obviously you aren't required to use it. (an iron man mode would be fantastic)

I played for  hours and finally started building up my settlement, only to realize I really don't care for the settlement building. I would rather play a game like Rimworld if that was my goal, however that's whats great about the game. You don't have to build a settlement. there's plenty of other ways to earn money and you can steal and buy everything you need. the settlement building is fine if you want it, but isn't forced.

The modding support through steam workshop is a nice bonus that allows you to change your game or just beef up the graphics.

Firstly, this game is not for people who like winning, and cannot handle losing  or parting with something they spent hours or days obtaining. This game is quite literally about struggling to survive. Chance of survival is extremely slim, especially for your first 5-10 characters. I am just finally getting to around 25-26 days on the same character, but many characters I made a new one within minutes or a couple hours in.

To truly enjoy this game, you have to realize you are supposed to be attacked or targeted by d*ckheads practically all the time and you will lose your stuff very often. This game will punish you every step of the way for making either the right or wrong decision and you have to not get mad at it.

In my opinion, this game is both stressful and beautiful in it's own ways. Something about the depressing nature of practically everything in the environment, the music, and even down to the morrowind-esque [i](?)[/i] graphics, adds to the hopeless and constantly foreboding feeling you have while playing. With that said, you will have key moments where things just work out in your favor, and those moments make the game so entirely worth it. 

Also, the fact this game is just one big single-player PvE experience is a huge plus. Not having to worry about PVP or other annoying players makes the game so much more immersive and an individual experience (invite-only/2-4 player co-op would be nice though I do have to say).

You can disguise yourself as an enemy faction to infiltrate them and loot their belongings.

The stats to this game are in depth as well, you start out as basically nothing, you are nothing to no one, when you die the world simply just goes on. You can't even really fight someone one on one and expect to win or live until you've leveled up your skills and attributes. The progression feels rewarding as you slowly build up your squad and abilities, building your own fortress / cities to become even stronger, fending off raids become more gratifying as you get to steal their loot too, or conducting them on nearby towers.

The mods are practically endless, and very easy to install / uninstall due to compatibility with the steam workshop.

I strongly recommend everyone who intends to play this game to download mods because there are mods that basically fix most problems as well as rework mechanics and add a lot of content. Nevertheless the base game is what’s being discussed in this case mostly, first of all one of the most annoying problems is that this game has a lot of grinding, whether it is walking from A to B or improving stats or producing stuff it undeniably wastes too much of your time. Another problem is that despite being supposedly finished it still lacks a lot of polish and it’s not just bugs like pathfinding breaks constantly, there’s a lot of crashing and loading problems, also very strange balancing decisions. Lastly, as far as problems go I feel like the game also lacks a decent amount of content, but it’s also sort of spread out and thus most people don’t notice it, for example there are really few animations for the various actions and attacks you have, there’s too few character customization options, there’s too little interactions with commerce and with factions, most of the wildlife is just beak things, some areas like the cannibal plains don’t have much going on in general. Despite all of those problems the game is still great, of note is the whole world of Kenshi both the map and the lore, it’s all both very alien and familiar at the same time, it has a lot of interesting characters, events and places all with unique terrain. The combat is also great and distinct from most games, it both adds to the immersion and the limb system adds a whole layer of strategy to fights, it also helps display the strength of enemies and animals. It’s also important to discuss the difficulty, the game is very hard and sometimes unfair, but still the greatest advantage one can have in Kenshi is knowledge of the game, learning the mechanics and the world is the most important thing when it comes to overcoming the difficulty and therefore the game rewards planning and exploration. The base building, though not mandatory, is very much worth trying and grants access to many items. It's very cool to be able to essentially create your own town that can be equal to or even greater than all the other cities in the game. There’s still a lot more but I think I’ve said enough, Kenshi is an amazing game with a lot to offer, and those that stuck with it know why it’s so addictive.",1688661390,1688661520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sigh, OK mod the gate.

Kenshi strikes the perfect balance between passive simulation and active strategy in that the game world can exist and operate without any intervention from the player but should the player choose to engage, they can discover how in-depth the game can get.

The setting, atmosphere, characters, world governments/tribes, and interactions are like if Feudal Japan had an illegitimate child with The Holy Roman Empire and left the child to grow up on an alien planet reminiscent of Pre-Christ Mesopotamia. Yeah, it's crazy and I love it. It's difficult to put into writing what makes Kenshi stand out among other battle simulation sandboxes so I highly recommend checking the game out for yourself if any of this is piquing your curiosity.

A few stand-out features:

- limb-based combat with the ability to bleed out, go unconscious based on what body part is injured, and the chance to lose a limb altogether with the opportunity to replace it with a prosthetic
- town-building system that ties in with you being able to establish your own tribe
- what race and affiliation you choose to play as will determine how others treat you
- stats that increase based on how often you use the associated skills (think Skyrim's skill leveling system)
- stealth mechanics that are meh but serviceable, can't fault the game too much here as it isn't an explicitly highlight feature, I just chose to mention it
- cannibalism!

You're not the chosen one and you're not stronger than anyone unless you climb the food chain by taking risks, losing fights, and training hard, and this reflects on your character starting looking like a holocaust victim but ending like a JoJo character as their journey toughens them up.

Also, ALL characters can die and the world won't stop because of it, you can be the one doing the killing and shaping the world of Kenshi to your liking, should you have the skill to fight an entire army and challenge the faction leaders, few things are as enjoyable as soloing the entire Holy Nation or United Cities, watching your character go on a rampage, punching off filthy slaver limbs into the stratosphere.

Oh and you can also build a town anywhere, though building in some places comes with risks of extortion, taxes and bandit raids.


Or maybe you don't want to do any of that and just live as a slave, merchant, thief, bandit or anything you want really.

1. Production

I came across Kenshi on YouTube about how this game was largely coded by a single person. And how he had stuck to it for more than 8 years (I think it was 10 years in total) before getting the break he needed after suffering much in production hell. And the vision he stuck by ""a sandbox RPG"" is great. I came across a few players who told their own story on YouTube of their own Kenshi adventures. Now I am hooked.

2. Gameplay

This is a RTS game with RPG elements in a Survival Game genre. If Mad Max had a kid with Fallout 1/2 and genetically altered the kid with Dune, this would be it. The game can be ""unfair"" and ""unforgiving"" but it is shows the reality of the world that was build. 

RTS - Yes
RPG - Yes
Survival - Yes
Base Building - Yes
Souls Like Deaths - Yes
Mods - Yes

There's plenty of flexibility in the way you want to go about the game that it can be daunting. Just note that:

Graphics - Not Really Fantastic (But Mods Improves This Somewhat). But Charming.
Story - None. It's Up To Your Own RPG Narration (I Find Myself Talking Out Loud My Characters' Stories)
End Game - Not Really. It Is Really Up To You To Define Your End Game
Glitches - Some Clipping. Some Restarting. Some Bodies Flying From Time To Time.

Thanks Christ Hunt for this game. You've taken so much time to make this game a reality. Now it has taken so much time from my real life... and counting! And I enjoy every moment of it.

Despite many wonderful story driven titles, games will always be second rate mediums for storytelling, behind books, movies and television. Kenshi excels at what games are meant to do by building an immersive, unique world rich in lore and full of character. Character progression is a strength, with no class and the possibility of maxing all stats and skills. Gameplay is an RTS/RPG hybrid that works very well. The base-building offers freedom and creativity rarely seen in games today. This is an indie title, so there are some issues with jank, balance and graphics. Some factions and areas seem unfinished or not fully explored. Some may be left that way to keep a sense of mystery. These issues don't detract much from the experience. On the contrary, comparing Kenshi to the unfinished AAA messes that have released recently leaves me increasingly jaded with the current state of an industry that seems interested only in extracting as much money from their playerbase as possible. 

In Kenshi, you are nobody special. Emergent gameplay is core to the Kenshi experience. Get robbed by a group of bandits, then saved from death only to be enslaved and set to work in a mine. Toil away, building strength and toughness, until you escape. Run into those bandits again, and exact your revenge. Go to war with a major faction. Free slaves, spread the glory of Okran, or purge the world of their zealotry. Every setback is an opportunity to add another chapter to your story. So buy the game, and write your own.

With a success rate that makes winning the lottery seem like a cakewalk, you'll quickly realize that you're just as feeble and inexperienced as you are in real life. And trust me, in Kenshi, the threats are as real as they get. Flesh-eating spiders, desperate hobos, and who knows what else? It's a dangerous world out there.

But once you do get past the difficult stage, the whole world is a bit... empty in a sense.

Strong RPG elements, action, squad management--all these things are there, but for 90% of the game, you will struggle to survive. Even on the easiest difficulty, you will start the game as nothing but an easy target for roaming bandits. You will hit insurmountable obstacles. You will be afraid of going beyond the safety of a town's walls. But, if you stick with it, you will hit a point where everything clicks. 

All the trials you've faced and overcome, all the walls you hit, all the times you felt the mercilessness of Kenshi's world... It forges you--and your characters--into a creature that thinks like a survivor and a scavenger, and eventually, something much more. Perhaps a noble samurai setting out to punish the many evils of the world; perhaps a warlord set on creating a drug empire. Perhaps a ninja, or an explorer, or a bandit. But once you've learned how to survive in Kenshi, the game world opens up to you, and it becomes a game of wonder, opportunity, and curiosity.

Kenshi was made by Lo-Fi Games for PC and is their only product to date, although Kenshi 2 is confirmed to be on the horizon. It was released into Early Access in 2013 and then as a finished game in 2018. It was also, to my understanding, largely the effort of one person. Kenshi roughly translates to swordsman in English, but at the start your character will likely be either a punching bag or food. Yes, food… 

Somehow Kenshi has achieved being a rather inspired blend of a single player Runescape and Fallout (no, not the modern ones: I mean, 1, 2, and Tactics). 

Perhaps the true beauty of Kenshi is that it is an open Sandbox. There is no main quest, side quests, essential characters or overarching plot to follow; no no no, just like every day life, you are stuck on a rock with what skills you have and make the best of it… Or you can do what I did, and make things worse for everyone else! Of course, that’s not to say there isn’t a history. There is, should you choose to seek it out. There are some characters, books, and even environments that will enlighten you as to what came before.  

There are also optional house building mechanics where you can build up your own base, trade hub, or even city. Furthermore, you have crafting which allows you to make your own clothes, armor, weapons, and food. To try to give you some idea of how expansive your options in this game are, I’m going to list all of the skills that I can think of off the top of my head without looking them up: Weapons, Athletics, Swimming, Cooking, Engineering, Armorworking, Weapon Smithing, Science, Assassination, Stealth, Robotics, Lockpicking, and Thievery. To further illustrate, you know the Weapons skill I just mentioned? That’s not a single skill, it’s actually 8 or 9, I couldn’t remember them all without looking them up. 

On the weapon side of things you’ve got: Polearms, Bare Fists, Katanas, Sabres, Giant Cleavers, Crossbows, Turrets, and more. By the way, if your strength is high enough, it is entirely possible to punch someone’s arm off… It’s… pretty crazy. 

There’s a multitude of stats that affect how good your character (or characters, should you decide to recruit/travel with others) is at combat; there are a few hidden ones too like what species you choose for them. That said, like I stated earlier, you will start the game out weak - regular goats will give you trouble. Somewhat ironically, getting beaten to a pulp - which will increase your toughness stat, should you survive - will make you stronger and more effective at combat. You level up your stats by doing them over and over, although there are some caveats to what works and when. 

The combat is really simple, your character handles all of it theirself; no abilities, specials, or anything like that. All you can do is click on who you want them to attack or click away from them to have them flee while praying that they don’t get cut down in the process.

The health system in Kenshi is REALLY interesting. Each extremity has its own health bar and when a certain threshold is reached your character will go unconscious (it’s different for each species). The best thing about this, and I won’t let anyone convince me otherwise, is that it is possible to lose limbs from combat or lack of treatment. Fortunately, it’s possible to get robotic replacement parts should you be skilled enough to buy, steal, or make them! 

Also worth mentioning is the inclusion of  a blood/oil (depending on if you are a robot - err, sorry, the game calls them Skeletons) and a hunger bar, so it’s entirely possible to bleed out or starve to death as well. I’m going to be real with you, when I saw that there was a hunger bar, I was worried this was going to be The Sims in the desert, where I’d constantly have to stop what I was doing and search for food, but as luck would have it you can actually change how frequently your character or characters get hungry at the start of the game. 

Although cruel, Kenshi is generous in the aspects that matter. You can tinker with a lot of settings at the start of the game, like the aforementioned hunger frequency, you can also change the frequency of dismemberments, enemy base spawn rates, squad size, global population, death chance, and things to do with towns you might build like their raid frequency.           

You are also provided with a large list of starting states during character creation. These don’t lock you into any one playstyle, but can make for an interesting intro or help you get started toward something you are hoping to achieve with the character. For example, you can start out surrounded by hostile cannibals, traveling in a group, traveling with a dog, or as a slave; just to name a few. 

I’ve had a lot of harrowing and funny moments with Kenshi. I think the one that stuck out the most to me was a time where Stork was traveling through cannibal territory and after knocking out and mortally wounding tons of malnourished cannibals, he was knocked out by a cheap shot, but luckily his vitals were fine and he was going to make a full recovery… or so I thought. You know what that remaining cannibal did? He picked up my unconscious character and started carrying him back to his camp to eat him. By complete happenstance, a traveling nomad saw and killed the cannibal; thus granting Stork another day at life. 
   
So yeah, Kenshi is a lot. It’s ultimately what you choose to make of it and how you decide to play. There’s also an active and very healthy modding community whose mods are easily accessible through the Steam workshop. 

My praises having been sung, there are a couple of things to be aware of. Firstly, while you can interact with every single character/creature/whatever in the game, it is important to note that you cannot talk to every single one. I’d say that dialogue is limited to a select few characters in each area; somewhere between the 10’s and 20’s, but I wouldn’t necessarily consider that a negative. It just means that the characters that can be conversed with tend to have something of actual substance to say or some sort of purpose behind their words, whether that is segueing into selling you something, being recruited, checking you for illegal goods, or something else.  

The other thing probably goes without saying as to the open-ended nature of the game, but it can be buggy at points. I haven’t run into anything gameplay ending or egregious yet, but I did end up having to leave behind a companion because he got stuck operating a turret and wouldn’t get off it. Granted, I could have reloaded an older save, but his stats were garbage and overall I didn’t deem him worth the effort. There is another answer of sorts, game importing! 

Game Importing was made as both a work around for bugs and a new game plus of sorts (should you check the right options). Importing keeps all of your characters, gear, and stats, while also giving you a wide range of optional things to import like: research, buildings you’ve made, major NPCs statuses as alive or deceased, and relationships with factions. 

For a game that I’ve seen go on sale pretty frequently for around $15 and having managed to dump 30 hours into whilst barely scratching the surface; I’d say the Kenshi was definitely worth it and I am looking forward to diving further into it after I clear away some of my backlog.  

From roving cannibals to beings that emerge from the fog, a variety of enemies await those who attempt to tackle the world of Kenshi!

It took a long time, but now Kenshi is one of those games that never leave my SSD. 
Excellent gameworld, even more excellent mods to tweak it in the way you want it and literally endless possibilities to play you character(s).
The ""grind"" in the beginning can be a little hard, but if you are like me, you don't perceive it as such.
I have build sprawling cities, merchant caravans, assassin guilds, played lonely wanderers, relgious fanatics and brutal bounty hunters. 
Kenshi is a game that requires time, but if you can invest that time, you'll be rewarded. (And will also die horribly in the beginning,)",1688033293,1688033293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there's actually no button assigned to switching between Weapon I and Weapon II. Also, only a few specific kinds of backpacks will let you stack items.

Old Review from 2017 
Absolutely amazing game, I bought it with doubts about how good it would be, but those were quickly squashed.
Took me a while to get my head around it being a squad game. I am so used to playing RPG and this seems very RPG like I found it confusing. 
Once I realised that I was not playing my toon but playing god, it all came clear.
The immersion is great, no quests, no story line, and the tutorial is just an smart help popup. It is just you against a very harsh world. 
Takes a bit of cunning and a little thought, but you can easily make enough to buy food, get that city condo or join the local thieves guild if you fancy.
Or go for a scenic tour, get a drink and some snacks (IRF) hitch a ride on a trader and have a safari. you can pick up some trinkets along the way too.

I highly recommend this game, but get a clock near by, It is addictive, and time quickly passes.",1508943904,1687959401,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

______________________

This is one of the true greats.    It's genre defying and defining.  It's a challenge on many levels and both gratifying and satisfies many different itches.  I cannot recommend it strongly enough.

At 20 bucks which is the current price point, it's got more legs than the last 6 games I bought put together, 2 at AAA prices.

A must buy at full price and one of the few titles I have ever rated 5/5 stars.

the game itself is difficult. unless you cheese the settings or use mods to make life easier, you're gunna get rolled. probably immediately. the learning curve is a bit steep because there's no hand holding or telling the player what to do and how to do it. there's no real tutorial other than some help text about certain things but, honestly, it's not the most helpful. (to me anyway). for example, there's a tip about playing dead, but it doesn't tell you how to play dead, it just says what happens if you get up from playing dead and enemies are still around. not helpful. so i did end up looking a lot of stuff up online. thankfully, there's a decently sized community full of very helpful people. 

once you get into the game it can be a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy challenge. everything i accomplished felt really good. building my own base and group up was slow, but satisfying. i did get messed up many times and had to recover over and over, but the setback wasn't anything i couldn't handle... there's settings when you start about NPCs looting you, limb loss chance, death chance, how hard everything hits, heal rate, etc. i don't mind recovery.... but i'm sure a lot of people find it very annoying to spend so much time in this game near the start injured and unable to kill anything.",1687831666,1687831666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are world to be explore with many experience you could have. You'll meet human, robots, monster, animals etc. You'll need to hunt and find food to eat, manage your body from your head, hands, chest, stomach, legs to stay healthy cause if you dont, you can lose them.

I'd like to tell you all a tale of a great man, a man named Sand Ninja Johunn.
My Life began in the great dessert I had been wandering for many moons my arm missing and I had not eaten in days.
Slavers came to me, the Manhunters. They beat me and took me to the great United Cited in the dessert or they tried to that is. Enter Sand Ninja Johunn The greatest man who had ever lived This man comes barreling over the dunes just outside the city gates blade in hand he alone cuts down every Manhunter with ease never even being touched himself. In the battle I break out of my binds and loot a Manhunter and assist Johunn after the battle we are stormed by United City Samurai. They arrest me for being poor and enslave me yet again into a cell I go with no arm and broken legs, there I sit for 3 days never being fed, healing of nothing but sheer will. When I feel better I begin to pick my cell door after days of trying Im out in the cell down the hall I spy Johunn also arrested I break him out honoring my debt to the great Johunn. Johunn is enraged he alone unarmed butcher every samurai in the prison. I follow him into the streets we make it to the gates we stopped by Samurai, I run. Johunn fights alone fighting ten men at once and winning after making short work of the last of soldiers he joins me as he runnings towards the open dessert I hear a loud crack I watch a harpoon tear through Johunn I run to him I and we soon are captured yet again. Back in the cells I am next Johunn the Samurai made an example of the man and cut every limb from his body. I stayed with him in his death throws as we slowly rotted in the slave pits Johunn dies and several days pass. One day the Samurai are very few in the city I take Johunns gear hidden as a sand ninja I escape slavery and flee to Worlds End, Johann even in death has freed me. I live my life to be as great as Johunn I became one the strongest men in the lands hunting slavers and freeing those like me In the memory of The Great Johunn but one day a day like every other day the world changed forever people starting going missing soon everyone was gone the whole world filled with animals and the odd survivor. It was nice at first I lived like a king in The holy city but soon I wished for death, alone and unchallanged I knew, I knew I would never die I death like Johunn's and so I walked into the great dessert once more seeking death and I found it the city I was from many years ago still bustling with life and slavers I walked into the city dressed as My old friend Johunn the ghost of the sands had returned for days I fought, freeing slaves and killing samurai and manhunters. I soon came to my wounds I was arrested they butchered my like they did Johunn I remember being thrown into a cell as I lay dying I saw something and seconds before death the world made sense for once. I saw a young man just as I was broken, limbless and weak. In this moment I had many questions but only seconds of life left I resigned my confusion and smiled at the young man in the cell and told him he will have a great journey ahead of him and to never stop surviving.

If that is a thing you are interested in then this is one of the best examples I have ever played. There is world lore, it is good and interesting and leaves as many questions as it answers but really your story will be your story. 

It will kick you when you are down and it will knock you down often. If you come in blind it won't be an easy start. That may be a negative for some so it's important to say, but the game for the most part isn't hard to learn so much as there is just a hell of a lot of game to learn and the good thing is that there is a pretty well updated and detailed wiki for when you just don't know how to do X. I have also found it auto saves very often so on the few occasions I have outright died, I found even if I had forgotten to recently save I didn't loose very much if anything. What's more if you are the type of player who really likes to get deep into the numbers, come up with crazy ideas and try to execute them, then this game can scratch that ""what if"" itch in a very satisfying way. What's even better is that if you aren't that type of player, and you really just want to progress with out getting too bogged down into the details, it is absolutely playable from start to ""finish"" (as far as I can tell there is no hard finish, you just finish when you feel it's the end of the story you are playing) with that approach as well.

I can't compare it to anything else since I've never played any game like it. Out of the games I have played I guess Rimworld is the closest match and if you enjoy that game it is likely this is worth a look, but even then, it's very different as an overall package.

In terms of the major faults. Whilst I appreciate the graphic design, the graphic fidelity is pretty poor even for it's release of 2018 let alone today in 2023. It's also a bit grindy at times although some of that likely comes down to approach and caution. My final complaint is that it will crash, maybe eventually or maybe often depending on your luck but I have crashed a couple of times in my time played so far and I know from checking online this is normal, if anything I have been a bit lucky. The game is good at auto saving so significant progress is rarely lost although a crash at the wrong moment could be pretty annoying.",1687465469,1687465469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still love it.

Old review:

Started off as a nobody, getting beaten the shit out of everywhere I went. This strange thoughness stat kept getting higher and higher. My ability to sneak around and steal things went higher and higher.. The pickaxe running rampant on that coppernode outside of town so I can support myself and buy some basic gear, food and bandages.

A good few hours of bing playing I ended up suddenly being able to fight back some packs of starving bandits thanks to my now big thoughness stat and of course a couple of friends I met along the way or bought services off from the stolen items I sold.

Even further in I started adventuring more dangerous parts of the map.. back to finding more friends :(
With a few of them still able to tag along, I found them new robotic limbs to join our glorious journeys.

Then the day arrived for our prosperous group to set up camp, build a town of our own. This was how I become familiar with Okran. Don't f*ck with prayer day.
New friends needed...

I continue the path to explore the map, me and the three friends that survived all my foolishness. Little did they know, they were the start of what I have now, the elite squad in my most dear game of Kenshi.

Thank you for this game.

This is one of the most unique games I've ever played where you're plopped into the middle of a world that is doing just fine without you, and you are no bigger, better, or stronger than anybody else. 

It's up to you to figure out how to survive this truly merciless world. The game doesn't even END when you die. The world keeps going for as long as you watch the screen, going about its business the same as it was before you spawned into it.

You as the player character are very much a simple meaningless person in the chaos of this post apocalyptic world. Literally every person's experience in playing this game is its own unique story, full of hardship, victory, loss, defeat, starvation, desperation, and just trying to survive one more day despite so many odds against you.

This game is extremely well done. Graphics are sort of current but also dragon age vibes from older editions of the game, from older open world rpgs, from before the dark times of dlc and such.

 Very good survival game with an open world you can explore. You will die a lot but it is rewarding when you succeed. Save often. Even the 'easy' scenario you will die a lot. I actually found 'wanderer' was the easiest for me so the challenge of keeping multiple characters alive turned out to be my middle ground. Try out different scenarios to find what works for you and your play style would be my recommendation. 

This game really highlights what people can do when they aren't too stuffed up there own ass-holes, like the supposedly 'AAA devolpers'. This game deserves so many awards they'd have to pay to received just to claim to be 'aaa'. 

While this game does not have a linear story there is enough story bits you can find and enough to explore you kinda just make a story as you go while finding out about the world you have been dropped into. 

I am new to this game, after finding out about it from a video that dropped into my feed one day, but after a little bit playing with it(instead of reading instructions lol), I find it is a vast world but you cannot just traipse across the map without great care both before and during doing so, which itself makes it feel more like a world that could exist. The post apocalyptic aspects you find places... such as the boats by the deadlands coming from a certain direction is just another indication. So far nobody acknowledges that it happened but the signs are everywhere and people just kinda live on top of it. You can buy a place in a city or town and have a place there and you can make your own settlement, but anything you build can be destroyed. So far there is more security in the already secured settlements but... not always. You can be attacked basically anywhere. 

I cannot overstate what a joy(and a frustration at times) this game has been the past few days. It is truly amazing. If you aren't careful it will suck you into it, because while there is no linear storyline for you, as the player to follow, there is enough lore and npcs to discover and settlements to wonder about, to find yourself engrossed in the stories they tell and in wondering if there is a way to find what happened and why the world has those ruins in game? You make your own story but the world is also rich with enough story to make that plausible. It's by no means a blank slate, which is the mistake those supposedly 'triple a' game developers would do trying to copy this if they did(the fact they have done dirty to games before doing things like that means at some point it will probably be attempted but it would be too bland with too little love put into it).  

You must always be conscious of threats. From wildlife, from other humans(mostly from other humans and humanoids actually but... some of the creatures in this game will f you up too- most of them- okay all of them that won't peacefully walk by actually so far have killed me at least once). You won't be able to fight everything. Your athletics skill will help you greatly- you will have to run away from many threats you cannot fight. The leveled lists aren't here to hold your hand in this game. I like this very much. It is quite challenging and it feels like a world that could exist.",1687391014,1687391394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI consistently forgets to do what you tell it to and has the prioritization skills of a 3rd degree methhead. Controlling your character is less ""control"" and more ""suggesting"" they do something and the grind to level anything at all seems to be modeled after the kinds of MMO's people beg others to stay away from. 

The graphics look like if Runescape Classic added 12 more polygons, the world loads in chunks like unfitting gears grinding against your sense of immersion. The systems are obtuse and confusing under the guise of 'difficulty' and the eye-blisteringly abrasive UI looks like Fallout 1 or 2 had a crack baby with popup ads from the early 00's. The tagline ""There are no hero characters"" is a straight up lie when facing down nation leaders or unique enemies with 85+ all skills and the sheer amount of running you'll end up doing should give this a ""running simulator"" tag before anything else. 

So WHY THE FUCK would I EVER recommend this game? Because although it's been one of the most absolutely fury inducing gaming experiences of my life that have ended in hurling more insults and inventing slurs that don't even really exist at my screen in pure rage... 

If I don't hunt down and imprison every last member of that Holy Nation so I can use the skin peeler mod on their self-righteous flesh I can never feel complete as a human being. Because despite all the vitriol I vomited up at the beginning of this, this is a one-in-a-million kind of unique game experience that comes together to make something unlike anything else I've ever played. It's an MMO made for one, a universe and game system that really truly doesn't give a shit whether you have fun. It's entirely unique to the palette in the most campy, terrible and frustrating yet wonderful, fulfilling and exciting ways possible. It's a game that is so bad it becomes good, so good it becomes bad. And it's this warbling between horrible and incredible that will probably keep me playing it well past CoD 2056 or Diablo 9 or whatever other lifeless corporate product arrives to try and convince you it's doing something unique and different. 

As much as I fucking hate this fucking game there is genuinely nothing else like it. Kenshi doesn't give a damn whether you love it or hate it.

BLOODSPORT!  -The Kumite

 -  say it... say iiiit !!!   

This sandbox can do a lot!   After mastering the controls and gaining substantial wealth through shear luck, I had created a character that could not be seen, (stealth), could one shot kill, (sneak attack), and single-handedly brought down every gang leader or 'King'.  Well, brought them all down to...The KUMITE!  

Imagine waking up, from a slumber, a King with armies and weapons and gold. Now, in a daze from a blow to the head, you find yourself in a rusty old cage like a crabby old crab. (luvin' those crabbies btw)
An incredibly fit man with only  a rag covering his crotch, is opening your cage and passing some moldy bread to you. 
You find yourself starving, a feeling you've never had in your lifetime of dictatorship and cruelty.  As you consume your life giving tasteless block of carbs, your eyes drift to the other cages.  ""My God!"" you whisper under your breath...

The room you are in is a dimly, torch lit, arena...of death.  The stench of dried blood, human or otherwise, the crumbling pile of old weapons and armor discarded in the corner, where your eyes lock, there! your armor, and your sword!  If only you could reach...or sneak a chance at picking this rusty lock!   

A loud bang and your cage door is opened. A huge monster of a man is now dragging you out, your fingers curling around a rusty bar, resisting...futile.    The overhead lights flash on, blinding you, still coming out of a light coma. 
A new sound pounding in your head, a drum...beating...boom...boom...BOOM!   A roar of chaos from a crowd of dozens of cheering drunkards demanding your death by dismemberment for your crimes.  Then you notice the machine...its...spinning and grinding away the final remnant of a man, much like you, who found himself in a predicament that no man wants to awaken to. The only thing left now, is to wish for death to be swift. 

Dux, Frank Dux, walks calmly onto the platform, one way in, one way out. The gate is guarded by a fierce dog like creature. Winning this fight is the only option.  Dux comes closer to you, you're staggering to get up, a painful surge from your left leg displays a robotic limb!  Your leg is missing! Those bastards!  As you stand, the crowd boos.   Dux turns his back to engage the crowd's cheers for him, ""Dux, Dux, Dux!..""  It's the last name you'll ever know.   

In a flash Dux side kicks your chest and you crumple.  The crowd ROARS!   ""Kumite! Kumite!""  
You yell into the deafening silence, ""You bastards!  You'll never get away with this!!!""  Dux's flying jump kick lands knocking you over, once again, yet this time, your right arm is now hanging by a thread.  Consciousness fading... the sounds of the mocking crowd grow silent...as the sound of a flesh flaying and bone grinding torture machine begins......

Yes, I created an entire Bloodsport arena for my crew to enjoy the rush of a fight to test their skills against the best of the best.  Thief, beggar, cripple, or King.  No one is spared, anyone can\will join, whether they want to or not.  The fun part, keeping them alive long enough to fully android them (or handicap) only to stake them out front of your base fort to attract the enemy trying to rescue them.   The only difference is that in my Kumite, there is no word for 'uncle' (Ma-te). 
Only death. 

Everything about this game will change the way you believe games can be made.  Besides the lack of voice, which you use your imagination for anyways, it seems as if what ever happens to you is REALLY up to you.  Yes, you run a lot. Yes, you need a crew, ultimately, and yes you will probably die the first few times you start. But you can do it. And that feeling of reward and dopamine drip is what you've been searching for all those late nights when you're realizing there's nothing good out and the best games came out before you were born, maybe.  Kenshi is amazing.  Mods or not, the vanilla product is an essential part of any gamer's list. It doesn't just change the way you believe games can be played, it changes the way your brain thinks about the rest of Life in general - Never accept that which is offered to you unless you know clearly the options you do have that are not offered. This...is life.

also life, I have over 1000 hrs, played.  I play off line so my wife doesn't see.... how much I played this one game.  HA!",1687212439,1687214020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Usually I don't like games without a set goal/goals and a curated narrative arc unless they are management sims or something similar. Kenshi breaks this mold. So far 71 hours in and several restarts later, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. Kenshi is unforgiving and you need to learn from your mistakes. With the default starting scenarios, you're normally worse than a farm hand at start. Screw up once and you'll quickly be a limb short and bleeding out on the desert sands and are actually happy when slavers passing by spot you, patch your wounds and ""rescue"" you into their cages.

The amount of stuff and mechanics really impresses me, even more so as they mostly work and give depth, thought being simple enough to not choke you under them. After larger fights between factions, the field is usually covered in dying people (YOU can patch up and sell to slavers in turn), others crawling with smashed or severed limbs, some lying unconsious or comatose, some might even feign death. It's not just ""everybody dead, I like that"". And you can mess with the factions and things do change.

Your outpost can experience raids and tithe collectors. Research is implemented in a nice way and specialization bears fruit fast. Many functions can be automated by making them into jobs for the members of your group. Your compound can function as anything from a military base or a bandit camp to a farm or a trading post.

That being said, Kenshi does have it's problems. they mostly come in the form of undeveloped facets of the game. There's so much stuff in it that it's inevitable some things will be left on the back burner. Trading is one of these. While you can be a traders, either travelling along a route or having your own store, the customers and trade goods are implemented way too simply for my taste. For example you can't set your sell prices and some stuff you can sell is not wanted anywhere and just stays there, gathering dust. Also the social aspects with the NPCs are quite limited, though there's some fun stuff going on in overheard conversations and chats between your characters. A lot of these problems can be marked down as problems stemming from the size of the dev team (as I understand it Kenshi was a solo project and the upcoming Kenshi 2 has more people involved).

Play Kenshi NOW

Now, I know I have to post an actual review of the game after this or some british cigarette is going to complain in the comments about meme review whatever.

Kenshi is THE sandbox game. Theres a lot of commentary about kenshi being ""insanely difficult,"" ""incredibly unforgiving"" whatever. That is true, but not in the way you would expect. The game is hard because you dont know the world. All of the difficulty spikes are avoidable by carefully learning the world as opposed to attempting to game it. You CAN game it, dont get me wrong: but that requires a deep, in depth knowledge of the world that comes naturally with time.

Theres a reason why so many people have 500, 600, 700 hours. Its because the game is incredibly full of things to do, but things all happen slowly. I have three playthroughs on record. THREE. One got to mid game, the other two are around late game. The idea of a ""300 hour playthrough"" is an absurd idea thats normally reserved for a highly cultivated experience in a game like DOS 2 or PFWOTR, not a sandbox rpg. The fact that Lo-Fi pulls this off is nothing short of midas fucking magic.

Now, thats not to say I havent modded the game. Most people mod the game. However, Kenshi isnt, to put it bluntly, a post morrowind bethesda game. You dont NEED to mod the game into functionality, or into having features. Modding is great, and despite the game's engine, Ogre, being basically a v4 engine made with mud and hope, doesnt horribly destroy performance even at higher settings (I do not have a high end modern setup, my PC is from 2018 and its parts were dated then)

This is all you need to know. If this interests you: buy kenshi. If you are dissatisfied within like a dozen hours? Play more kenshi. If you're dissatisfied at like 60? Shit guess I was wrong, but at least you're supporting a fucking awesome dev.

The camera is uncooperative at the best of times, stuttering and defiant and the worst. The the game has so few environmental assets it looks like a game that came out in 1997 and the color palette only makes it worse. Also the color palette is so bad it fatigues the eyes everything washes together. 
    They made the very poor choice of not adding loading screens when loading save files in game, you see everything pop in bit by bit while world simulation tries to start and it doesn't suspend the controls while it loading. It gives the impression the the development team is a complete mess and and they forced that mess into software. There is so many more things wrong that i could write forever. I wonder how this game ever made it out of beta. i'm glad i got it for next to nothing on sale because that's what this game is worth. the game is so bad that you just have to laugh sometimes because so many poor choices were made, and validated. 
   The game-play is more distracting then fun. the battle system would be kind of fun with proper balance but with the other control an camera issues it just adds to the annoyance. The difficulty would be fine with proper incentive, the best way to level one of the best skills in the game is to lower your stats to make yourself weaker and get hit by stronger enemies then yourself...",1686953541,1686953541,False,2,3,0.376051068305969238,0,True,False,False

In a stark contrast to games like Fallout 4, Kenshi makes no attempt to paint you as a special protagonist or a destined savior. Instead, you're just another survivor, trying to navigate the harsh realities of this ruined world, and that's the beauty of it.

In Kenshi, you start at the bottom rung of society, experiencing life just as any other denizen of this dystopian world would. There's a steep learning curve to the game, but once you get the hang of it, it offers a level of immersion that few other titles can match.

The game allows you to live any life you want. Want to be a nomadic trader, a bounty hunter, a farmer, or even an empire builder? The choice is all yours. You can hone a variety of skills, recruit team members with their unique traits, and even build your own city anywhere on the map. This unfettered freedom is one of Kenshi's greatest assets.

But it's not just about survival and growth. The world of Kenshi is rife with political strife, notably between the Holy Nation ,the United Cities and Shek Kingdoms, each with their own philosophies and methods. Slavery, banditry, and all manner of social ills are common here, and as you navigate these complexities, you can choose to support a faction, remain neutral, or go against everyone.

What's fascinating is that your choices have genuine, often far-reaching consequences. Picking a side can drastically alter your gameplay, sometimes leading to outcomes that you may not have anticipated or desired. This level of dynamism keeps you on your toes, as you must constantly adapt to the evolving world around you.

Visually, Kenshi isn't the most impressive game out there, but its unique aesthetic works well to underscore the game's grim and unforgiving setting. The world is vast and filled with distinct biomes, each with its own unique threats and opportunities.

Kenshi is a difficult game; it doesn't hold your hand or guide you through a pre-ordained narrative. It's a game that drops you into a brutal, post-apocalyptic world and says, ""Survive."" But it's precisely this challenging yet rewarding gameplay, coupled with vast freedom and impactful choices, that makes Kenshi a special gem in the world of RPGs.",1686891298,1686891298,True,5,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

I have 3 hours of gameplay, and had few mods at the time.

I was trying to build a small base outside a village I wanted steal from. I went back to the starting location to get some stuff and ventured back out to build my base. 

The game crashes REPEATEDLY when I get to a certain area on the way to the village. Since then, I have spent more time on reddit and steam trying to solve the problem than I have enjoying the game. 

Even after removing the mods nothing worked. 

The time I had playing the game is fun, but even at a discounted price I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you wanna spend time learning why your game crashed for the 5th time in a row.

With its unforgiving gameplay, open-ended exploration, and deep mechanics, Kenshi offers an immersive and challenging experience. Prepare to navigate a harsh and dangerous world as we delve into the intricacies of this ambitious RPG.

[h1]Vast Open World and Exploration[/h1]
Kenshi presents players with a vast and desolate open world to explore. From sprawling deserts to dense forests and bustling cities, each location is richly detailed and filled with unique encounters. The freedom to traverse the world at your own pace, discover hidden secrets, and encounter diverse factions creates a sense of adventure and discovery that keeps you engaged for hours on end.

[h1]Non-Linear Gameplay and Character Progression[/h1]
One of Kenshi's defining features is its non-linear gameplay and character progression. The game doesn't follow a traditional narrative structure, allowing you to forge your own path in this unforgiving world. Whether you choose to be a trader, a bandit, a mercenary, or a leader of your own faction, the choices are yours to make. As your characters gain experience, they can improve their skills and abilities, opening up new possibilities for survival and growth.

[h1]Harsh Survival Mechanics[/h1]
Survival is at the core of Kenshi, and the game doesn't hold your hand. You'll face constant challenges, from hostile creatures to bandits and competing factions. Managing resources, including food, water, and supplies, becomes a crucial part of your survival strategy. The threat of death is ever-present, making every decision and encounter a matter of life and death.

[h1]Base Building and Faction Interactions[/h1]
Kenshi allows players to establish their own bases and build their own settlements. From small outposts to fortified cities, the possibilities for base building are extensive. Gathering resources, recruiting NPCs, and defending your territory become essential aspects of the gameplay. Interacting with various factions, forming alliances, or engaging in conflicts adds depth and complexity to the world of Kenshi.

[h1]Dynamic World Simulation[/h1]
The world of Kenshi is alive and ever-changing. The game employs a dynamic world simulation that goes beyond the player's actions. Factions wage war, cities expand or decline, and economies fluctuate. These dynamic elements create a living, breathing world that feels immersive and believable.

[h1]Modding Community and Customization[/h1]
Kenshi boasts a dedicated modding community that has created a wealth of user-generated content. From quality-of-life improvements to total conversions, mods enhance the game and offer new gameplay mechanics, items, and quests. The ability to customize your Kenshi experience ensures that the game's replayability is virtually endless.

[h1]Atmospheric Visuals and Sound Design[/h1]
Kenshi may not feature cutting-edge graphics, but its stylized visuals have a unique charm. The desolate landscapes, detailed character models, and atmospheric lighting contribute to the game's immersive experience. The sound design complements the visuals, with a fitting soundtrack and ambient sounds that enhance the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Kenshi is a challenging and ambitious sandbox RPG that offers a unique and unforgiving experience. Its vast open world, non-linear gameplay, and emphasis on survival create a sense of immersion and freedom rarely found in other games. While its steep learning curve and harsh mechanics may deter some players, those who embrace its challenges will be rewarded with a deeply satisfying and memorable journey. If you're seeking a gritty and immersive RPG that pushes the boundaries of player agency and exploration, Kenshi is a game that deserves your attention.",1396220535,1686793138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Built base near religious racists, trapped their paladin squad inside my walls, anyone getting through the gates gets whacked by paladins. Slowly build turrets so I can defend myself. Build cages for... purposes. One day I decide my martial artist needs to be faster and stronger, so I send them with naked arms and legs into the acid rain death desert, off melt their arms and legs. SUDDENLY they have prosthetic arms and legs of the highest quality and sprint back to my base at basically 100mph. They get back to the base but I forgot one very very important thing. Religious racists hate robots. My gate guards make pin cushions of the paladins but my super dee duper martial artist is out for a few days. Cage the surviving paladins, then I used them to train my new squad members, I procured a strange insect looking thing or two, worf from star trek(probably) and a few of the cutie pie robots. Every few days I got these religious idiots coming to ask me to pray, I tell them no and they get promptly told what's what. My new dogs keep stealing dismembered limbs and running off with them. I saved a paladin from dying, he had lost both of his legs. He liked his new bed for a bit, then became a training dummy. I left him in his heaviest armor and let my new recruits beat him whilst he lay there defenseless.

Suddenly I have a squad of the finest shaolin monks known to the kenshi Universe, able to take down the dreaded beak thing in 1 punch. I go murder all the religious racist forces in their cities and they get taken over by various peeps. Kenshi was better for my murder spree and everyone lived happily ever after.

Well if that sound strange and also pretty much the same as the fallout, please look at the roman, the build that still stand after like 3000 years is you guess it church, something and housing of the eilte.

[h1] About the game [/h1]
The devs of Kenshi are one of the most amazing devs ever. (Dont be scared of my time limit, I played before), They truly love their community and clearly are making a game THEY enjoy rather then a game that makes money. I will always support these kind of devs, and will certainly be buying kenshi 2. 

The game start slow and it is hard, and you may be confused, or think theres not much to do. GIVE IT A TRY, dont give up, watch a youtube video on the game before judging it because there is so much you can do, that you probably dont understand. There is a reason this is overwhelmingly positive. It is very good at simulating what survival in this world really would be like, and its not afraid to add stuff other games would not add, such as the option to be kept as a slave if people manage to beat you up and decide they want a slave.  It really adds realism and harsh choices .

[h1] About single click mouse support.. [/h1]
 It would be nice though if there was support for single click mouse, most gaming LAPTOPS have a single click mouse, and a very large portion of people use these.  it is impossible to do certain menu actions with one in this game as you need to hold down the click button to keep action menus open and click with the other. It would be nice to change this in settings where the menu stays open with a single click. Forcing many people to buy a mouse to connect to the laptop when many of us don't like using mouse.  Usually laptops dont use a single click mouse but for some reason, huge gaming laptops like nvidia geforce laptops do.  And despite how popular these laptops are becoming (I know 3 people who own them), there is no support for single click mouse for may games. Which is really weird considering how many people really use these kinds of laptops.

Untold generations have gone by, we no longer need blacksmiths, yet a man who makes something beautiful with his hands is still cherished, the item he made still considered exceptional in quality even stacked against the machine-perfection of a highly engineered line.

Kenshi is, in essence, that one exceptional item made by hand. Driven forward by one guy who had a vision and the desire to see that vision fulfilled rather than try to play it safe. For all of the jank or potential flaws, I think that alone would make this a game worth playing. As it turns out though? When someone cares about their game, it usually turns out pretty good and with enough redeeming qualities to make it worth playing even without respect as to the difficulty of it's creation.

But that was no easy task when he struggled to even simply feed himself. He had no space for pride; he did what he had to to survive, to support and arm himself and, soon, his allies. He gathered those who were outsiders. Shamed warriors, exiled hivers, former bandits, and sought to build them a home. Through great hardship he built a camp, then a village, then a city. 'Freedom', a home to all, safe and fortified, with food, water and shelter aplenty, even amidst an arid wasteland.

For a while, he was proud and satisfied, but one day, he realised he had lost sight of what he had once set out to do. He had made a safe place for people like him, yes, but there were so many still in captivity. So he left his city in the hands of Logan, his first companion, and took off into the deserts. Under the veil of night, he snuck into one of the slaver camps. With half the guard distracted by attacking Skimmers, he stalked the other half, taking them out one at a time and locking them in their own cages. He freed the slaves and had intended to go after the slave master, but found her guards to be too wary and too powerful. When a wandering patrol passed through the camp as well, he was forced into retreat, but even in that defeat, he brought almost twenty men a newfound freedom. Six of them remained by his side, motivated by honour, vengeance, bravery, security or adventure. He looked over these gathered six - their bodies worn, their muscles weakened, their stomachs empty. He had been just like them once. There, he made a decision. 

They would be his Chainbreakers. 

He would stop building cities and start building armies. He took these six to the edge of the desert, finding refuge with the Tech Hunters and started to train them. They would strike out at bandits and slavers patrols and take their equipment. With little to no experience in combat, they struggled, but Axel always ensured they'd all return home safely, even if not always whole. When they gained in power, they set out to build a camp in the middle of the desert to strike out from. Now out on their own, however, they found themselves beset on all sides. Raids by the slavers that learned to hate them. Attacks organised by the Trader's Guild when they refused to pay for 'protection'. When they almost lost the outpost itself to Reavers, Axel had them retreat, to build a safe place on the edge again.

But even as his Chainbreakers started to build a new community, he realised that he was doing it again. He'd wanted to keep the people who trusted him safe, but that wasn't even what many of them wanted. He stopped them in the middle of their work and brought them back to the camp they had been building with a simple declaration.

They were going to war.

He left for Freedom, the safe place he had once made, to seek recruits for his new war. He returned with an army. The small camp became his second city, Liberation, a citadel built for war. Inspired by his newfound fire, his Chainbreakers pushed themselves. Brave Metaru sacrificed his own limbs, replacing them with steel, so he could better protect others. Vengeful Hew built a prison for their enemies and an arena for training - and to make them bleed. Honourable Harp built a home and a hospital, to keep their own safe. Once fearful Hengu took the animals under his wing, leading his pack into battle. Scheming Maggie saved the bandits that had once attacked them from starvation by trading their cell for one in the United Cities, letting the slavers fund their own downfall. And manic Dirt ensured that none could approach their citadel, setting traps and defences that annihilated almost anyone before they could breach the gates.

When the United City taxmen next came, they were faced with walls that were bristling with turrets and Axel waiting for them by the gate. There would be no more hiding, no more cowering. He would no longer appease them to stay safe, hoping that ""one day"" he would finally strike back. Nothing more would be given. Not one cent. Not one inch.

Until all were free, the desert sands would run red.

This is the story I have written - and am still writing - in Kenshi. I didn't go in intending to do so and I don't normally do so, it just... Happened. Because while many games like to tout that you can 'do anything' and 'play it your way', Kenshi makes true on it. It will not be for everyone. It is best played by accepting loss, because you will see a lot of it, but the more hardship you face, the more you will grow. Your characters will be beaten and robbed, will have their limbs chewed off by wild animals, find themselves captured and enslaved and yet in Kenshi it is not just possible, but basically expected that you will recover from all of that.

The game is buggy and slow to load, many of the aesthetics aren't pretty (often deliberately, I think) and the balance in the game is all over the place. Yet I keep finding myself returning.

The graphics are trash and the game is held together with duct tape and super glue.

BUT

When you learn it was made by one man over many years and a lot of help from people along the way its a wonder it even exists at all and one can forgive its shortcomings.

First time I played this game I HATED IT. I just kept dying at everything, got frustrated by the game and refunded it. There was just something about tho, I kept watching videos of people playing it on youtube, eventually I decided to try it again and I actually got into it.

I like to think of Kenshi as a PROOF OF CONCEPT of game, if it was made with a real budget could be one of the greatest games EVER MADE so I think Kenshi 2 could be huge.

This game is only for a certain kind of gamer, its brutally hard and unforgiving, it never holds your hand and even after you die, the game will go on without you, the world of kenshi dose not care about you or anyone else in it, everyone is out for themselves.

Lots of mods for this game so you can really play it however you like, the mods are the best thing about the game in terms of making it better then it would be otherwise with the limited assets the creator had.

If you can look past the graphics and the many other shortfalls of this game such as the engine and bugs you will actually find a really cool game concept and will learn to love getting beat down as soon as you walk out of a town by some starving bandits for a loaf of bread that you dont even have.",1686596267,1686596349,True,109,5,0.883944153785705566,0,True,False,False

The world itself is apocalyptic, this is abit personal to me but dustier worlds aren't  that aesthetically appealing
Going alongside it, the map is dreary, I never quite can find a place I'm happy building a base. Locations that look good are restricted, by other groups, by clutter, etc. Open areas are meanwhile lacking.

Taking inspiration from Metal Gear Solid and Ninja Gaiden to create a robust yet beautifully simple experience. You play as Joe Kenshi, a former Christian, on a deliberately vague mission to find the ""truth"". Joe Kenshi is a very well developed all-round character, his mastery of Kung-Fu-Kickboxing and ability to speak to plants often come into play as you roam around seemingly aimlessly on the moon looking to find ""the truth"". The local moon people are distrusting of Joe at first, as humans were responsible for the sun's disappearance, but are soon won over when they realise he is just a man on a mission to ""find the truth"".  Joe's character is revealed to be traumatised from his past however, and actively hinders his quest when he begins to struggle with it much more greatly. Joe stroked a guide dog as a child, which ultimately led to it being put down as it reverted back to a normal dog (It was very good of the developers to mention this little detail as it applies to real life on a daily basis). The underwater fishtank level as well as the tower of bricks were some of the most enjoyable yet challenging gaming experiences I have ever experienced while gaming.

I won't spoil much more as I fear I might have said to much on this new release. What I will say is this: if you purchase and play this game be prepared to have every morsel of your being fully invested into Joe Kenshi's story.

I struggled with UI and basic premise. Why is my guy so useless and weak? What am I supposed to do? Do timelapse of ore mining?

I watched a lot of meme Kenshi videos to try to appreciate it from different perspective. Then I sat down and watched basic tutorial which taught me that I can use few keys to make manial labour more tolerable. Then I recruited my first guy, then I made enough money to be admited to guild then I made a small outpost then I made a farm, build defences, etc... Suddenly what was at the start ""too much time"" now changed with me stopping the game every third second because something needed to be managed by me. It was like new game was hidden under the previous one.
Suddenly a spark awakened inside of me. I started reading Kenshi wiki, reading about ancient books, locations, bosses, weird animals and I started to be pulled in and spending hours playing. It was a long time when some game managed to entertain me like this.

You suck, your character sucks, and you will die. At least until you figure out how to survive, and develop your skills. Sometimes it's your fault and sometimes it isn't, the world of Kenshi has never claimed to be a fair one, and you will be brutally punished if you treat it as anything of the sort. 

You could ask any longtime Kenshi enjoyer for their story in this world and while elements may be shared between them, no two stories would be the same. Rebel against a nation of fanatical human supremacist cultists alongside those working to take them down in the shadows, aid the Anti-Slavers in taking down the United Cities and their slave economy, build a faction of your own from nothing and wage war against the mighty Shek empire, the choice is yours.

-No scripts for you to follow, no quests. You kinda make your own story as you go along.
-The game doesnt revolve around your characters. You can get beaten up, enslaved or eaten alive, and the game will continue on. 
-The gameplay is unforgiving. You will lose... ALOT, but thats what I personally like about it, it makes leveling up and eventually winning your fights much more satisfying. No handholding, no tutorials (execpt for helpful popups every now and then) the game just drops you in and lets you go do whatever you want.
-Replayablity 11/10. I think this is what separates it from other games in its genre. You could start and end games differently depending on what factions you're with, and the corresponding world states. There's literally an endless amount of ways to playand enjoy the game. Together with some amazing mods from the community, you will find yourself hours deep in Kenshi.

Has a slightly complex stats system for every character,  a slightly complex health and limb health system, hunger needs for characters, Clothing and weapons give buffs and debuffs making it very dynamic.

There isn't much of a story to it. It really is a sandbox, you just sorta make your story as you play.

The Game can be brutally hard in some respects and yet hilariously easy to exploit in others. In a way the games difficulty is dynamic depending on how much you want to cheese the systems or ... If you choose to play is straight. Either way, the game is gonna throw curve balls your way. You'll take your lumps and don't even THINK about hitting that Quickload button, taking your lumps and getting stronger from failure as well as the drama of things not always working out, that's part of the beauty of Kenshi's design.

Yet in the end, most of the time I've spent with the game has been a joy... Whether it was camping just outside of a long ruined Skyscraper on the edge of a great desert, only to be attacked by giant insects.

Or having my Bone-Wolf puppy whom I'd recently bought eaten by Starving bandits after they beat me unconcious. Only to get revenge later by luring said starving bandits into a pack of fully grown, vicious and wild Bone-Wolves, seeing them torn to pieces by said wolves who then gleefully begin ripping the limbs of their corpses and eating them.

Or getting knocked out by slavers and carried to a workers camp in Holy Nation territory only to manufacture a daring escape after spending two days working as a Slave.

This game is special. I used to think it was ugly, but the more I played... The more beautiful the world and the graphics became to me... I had my band walking through the Bonelands by the beach one day as the sun was peaking over the Mountains to the East and it was just, gorgeous... The game is possessed of incredible story-weaving possibilities that just... Manifest, as you play. I've never played a game that said as little as Kenshi yet conveyed so much.

That had so little in the way of dedicated ""Story"" or Questing yet had so much going on.

Kenshi should literally be studied by upcoming Game Developers. That's how good this game is.

This is the game that other games should be LEARNING from.

During my first major base build, I underestimated the amount of resources I would need to fully construct my defenses. I had built a long oval of defensive walls with rock mines and material crafting elements on one side with an open half on the other side of the ""oval"". There were not enough materials to create a gate or finish the walls as I had used the remaining materials to build a small building for housing and storing resources near the open half.

After the first few days, a group of bandits showed up demanding tribute. Instead of talking to them, I had my boys sit on the other side of the base in stealth mode behind the rock mines. The bandits charged into the base and took up residence in my small storage building. Meanwhile, I kept mining while trying to plot a way to remove them, but I couldn't think on it long before a second group of bandits showed up. The same thing happened. I kept my worker bees in stealth while this second group plunged into the storage shed. Nothing happened. All quiet.

Now, I'm really in a pickle now. Small bandit groups aren't that tough, but my workers were laborers with mediocre weapons and armor. Not much good in a serious fight, and there were two separate groups of sweaty desert bandits standing shoulder to shoulder in my storage building. There must have been several dozen of them at least. I'm about to run to the nearest fishing town to hire some mercenaries when the third group shows up. These new guys are rude and hella nude. They're also hungry as hell for human flesh, and there had to be around 50 of them.

The cannibals stood at the open half of the base for a hot minute before they too plunged into the storage building. It was absolute pandemonium. The bandits are screaming, the cannibals are yelling, and there's blood everywhere. Earlier, I had my boys build some internal walls with crossbows on them, and we're sniping the all out brawl that's occurring. The moment one of the bandits goes down a cannibal will scoop him up and take him to some far away dinner table. It's like a self cleaning mess.

After about 30 minutes, nothing and no one remains except for some bodies, arms, legs, and a massive amount of blood. The cannibals aren't even interested in eating my guys, and the few remaining bandits are simply hobbling away. I then built the remainder of the base so that the front gate was partially submerged in the ocean. Any would be hostiles would have to swim to it in full armor just to knock, and this never happened again.

God help me, I can't stop playing this stupid shit.",1685911298,1685911298,True,521,172,0.959679365158081055,0,True,False,False

Kenshi's game play is tedious; the combat is point and click. The difficulty starts off on one side of the spectrum, being very hard and stays that why until the endgame where the game becomes extremely easy. Overall the game play is not impressive and has next to no player skill involved. That being said, its addictive. After 250 hours of playing this game I still find myself entranced with just watching my characters fight after clicking the ""Attack all"" option.

Where this game really shines is exploration, and the vast amount of freedom and randomness you can encounter. If you want to stay a low level and become a trader, fearing bandits and monsters, you can. If you want to be a lone warrior and train up to being able to kill dozens of enemies all by yourself, you can. Do you want to destroy one of the major faction and kill world leaders? Well, you can. There is no end to the possibilities, and with player created mods, the choices only expand.

Exploration is the main focus for me personally. Each area is vastly different from the next giving the player a lot of eye candy to find. If you enjoy post apocalyptic art styles and question with no answers, you'll love the world of Kenshi. My main disappointments with exploration is the lack of unique monsters roaming the world. There are only a handful of monsters that stick out in the mind; most of which being almost identical to real life animals. Also, many minor factions feel the same or so similar they might as well be the same. This is very much the case when exploring Old Empire structures, only two or three enemy variations are ever seen inside them.

Overall this game is absolutely and positively amazing, especially if you take into account that a single person did the overwhelming majority of the work. I cannot accurately describe why I love this game as much as I do, so you'll have to experience it for yourself. 

Please, play this game and give it a chance. It might look confusing but if an idiot like me can figure it out there is no possibility you can't as well.",1643446387,1685907401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I entered the swamps, and we get attacked by a group of people, they knock us all out, and butcher my dog for meat. After a while they eventually leave and the 3 of us make it to the nearby town after patching up. I recruit 3 people, and now there's 6 of us, we should do really well!

Let's just say.. 6 people left town that day, and only a limping man carrying a person in a coma on his shoulder returned. Everyone else was eaten alive.

My remaining 2 people eventually recover, and I decide I want to make them drug smugglers, so now we run drugs back and forth from various towns making a profit. We find a guy at a bar who gives a sob story about his sister, and says he wants to join us to get revenge. I say sure.

Our first trip outside of town, all hell breaks lose. Beak Things, Gorillo Bandits, Blood Spiders, all in one chaotic fight, the new guy goes down, as well as one of my drug smugglers. I pick up my fallen smuggler, and run them off to a small island in a river, for safety, as I go back for the new guy. 

Hmm new guy isn't there? I click on his portrait, I see him being kidnapped by a robot! I chase after them, but the robot is too fast. This whole time I am thinking ""where is he taking him?"". We eventually end up at a tower, red lights all inside, and filled with ""peeler"" machines! They place him in one, and it slowly rips limb from limb from his body, until they eventually chuck him in a meat grinder. Not the best revenge arc for him, but he gave it a good go. 

So now I'm back to running drugs, and in the process of learning how to start my own drug farm/base.

Summary: Kenshi is hardcore; Kenshi is one of the most brutal survival games. On first looks the game may look like a RPG and even though the game is a lot better when you RP and get into the lore of the world and the people around you, The first thing you may notice from other RPGs is that you are not the hero, even on some of the best starts you start off on the lowest teir of survivor. I went though 10 different characters just trying to figure out how to leave the starting zone and set up a base. That's the other feature that makes this game feel like a survival game. When I had built my base I thought it would be just that ; I built a giant beacon for all my haters to attack me + making sure I had enough food for my little town. After you have a decent base and survived a few waves you can finally wage war with the Other factions (Yes kenshi has now become a strategy game). 



PROS : 
Deep Lore with many characters and in game pay off for reading and checking things out

Very rewarding imagine being a loser and then becoming the ruler of your own small kingdom 

Skill system. each skill can be effected by weather, weight, armor, and race. 

Fighting looks nice, you don't fight directly but you watch your little guy and their crew fight and once they rank up it looks nice



CONS :
You will die alot. your fav character might die, you might be out with one squad when your town gets raided 
and you comeback to nothing but bodies. 

The loading in some parts can take a minute and if you have a bunch of squads running around the game can get slow at that point.

Building can be buggy, auto store and building clipping at times can be buggy nothing major just dismantle and place again if needed.




OVERALL SCORES 
 
FUN: 8/10 I enjoy this game l lot and recommend it for anyone that loves a challenge and strategy games 

REPLAY VALUE : 9/10 Once you can build bases and fight off ppl the game gets soo much more replay value 

PRICE: 30$ 5/10 Not the 60-70$ a triple A game is but still a bit too high for an Indie game.

GRAPHICS : 7/10 The game does not look pretty, with a lot of mesh work needing to be done but its not ugly 

GAMEPLAY MECHANICS: 8/10 I the way everything works together in this game and the way combat flows and feels. Example for combat, the factors that go into play are Weather,Armor, Skill, Hunger , Day/Night , Race , Dodge, Stealth, Limbs, Weapon grade, weapon type, NPC attributes.

233860,139290175,76561198181970265,0,17,613,0,613,1685487092,"Kenshi is a tough game to review, because it's massive and the potential is enormous. The selling point of the game is that you can do anything, and that seems to be true, but I can't really recommend it for a few reasons:

1.) You NEED a guide to play. (This game does whatever the opposite of ""holding the gamer's hand"" is. Guides provided in-game are vague, brief, and largely unhelpful. Especially to get going, you need to look up a guide of some kind pertaining to your starting point, which varies based on your background and race selection. It is my opinion that a game should be self-contained and should not require other materials to be playable. This game cannot reasonably be considered as self-reliant. Perhaps if you are extremely out-of-the-box with your thinking, you'll do okay, but it's not guarenteed.)

2.) Boredom & Realism to a Fault. (This game relies HEAVILY on waiting. Waiting for animals to pass by, waiting for followers to mine materials, waiting for characters to walk on the map, etc. It's incredibly boring. After awhile I got to a point where I realized that the game had turned into 95% waiting, 5% other that I stopped and thought about why I was playing this at all. In most basic starts, you have virtually nothing to your name and must start from scratch. Most NPCs are either designed to trade with you, sell you themselves, kill you, or spout off a line or two of dialouge. This game is not quite completely stripped of interaction, but its close. It might be realistic to have to build everything from scratch, but it's not fun gameplay. Multiple irl hours must be spent to even create a shitty outpost with virtually nothing in it. It really gets to a point where you wonder when/if things will pick up. You need to be grinding to make money to survive, but that basically turns the game into a less fun version of the Sims set in the apocalypse. Combat is merciless. You have no chance of killing anything on your own and will get mauled by low tier enemies. You need to train a character intensively for them to even have a chance of hitting the wide side of a house and armor often slightly protects you will drastically lowering your attack score. I understand wanting the player to take combat seriously and even make them afraid of it, but there is a ridiculously high barrier to entry in so many ways for this game)

3.) No Story (The game leaves it up to the player to create their own story, which sounds more fun than it is, and requires alot of ""headcanon"" to work. Having no direction is worse than being railroaded in some cases. It is more fun to watch a video of someone explaining a playthrough they had in Kenshi than to make one yourself, and that's not how games should work. In concept, this game sounds really fun, but it just does not translate well, unless your goal is to explore and you are alright with dying multiple times via trial-and-error, monotonamy quickly settles in.)

4.) Who is this for? (This game seems to be only for people with these overlapping characteristics: they enjoy brutally difficult games, and they enjoy almost limitless freedom, with the caveat that freedom comes at the cost of interesting things occuring. If you dislike one of these, or both, I would recommend not buying this.)

If you want a game that does the concept of a post-apocalypse with brutal realism that has multiple choices and an actual narrative, I recommend Age of Decadence whole-heartedly. Kenshi is made for a specific niche of people, and if you don't want to waste hours of your life for extremely pitiful gains in a videogame, don't bother.",1685488535,1685488535,False,47,5,0.645158708095550537,0,True,False,False

obligatory comparison to Dark Souls, but honestly more difficult and engaging due to the lack of direct control on characters when they fight ( meaning you can't beat the entire game on lvl 1 just because you know how to play) and there being no sort of hand-holding from the game in the form of ""you're the chosen one, therefore you have some crazy ass skills and powers""..

honestly a 9\10 game, only downsides are some small annoying things like a sniper character who has 182m range on his crossbow wasting ammo on enemies who are behind objects\geography, gates to your base having to be used manually and no way to make them automatic (unless im dumb and missed it), if there are too many people repairing a gate thats being damaged they will push out teammates through it right into the hands of the enemy raid without helping him and a bunch more small things like this... other than that it's an amazing game and Im thoroughly enjoying my first playthrough (first that didnt end with me in jail 10 minutes into the game)",1685209396,1685452486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fast forward a few years and I saw a play-through of this game and I was immediately interested again - I saw that you can escape slavery, explore ancient ruins for great equipment, and the worldbuilding seemed incredibly unique. 

So I booted up the game. There was no opening, just some buttons on a screen. Picked the UC start. There was a battle going on, so I decided to loot a corpse. I got attacked by guards and was immediately downed, picked up, and put down - then launched 500 feet in the air and outside of the city, left to bleed out. I decided to close the game, but in the menu there is an option to create a new game - likely a design decision knowing that dying (a game over) is commonplace. 

I started the Hub run. I quickly learned that saving often is a must. Mined rocks, bought some friends, looted things. We chose our battles carefully as we explored the wastes. Finding ourselves stronger through many battles (and save reloads) we tried our hand at bounty hunting. With lots of money, we got equipment and made a base near Squin and recruited some farmers from the Swamp. Tired of taxes, we went to the Cannibal Plains in search of freedom and ancient knowledge. Now having lots of wealth and experience, we decided to take over the fishman islands so that we can all live in peace. We decided to venture even more, going southeast to investigate rumors of incredible wealth and technology. 

Before I knew it, I had a 100 hours in the game. With a little patience and RP-ing, you can have alot of fun in this game. Afterwards, I played several runs with many different mods - hivers only with Genesis, holy nation with lots of animal mods, skeletons only with tons of different weapons, and more. Mods in this game are fairly limited due to engine limitations - I recommend researching and testing mods to eventually build up your mod list. 

In conclusion - this game is not for everyone - it's unfriendly and clunky. With some knowledge about the game and some patience: you will eventually find yourself immersed in the incredibly unique world with lots of room for RP-ing, complex decision making in equipment/combat/wealth, and a massive world for adventure augmented with tons of mods.",1685297132,1685297675,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

-It’s a vast open world, but there’s nothing in it.  No hidden bosses, locales, or loot.
-There’s some world building, but no plot or characters to care about.
-There’s level/skill progression, but it’s tedious and grinding.
-I also find the aesthetics ugly as sin.

The counterargument is that we need to “use our imagination” to make the game fun.  What a scam.  What are we paying money for then? They said the same thing about Sea Of Thieves, and I’m so tired of hearing this lame excuse.  Kenshi isn't the only offender.

You know what?  I’m going to start selling people empty shoe boxes and charge them $30 for an amazing game.  If people open the box and complain it’s empty, I will just tell them to use their imagination.  It’s their fault they paid for nothing.  

My imagination is free.  If I play one more video game which charges me money for a game with nothing in it, I’m going to stop paying for video games.  This is just getting absurd.

It's a squad-based game, but you can go solo. It's combat intensive, yet also sometimes similar to the sims. It's a business manager, it's a tower defense, it's stealth-based ninja infiltration, it's prison break, it's a prison manager. It's a game where you can sit back and play while you snack, or create a situation where your eyes are tethered to every pixel on the screen. It's a game where you start off not only as equal to those around you, but less than. 

This game will make you feel like a nobody, in order to make you feel like a god. This game will frustrate you, even when you've figured out how it works. It will humble you when you think you've made it. You'll anger the wrong people and find your overpowered clan suddenly overwhelmed. You will find yourself gathering your men to rescue one of your crew before they bleed out or are eaten by cannibals. You'll spend hours planning to break into an ancient ruin with invaluable treasure. You will do this all without being told, but because you discovered these things were there for the doing and the taking. And even when you're on the top of the world, you'll stand on your ramparts staring into the wilds, wondering what the world has next to throw your way.

An outpost is being established in Darkfinger; close enough to the Great Desert to send out raids against slave camps, but not so close that wandering patrols will be able to find it easily. However, due to the remote location, shipping in supplies is difficult. The decision was made to just bring a small amount of seed material to set up stone mining and processing on site. What this means in practical terms is that there are no defenses whatsoever, just a stone quarry, a single storm house filled with camp beds, and a basic lab bench that the chief (and only) scientist is using to try and figure out windmills.

All of a sudden - bad news. One of the workers spots a large group on the horizon. It's cannibals, at least fifty of them, headed straight for the outpost. The seasoned warriors are all busy robbing the bank in Heng, days of travel away. The malnourished former slaves won't be able to come out on top in a head-on conflict, so a new plan is formulated. Jakku, the fastest runner, is sent with the meager on-site funds to the relatively nearby Bastion, headquarters of the Cannibal Hunters, in order to hire as many soldiers as can be afforded. Unfortunately, there's no chance that the hunters will arrive in time to intercept the assault; those at the base will have to survive as long as they can in hopes that help will come before it's too late.

Simply running away won't work, the rescued slaves have yet to fully recover from their lack of food, and several are even missing a leg or two. Instead, they decide to hole up inside the storm house with their stocks of building material to reinforce the door and windows. As the cannibals are closing in on the outpost, the last of the workers hurries into the storm house, locking the door behind them.

Outside, a voice bellows; ""Meat for Canhead!"" The morale of the workers lowers even further. Mighty Canhead is a cannibal war leader so feared that the United Cities had placed a 20,000 cat bounty on his head - more than a peasant might see in their entire life. The workers are all hunkering down inside, trying to keep quiet. Maybe if they don't find anyone, the cannibals will just leave. However, this theory never gets tested. 

Voth had been working at a far-off iron node and hadn't heard the alarm going out. As he rounded a hill, loaded down with iron ore, the cannibals spot him. He quickly shrug off their backpack and start running, but Mighty Canhead, joined by several of his fellows, are gaining on him. He won't be able to outrun them. Thinking quickly, one the workers in the house yells out a plan: they'll open the door so that he can run in, and then they'll shut it behind him. The better-fed workers armed with rusty staves should be able to keep the doorway clear for long enough to keep all the cannibals out.

With the cleavers of cannibals on his heels, Voth sprints for the storm house, practically diving through the open doorway. Unfortunately for the workers, Mighty Canhead isn't a war leader for nothing - he easily pushes past the poorly-armed guards, and three more cannibals also force their way inside before the door is wrestled shut. Seeing combat as their only chance of survival, the workers attack the cannibals with all their might. Luckily, interior walls have yet to be installed, preventing their numerical advantage from being negated. As mighty as Mighty Canhead is, there’s only so much he can do against forty staff-armed Hivers, and he eventually goes down, head ringing from the impacts to his namesake can-style helmet.

While the situation is still dire - the rest of the cannibals are still trying to beat down the door, and Mu, one of the farmers, is still out cold after taking a nasty blow to the chest that caused a lot of blood loss- the mood is almost ecstatic. They, who had just days earlier been toiling away in slave camps, had taken down a cannibal war leader all on their own. 

The statemate between the cannibals’ stamina and the workers’ suppy of materials to reinforce the door ends several hours later as Jakku arrives with twenty heavily armed cannibal hunters. They make short work of the cannibal raid, and the crisis is resolved without a single casualty.

All of this happened within about twenty real-life minutes. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time; I had no idea how successful my mob of rescued hive workers would be. 10/10 game.

And Kenshi nails it. If you ever wanted to play a true sandbox survival RPG in a post-apocalyptic world. Kenshi is your best option.

The world in Kenshi just exists. The world does not care if you are there or not. You are not the star of the show, you are a weak pleb just somewhere in this gigantic unforgiving land full of danger. The lore is told by the environment and the inhabitants instead of being shoved into your face through linear quests. In fact its a world that has history that can be discovered or ignored and the true story of the game is created through your actions and decisions and encounters inside this world. If you need handholding and the game telling you what to do, you will not be happy with it. If not you will be the happiest.

This game is the ultimate ""become whatever you like to be"" game. You might be a weak pleb when you start and the road is long and full of hurdles to overcome. But when you have a goal and stick with it, you can get there. You want to focus on your character and become a master thief roaming the lands solo to survive? Why not? You want to build your own city? Sure, no problem (Just don't forget prayer day)... You want to be a slave trader, a relic hunter association, make your own drug cartell or even just kidnap people and replace their limbs with robotic ones for the fun of it? Its all possible but the way to your goal will be full of hardships and horrible incidents for your character(s) you can't really prepare for.

The combat is addicitve and always fun to watch because of the detailed health system and dire consequences it can have. The combat is semi-active, it is a real time simulated battle, decided by the individual character stats and equipment of the participants, while you can still move your character to get into better positions. Being struck down will only make you tougher (if you survive) and every fight will train you for the next one. That way you will slowly become a strong fighter.

The game might have its technical flaws but the whole experience of it makes up for it 1000x. It is a true ""one of a kind"" game and I highly recommend it if you are interested in sandbox rpgs and/or colony simulation.

The primary aspect that is touted anytime Kenshi is mentioned is freedom.
Freedom to trade, to kill, to explore, to build, to (ironically) become a slave, to escape from slavery... You can ""do anything"" and ""be anyone"" in this game. And in many regards, it is true.

You see, there are no inherent goals in Kenshi. it is a subjective notion.
The world is your oyster, but good luck stirring things up on your first playthrough.

Kenshi only starts revealing itself after you invest time in it, because what Kenshi is not is a casual experience that you can just load up, play, and extract some enjoyment out of. You will get bored at first. You will feel lost and wonder what to do. And to be quite honest, depending on what you like, you may still feel like that after hours of gameplay.

Because therein lies the issue with all pure sandbox games: you can distract yourself for a while, enjoying the systems of the game, up to a point. With no overarching goal to direct you, only the most avid fans who can fill the void with their imagination will truly enjoy Kenshi.

For now, I appreciate what Kenshi is about. I enjoy the exploration for the sake of exploration, I enjoy recruiting and training people, I enjoy meticulously building my base of operation and expanding it.
What I appreciate less is the micromanagement that is sometimes involved, the different non-gamebreaking but still annoying bugs that inevitably come with sandboxes, the lack of a feedback loop and of a gamification of exploration.

All in all, I have spent 48h in Kenshi's world so far, some good, some just... Grinding, a few bad. Am I enjoying it? Heck yeah! But I wish the game felt less like a blank canvas you can only paint with 2 colors. It relies too much on this ""freedom to do anything"", but even said freedom is restricted. It hides the game's lack of depth. Or maybe said depth is too well hidden? Who knows... Will update if I see anything.",1683973712,1683973729,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game presents on the surface a very clunky gameplay experience, on par with a lot of CRPGs, with a combat system that you don't have a lot of control over. It's physics-based attack system sounds interesting on the surface until you realize that it causes a lot of problems when it comes to guarding specific body parts. You can't control what limbs a character will defend on-the-fly, you can't target specific limbs on enemies either, effectively meaning that a lot of combat is dice rolling on of jank AI interactions. Fighting the same battle 5 times will result in 5 different outcomes, some drastically different.

Despite the base gameplay being so....atrocious, the outpost management and the exploration are very well handled. The world of Kenshi is vibrant and interesting, if ugly as sin to look at. That's not a dig on the graphics being far below average, that's a dig on the game's art direction being atrocious.

The problem is this: it's a niche game full of bad choices, a horrible GUI, numerous eternal bugs, and a command structure that will leave you wondering if the developer was allowed to interact with other people growing up. Fortunately, the community is very supportive. Whatever the issue is, it seems there is always someone on duty to provide an excuse, or else a convoluted answer that someone else will disagree with... usually with yet another excuse or convoluted answer. Steam Charts tells the story of a game a good number of people purchased, but also of a game no one is really playing.

But even when things go wrong you can crawl (literally) your way out of it. The skill based sksytem works really well and everytime you do something, like fight, you can see your stats go up more and more. With each fight you get in your squad will get stronger.

There's no tutorial, you need to learn on your own to understand the mechanics of the game, or read somewhere else deep within the internet. The graphics is unpleasant for 2023, but you still need a decent PC to run it. The main advantage of this game is very non-linear, you can be whatever you want, be a thief, wandering traveler, slave trader, etc., and you can go solo, couple, or full 30-mens at the same time.

The only caveats I want to mention:

- Though the graphics are a bit dated, you still need a decent system to run it.  I suspect that this is due to the engine they used when they developed it, which had some issues and I believe they said they are using UE for Kenshi 2 to avoid similar issues.  So, on my relatively old laptop (w/ dedicated graphics card), The Forest runs fine if you lower the quality a bit, but this game has difficulties at its lowest settings, which by itself lowers the play quality as you need to be able to see enemies from a distance to react accordingly.  Thus, I play on my desktop with a good (if slightly dated) graphics card.  

- It's buggy, same reason.  If walls are angled wrong/weird, enemies will get in, so check them after you build, and account for errors.  Save often, and maybe keep a rotation of 10-20 recent saves.  But be forewarned that these saves are much bigger than for most games, so don't save-spam unless you have lots of room.  

- Read a guide.  This game has so many nuances that you might end up ragequitting if you don't avoid some pitfalls, and there are many, but they're the spice that makes it so great, which leads me to:

- You will get your ass kicked.  Lots.  Sometimes irreparably.  Don't be afraid to load a save to protect your hours of progress, or just be prepared to spend some time adjusting your strategy to account for the permanent changes.  Loss is part of life, but it's okay to be a perfectionist too.",1683418799,1683418799,True,2,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

The game is a sandbox. There is no main quest or side quests there is just you and the world that you can interact with.

The game allows you to do quite a few things. Would you like to become the greatest swordsman in the land that can take on entire armies? Or maybe you would like to create a giant army and destroy some of the world factions. Or maybe you would merely like to create a small city where you craft items and farm food to sell to travellers. All of those things are possible. Of course the first few times, your story will be more close to spawning in a city, gatting ganged by hungry bandits and then captured by slave traders.

In some games that might sound like game over but in Kenshi being enslaved is a free trip to train your lockpicking, stealth and assassination skills. Unlike you the guards cannot leave. Free other slaves arm them with stolen weapons and destroy the slave camp. Become the greatest freedom fighter and destroy the empire. Or you know, capture the escaped slaves and sell them back to slavery and use the funds to buy slaves and have them mine for you. Join the empire and became its greatest ally.

Kenshi allows you to do quite a few things.

The actual game itself plays similar to many older RPGs where you control one or multiple characters. The characters can focus on the individual tasks and with task assignment you can create entire supply chains in which your characters will farm or mine resources carry them to storage boxes from wich other characters will take them for crafting of anything you might need. All while different group of characters plunder the ancient sites for research materials, which you will need to unlock better stuff.

Sadly the game runs on an ancient engine that is being push to its limit. This will lead to a few problems mostly with performances and some crashes especially if you add mods to the mix (the game supports Steam Workshop). The game can be quite atmospheric at the right time with the right camera angle but overall the graphics are quite ""dated"".

Its not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend it to some people. Despite the difficulties Kenshi is one of the most unique and fun games i've ever played. The moments in Kenshi are truly unique and something few games can accomplish. The game is grindy and you do have to put in the hours and effort to see your characters and base progress. The graphics are not the best but the art style and world is truly unique and immersive. The cities and scenery are amazing and really immerse you in this dystopian old world. The RPG elements are simple and easy to learn but it does require you to fail and die to learn this which can be frustrating to some players. The base building mechanics are clunky but fun once you get used to it. 

Kenshi may not be the easiest game to learn or play, but it offers a unique and immersive experience that is hard to find in other games. Despite its flaws, Kenshi's art style and world-building are impressive, and the RPG and base-building elements add depth and replayability. Sure, the game requires a considerable amount of time and effort, but the moments of triumph and discovery make it all worth it. If you're looking for a game that challenges your survival skills, your strategic thinking, and your patience, then Kenshi is definitely worth checking out. It may not be for everyone, but for those who are willing to dive into its world, Kenshi can be a rewarding and unforgettable experience.

Im saying this game feels empty once you have overpowered characters and gear. There are some pretty powerful enemies but even then all they do is give you a weapon thats like 30% better and a bunch of money which is already easy to get. I think the game tries to be as hard as possible but it manages to some how be easy. I am hoping kenshin 2 is the same game but much much harder. I mean in this game you can literally sneak into the skin hunters HQ kidnap the leader and make 80k credits and a weapon in less then 30 minutes from your spawn. That feels way to easy in my opinion. The base building is fun and I see why people can put thousands of hours into this game. But for me I probably will not be putting in any more. Though I have yet to try mods, which I will, this game is a 7/10 for me. The grind is fun and satisfying. Theres a lot to do. Its harsh sometimes and other times it makes me laugh how easy it was. Overall my favorite playstyle is just one character and go around assassinating leaders. I think this game has a lot of potential and this game is honestly amazing. I can see the idea that the goal is to try and eat and survive but im going to be honest surviving isnt that hard. Once your base is made there isnt much to do. I really hope kenshi 2 will expand on everything and get rid of most cheeses and give you more reasons to get powerful. But even if kenshi 2 is the same game with just more content and better graphics, i'll still be purchasing it. I really do love this game and I want to give it a 10/10 but it really is repetitive.

I have had countless adventures and failures, trying different play styles each time. Once i was Trades Chadly who owned a massive brewing and trading guild, providing for every faction I could reach all the while fighting off cannibals left and right. In another Warboss Rock Cracka and his 'Ardy boyz went across the land pillaging and maiming before a horde of beak things left us as a pile of bones and torn flesh. And each of these runs were fun. I think this is mostly because the world. The world is, and more importantly, FEELS big. Living and traversing areas like the Border Zone feels miles different from living in The Pits, or Shem, or The Swamp. Along with these lands are a large amount of factions that act and feel very different. From major government bodies, to bandit gangs, thieve guilds, and CRAB RAIDERS. Even if you've seen it all, from traversing every land, to beating and wiping out every faction in the game, you have a massive modding scene that adds so much content I have barley dived into it yet.

This game is also broken as all hell and held together with gum, duct tape, and a dream. If it doesn't crash, it might just lag to near non-functionality, or something like characters glitching into terrain, or their pathing all together might break. You need to be a very patient person or download counter measures for these. I've personally played worse but that worse are games made in hyper crunch and Postal 2. Some features in the game also really need mods to not feel at best bare bones. Building is very jank and feels like i have to build a whole mile away from a wall if I want to place down a building. Also a 5% incline can mean building there is not allowed. Playing for the first few times without mods felt fine but now looking back I'm just left wondering why this stuff isn't in the base game.

The game has the potential to be very fun, but needs a lot more time in development to be worth its price imo. The amount of game-breaking bugs makes the game very difficult to enjoy for me, and the gameplay itself is not extremely conducive to all playstyles.

For example, if you want to become a shopkeeper/tradesman, you have an extremely limited list of items you can actually consistently sell from your base (you can't be a blacksmith, armorsmith, or mechanic, you must sell common trade goods like food, drink, and medicine). If you want to be a martial artist, you must train with things like heavy weapons and intentionally lose fights over and over, there's no easy way to train it that is conducive to roleplay. There are plenty of other examples, but these are just a couple that I've seen so far.

Overall, the game has great potential conceptually, but until the most prevalent bugs have been fixed and the rpg and trading features are reworked, I wouldn't recommend buying the game unless it is on sale.",1682979085,1682979403,False,2,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

I recommend the idea, but not the delivery.

Kenshi is unlike anything I've ever played. The variety of possible experiences and playstyles is vast and the world map is varied and heavily populated without feeling crowded or claustrophobic. Progressing through the game is a slow but generally satisfying process, and easy access to mods with workshop integration can help tweak the experience as you prefer (as well as adding lots of content if you want to change more than just the lategame pacing or the balance). Starting your own town and never seeing 90% of the map or living an entirely nomadic existence are both viable and have their fun moments. I have pretty much nothing but good things to say about the ""ideas"" end of this game. Pretty much everything that was done intentionally as a feature by the devs, I enjoy.

That said, this game has issues. The controls are just a nightmare after the first hour. Inventory management is more tedious than organizing in real life. There's no way to mass sort your inventory, every single thing has to be moved individually. I'll give an example from the save I'm playing on now- I have an outpost reasonably close to the nearest town and have an excess of copper, so I decide to load up my pack animal and make a quick trade run. 

Here's how this should go- I bring my pack animal (garru) next to my copper storage, bring my character next to both the garru and the storage, open their inventories, type in how much copper I want to transfer (or click and drag to select multiple items at once, or hit one button to fill inventory to max, or shift click or something to transfer like 10 at a time, or anything else you could think of and incredibly easily implement to make this process less of a chore that leaches all enjoyment and entertainment from the experience). 2-4 clicks and I'm good to go, then run to town, hit one button to transfer as much copper as I can carry from my garru to my character, talk to the merchant and sell it, then refill my inventory with one button click as many times as needed until I've sold it all.

Here's how it actually goes- I bring my garru and character next to the copper storage. I open the storage, then click the stack of copper literally 40 times to fill my inventory. I close the copper storage and open my garru's backpack, then mouse through my inventory and click each individual piece of copper separately because they don't stack in my inventory and there is no way of transferring more than one item at a time. Go back to the copper storage and click 40 more times to fill up my pack again. Back to the garru, click each and every pixel of my inventory to transfer the copper. That's 164 clicks where it could have been 3 and I'm ready to go. Run to town, open the garru backpack, click 40 more times, go inside, 40 more clicks to sell my inventory, back to the garru, 40, shopkeeper, 40. Nearly 350 clicks to do what could have been done in 10 with half decent controls.

The pathfinding is just downright terrible. On that trade run into town, my characters have to cross a valley. If I send a character to town on their own while I watch over the rest of my base, they will run to the same cliff, realize it's too steep to walk down, turn back towards the road to take the ""long way"" (which is actually the only way, the pathfinding AI just thinks it's faster to walk down a vertical rock face at a 90 degree angle, which is technically true I guess but also not possible), then halfway there forget that the cliff was a no go, turn around and try to go down the cliff again. They will do this for days on end if I don't interfere and force path them down the road, or babysit the one character their entire trip while ignoring a dozen others back at base who are actually doing things. At one point there was an invisible wall right in front of my storage room that characters would spend hours trapped on that I eventually found out appeared when I put down a barrel at least 15 feet away. When building around rough terrain (which you will probably do a lot) your characters will sometimes trap themselves requiring you to take apart your brand new building to free them, but usually they can't actually path to the point where they need to get in order to demolish the building from their trapped position, so you have to commit another character to fixing a problem that should have never existed in the first place, not to mention the lost resources.

There's little bugs too, the interior of buildings won't load sometimes until you open the build menu and go to place something down in there. Characters will arbitrarily decide they are going to stop eating from the food storage like they are supposed to do automatically, so you will just be scrolling through your tasks to see if anyone is idle and realize one of your miners is starving to death while you watch the person right next to them go get food no problem. I've placed furniture too close to the interior walls of the building it was supposed to go in, which resulted in the blueprint for the build permanently taking up space inside because it won't show the build icon for me to order someone to finish the construction, but I also can't click on it to cancel it. My favorite was when I had just finished bandaging up from a fight against a ton of dust bandits, then got raided by a dozen ninjas whose worst fighter was twice as strong as my best while the holy nation showed up for prayer day. ""Thank god!"" I thought, thinking the paladins with the holy nation who were much stronger than the ninjas and had come here on my behalf would help defend our settlement. Imagine my frustration when they just stood there in the middle of the carnage, literally bumping shoulders with combatants on both sides while doing nothing but telling us how missing prayer is sacrilege. We're in a losing fight for our lives and they're scolding us for not stopping defending ourselves to talk to them, while they're more than capable of resolving this in no time. Now dear readers who are somehow still reading, imagine my frustration when I pull someone from the fight to talk to them so they don't get angry and eventually turn hostile, just to get caught in a bug where my only dialog option is ""1. [...]"", I cannot exit this dialog window no matter what I try, and every time I select my only option their idle dialog progresses one more line until they hit the ""alright since you won't talk to us we're gonna go tattle"" point, when they refuse to talk to you and run off to go tell their town full of dozens of those guys who are way stronger than the ninjas who were absolutely demolishing us about how terrible we are.",1623869259,1682892850,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is unlike any other and quite unforgiving early on. You need a lot of patience to figure out what to actually do, other than getting pummeled by everyone and everything, starving, being sold into slavery or similar assorted past-times. You start at the bottom of the food chain, sometimes literally.

If you can muster the patience to get past the initial frustrations, you are rewarded with an incredibly deep and dynamic world and endless character building opportunities supported by a large mix of game mechanics. As you discover all this, you will often come to a point where you think you know the game, because surely it can't offer even more than that, just for it to keep surprising you.

I strongly advise against reading any spoilers beyond maybe a shallow getting started guide or looking into very specific things you already know and want to learn more about. Exploring the vast opportunities Kenshi offers is a very rewarding experience.

There are some great mods out there, which address some of the Kenshi's shortcomings, e.g. the UI. Also some which add a lot to the game without spoiling the lore. You will want a handful of them, but there's no reason to go overboard.",1636833480,1682689371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kenshi, developed by Lo-Fi Games, is an open-world, sandbox role-playing game that stole my heart and consumed countless hours of my life. Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland teeming with danger, Kenshi offers a unique blend of survival, strategy, and role-playing elements that make it both challenging and addictive.

At first glance, the game's unforgiving nature can be off-putting. Permadeath, brutal enemies, and a steep learning curve are just a few obstacles players face in Kenshi. However, these very elements are what make the game so enthralling.

In Kenshi, you start with nothing. Your character is weak, ill-equipped, and the world is out to get you. Survival is not guaranteed, and every decision matters. This raw and visceral sense of danger creates a level of immersion that few games can match. You're not just playing a game; you're living the struggle of your character, making each victory and setback intensely personal.

Kenshi's open-ended nature allows players to forge their own paths. There is no linear storyline to follow, which means you can choose your own goals and playstyle. You can be a lone wanderer, a bandit, a trader, or even build your own city. The possibilities are endless, and this freedom is intoxicating. The world feels alive, with dynamic factions, economies, and ecosystems that react to your actions.

The game's complex mechanics and deep systems also contribute to its addictive nature. The research and crafting systems enable players to build their technology and gear from scratch, while the squad-based combat and training mechanics make each character feel unique and valuable. The world of Kenshi is unforgiving, but as you learn its intricacies and develop your skills, the sense of accomplishment is unparalleled.

Graphically, Kenshi may not be the most stunning game, but its art style perfectly complements the desolate and harsh world. The game's soundtrack, composed by Kole Audio Solutions, is hauntingly beautiful, and it sets the tone for your journey through this unforgiving landscape.

Kenshi's modding community deserves a special mention as well. Countless mods expand upon the base game, offering new content and customization options that breathe even more life into the world of Kenshi. The game's replayability is further enhanced by these mods, which cater to a wide variety of playstyles and preferences.

In conclusion, Kenshi is a game that is both brutal and beautiful in its own way. The unforgiving world, deep mechanics, and open-ended nature make it an addictive experience that is difficult to put down. This game is a love letter to those who crave challenge and freedom in their gaming experiences, and it has undoubtedly left a lasting impression on my heart.",1682612174,1682612174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My characters have been beaten to a pulp, robbed and left on a side of the road bleeding out, captured, sold into slavery... but then I got the hang of it and finally I learned to survive and in the end my team became a force to be recon with.

I dispatched bands of bandits, created a flourishing village, erased states from the world... no game made me feel such sense of accomplishment before. If you decide to give Kenshi a try, do it with a different approach from the usual RpG: in this game you are not a hero or the choosen one; you are merely a desperate nobody trying to get by in this harsh environment just like anyone else, and no one cares about you.

While I do recommend this game because it's a technically impressive game that evolves from an RPG into more of a management/RTS game, it's got some pretty big flaws (or ""features,"" depending on who you ask) that would prevent me from, say, buying this game as a gift for a friend.

As far as what the game does right, you've got a surprisingly unique and interesting world that you are drip-fed lore about through character interactions, text boxes for items, books... and there's a lot of places to visit, lots of people to meet and things to acquire, all of which adds more pieces to the puzzle for you to work with. The races are varied but balanced and they have their own interesting lore that offers a break from the usual Tolkien lineup. The combat system is a thing of beauty, too, and I'm sure there's any number of YouTubers who could do a better job of explaining the bits and pieces. What I can explain, though, is there's plenty of gear to buy, steal, scavenge, craft, and train for. It scratches a very specific itch I have bordering on the 'tism that I can scarcely describe.

Unfortunately, this game really does feel like it's unfinished. Literally, there is no finish line. Even after you kill all the faction leaders and explore every inch of the continent, there's no ""end state"". Perhaps that's a feature, what with the game being a sandbox and all, but having a few rails, a few carrots on the stick, a few things to give *context,* would help. Most of my playthroughs involve getting a nice big colony or two going along and having a decent-sized number of people with masterwork gear and decent skills and it's like... well, the only thing left to really do now is kill faction leaders. Only, it's not that simple. 

The grind is *insane* in this game. You might say ""Duh, it's an RPG"" but it'll take you at least an IRL week of micro-management to train up a recruit to be on-par with some of the more mid-tier NPCs like manhunters, let alone Samurai or Paladins. And these guys come at you in packs ranging from 8 to 15 folks strong. Even if you manage to wipe out a whole squad, you've done nothing to impede the Computer. It's lost no progress, no resources, no time. Inversely, getting even one of your own guys killed is a massive loss in time spent grinding.

And the early-game is an absolute nightmare regardless of which starting scenario you pick. You're too weak to defend yourself from a single starving bandit, let alone a whole squad of them. You're gonna spend an IRL afternoon mining and selling copper so you can eat and save up enough money to join the Shinobi Thieves and use their training dummies. Then you're gonna spend your evening in sneak mode walking across town until you've got at least like 50 Stealth so you can Naruto run around the desert and practice your Assassination skill, rinse and repeat until you can knock out Bounty Hunters and Samurai to sell their swords. That's the early game. That's how you do it. Every. Single. Time. 

So, yeah. It's a great game. Amazing, even. But it's got problems. Problems that I wish the developers addressed instead of making a sequel so soon.",1682376312,1682376312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
