My biggest concern is how the camera angles are so bad when I'm near a terrain or a building. Even if I press the ""lock on"" key I still can't see the enemy. Sure, I can still continue the combo without seeing my character but it sucks when I'm up against enemies on their ""burst mode"" (ex. crocodile, blackbeard, ace) as they keep interrupting combos and I can't see anything other than walls covering the screen and my HP depleting.

And what is up with the delay in announcing that I beat an enemy? They're dead but the dialogue has to continue? Like I beat Kaido but he still talking and not dropping food or sword or shield until it's done? The mission ended a minute ago but I have to wait until Kaido (and his spirit?) ends his dialogue while I watch Luffy idling or running and all the minions crying? Tf

I tried getting used to it but it's hella annoying in the New World log. If not for the remaining 3 achievements (technically 2) I would have dipped this game.",1708948524,1708948524,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the gameplay is incredible! Each character has these amazing moves that make battles so intense. And the graphics? They're absolutely stunning, making me feel like I'm truly immersed in the world of One Piece!

What I love most about this game is how faithfully it adapts the story from the manga and anime. Every character and iconic moment from One Piece is here, and I love being able to relive their adventures.

Oh, and let's not forget about the content! There's a story mode that's so much fun to play through, plus side missions that keep you coming back for more. So, whether you're a die-hard One Piece fan or just looking to give it a try, I highly recommend checking out this game.

This one is just the same as the others but I do like the additions it adds. Next to this, you can set specials/skills to each character giving a ton of variety to builds. However, it does have a ton of characters but most are utter trash sadly. It's usually the Power characters that you'll be playing the most if you want to tackle the tougher missions. Also most of the DLC characters break this game. Like a LOT. They are crazy powerful. (Recent one being Film RED Shanks is crazy OP).

Play this if your a fan of the series. If you have an interest in the series, don't. Read the manga and then jump in if you're interested. The story jumps right in the middle of a story arc a hundred chapters in the story. And it skips a TON and glosses over a ton of little details. Granted I'm not surprised since it's the overall story is so long but don't come in thinking it'll tell you everything.

Yes, the combat system improved alot in my opinion...but the devs cut out characters that were already fleshed out and just needed a tweak to fit the new system but they decided to charge for character dlc packs with the worst release schedule i've seen in a long time. This game lacks replayability and endgame content. That's why i'm not paying for dlcs where i get to play as weird characters that i never wanted to play with anyway, and that a year after the game has already died. The design and accesability of the ""online mode"" is one of the most attrocious things i've ever seen.

It could have been the best OP PW game with ease but the devs and or publisher decided to milk the sh.. out of us instead.",1604850138,1703886589,False,51,3,0.679164767265319824,0,True,False,False

I might have to go through settings to troubleshoot the controls, because using an external keyboard with my deck seems to make whatever character I'm playing as run in whatever direction they're facing for no obvious reason, making it impossible to navigate stages properly. I enjoy the graphics, but sometimes the cutscenes won't load until part way through them, showing a TV off-air type screen until it loads, even as the subtitles show up. The combat is fluid and performs well, and the steam deck controls handle well.

This isn't wildly different from the handful of other musou games I've played so far, but the characters and attacks feel different enough from each other to keep things interesting. It is definitely worth getting, though I'd personally wait for a sale.

If you're here, you're probably also a One Piece fan, and if that's the case you know enough to fill in the little gaps in the story, so you'll enjoy this-- that said if you haven't read/watched it, I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to the narrative. This game does the best it can at condensing entire arcs to a few levels, but it inevitably has to cut parts for time. Some plot points are left as 1-2 sentence summaries, which is fine for someone who understands what's going on before but could be confusing to someone who's completely new. For example one of the more emotional parts of Water 7 (arc, not saga for existing fans, it's the duel and what leads up to it) definitely doesn't have the gravity it does in the full story. Considering it would take more than three weeks straight to watch the anime, it's not really possible for a game to go into that much depth, especially at the steal of the price it costs on sale!",1703263606,1703263606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positives

1. This game is frequently on sale for dirt cheap. If you want to try this game, for the love of god wait for a sale. It is almost always less than $10 dollars for the basic edition, which more than justifies it's asking price. 

2. The cast of playable characters is extremely varied and well put together. A lot of musou games cut corners by having lots of clone characters or a shared weapon system for the cast. While there are a handful of sort-of-clones here, the overwhelming majority of characters all have unique basic and special attacks that often make them play completely differently from anyone else. While this does result in the roster being very unbalanced, with some characters being absurdly more powerful than others, almost all the characters are at least interesting to play.

3. The game scales well for a variety of machines. This developer is notorious for poor optimization on PC, but I was able to get satisfactory performance and visuals on both desktop and the ROG Ally with everything still looking great. I had a little initial trouble getting my xbox controller to work, but this was easily sorted in the steam settings. Overall this game looks great and runs at 60 fps even on middle of the road machines. 

4. The combat is flashy and impactful. The basic musou weak-strong attack combo system has been further expanded to include air combos and a customizable palette of special moves that can all be linked together fluidly. As an added bonus, environmental destruction is a prominent feature here, with entire buildings crumbling to rubble form your errant attacks. These features all ramp up the power fantasy aspect of these games to new levels, making you feel like an unstoppable juggernaut who can reduce entire cities to dust. 

Negatives

1. The story presentation is atrocious. Of course this was going to be a cliff notes summary of the One Piece saga at best, I expected that, but what really surprised me was how slapped together the story segments actually feel. Still images, pre-rendered scenes, and footage that seems to be lifted straight from previous games are often mashed together in overly lengthy lore-dump sequence. It just feels like a lot of corners were cut here, and the most laughable example was the refusal to give Iceburg an in-game character model for the Water 7 sequences. All of his dialogue just comes from somewhere off-screen while the characters stand around staring at nothing. It's bizarre and unintentionally hilarious at the same time. Also, once again, there is no English voice acting in this game. For most Japanese games this isn't a problem, but it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue for half a dozen characters quickly barking orders at you in the middle of combat.

2. Named characters are very annoying to fight. By default all enemy officers have a super-armor meter you have to first deplete in order for them to stagger and take increased damage. The problem is that as soon as you do this, without fail, most named characters will activate their full-burst ability, buffing their attack and allowing them to repeatedly ragdoll your character. A few of the characters, such as Crocodile and Kizaru, are also invincible while in this state and will force you to deplete their super-armor a second time to stop it, all while they constantly blast you away with massive AOE attacks. The game overall isn't particularly difficult, but for me the fun fell off a cliff every time I had to deal with one of these assholes. 

3. Progression is pretty mediocre. You don't gain experience or level up in this game, but instead have to spend collectible coins and money to purchase raw stat boosts and abilities for each character. This system was fine overall, but I was a bit disappointed that the power ceiling felt relatively low for a Musou game. Once you're 10 hours in or so it doesn't take much effort to max out a character, and once you've filled out their ability map that's pretty much it. A dlc was recently rolled out that introduced a new progression system where you collect and spend souls for infinitesimally small stat boosts, but the currency for this is an extremely rare drop unless you own a particular dlc pack that lets you earn them more easily. Considering that a lot of other Musou games let you become ridiculously overpowered with levels in the hundreds, late game progression here just felt tame and underwhelming in comparison. 

Overall, pretty cool game, get it on sale if you are a musou or One Piece fan.",1702524144,1702524144,True,12,0,0.659266948699951172,0,True,False,False

to made thing short I don`t recommend this game.

don't got me wrong One Piece Pirate Warriors 4(OPP4) are a nice dynasty game, not just the combat are fun and developer spent really tons of effect to made this game, I would explain it one by one.

the first are the whole game are made by a template, every piece of the game from the combat or the unlock system to the Boss battle, every stage you beating a group of the enemy then maybe beating more captain or character to pass the level, after some of this levels, then maybe you gotta face a Boss level that spend a lots that I meaning ""a lots of times to grind down Boss"", most of the Boss not strong but with a huge defensive point before you could deal damage to him and recover back it rapid which made this game super grinding, the final are the puzzle levels, they are terrible to played with and non-fun at all to play with.

[h1] The plot[/h1]

 ""wtf are those people and wtf are they doing""

the main thing I not recommend for new player are the plot from comic, if you new and didn't watch comic then this game would be a nightmare for you to experience with, like I mention it before the combat would confuse you a lot, there not much room for new player who not in ""otaku zone"",  the combat won't light them fire up, while a key character gone away from group they won' tear out but only feeling confused, that basically how I not recommend for new players, if you wish to immersive then maybe you should grab some comic or watched some episode of anime of OPP.

[h1] detail things[/h1]
so let's go for more detail part about this game, personal really like the CP9 and how the sound effect while being attack, it really feeling like hit the steel and sound effect are smooth.

the company of your ally still didn't known how much damage or effect did them did just like dynasty game before, the combat only need to increase your attack to slam thought the creep or enemy heroes, it simple but then developer adding too many things, like the switch or the trigger trap everywhere in map, force you walk around to all place concern of whole map which really terrible and super grinding to experience.

as I say about the plot of the game I commend the developer, you could easy understand for all part from the comic, we don't need too went thought all detail from the comic, all you need is new enemy art style and type and Boss, most of the story went thought by dialog, some Boss still count you lose when winning which kind of lame but that how the comic plot went thought.


however the indicated of the objection from the game are the worst part for this entire game, you fall into a maze that your gonna suck at known no where to next enemy or location or wreck thing that game ask you to take, about half of times you are running around to found next object, this circumstance getting even worse when the map have multiple floods in match.


the final are that pay DLC, omg don't buy any of them, end of state.",1701276553,1701778701,False,8,1,0.494343549013137817,6,True,False,False

This one has a lot of stories, good animations, a lot of cool skills from characters and a lot of playable characters. 
They even still updated the game until now with DLC (New characters, new stories and new quests)(optional to buy).
Single player game are so good because you can play and stop whenever you want to without having to begging your friend to come online or buy the game to play with you.
I bought the DLC just to get a new experience from the game. Even though its expensive but if im happy with what i bought, thats enough. 
I even took a lot of screenshots just because i love the animations, characters and stories.

Game play - very repetitive. The skill leveling is slow. At mid game will you only have The luffy in OPPW3. Final part is more like dragon ball.

The enemies are pretty much the same throughout. You will find yourself fighting the same enemies and bosses again and again,

The missions that changes mid game are quite predictable. The map is slightly confusing, you will at first miss out the small paths that leads to the mission though you will get use to it after a couple of chapters.

Worth it? Nah.. not really. Not at full price. Maybe something around 75% discount off then you can try.

At its root it's still a Warriors title, which means you can have mindless fun bashing millions of enemies around, and in this series do it as popular one piece characters.

That said, the game suffers from what feels like rushed dev time. There's not a lot of polish and there IS a lot of DLC. There are fewer playable characters, fewer costumes, the maps feel less varied, everything feels like a step down from OPPW3 and considering this game's price and the amount of DLC you're better off going back and just playing 3 instead.

Most annoying, is that the story campaign is both not canon(because it came out before the end of the Wano arc of the manga), you also cannot do it completely co-op until you've beaten the campaign once.",1700416947,1700417011,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters are fun to play, though I wish there were more of them. It is a little bit of a grind to fill out the skill trees, but if you like Warriors games that`s not really an issue.  There`s no blocking in this game but you learn to adjust, the combat pacing is quick and fun.

My only major complaint is making Sanji incapable of hitting female characters. I understand it`s part of his character, but when there are female characters on a lot of maps, it makes playing him a chore. Sure, you can hit them indirectly with specials, but when there are other fun characters to play, this handicap just makes him a passed over, unused character.",1696107423,1696107423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It might take a little while to get used to the new, fast and unapologetic (sometimes confusing) gameplay if you're immediately coming after playing Pirate Warriors 3, but once you do, you'll really appreciate the changes.
What I like about this, is that it adds a different twist to the almost perfect Pirate Warriors 3 formula, so both 3 and 4 are highly valued for different things.

If I had to put it simply, I would rank them like this:

- Warriors 3: Slower gameplay and flashy team moves. 

- Warriors 4: Improved graphics, faster gameplay, no special team moves but more exciting, breakable buildings and bigger scale (giant enemies).

All in all, this is an excellent game, maybe the best One Piece game so far.

A slow burn at the beginning, but after the story play through is complete, the game opens up with multiple tiers of difficulty, huge level capacity, a massive roster, and some significant increases to functional replay-ability. The transition away from Dynasty's weapon system to the abilities that exist in the progression of the show is a nice switch, especially paired with the in game maps for skill and level progression.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Easy to Learn, Hard to Master.
- Music is consistent with the themes, works well.
- Game play is smooth, and consistently fun.
- Character range is massive, extremely diverse cast of skills and play styles
- Giant characters are ridiculous to play as, and fun to fight

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Online matchmaking is poorly implemented
- No ability to check status unless you start a match
- Very little guidance on unlocking skills for later characters.

[h1]Overall:[/h1]
Its the best parts of dynasty warriors packaged in the absolutely insane world of One Piece. It's fun, easy to pickup, and enjoyable to play. Get it on Sale.

This game has a lot going for it, but just as much working against it. I haven't played it a lot on Steam, but have Platinumed them all on Playstation.

Pros: Nice graphics, destructible environments, decent roster, great new additions to the roster, jumping (?), Nami., great core gameplay as always, online is pretty fun, Gear 4th

Cons: Lack of costumes, a LOT of cut story content/maps, plenty of classic characters cut from the roster this time around.

This game tries to do a lot of new things with the Warriors formula - and I can appreciate the vision, but the execution is rather lacking. The jumping and addition of ""sky"" combat seems great, until you realize that it interferes with a lot of character's movesets and I cannot stress enough that not all air combos were created equal. Unless you're playing a Sky type or Luffy, you're shit outta luck. I'm not a fan of the added dash/stamina system either. The new skill select is okay, I can see why people may not like it as it does interfere with established movesets once again. Personally I'd go with PW3 for the definitive ""Pirate Warriors"" experience.

Still, if you're a fan of One Piece, pick it up on sale. It does have a lot of the newer characters and forms working for it over PW3, so if that's more your cup of tea then I'd say its worth it.",1695468325,1695468325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have big forces: army, rebels, Baraque Works, straw bois; this forces have ""heroes"", engage with objectives, like in DW3 for example you had to destroy some big magic pots that made enemy soldiers invisible, or windmills to let your forces past the winds. Here you have to secure cannons for support, prevent square from exploding, lure out Crocodile to save your crew from imprisonment.

Out of all franchises that have been poot on warriors genre, i feel like One Piece hits the spot most precisely.

This works great as a companion piece after playing 3, which starts at Romance Dawn and ends in Dressrosa with a great list of best-of moments of the series, and representation for plenty of weaker ones too.

Meanwhile, PW4 compounded everything down to only 2 arcs pre-timeskip (Alabasta and Enies Lobby) and threw out the rest, cutting down the cast significantly. In return, they focus more on the contemporary-at-the-time Whole Cake and Wano arcs, but these haven't held up as well and suffer from a lot of ""new at the time, stale after a year"" appeal characters, like all 7 members of Germa 66 being playable with unique mechanics, to a point of selling them as preorder incentive!

The new mechanics aren't good, either. PW3 is probably the best Musou I know specifically BECAUSE it doesn't have any jump or block mechanics, forcing frantic dodges and weaves to stay alive, as well as health pickups to put pressure on. While they kept dodging as necessary and still kept blocking out, they've re-integrated jumping with both attack cancels and air combos, as well as new ""Sky"" type characters who perpetually stay in the air. It's a flashy mechanic but works miserably against a lot of units who are designed to exist on the ground to begin with.

The new armor system for enemies is fitting for One Piece; notable enemies just ignore attacks and take things on the chin, and it means you have to respect their animations more, but the real crime is level scaling between stages. A 1 level difference between your upgrades and the stage easily means it's a no-sell for you and you'll suffer time penalties just to get rid of one unit that isn't trying especially hard to stop you. It's designed to only be played in order, which would be fine if there was linear branches that made it obvious, but this game has very little in way of content.

Besides the scene-recreation Story Log, your other free play mode is Treasure Log. In PW3, you'd have a map of islands with random assignments to clear to find boss characters to unlock with special maps. In this, it's a similar function, worse UI, putting everything in a numbered list sorted by level. There's maybe 1/4 of the amount of stages to play in this one.

Combined with how many characters were removed due to the changes to combo systems and gameplay mechanics, it's unsurprising many weren't happy with PW4.

I still recommend it because it's good slop and I love my slop, but I'll *STRONGLY* recommend checking out the graphically inferior Pirate Warriors 3 first. It has the spirit, the story, and the gameplay. Just mod the visuals to be on par with the PS4 version and you'll have the best musou possible.

 It goes on sale really often
 The graphics are really good. 
They change a bit of the dialogue and cut some of the story
Wano is different from the anime but gear 5 is in a dlc
The sound is really good
Its a really fun game to just play around and have fun in.

This game is the type where you have to fight hordes of weak enemies paired with a few strong ones and there are many mission goals/objectives which give you the win. 

The leveling up system/power system is really cool, all characters share a map where everyone gets upgrades but if you want to upgrade a character to there full potential and unlock more moves you can put points into a specific character map which only boosts that character.

In this game there are skills/special buffs where you can only have a select amount of them so its interesting to think of what you'll need for each character.

There are 4 character types( I think) Power, Runner/Flying, Defense and Technique. Each character type has different pros and cons. Power characters tend to do more damage and runners are really fast.

Transformations:
There are 3 transformations in the game for luffy.
Gears 2, 4 bounceman, 4 snakeman
Gear 2 is only available for pre timeskip because after that gear 2 moves are incorporated into normal fighting.

Gear 3 is only an attack but there are many gear 3 attacks. These attacks do more damage but they take a long time to charge up. Pre timeskip luffy also shrinks after using this attack but this effect is removed after timeskip.

Bounce man and snake man both change Luffy's class to runner.

IMPORTANT:

Some really annoying things about this game are that they skip short or unimportant arcs.
but they do have cut scenes explaining the blanks.
They skip:
The whole east blue
Skypiea
Thriller bark
Fishman island
punk hazard
Zou

This game is still really really good
overall its a 7/10 game for a non one piece fan
but a 9/10 for any one piece fan",1694328724,1694328724,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's no other better game. It looks good, it plays good, the combat is surprising varied for how easy and for how many characters there are. There's enough progression that lasts long enough to give you something tangible to go for.

The biggest issue I have is the map design. It is so dumbfounding how they designed most of the maps. Most objectives don't have markers, you have to use your mini map. When you have hundreds of guys to fight, particle effects everywhere covering up a mini map that is already chalk full little icons it can be frustrating trying to figure out where to go. It doesn't show you different levels it just highlights what level your on. I don't need to see which level I'm on I need to find the stair case that takes me to that different level. Being such a fast paced game where their are literal thousands of enemies spawning every second you'd think they want you quickly go between objectives and keep up a combo streak. No they don't. That put objectives on complete opposite sides of maps they design it in such a way where you to go around everything to get to it. You can't jump over environments, invisible walls block pretty much every thing. If an objective is 5m away but there's a railing in the way, you can't just jump over it you have to walk all the way around the map to go the one spot the devs want you to go. For how fast paced the game is it not uncommon to go minutes of game play in total of you just walking around with nothing to do. It is also not uncommon for this hack and slash game to have levels go on for 15/20 minutes which can drag on. 


There is also a lot of small technical issues. The menus are just god awful to navigate. Do you have a mouse and keyboard? Well good luck, there is no mouse support in the menus, you have arrow key to every tab. You can't just click things like a normal game. The lock on is awful it's so slow it actually handicaps you, the camera can't keep up with how quickly you can juggle enemies and throw them across maps so your stuck in a situation where you can't see in front of you but you also can't move the camera. Anytime you use can attack that has a long wind up you can't aim it anywhere, you're stuck in direction you aimed it before. With hundreds of effects, sounds, thousands of npcs, text on screen, it is very easy to miss something and you can't correct your mistake. One could cancel the animation but that just means you dropped your combo and wasted your skill. Combos timers still decay during wind ups and in animations which is a questionable choice.",1693725441,1693725441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I assume it's on sale because of the Live Action release's hype. I'm a fan of Warriors games, and have played a lot of the crossovers (and none of the actual ones, haha.) 

The game is fun, but not worth $60. It goes on sale for like 1/6th the price or so often, and if you like Warriors games or like One Piece, pick it up then. For more detail, read ahead.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
[*] Game has a universal, on-command movement option that allows for many different combos and long strings to do. It feels fun and snappy to do in the middle of combat, and is a nice offensive dodge and free combo extension that helps a lot with the power fantasy of Warriors game.
[*] Characters are represented very well, with each character feeling powerful and having their own unique traits and mechanics. Also, a generally pretty large roster of unique characters. 
[*] The Armor System isn't nearly as bad as other reviews have made it out to be. It's a perfectly fine system and it just makes you have to respect the tougher enemies and actually watch out for their attacks and strike at more proper moments. I found it fun to create my openings and then deal as much damage as possible and it made me have to think about when to use my moves more.
[*] Incredibly fun in the Beat'em Up aspect.
[*] Has plenty of non-story missions to do as well in a big side-mode.
[/list]

[h1]The Middling[/h1]
[list]
[*] Some episodes of the main story are just 1v1s with very little substance, and it's pretty boring. It's not bad or hard, just a little lame. I'd rather these not exist at all. Alabasta has the most of these, and for some reason you have to actually play the fight where Luffy does nothing against Crocodile for 3 minutes and then nearly dies in one hit. 
[*] Speaking of mission design, you really can't fail any missions unless you die or a very key-to-that-particular-mission AI companion falls, especially in the main story. If you aren't one to want to strategize, this is fine. But it left me wanting more, especially coming off playing Fire Emblem: Three Hopes.
[*] The game has the repetition you'd expect from a Warriors game. It isn't for everyone, but if you like the source material or Warriors game, it should be fine.
[*] Not everything gets a Story Arc. More on the consequences of this later, but the idea of skipping arcs for the sake of a game is definitely reasonable on the development side.
[*] Fighting Teach sucks. You really get to feel how obnoxious his powers are and he's an enemy you generally do have to play pretty slow against, and he's cowardly as hell. Doesn't dock the game points at all, if anything it represents him well. This is just a silly bulletpoint I felt like including.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[*] Very small microstutters happen occasionally. I'm a stickler for framerate and lag, and it ultimately didn't bother me that much. I just enabled vsync and then it happened significantly less, mostly just in the low-effort cutscenes. My computer is far over the recommended for the game.
[*] Many arcs get skipped over in the story. I can understand skipping a lot of the East Blue stuff; there isn't much room to work with an arc like Arlong Park in a Warriors game, as good as it is, but... No Fishman Island? No Impel Down?! No Skypiea?! Not only that, but characters like Magellan and Enel are also completely unrepresented. It's a big bummer, especially given both of them are absolutely primed for Musou-styled gameplay with their gigantic and dangerous attacks as seen in the animanga. 
[*] This is a big one for me. You only pick one character to play as per mission, and cannot change in the middle of one. Not only this, but you cannot issue orders to any allied playable characters for that mission. This means that you're pretty much entirely on your own as the one character you pick. This also greatly hurts any sort of strategy element the game could actually have, discourages playing as and investing time and knowledge into multiple characters, and the overall mission design being far more simplistic. If you've played another game with these elements, you're definitely going to miss them, especially when every character in this game is generally really cool. I don't regret sticking with Luffy wherever I could for the main story, as he kind of just does everything, especially mobility once you get Boundman. It was the best thing I could really do to fill the void of being able to be in several different places at once with multiple characters, as there are plenty of objectives that will just spawn on the opposite side of the map from you. 

So overall, I think it's missing some key characters, and the actual strategy is really done away with and you can only play as one character per mission as really the biggest flaws with the game. If you can deal with that, on top of the usual Musou button-mashy beat'em up style gameplay, you'll like this game.",1693714149,1693714212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overview:
I managed to achieve  [b]100% completion[/b] in this game using [b]Charlotte Smoothie[/b].
Unlike any other musou game you ever played, this one have a [b]MASSIVE character[/b], not just on the chest area, but the whole body!

While the story is feels like a recap of what happened ( [i] understandable as one arc in one piece take almost 3-4 years [/i] )

Story Review:
So, after we have game original Dressrosa arc in pirates warriors 3, now we have Wano game original arc, which seem a bit goofy after we know how great the anime/manga version is.

Not much to see here in the story, you will finish the story under 20 hours and then playing treasure log a lot.
my rating: 3/5

Gameplay review:
HOLY MOLY!! KOEI?! WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS IN DYNASTY WARRIORS?!
The fact that the combos are unique, fun and have much variety, you won't find it in DW9.

You may want to try all the characters that are divided with 4 types of character with their unique moves and dialogues to every enemy they encounter, not just some reused words to every enemy.

I can't explain, but you have to try it if you are at least watch the anime, it feels more alive.
my rating 4/5

Overall:
[b]Robin and Nami chests are massive.[/b]
5/5 must try",1693233107,1693233107,True,81,14,0.814395010471343994,1,True,False,False

Words alone cannot say how impressed i am by this game and all of its features, if your considering buying this game you should just go ahead and do it, your going to have a great time after all!

Edit after finishing all the missions and achievements: this game is still absolutely breath taking, after going through every treasure log and getting S rank i can say that there are some issues if you can even call it that, it mostly has to do with the strength of each character, for example Whitebeard and Kaido are by far the 2 strongest characters in this game (Smoothie doesn't compare i have tried her a decent amount and she just inst as unstoppable as those 2) while other characters struggle on the later stages despite being fully upgraded and having OP traits, i do want to play some other characters to fully 100% the game (by maxing every character and getting every coin) but for level 14 stages and above you just don't do enough damage or you get bounced around like a balloon because of this alone it is a little disappointing if you wanted to go through the entire treasure log with a character like Brook because he cannot hold his own on these stages. Despite all that mentioned i am very happy with the game and am excited for whenever they release more stages and or characters (Onigashima Luffy hype)",1691471185,1692491075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Look there are good Musous out there like dynasty warriors

but none of them have the same amout of reinement as dragon quest heros

and Most espeically this one

the dlcs on offer

the objectives in this one so much lesss brain dead

the combat system

feels like you are actually interacting

look they have boss battles with mechanics

this should be considered an action game

but it's musou

if you are looking for a game like musou

but find most musou too boring

this is for you

it's colourful

skip the story and get the dlcs 

when you unlock the story

go back and you have the perfect play ground to play with each character you think is cool

guess what they are all different

and have different well refined styles

look dynasty warriors is cool but it's a bit too much

that's good

i have nothing against it

but this is the gold standard of musous

thank you

　If Pirate Warriors 3 didn't have port problems, it would have outperformed Pirate Warriors 4 in terms of content. Pirate Warriors 4 was good in terms of gameplay and its port, but it lacked content. about gear 5th lets talk:

　Since this is the newest game, of course, it has better visuals than any previous installment. OPPW4 brings the best character scaling and color scheme, which looks different for each map. Not to mention, the close-up cutscenes look better than any previous PW game. As for its new UI, though, I think PW3 still holds the trophy. it looks more stylish than this game. It may look clean, but when it comes to the character select screen, it doesn't really look mind-blowing. However, the rest of the graphics are outstanding.

　As a PW player, this game does hold the best gameplay in the series. I'm kinda disappointed they removed the Kizuna Rush from PW3. now our allies are useless AF. Of course, the new technique equipment was the best feature, and I think it should carry over into the next PW series. The only reason why this game gets positive reviews, as in my cover review, is because the combat saves this game a lot. It's the most solid One Piece Pirate Warrior combat I've ever played.

　Most people prefer single player. Additionally, the multiplayer mode doesn't really add new gameplay. I can't say much about the connection, but that's all I can say. I mean, why don't they just make a separate all-online room like many modern games? Searching for a room with specific categories won't help. and its dead.

　After getting tortured with controller issues in PW3, PW4 is supporting many inputs than PW3, and it works so well you don't need to mess with Steam community custom controller inputs. So far, D-input works just fine.

　Up to 15-24 hours compared to the previous game, thanks to its best mode called Dream Log that makes the game last about 100 hours. This game is shit. and it will be always a fact even if they added new DLC up to 100 DLC without new mode it just useless.

        [td]Sᴛᴏʀʏ[/td]
        [td]　
　Here's the main problem with PW4. You know, most PW games started from the beginning up to the newest arc (except PW2, that game never existed). PW3 had all of it until the Dressrosa arc. I mean, if you want to experience One Piece without reading the manga and anime, go play PW3. But if you want to get into OP and play PW4, go ahead, but these games remove most arcs, and even gathering the crew doesn't exist here. PW3 > PW4, and that remains a fact!

　Besides the story mode, we should talk about other modes. In PW3, they had Dream Log, a mode where you can take your selected character adventuring on islands to reach the last island where Shank is the final boss. In PW4, bye-bye, no content for you! Instead, you got Treasure Log that's so bad; it only throws random stuff at you! The map changes whenever you reset the menu and has no purpose at all, besides collecting meaningless coins. In PW3 Dream Log, you can unlock new characters, which is the best and has so many collectibles compared to PW4. Overall, OP4 was more like an arcade-like game, not really worth it for its story and content but only for using your favorite characters to battle enemies, that's all.

　Ah yes, I played this game before the Gear 5 Luffy trailer came out, and as far as I can see, the game now became a money grab. There are no additional new modes, just random favorite characters you already have, but with new costumes and techniques, and now it's time to grind endlessly without any purpose. I remember PW3 had so much content that DLC has costumes. This game has no content and releases costumes that don't change anything, but let's see, still i bet they wont have new mode. so not worth even for OP fans.

　Our main discussion is: Why do we need to pay for Gear 5 Luffy? We bought this game, and we're getting nothing new—no story updates or new arcs. It feels like a waste of money! we might as well wait for PW5. At least Yamato and uta was worth it but not at that price, but what about the rest of the cast? Young Rayleigh and young Garp? And what's the point of having OP Red Movie Shank again? I know they are just leaked characters, but it definitely feels like a money grab.

　I hope PW5 will be the final entry, and please add all arcs, including Enel, that are missing in this game. Even if it takes 10 years until OP is finished and a new game is created, I don't care. at least we will have decent characters to play.

　Yes, if you want solid gameplay, but if you want a better story, content, and solid characters, play PW3 instead. I know it has a bad port, but you'll find a way out anyway. Also, Sanji's Power Ranger brother is useless af. I love his sister, but the rest are just Sanji clones with different colors.

However, the game can feel repetitive after extended play sessions, with some players finding the camera angles and movement to be disorienting and difficult to control. The story mode can also be short and lack depth compared to other musou games, leaving players wanting more.

Furthermore, some players may find the lack of challenge in the game to be disappointing, with the game feeling too easy. The music and sound design can also feel repetitive and lacking in variety, detracting from the overall experience. The game's story mode is also not fully voice acted, which can be a drawback for players looking for a fully immersive experience.

Despite these drawbacks, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a great choice for fans of the One Piece series, offering great fan service and faithfully recreating many iconic moments and locations. However, for players looking for innovation and new features compared to previous Pirate Warriors games, the game may feel lacking.",1683434187,1686094140,True,8,0,0.581571519374847412,0,True,False,False

The graphics style is niche; clay-realism with black anime-esque outlines. Gorgeous!

But if we turn our eyes away from Nami's chest area, I would not recommend this game in general because:
- While they updated skill mechanics and unlockables via the really creative islands, the game is just a pure downgrade of PW3.
- Graphics are nicer than the first PC PW3 game but I miss that comic-style cutscene direction. I really thought they knew they had something good there and would build upon it.
- Returning to the cut argument, while you have a lot of playable characters with a lot of specific things to do to unlock it all, PW3's content of characters and maps was just far more magical.
- They know fully well they could sell the One Piece story to us a thousand times over yet they decided to release a high priced game to us that is basically just a technical preview of what the previous version could have been if they tried.
- One Piece Pirate Warriors 5 needs to learn from these mistakes, because the Musou genre is perfect for the world. You need to feel OP against the masses and only bosses should be a challenge, it digs that, it just needs balance. It also needs far more depth, JRPG depth, food, training mechanics, fishing, exploration, Straw Hat Fleet mechanics, I could come up with more and more and it would all still fall into place with this story-telling Warriors-like game.

All in all... If you want a PC re-sensation of One Piece, play Pirate Warriors 3 rather. It has issues in regards to high fps, resolution and controler support but they can be fixed. It's giant in comparison to this 4th entry, sadly or rather in the perspective of that game, luckily, you'll have the awesome Arlong moments and Fishman Island story, more Sanji and Zoro, the important parts! ... a ton more of the very important story details in short. Games will always flop if the next entry isn't an expansion, developers please, try to finally understand this fact. We've had enough paint thrown over our eyes. Something as big as One Piece deserves respect from all of us. Never cut; only expand! Take the good you had going, remove the bad and tedious, come up with new streamlined ideas. Make it a 250gb game, I'll happily download it. Just gimme the perfect One Piece Video Game experience in the next entry, please, this genre is *made* for this; all it truly needs is clever balance and more of everything.",1685770461,1685774075,False,48,7,0.692118287086486816,0,True,False,False

Definitely one of the better warriors games, but I wish there were more move slots, skill slots, & that you would do more damage by endgame (Was really hoping I could one shot with Katakuri's mochi anemone or White Beard's super for example by end game with all damage passives equipped, w/ maxed out damage coins) I personally was just a little disappointed by the lack of oomf in supers in general.

Also I was pretty disappointed by how some characters were either shortchanged with skills & transformations (Such as Carrot Frankie & debatably Chopper not getting transformations; but Big Mom, Kaido, & Luffy did get transformations), lack of costumes, or straight up being worse than in OPPW3 (I personally found Tashigi & the Fujitora to be a lot more enjoyable in OPPW3), or just outright terrible (I'm like never going to play as Boa Hancock, she legitimately has the worst moveset in the game imo). Oh & they removed a few characters from the previous game such as Perona, RIP Perona.

Apart from all of that I still feel like out of all the Warriors games I've played, I still feel like Fire Emblem Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, DW7EL, & DW PsVita probably all handled enemy captains better; I was never particularly thrilled to run into any captains, & never felt challenged in any recent warriors game, pretty much it boiled down to just needing better stats in this OPPW4 or the other OPPW3, or just running off to find a medkit (meat/food), or just playing as a factually better character (Like Big Mom, or Katakuri who can heal themselves & deal great damage).

If anything the combat encouraged playing as the ""OP"" characters, since you want to deal with the regenerating ""health bar"" quickly & having a self heal makes things significantly easier, it just felt like if you wanted to have any fun you had to give up a few skill slots to damage boosting so you could tear through the armored health bar thing faster so you could beat a stage in a reasonable amount of time. And I am still very annoyed by the ""victory conditions have changed"" thing where every stage is just constantly dragged out, does it really hurt to let us know how much time we will be spending on a stage, like come on, sometimes I just want to get my upgrades or money & move on instead of having to randomly commit to a long mission.

As for the new types I personally didn't like it, it really didn't make a whole lotta sense: For instance Luffy's Snake Man is a Speed type, but his Bound Man is a sky type, yet the Sky type moves faster & can hold the dash button to fly across the map, but Snake Man has to spam the dash button (And snake man has a problem doing damage or connecting hits so he isn't that great either really). This same issue is sorta across the board as Kizaru & Big mom both in sky type forms can dash infinitely, but speed type characters seemingly cannot. Then when it comes to movesets it feels like Technique types are always Clunky, & Strength types are always robbed of any aerial moves, so sky types tend to be both faster & more versatile than everyone else.

I will say I really liked the addition of being able to equip moves onto characters, but I wish we were able to equip another 4 to the other trigger, I just find it odd that we have so many unused buttons, & that captain fights have not gotten more intelligent, it pretty much boils down to spamming attacks & having better stats & running off to heal when necessary still.

All in all, I feel this warriors game is worth your time, it has the groundwork to be a great game, but falls just short of being great by taking a few steps forward from past titles (selectable moves, better graphics, larger characters & enemies, destructible environments) & a few steps back (Armored health bars, clunkier movesets, less costumes, not everyone gets aerial combos, not everyone can hold dash, not everyone gets transformations, cut characters & stories, difficulty largely based on stats rather than skill).",1680301196,1680905709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: I really need to vent my frustration out of that Katakuri fight. To be fair it's a really good game. Lots of changes made on the classic Dynasty/Samurai Warriors, friendly AI actually deals damage and actually moves and attacks as relentless as enemy AI, enemy AI is more aggressive, removal of block button so you have to rely on dodging making combat more kinetic, additional character skills(like Luffy's gum gum storm) placed on dedicated controls(r1/rb + face buttons), and many more changes to their classic formula.

All of the characters are pretty faithful to the actual story, as well as having a lot of different environments and unlockable moves. The game is pretty grindy, so it can get really easy to burnout, which is what happened to me. But I can't deny that for the most part it's really fun to just go apeshit with some of the more broken/destructive characters. Big Mom and Kaido actually feel like complete powerhouses, without being so broken that it starts to become boring and braindead to play them. Although I wish some characters were a lot better like Usopp and Chopper. Usopp is my favorite Straw Hat in the story, but he is by far my least favorite character to play in this game due to how weak he is. Another negative that I have is that I wish that there was a lot more stuff that could've been added in. Because of the fact they put every single Vinsmoke brother in the game, I feel like they could've at least added in some other fan favorites, with some of them already being in the game as different AI. I will have a list of all the stuff I wish was in the game, but overall I think this is a great game for both One Piece fans as well as Dyansty Warriors fans, due to the fact that anime powers can make everything feel way more fun and chaotic. 

Stuff I wish that were playable in the game:
-Bon Clay
-Rayleigh
-Moria
-Magellan
-Nekomushi and Dog Viper
-Yamato
-Kuma 
-Garp
-Perona
-Enel
-Caesar Clown
-Bellamy
-Hody Jones
-Literally any costumes for Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook (Seriously where are they?)
-Costumes and Characters from Pirate Warriors 3

Here are some recommendations if you plan on getting this game:

- You don't need any particular strategy to beat any boss, just button smashing and a bit of running around. No decision making, no secrets, just plain hack & smash and a bit of grinding for coins and money.

- If you get the game with the DLC included, you will get a few characters like Drake and Oden than can help you farm S rank easily on those hard and pesky missions. But if you don't get any DLC, you can wait until you unlock Luffy (with fourth gear) Whitebeard or Ichiji-- they are fairly powerful. 

- I totally recommend anybody to play this game on Hard difficulty. Normal is way too easy. The boss is literally standing in front of you, walking around waiting for your attacks if you play on Normal. 

- Playing with a controller is highly recommended, seriously, playing on a keyboard will give you carpal tunnel.

A deep pool of characters to pick from (albeit with a couple members missing that I would've loved to see) keeps you refreshed and the progression system to upgrade their stats is neat. Lots of ability customization as well. Can't wait to see a 5th installment! Please add Enel as a playable character!,1671907310,1671907310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, you still grind to get coins although its way stripped down and linear (but less frustrating). Yes, there is fan service. No, there are no Kizuna Attacks. 

Character progression has been jazzed up with a sphere grid-esque tree of upgrades per character. Each character now fits some pretty well-defined sub-classes that provide some variety to play styles. Personally I think the Sky characters are really overpowered and can stunlock and then decimate pretty much anything with the right upgrades. I mean that in the best way; Musou is at its best when you've broken it.

Stages are ugly and confusing in their layout, par for the course here.

I like all the new improvements to character differentiation and the new special moves system is a great way to swap out big flashy moves to use on command instead of trying to remember the attack string.

Pros:
*Redefining [b]fast[/b] paced action for Musou/Warrior titles
*A moderate cast of characters with 4-5 different play styles
*CO-OP mode!

Cons:
*Skips several arcs, a few important for character's development, others not so much
*several cut characters, playable and non playable
*coby is still not playable
*broken english (as per usual) as well as broken character names (""koby"" and ""teech"", i'm surprised they didn't go with ""ruffy"" instead of luffy)

One Piece: Pirate warriors 4 absolutely knocks it out of the park with it's amazing gameplay mechanics and speed, not to mention different skills for you to costumize your favorite character with your favorite abilities instead of the locked 2 special attacks you had in previous ones. To say OPPW 4 is bad is an understatement, even if it cuts content in favor of gameplay.

This game is a must have if you wish to experience what musou/warriors series have come to, and being a fan of this type of game, It brings a tear to my eye to be able to experience such a master piece of modern gameplay <3

You're still getting a banana split, it's still delicious, and it's really all down to personal taste.

This game slaps, but I'm a butterscotch kinda guy. One thing I really don't like about it, though it's not a game breaker, is how much looser the combat feels compared to its predecessors -- you really feel like, especially with speed and sky-type characters, you're just zooming around almost to the point of being out of control. I haven't played as all of the characters yet, so I can't really say I've settled into one I enjoy deeply, but as a result I'm finding myself playing as a wider variety of characters compared to earlier titles *because* I haven't settled into a main. The characters I usually play as have been changed dramatically (Sanji) or gutted to an unfortunate degree (Tashigi), so finding a new one is a bit of an ongoing effort, I'd say.

The campaign mode is fine, it's about as good as any of the PW games' campaigns are, though I really do miss PW1's more linear, mission-type layouts with obstacles to overcome and problems to solve compared to later games' more traditional musou play. I didn't realize how much I missed that kind of musou game until I played P5 Strikers, actually. PW4 being a more traditional musou game like PW3 but without the *impact* you feel with your attacks and without some real army-clearing attacks like the Kizuna follow-ups makes it feel a lot less dynamic as a result. The fact that there's not much free-play or mission mode like PW3's is also a point against it.

But, where the game falters is also where it really kicks up something new and interesting by comparison. If you're a grindfest kinda guy like I am, the new character upgrade maps are a treat and make you feel like you're really advancing a character unlike PW3's coin system. The giant enemies are fun as heck to take down even on harder difficulties, where you'd expect them to just be HP sponges, and they add a layer of strategy to the greater map design that I really enjoyed. Overall, I would say the feeling of taking down a giant and capturing territories in this game is about as fun and high-pressure as getting Kizuna score was in PW3, and I'm a lot more thankful of how much less stressful S-Ranking a map is in this one.

Game's solid, definitely a recommend.

But man, they really did my boy Sanji dirty. Though, if you were playing Sanji in Pirate Warriors games to begin with, you're already a special kind of masochist, I suppose.",1668394548,1668394548,True,14,1,0.591864168643951416,0,True,False,False

+ Gameplay and new movesets for many characters feel more fluent and devastating than PW3.
+ New giant type enemies are fun to fight.
+ The biggest roster of playable characters with 43 in the base game and 9 DLC.
+ New, bigger maps with the new building-destruction mechanic really help sell the power fantasy.
+ Better visual and effect when compared to PW3.
+ Great music.

The bad:
- Lock-on camera is god awful at times
- Many playable story arcs like Arlong, Thriller park, Fishman island in PW3, are either removed or reduced into recap cutscenes in PW4.
- With the revamped gameplay, the kizuna rush mechanic is gone, I can't say if this is for the better or worse in term of gameplay but without it, a somewhat unique aspect of characters' interactions is gone.
- Less alternate outfits for many characters.
- Dream logs' interface is severely downgraded from an interactive map to a simple selection menu.
- No more treasure events, legend diary or anything that would encourage you to replay story missions except for getting S grade.
- Some maps can be quite annoying to navigate.
- The new buildings-destruction system feel somewhat underused, like i was hoping to be able to create new routes on some maps and not just dealing extra damage to enemies.

Overall:
- Is this a good musou game? Yes.
- Is this game a good sequel to PW3? Absolutely not, if anything this is more PW3.5 than a full sequel.
- Should you try this out knowing nothing about One piece? Maybe not, many of the main story arcs are greatly abridged or glossed over.
- Should you try this out as a One Piece fan? Yes, but i highly recommend getting this on sale.",1667369913,1667669308,True,48,1,0.814611315727233887,0,True,False,False

I got given OPW3 from someone dear to me in my life who died a year later so I was really excited to finally own OPW4 and I found that there's a few improvements but a lot taken away at the same time.

The storymode is ridiculously short compared to OPW3. We got to explore all the major arcs from our first encounter with Buggy all the way to Dressrosa in OPW3, here we get a whistlestop tour of some places with the biggest focus being on alabasta, giving us this impression we'll see the same experience as OPW3 with the storyline just to be disappointed and rugpulled. I've completed 4 stories worth about 10 stages each and I'm basically at the last story. It took me way longer to get this far in OPW3.

The character progression feels more involved in this game, with us now being able to unlock, upgrade and swap out character skills to build a cooler feeling experience and allowing a difference in playing which OPW3 didn't have (which made combat feel samey). Let's get into the important bit.

I am not anywhere near done so IDK the full list of characters compared to OPW3, I am hoping it's added rather than taken away but I would say I feel that removing the amount of storyline they did for the sake of adding a plethora of characters which most people won't ever touch, whilst also robbing us of the opportunity to see explored arcs post-Dressrosa feels...

+ got at least  60 more hours offline
+ you can 100% the achievements without spending 100+ hours like PIRATE WARRIORS 3 to 100% the gallery and treasure log
- Botched the story just like pirate warriors 3
- They uber botched the wano arc by making ur their own story and the game just ends when its getting good
+2 player Online co-op, not sure if some levels can go up to 4 player
+ 2 player Local co-op 
- audio is choppy in cutscenes, almost unwatchable. lots of reports on this, im not alone
- No playable vivi… come on guys
- Level system is pure garbage, but at least the game has it. Ive spent at LEAST 8 hours leveling characters….that shit aint fun, and is slow as hell. About 200ish things to level per character and over 150 of them are the exact same.
- Spent 20 minutes leveling up characters and back out of the game exiting it from the in game menu….none of the leveling had saved
- Insane grind to max a single character,  pirate warriors 3 did a far better job with the level system
+ Gameplay wise its fun
+ Character play style diversity
- Deluxe Edition doesnt come with1 month or song pack DLC
- why isnt Vivi a part of this or any game as a playable character, shes a recognised member of the straw hat crew

+ Musou game is a good fit for One piece as the characters within said series are OP as hell and could defeat an entire army
+ The ability to transform some Character types are really fun, as different forms can really change up their gameplay style
+ The Wano arc is a unique take, as its original to the game and has some fun ideas in itself (its also interesting to see an alternative ending to Wano and compare it to the actual ending it had)

Negatives:
- GLITCHES, especially animated Cut scenes. When said scenes occur the screen turn blank and resumes to gameplay when it should've had cut scenes within it. I realized this was a glitch after Marine Ford.*
-Some arcs are really skimmed over making the pacing feeling odd (Definitely do not use this to catch up to One Piece)
-Steam Workshop support would've been nice

*A fix for it that worked for me was turning the game into windowed 720p and use ALT+Enter to make it into full screen, this way the cut scenes Play out normally (hope this fix works for you)

Final thoughts:
Highly recommend this game to One Piece Fans as it gives an fun Recap of the One Piece up to Whole Cake (The Wano here is original to the game, but nonetheless still interesting).
Definitely pick this up during a Sale.",1660492658,1660492658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All characters have their own style/stance now (power, sky, technique, speed) this makes our overall play time more enjoyable since there are many play style to choose from, beside that now they add aerial combat so you have more combos execution and faster way to travel around the map. The environment are now destructible too making it a fun musou combat to mess with. For the leveling system and coin, i say its not as grindy as PW3 so its fine for me.
One thing i didn't like is the treasure log, there are many stages to play with but they didn't represent it like PW3 where the menu are you traveling the sea its just more fresh to look at, in PW4 its just a simple menu.",1651656957,1659720083,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

If you're a fan of One Piece and follow the stories through Shows and Manga and don't mind how they compress and skip most of the story. This game is something you will enjoy. It even have some original story on ""Wano Arc"" since the game was release before the conclusion of the saod arc.

But if you are not a fan og any of those then i don't think you will have a great time with this game... You can still have fun but you will get bored fast specially on how repetitive a warrors game is and on how they skip most of the one piece seriess arc.

And as for me after completing the main story and some of the of its other content i can safely say that i did enjoy my time playing the game... But there are something I need to address about the game... First, on how grindy the game is for maxing a character... Most warriors game are very grindy but the way they changed the level system on this take that gindyness of those game to a whole new level. Second, this is not just for this game but dor the whole warriors game series... Why does every time a sequel come out rather than balancing and upgrading all tha character and adding additional new one you always have to remove old characters? And lastly speaking of balancing... It's okay to have some OP character that will steamrolled tha game since there are only a few that can be call OP... But those character whom you only going to use once because on how bad they are on everything that they do. Those should be fix.

Overall, the game is very fun and very much recommended... But i do recommend to get it on sale.",1659231115,1659233041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. Karakter dalam game ini cukup banyak
2. Skill nya gampang untuk digunakan
3. Ada banyak variasi skill
4. Map yang cukup luas (jika dibandingkan dengan game hack slash seperti samurai warriors)
5. Cerita dalam game ini sama dengan yang di anime, namun ada perubahan gaya penampilan mengingat ini adalah sebuah game hehehe
6. tree talent yang ada dalam game ini cukup seru untuk dilengkapi dan bisa menjadi tujuan lain dalam game ini, sehingga membuat game nya jadi gak monoton
7. grafis oke
8. Voice actor nya mirip dengan yang di anime
9. leveling cukup mudah

Cons:
1. Cukup sulit/ terbatas untuk menenmukan power up dan healing item ketika bertarung sehingga menyulitkan untuk mengalahkan boss dengan aura iblis
2. kostumnya sangat terbatas dan tidak memberi efek lain ketika didapatkan dari game
3.  karakter seperti kaido harusnya tidak dimunculkan bila kemampuannya masih belum diketahui ketika game ini diluncurkan, karena dalam game ini kekuatan kaido berbeda dengan yang di anime
4. arc yang kunilai bagus (seperti skypea dan punk hazard) malah tidak muncul. karakter skypea padahal cukup seru bila dimainkan

Overall aku kasih nilai 8.0/10,0

There are a lot of improvements but there are a few problems I have with the game. First problem is the main Campaign feels short. That's because they cut off a lot of the Arcs from like East Blue, Sky Island, Thriller Bark, Impel Down, Fish Man Island, and Punk Hazard. The game reuse a lot of the models and animation during cutscenes, not movie cutscenes. Second problem is they removed like about 7 playable characters from the previous, Enel, Kuma, Garp, Perona, Magellan, Moria, and Caeser. While the roster of playable characters in this game is bigger, yes, even with the DLC characters, it is a downgrade by removing (or in this case replacing) previous playable characters. Third problem is they removed Kizuna Rush and replaced it with Full Force Burst but without the APC characters appearing at the end of your combo strings and combination cinematic attack. Some people dislike them and some people like me like them. I enjoy looking at the different combination attacks cinematics and having APC attack with you at the end of a combo string makes them feel alive. In this game, allies APC are useless and boring. Fourth problem is the DLCs. I didn't buy the DLCs mostly because they're pointless, in my opinion. They should had added additional maps and Arcs for the DLC. But instead we get more playable characters which doesn't add any replayability to me after finishing the game. If the characters DLC were like 5 or 6 USD I guess they're worth it. The new improvements they added are as follow. You can jump, customize your character's Skills and Special Skills loadout, and they removed the Treasure Events. This is a musou type game with a One Piece skin slapped on it. You either like One Piece and/or Musou games or you don't. I like both but eventually it starts to feel very repetitive like I said earlier. Not worth full price. At least 20 to 30 USD.",1649329038,1656537431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ONE PIECE: PIRATE WARRIORS 4 isn't the best in the Pirate warriors franchise, however it is really fun for One piece fans who know the material.

Pirate warriors 4 only cover 6 main arcs that are in One Piece. 

Meaning it's missing ALOT of content that was in previous games. The Arcs included are Alabasta, Enies Lobby, the Paramount War, Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and a game original Wano arc that has nothing to do with the actual Wano Arc because it's missing key characters and things that happen in Wano, so its not just an original story about Wano...Its just a set of missions were Kaidou has a loose connection and it's called Wano because of that.


None the less Pirate warriors 4 does a great job at being a fun Dynasty Warriors type game with One piece characters, It's still really fun and while not having a massive amount of content it plays better than other Pirate warrior games by far and i did have alot of fun with it despite the missing of some of the most important arcs in the series...*cough cough* dressrosa.

7/10 Just buy Pirate warriors 3 however if you really dont care and just want mindless fun with One Piece characters then go for it.",1652130743,1655999947,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But if you are here to play your fav characters from anime (assuming they didnt ignore completely) then i would totally recommend this game ,The gameplay is insanely good and they and the RPG system is very good 

Things that i liked about the gameplay:

1.They didnt fuck up sanji like old game 
2.You can actually jump in this game! unlike warriors 3
3.You choose your abilities 
4.The map destruction and layout ,the map feels 500% more alive than warriors 3
5.The flow of the fights ,It doesnt have as many pauses like warriors 3

I dont believe that you would be looking at this game if you weren't already a fan of One Piece so the review is based from this view.

For fans, this game is simply amazing
- Lots of maps
- Lots of characters
- The whole story of One Piece (Up to the start of wano + a fake ending for the arc)

The only thing holding this game back is the lacklustre AI and the gameloop (most missions are the same)
Also, this game would profit from a nude-mode, but that may just only be me.

Way more comboes, and a easy flashy super move you can do with the crazy combo attacks is very fun overall! Its only fun like this, but sadly you have to grind individually for each character in order to unlock all their combos and moves, which is ridiculous cause of how long the grind is. But if you manage to level them all up, and play them normally, it becomes a really fun game to pull out whenever I wanna kill an hour or 2 for time. Graphics are an improvement, and has quite a bit of options to tweak to compared to pirate warriros 3. And whats even better, the port of this game is good! Your able to actually play the episodes and not having to worry about crashing or being randomly kicked out. The only thing I didn't like was that if u left the game for any reason, you cant save and go right back into action like PW 3 had (tho it wasnt auto save, so i had to manually save to do this) but still better then not being able to save at all. If u play an episode, better hope to god u can finish it before you get called up and have to leave the game. Not only is the grind and progression really slow, the only way to lvl up your characters is to actually load up a game, I found this to be pretty annoying. Much less episodes compared to PW3, PW3 covers mostly all the arcs, and is pretty accurate. PW4 decides to skip some arcs which is sad cuz skypiea was one of my underated favorite arcs, but sad to see its not in the game. Choosing to start at alabasta arc instead of replaying the episodes to get your crew was a smart decision (every arc before alabasta besides arlong was pretty boring im not gonna try to cap) IN conclusion, its a good game. one of the few games where instead of unistalling after finishing the story, I wanna complete the treasure logs in order to unlock the rest of the characters. (cant wait to see how shanks, and black beard plays.) The only other con I would say about this game is some characters are pretty boring to play. Mostly the Technique fighters like robin, and kuzan who by the way u would expect to have cool moves and combos, but his attacks r so fucking sloww!

In Dynasty warriors, ALL weapons and playstyles can kick butt and be incredibly fun, flashy, unique. In Pirate Warriors it's not the same at all. You have the play as the big well-known fighters or go home, Chopper for instance has 0 effort put into his mechanics. Despite being THE transformation character of the show, he doesn't hold ANY OF HIS TRANSFORMATIONS and has NO UNIQUE MOVESETS based off his forms, but yet Luffy does. Why? Idfk, makes no sense.

A LOT of characters suffer this, Usopp, Crocodile, many others suffer this lack of ambitious builds. And it's not just me not liking a playstyle, I loved ALL weapons in ALL dynasty warriors because they were all unique, and effective. Chopper is NOT effective AT ALL. I did my absolute best on 1 mission and it took 2 and a half hours. Then I went in it again with a character I didn't try yet, Frankie, and I beat it in 5 minutes. THAT'S ABSURD. What makes it worse, is these characters on back burner all mechanically work closely the same. They're slow, low damage, no arial potential, and only hit 1 small area once in a great while, and have slow combos. 

Another issue is awesome abilities have to be equipped and make you leave behind other abilities. This should be canned and instead introduce complex input systems so all characters can bring in all moves. This alone would make the trash characters more baerable.

Now for online. Online is so badly done, there's a ton of Desync and it makes it that you might as well be playing alone because of this. And it's not flukes or a glitch, it's 100% constantly desynced intentionally. You will NOT fight the same enemy at the same time. Instead you should Parsec and splitscreen this, but that's lame that you have to do this.

Another issue it lacks is lack of character specific campaigns. Dynasty Warriors let you pick any character, stick with them from their perspective, build up, get stronger, and help whatever cause, it was an RPG game. Pirate Warriors has none of this. I get its trying to be true to the story, but they could easily have another gamemode for this. It's a Video Game trying to be like Dynasty Warriors, so where are the golden, tried and true Dynasty Warrior mechanics? They could have AT LEAST a non-cannon alternate mode.

I won't say don't try the game or avoid it, it can be fun with friends, and if your favorite characters are characters like Luffy and anyone who almost beat Luffy then you'll have a great time. But I still give a negative review for how little effort they put in so many loved characters. You either play Emporers, Warlords, or don't play at all because picking Chopper will mean you spend up to 4 hours on a short mission.",1613397172,1651535148,False,16,1,0.596819400787353516,0,True,False,False

You can relive the anime through the singleplayer mode.... if you fail, you are just doomed to restart the entire 
button mashing fest that this game is. 

The moves are cool, it's accurate and detailed, but overall it becomes boring. I cannot bring myself to enjoy this game past 5 minutes of button mashing to defeat an opponent that most of the time looks like they are standing still.  

On top of all that, you will hear several sound clips and see subtitles that you cannot possibly focus on if you want to continue fighting effectively. This is annoying for most players... 

It feels soulless, after defeating several enemies, I cannot stand watching my character move around with my input while sputtering voice lines with zero animations to accompany them. As if whatever they are saying is so unimportant that the developers just slapped it into the game without a care.

[b] The Good [/b]
Amazing artwork
- The design of the levels and characters really bring the one piece universe to life
Story
- The story follows the manga (mostly) so not much to say here
Replayable
- Characters require a significant amount of resources to max out, so lots of grinding involved
Lots of signature moves
- Ranging from iconic to flashy, the ultimate moves do not disappoint and are always a joy to unleash

[b] The Bad [/b]
Unbalanced characters and character classes
- Aerial and Tech characters are not viable, and speed types are vastly inferior to strength types.
- Only Akainu, Biscuit, Big Mom, and Kaido are decent
Lacks the rush of PW3
- Marines are beefier this time and the level cap is 50, so enemies don't really go flying unless using the 4 characters listed above",1648979221,1648979221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it comes with most of the typical baggage that goes along with that distinction, it’s not the prettiest looking game in the world, there are lots of reused assets from prior games, and outside of a few select boss fights, its hoards of baddies offer very little resistance.

It has the unusual honor of being both one of the best anime-based games and best Warriors games I've ever played. It has its flaws, including the tiresome return of Giant foes and the usual Warriors repetitiveness, but it's a great example of how to reinvigorate something that seems like a tired formula. If you're a One Piece fan or a fan of the Warriors franchise, PW4 is absolutely worth a go. Once you've taken a bite of gum-gum, you won't be able to resist more.",1646325717,1646325717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What the game does best, once you unlock all the combos for each character, is the feeling of being a pirate blessed with anime power. By fruit or by will, your enemies will fall to your over the top might. It is also great that everyone feels legitimately like their own character, with no two combo strings feeling like the same function. 

Also, you get to hear the silly otomat laughs of the pirates in their classic Japanese, what's not to like there?

Get the game on sale if fictional pirates that stretch or set fire to things or literally sunder reality by willing it sounds a bit over the top, but this is def a great game.

The biggest improvement over Pirate Warriors 3 in my opinion lies in the level design. The levels in 4 feel so varied and fun to fight around in. Pirate Warriors 3 had very linear and flat level design and PW4 absolutely knock it out of the park in that regard.

Aerial combos is a nice addition but I'd say the shield adds a extra layer of tedium (You either smash through it because you're overleveled for an area or its a wall that takes forever to overcome).

Each character is really fun on their own way, and the playstyles fit their abilities quite well, and the skill tree is easier to navigate around as it connects all of the stats and skills as different islands, which is honestly just a neat detail. and the story is told well enough to enjoy it, still not good enough to replace the source material, but the cinematics help on doing justice to a lot of iconic moments, that while rushed, they still really have a lot of impact on them. Plus since this game covers less arcs than the last one, there are extra levels covering parts of the story that were not playable before.

Most notably are the majority of story arcs both pre and post timeskip (and even in the ones that are included, some plot points are skipped over or changed slightly to help the musou gameplay fit in, so I wouldn't recommend this to someone wanting to catch up to the series with this), but also specific characters (most of the strawhat crew pre-timeskip are unplayable, and their respective costumes aren't available either), and extra content (the gallery shop and Dream Log from 3 have both been removed, with the latter replaced with specific 'what if?' style battles instead). Reading this, you may wonder why I'm recommending it.

The fact is, Omega Force seem to have focused on the depth of what's in the game rather than a wide spread of things to do. Combat is much more developed than in 3, and most characters really feel like a unique, authentic experience to play as. The upgrade tree is now split up into 3 parts, with the first conferring stat upgrades to all of the characters rather than just one specifically, meaning you don't have to grind to enjoy playing as a character you just spent hours trying to unlock. It isn't an extravagant feast of content, but what is here is a lot of fun.

Side note, the background music in this one is honestly really good! I don't have the anime music DLC but with songs like this I don't think it's really needed at all.",1639339764,1639339764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Story is a bit lack luster though, with cutting out major plot points, and some characters don't even have that many Voice lines or Available movement options. 

I can understand cutting back on things for time and not having the material to work with, but it was a better opportunity to just re due the third game, with this engine and landscapes, and Play the same story, with the Full New world arc up to [SPOILERS] instead of rushing through 'SOME' of the main plot points. Cutting out Sky Island and Thriller bark makes Robin and Brook's segments Seem really rushed and out of place when your supposed to care for them.

If the game was supposed to be an introduction to the series it fails hard with how the story is told, and adding some Characters that are towards the end of the Games story in as early as The First mission/Thing you do is a REALLY bad move story wise...

Not to mention cutting out Half the character roster of the main characters just cause they didn't want to fix/finish their Previous game incarnations? Franky, Robin, Chopper, and Brook aren't playable till half way through the game and most of them are with the crew at the first level. They use their moves from the third game, they have their costumes also, but they aren't selectable unless you're playing Free log and are restricted to 'ONLY' playing their New World versions. A terrible move for the sake of Fast forwarding to.... Basically a Black hole where they lost the main story and made up alot of interactions.",1639121973,1639121973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like an 8 out of 10, which sounds good, but it isn't better than pirate warriors 3, which is a masterpiece of musuo.  The fighting is different, with styles such as flight and speed, and that really ruins some characters, since they fly all the time if they're sky type. the roster is okay, although the DLC leans too heavily into wano, and there is zero reason for them to have taken out characters.  i would still say pirate warriors 3 has the better roster.  the story mode is okay, although very long, and the treasure log system is okay, not near as fun or inventive as dream islands. overall this game feels like it lacks depth, while pirate warriors 3 had a surprising amount.
The only reason i recommend this game at all, is because the steam port of pirate warriors 3 is a ps3 port, which means its garbage and not worth playing.  this port of pirate warriors 4 runs perfectly fine, so shoot for this if you want to get into musuo, one piece, or just want some mindless, albeit sometimes unfun, musuo.",1638848662,1638848662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Active skills are combo finishers of the previus game but with less damage and even worse Aoe, we have no frenzy kizuna but a boost that increases speed attack and just a bit of damage, most of the characters are unplayable durin high level missions without hp regen thanks to enemies being able knock-back the shit out of you, even the dash is just trash, it has no I-frames and its only worth usin for rushin through the map. Cool character system like Shirohige charged attacks durin combos is gone, even though Shirohige is by far one of the best characters in this game in the previus game it was a truck with a retarded damage and the AoE it had was the best out of any character, but generally speakin most characters got worse combos compared to the previus game like Sabo who could obliterate any boss enemy within seconds.

The game even lacks endgame for some reasons, theres no cool island system like we had in the previus title that unlocks certain characters, there isnt even any breakthrough system and gettin S ranks gives you nothin, it doesnt even count towards the 100%, fuk you literally do not need to complete the album to get 100% in this game whille in others musou you had to even get specific songs to play. It takes around 20h to get 95% of the achievements and less than 25h to get the 100% while in Pirate warriors 3 it took me around 60h just to complete the freakin campaign with all rank S (here as i said you do not need to get any rank S or do any side quests, they are just useless and do not unlock anythin).

The game trully feels unfinished, there isnt even an actual level up system like the previus pirate warriors, is just get coins and buy stats throught a common skill tree. Even payin 15 buxs  feels like a rip off. They even sell characters apart i mean what the hell were they thinking????

These are my personal opinions on each aspect of the game

Graphics: 8/10
- The 3D models are very cool
- The ground textures are pretty wack in some places
- The textures have a below average amount of pixels in them
- Chopper looks adorable
Animation: 9/10
- The animation is pretty darn good
- In the introduction, the scene of kid running towards kaido is pretty cool
- Some of the scenes are a bit odd
Gameplay: 9/10
- The camera movement is a tad bit inconvenient
- Very satisfying combat
- The controls aren't that good but and I got confused with a bit of the tutorial but I changed the keybinds so thats okay
- It has some very cool combat mechanics
Story: 9.5/10
- It's good as a summary of the one piece story but isn't a replacement for the actual manga or show
- It skips some parts of the original story but that's probably for convenience
- Covers the main scenes of each arc

This is my opinion, please don't bully me :/

So One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 has one main thing going for it, and then one thing taking away from it. 

Pro: you get to see and play as some of your favorite one piece characters. There is a nice diversity of abilities, all of them signature moves. The character interaction is great with a lot of ""what if"" moments which are cool to see. 
Con: The game is too easy, especially when you unlock Kaido, who just bulldozes over everything. Granted, I played it on normal mode, but unless you are going for some sort of uber-completionist stuff and get S Rank on the ultra hard difficulty, then I don't see the point of playing once you have completed the treasure log and the story mode.",1637219508,1637219508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pirate Warriors 4 contains 6 major story arcs, Alabasta, Enies Lobby, Summit War, ""Entry to the New World!"" (Mainly just Dressrosa), Whole Cake Island and Land of Wano (Called game original because they were entrusted to make their own non-canon ending).

So, they skip the entirety of One Piece up until the end of the Alabasta Saga in this game, as compared to Pirate Warriors 3 which starts off at Orange Town. They've opted to focus on these 6 major story arcs in order to provide more structure I think. The thing is that Pirate Warriors 3 is a fantastic recap of One Piece up until Dressrosa, it goes through important arcs. There's no Impel Down, Thriller Bark, Fishman Island or Punk Hazard in this game. 

All of Germa 66 is in this game except for Vinsmoke Judge, you have to buy him as a DLC along with Smoothie and Cracker, who are the only playable Whole Cake Island characters in this game aside from Big Mom and Katakuri. Germa 66 who haven't really done that much in One Piece as of yet, but still they're in the game, but Kuma, Moria, Magellan, Enel, Perona, Caesar and even Garp were cut out despite being in PW3. You were also able to fight Oars as part of Thriller Bark in PW3, that felt really cool the first time, this game doesn't have that.

It just feels weird not having every Warlord as a playable character, I understand cutting out Enel and Perona, maybe even Caesar. Kuma, Moria and Garp should be in the game.

But instead we have every Yonko, Whitebeard, Big Mom, Kaido, Blackbeard and Shanks as playable characters.

We also have almost everyone from the Worst Generation. Of course, Blackbeard, Luffy and Zoro, but also Law, Bege, Kid and Hawkins, with X. Drake, Urouge and Killer being purchased as DLC.

Then there's the third DLC which allows you to play as Kin'emon, Okiku and Oden.

I just find there to be a lot of odd decisions in this game. One thing this game does better is the levelling. In PW3 you had to use different coins on a character in order to increase their stats or unlock a new ability or something. In this game, you have 3 growth maps to follow instead, 1 joint growth map that affects every character, a personal growth map for each character which allows you to unlock new special abilities and new attack combos among some stat increases, as well as a second personal growth map which is exclusively stat increases.

I think it's a huge improvement, but the third growth map feels a bit unnecessary, because it ends up just making your favorite character way stronger than everyone else, which as far as I know could be mandatory if you play the game's Treasure Log long enough. I like versatility and playing different characters, if some of my characters are weaker just because I don't have the money, that just ends up feeling annoying rather than fun.

I don't know, if you put a larger focus on gameplay than story, then this is a fantastic game, I personally feel it just misses out on some things concerning One Piece as a whole, but it's really fun playing your favorite characters from One Piece. It's just sad that they took out certain iconic and important characters. If you want more story and what feels like more replayability however, Pirate Warriors 4 is a great game, the only thing that game misses out on is everything past Dressrosa, because ti does everything else fantastically.",1632953855,1637205960,True,7,0,0.613259673118591309,0,True,False,False

I'm only giving this a thumbs up because it's still braindead fun. But as someone who has own all 3 previous games, it's a HUGE downgrade from it's predecessors (if you played PW3 on PC its an upgrade).

Burst and special moves don't nearly do as much damage as before; this turns bosses into damage sponges that just stay there getting their ass kicked, being thrown through the air left and right for 2 minutes straight. (Remember the satisfaction of clearing an entire room instantly with Enel or Boa in Pirate Warriors 2? Yeah imagine the absolute opposite of that). I understand rebalancing but they went really hard towards the weaker side of things and without improving the enemy ai, it just made things take longer to kill without any real challenge. 

There's also missing characters from previous entries (Perona, Enel, Garp, Magellan, Caesar Clown, Moriah and Kuma), they removed all of the Dynasty Warriors skins, the music is a huge downgrade, the cutscenes look stiff and awkward as all heck, (No neck Kaido) the story goes Alabasta (yes it starts there) > Enies Lobby> Marineford > Sabody  > Dressrosa > Whole Cake Island > Wano... it just really feels like a beta more than the actual finished product.",1636943314,1636945902,True,3,0,0.513079285621643066,0,True,False,False

The story mode gives you a good refresher on all the previous arcs with timely cut-scenes from each Key Point in the Anime. There are also several characters you can play as after finishing the story mode, so you won't ever get bored of using one character. I would definitely recommend maxing out at least Luffy and Kaido as it's pretty epic when you get to transform into Gear 4 or Kaido's dragon form.

With that said, One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is a far cry from being a decent Warriors game and I am increasingly disappointed that I didn't refund when I had the chance. This game is definitely more for fans of One Piece then Warriors.

The greatest sin of this game is the most vile any piece of entertainment can commit, and that is being boring. The game play relies entirely on repeatedly pommeling the same clone enemies over and over. But that isn't atypical of a warriors title. The real problem is with officer fights. They are absolutely terribly done and expectantly numerous, some levels only consisting of the player fighting an officer. 

Not only is EVERY SINGLE officer an absolutely tank that does basically nothing while you pummel them for several minutes straight but, to add to this tedium, EVERY SINGLE officer has magic shields that make them invincible until you bring them down, with, of course, more pummeling. Even then, you do so little damage that you're just constantly spamming the same attacks for minutes on end. Then, TO TOP IT ALL OFF, invincibility shields regenerate, causing the player to have to continue their ceaseless pummeling to bring them down once more to chip off another embarrassingly small bit of the enemies actual health bar.

This might sound like a small gripe to the uninitiated, but know that every map requires the defeat of numerous officers, sometimes over a dozen and each and every one requires the same exact treatment. It never changes. It was exceptionally lazy on the part of the developers and this constant throughout the game has completely killed what interest I had in the series.

While not terribly familiar with the One Piece story, I get the feeling that a GREAT deal is skipped over during the 'story mode' leading to confusion and a disinterest in that as well. Further, the character selection remains very limited, despite other characters being present and playable in other modes, which I found not only stifling but baffling.

Overall, a very disappointing experience and complete waste of time and money in my opinion. Even on a significant sale, I would not recommend this to anyone I respect.",1633359113,1633359113,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a one piece fan, I love this game and its portrayal of these beloved characters. The abilities are a great way to encapsulate one piece attacks and transformations flow smoothly into combat with great effect. 

But, this game is lacking in one way compared to the warriors games I remember from my childhood. A campaign map where I can conquer territory while fighting other commanders throughout the land. Game modes like this were the reason i got so hooked on games like samurai warriors back in the day. Unfortunately, due to the absence of this mode, the game lacks incentive to play the next level. Because I don't have that sense of progressing a campaign to eventually control this land, playing the next level inevitably begins to feel like a grind. Additionally, without this incentive, the low mission variety begins to tax even more, since most missions boil down to beat up the enemies, literally in terms of mission objective. If you enjoy slaughtering hordes of foes this is alleviated, but still an issue none the less. 

Despite all this, I would still recommend this game, at least to certain people. I would say that, in general, one piece fans will enjoy this game, and warriors fans may like it for the new abilities mechanics. Honestly, a conquest type mode would make this game perfect and I would pay for dlc to add that. Regardless, this game will still be my go to for a quick one piece fix.

As a fan of the Dynasty Warrior games, I have always been interested in the adjacent series, like Pirate Warriors, Gundam, Samurai Warriors, etc. This led me to picking up the newest One Piece Pirate Warriors game during the last Steam sale, and I have enjoyed my time with it. 

If you like huge battles, lots of playable characters and missions this could be a game I would recommend to you. On a similar note, if you are a One Piece fan ad are looking for a good One Piece game, I would definitely consider this one, as I feel it is one of the better One Piece releases.

It has engaging combat and does a good job at making its diverse cast feel very distinct from one another, but lacks long term replayability because there is no incentive to grind, or mechanism to track grinding.

Due to how grades are set permanently at the first stage clear, there's no incentive to re-do stages on different characters and difficulties to grind for the S. And due to how character progression works, you can power a character up all the way without having played them at all. These design flaws make the content in the game feel even more limited, and work against its strength of character diversity. 

It's unfortunate that Bandai neglected to at least give us a statistics page where we could see our kills etc by character; that alone would go a long way towards making it feel like you're accomplishing something when clearing stages you've already completed. As it is, it feels like the game wants me to stop playing after I've finished all the content once. DLC characters seem cool but don't address this issue or add any replayability. 

Still, it's at least 40 hours of solid fun and the combat really is well done. It could have been great, but it's still good. Highly recommended for One Piece fans.",1628721108,1628721108,True,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The game also makes some enemies feel like HP sponges. It's not as big of a deal as past entries since there are at least some size variances and special fights that mix things up here and there, but it can get tedious.

The combat feels improved generally, particularly when you get a strong enemy into a midair juggle and then pin them back onto the ground.

This game eschews leveling for what is effectively just skill trees but divvies them up with character coins, which you get through general gameplay but also through progress, so there is a natural rhythm to powering up characters where you'll unlock some, fight, and unlock a little more.

The only level is a crew rank which characters get just by attending battles, so your characters will at least build potential side by side, and if you want to level up one particular character you don't have to play AS them in order to do it. I think it's a well designed reinterpretation of Warriors leveling.

I like the cutscenes, they are mostly fairly static but the characters remain as expressive as they are in the manga and anime. Some cutscenes are changed to accommodate for the fact they don't have character models or voice actors for everyone, which is fair enough, but it feels as faithful as it can get while doing so. A lot of content from previous games is skipped so I think this pairs particularly well with 3 which is a lot more detailed about each arc in the series (PS4 version is probably best, pc is a bit broken, though definitely worth it if it's your only option.)

One particular thing I like is how skills work, you can shuffle around 4 skills on a character, and they can be attacks, effect applications, form changes, whatever. Not a lot of them have wowed me so far

The battle system's really great! much faster than the previous title.

Cons: even the characters is more than PW3, but some of character is missing. And they choose new character just for gimmick, like Germa 66, I think Reiju is enough. They should bring Jack, Apoo, Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, and Kanjuro instead. It will be more unique. Hope they will bring more DLC. The Map is more living, the environment is amazing, you have terrain now, but they don't bring every map like in PW3. I Know that in this version, every arc has some variant map, but it feel the same. With the terrain, level, and live environment they should bring Skypeia, Thriller Bark, Impel Down, and Zou. They makes Enies Lobby have many floors but it's boring, imagine they do Impel down instead. I hope they will bring update for the map. And my problem is with side characters, mini boss. I wish they bring more like Donquixote Family, Big Mom Pirates and Vice Admiral for marines.

Very abbreviated story, especially with the earlier arcs, compared to Pirate Warriors 3 so if you're looking for a primer on One Piece, this ain't it. It's a decent refresher though, hits the major points so far.
Having now finished the game I've got some more thoughts. The games story isn't very good. PW3 is a much better recap of One Piece, this games basically has Dressrosa and Whole Cake arcs, and even those feel rushed through.
Now the gameplay is good, I enjoy it very much and don't think I could go back to PW3 after playing this. However the roster is kinda disappointing. They get all the major characters in, a few are missing that were in PW3, and they added some of course. But overall, it feels a bit lackluster.
What's there is good, I like every character I've played as, and I haven't played as them all so maybe I'm just being super spoiled, but I feel like there's characters missing.
Anyway, despite these negatives my thoughts are still pretty positive, though I think I played more PW3 than I will 4, mainly cause I was achievement hunting and the achievements here are quite nice, 3's were very grindy.",1624575640,1624921600,True,1,1,0.517857193946838379,0,True,False,False

This is a fun and straightforward musou game with a good amount of playable characters. Graphics are very nice for conveying the anime artstyle, nothing like the abomination that is Jump Force. The game has three primary game modes and I haven't even gone through the first one yet which is the main story. The game's just so fun that I felt I had to drop a review already. 

But it's only really worth it if you're a fan of One Piece. This game does go through the storyline events but in an extremely condensed manner. It skips over entire arcs like East Blue, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Impel Down, Fishman Island and Punk Hazard on top of only showing the bare minimum of what happened during the arcs that it does cover. So unless you've read the manga or seen the anime, you'll have no idea what is happening and who the characters are. 

Cutscenes are also in 30fps so they look hideously out of place and choppy. A lot of the story content that has you going through dialogue boxes just looks very flat and emotionless.

- The save data is up to 6 GB , i don't know if it can growth more . hope not
- the configuration sometime chance itself
- the eyes on some of the character wont get animated (and i'm talking about you Reiju, personally)

minor 
- it has 3d model of some character (sometime even on the cut scene) , that you cannot play it in this game
- Sanji brothers maybe you can change it with more interesting character?

The visuals are a huge stepup from oppw3, the game looks amazing in terms of gameplay. However the cutscenes are just really awkward looking. One piece just does not transfer well into 3d. Atleast the animators don't put enough effort into the cutscenes in order for them to look somewhat good. 

The combat is cool, characters now have the ability to do aerial combos, expanding everyone's moveset from oppw3. However actually performing combos on any major enemy is a nightmare. You'd think that when you successfully stun an enemy you'd be able to perform a combo on them right? No, they produce a red aoe that stuns you wether they're midair or being hit. Then they go into their full force burst and if you're fighting any type of logia then have fun because they're going to be impervious to all damage despite you being in full force burst yourself or not. Additionally you can't continue your combo after dashing like you could in oppw3, in this game dash has a hitbox which is just awkward when you try to combo. It was nicer before when you could do half your combo, dash, then do the rest after the dash.

If you bought this game looking forward to playing as characters like Kaido then don't. Kaido is extremely linear when it comes to his standard form moveset. Due to the wano arc being like 4-5 episodes in when they made this game they didn't have any clue what to do with Kaido since he has only used about 2 moves in the anime at the time. In the game Kaido launches rocks, yells and belly flops. His dragon form is cool but it's EXTREMELY awkward trying to combo anyone with it due to how big he is. However Whitebeard was well done in this game. Way more fun to play than in oppw3 and he's even bigger this time around.

The story is a huge letdown from oppw3, while oppw3 was made before dressrosa finished they had to improvise on how to end the arc. They went with the ""power of friendship"" path in that game which was cringe. In this game it's the exact same, the later half of wano is a huge letdown since they just bring back all previous characters into wano for no reason at all because they have no reason what to do with the story. They don't even feature important characters like Tama in the story which is one of Luffy's main driving forces to actually fight Kaido. In my opinion they should've released the game after wano is finished or just not include an unfinished arc in the story. 

Speaking of arcs, They skipped the entire East Blue storyline and the first mission starts directly in Alabasta, they skip a bunch of arcs for no apparent reason making the story feel very clunked up together. 

If you want to play this for the co-op then I don't recommend it. The online might as well not exist. When i bought this game i got it because one of my friends also bought it so i wanted to play together with him. I expected us to be able to do combos together and use teamwork to our advantage, turns out that online  is extremely desynced when it comes to fighting any enemy that isn't a minion. 

In conclusion this game was a letdown for me, takes like 30 hours of gameplay to complete the story and about another 30 to complete the treasure log stories, which is just more improvised cringy storylines. Not worth 50 euros",1623432127,1623707614,False,241,13,0.764115452766418457,7,True,False,False

great game, dialogue scenes look kinda ugly but gameplay is really nice, fun and addicting.

Edit after another 20 hours: The game is really good if you only consider the gameplay. I assume only one piece fans will consider this but I want to highlight that you should ONLY consider purchasing if you have watched/read One Piece. Originally I said the dialogue scenes look kinda ugly, this is still true but they are also executed worse as you progress through the game. Iconic quotes are changed, 5 minute scenes are rushed into 2 seconds, characters no longer exist (resulting in scenes being changed like Flampe's needle being shot by a chess guard or the scene not existing at all - King Riku is not in this game, so looking back Dressrosa has a very vague ending.)
To contrast from this, considering the gameplay itself I've really enjoyed this. This is potentially my favourite Hack & Slash game.

Edit after finishing Wano arc: It had a nice start but goes downhill. It was really interesting to play through the arc at the start due to it being non canon and not knowing what will happen, and the start does bring some hype with returning characters. However it feels rushed, short and doesn't feel that much thought has been put into it. This arc is joint shortest levels of any arc along with Alabasta for 5 levels, with the remaining few arcs having 6 (Enies, Marineford, Saboady) and WCI having 7. Mid arc feels repetitive and confusing, the levels end up just being fight the same Kaido/Big Mam pirates over and over until the final boss fight (which was a walk in the park, he didn't really attack you at all.) This leaves an unsatisfying ending, where Wano is free but no luxurious celebration occurs, just a normal, generic banquet outdoors. Alongside this, the ending does not feel amazing as the only Kozuki present are Momonuske and Kinemon.

I currently have this remaining at reccomended as throughout the game, majorly the gameplay has been amazing and given me the most joy out of a Hack and Slash game. However, this recommendation depends on if you are willing to only judge the game through its gameplay and if the game is on a large sale (I picked this up for about £15.99, no more should be payed.)",1620005131,1623547505,True,4,3,0.557495474815368652,0,True,False,False

One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 improves over its sequel with some key combat refinements that make the core '1vX' combat loop more addictive than ever.

+ Increased mobility

+ Aerial Combat

+ Variety in special moves and ability to bring up to 4 simultaneously in battle

+ Greater sense of scale with ""Giant"" characters and destructible environments

+ Massive roster

- Re-used cutscenes

- Story quality hasn't improved despite a new generation and a smaller quantity of covered storylines

- Tons of mid combat notifications that are annoying and can't be disabled

The changes they made have been interesting and some are good and others not so much in my own opinion. I've currently only cleared Alabasta area so far, so I dont know if you can swap allies mid combat later or not. But I don miss that feature. Changes I liked though was the ability wheel that you can use to change out skills as well as the character maps that you can use the coins you get to upgrade your group overall or focus on a character.  Providing the bigger enemies with shields definitely provides some extra difficulty but not much that it made me want to swap from normal mode.

Likes:
- They upgrading (or reworking?) aerial battle works much better than i thought, especially for Speed and Sky type character. It makes the combat much faster, feels like a dbz fight when you juggle and move the enemy around with those aerial combos. And the aerial fight actually suits the character like Sanji, Marco, Vinsmokes brother, Crocodile, etc
- Giant unit are hella fun. They felt so strong and can clear those higher difficulty mission easier. The destructible environment also helps in making them feels more powerful
- The new upgrade and skill system also feels nice. Help yourself by not watching the moveset from Youtube. It is part of the fun to wonder what kind of move you can unlock from the skill map.
- The cutscene looks clean, you can feel the upgrade from Pirate Warrior 3

Dislikes:
- Half of the new unit are locked behind DLC. You can get vinsmoke brothers and sisters, kaido, bigmom, katakuri, carrot, kidd with the basegame. But other supernovas, sweet commanders, wano characters are locked behind dlcs (which i don't really mind buying when discount)
- No costume for wholecake island nami, despite her being a big contributor in the arc. And in general, the costume just seems lacking
- Wholecake island is supposed to be the new big arc that they can implement fully following the anime since Pirate Warrior 3, but the execution seems a bit lackluster. No Crackers fight, no Smoothies, no Djinn dude. I'm not demanding them to be playable, but they definitely need to shows at least as enemies
- The campaign starts from pre-timeskip as far as Arabasta arc, which i think won't be needed anymore. Yes Arabasta and Ennies Lobby arc is really cool, but we have saved vivi and robin in the previous game (which also more fleshed out). There's no point in doing that again, and should just focused on making new world stuff better.


Final verdict:
- The progress for character feels fun, the new mechanic (aerial combos and giant unit) are hella fun, and makes it different from previous game. Definitely worth buying it.
- Don't pirate it since it unlocks everything iirc, which takes half of the fun away
- The issue mentioned in ""Dislike"" is quite annoying. So for best value, just buy it when discount (but when it's in discount, go buy the DLC. I think the DLC characters are fun and the price is actually justified)",1621670194,1621670194,True,7,0,0.601430714130401611,0,True,False,False

The One Piece series is represented well here. The characters look and sound incredible. Their move sets are hilarious and true to their presentation in the anime more or less. In this game you will play through the following arcs: Arabasta, Enies Lobby, Marineford (just the battle, not the prison breakout), Dressrosa (Really just the birdcage, the colosseum is minimized, and a missed opportunity), Whole Cake Island, and Wano Country. Arcs inbetween and around those played through are covered in a voice over montage between Islands. 

There are a wide array of characters and costumes for the characters to spice up your visuals and play styles. The advancement for the characters and their abilities is rewarding and fun, I can see it being a bit grindy towards the end. 

The music in the game is... 'fine'. With so much amazing music from the show, there are just a lot of missed opportunities to incorporate it here. The additional music pack that they are selling for $17-$20 USD is absurd, and it should be included. I read some reviews where that music had some issues as well, but they appear to have been resolved (the music didn't loop, it does now)

So, I recommend this game with a caveat: You really need enjoy the game play of the Dynasty Warriors games and One Piece to get value here.  It captures the madcap and wild adventures of the One Piece crew, and the massive crowd battles really seem to fit - The ""Deluxe"" edition simply includes all of the character DLC packs, so if your interest in those characters is low, you can likely skip it for the base game, and be perfectly happy.",1620155874,1620155874,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I still highly recommend this game, and anyone who has read my OPPW3 review knows why.  PW4 does an amazing job of taking the mechanics of Warriors games and changing them up to be unique and fun again, with the changes to super moves being the most welcome of the lot. Allowing up to four player selected moves to be available, with form changing and self heals on the list for many characters, is a huge step forward for the genre. The varied maps, changes to the way territory works, and dash gauge all add to the fast paced, frenetic fun of this game. Combine that with an awesome cast, both base and DLC offerings, and you have a solid and fun brawler worth its weight in Beli.

The one, and only gripe I have, is the fact that it cuts so many great arcs out of the story, jumping so far forward in the One Piece timeline and skipping over so many battles and characters that it ends up being only half as long as the janky, busted game that came before it. But if the next installment of the series can somehow merge 4's fast paced and solid mechanics, as well as excellent porting, with 3's sheer depth of content, then PW5 would become the definitive edition of this storied franchise. One can only hope for such an outcome.",1616128445,1620051863,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Different set of playable characters. Including Sanji's siblings, big mom, kaido.

-Combat in general looks different to opw3.

As for the DLC i highly recommend all 3 available DLCs because of Smoothie, Urouge, and Kozuki Oden! Not only does this excite me to play characters that weren't given much love in the anime, but it wants me to watch the anime again to pay attention to all characters as well!

Overall highly recommend this game!

Pros
+ Dash Cancels, Air Combos and Big Damage to the Environment
+ Great Character Models
+ Mega-Church of Katakuri Approved
+ Co-op is Solid
+ Big Mom and Kaido are BIG!!!
+ It has that Lego Star Wars vibe of defeating a boss, and then getting to Free Play as them.
+ BIG MONKE LUFFY VS GIANT LIZARD KAIDO is a good final battle for this game.

Cons
- This game skips a few arcs (Skypiea, Fishman Island, pretty much all of East Blue.) It does recap events that aren't playable, and focuses more on the major battles within the series.
- This game is also really quick to beat your first time through, and there isn't much replay value outside of mastering different characters and 
- The Boss Armor is ANNOYING! It only pads out the fight, and can easily break the flow of combat when it recharges. Not as big of an issue in the late game, but by that point it's a grind to surpass.
- Invisible Walls where you think you should be able to jump, and the maps tend to be bigger than needed - especially when a mission-important ally needs help from the other side of the battlefield.
- I miss the Crew Attacks from 3... being able to have the crew line up and unleash a Combination Finisher on the Bosses really hyped-up the fights.

OVERALL
Gameplay - B (Only repetitive if you don't do combos on the plot important enemies. There is a lot of impact with the Supers, but you do have to grind in order to start One Punch styling on enemies. Controls feel good, Camera never fights, but the boss battle armor can get annoying if you aren't learning air combo tech.)
Story - EH (Watch/Read One Piece, this game doesn't flesh out all the characters)
Music - SSS (I highly enjoyed the remix of the returning OST in this game series.)
Graphics - Anime +

BOTTOM LINE
If you are already a fan of One Piece, and enjoy the Warrior-style gameplay... then I recommend giving this installment a try. I still recommend 3 as the starting point of the Pirate Wars series, since 1 and 2 were just full-priced Betas back in the day. For a PROPER One Piece game experience, I still want a game where you sail around and can fully explore islands - needs more inspiration from Black Flag and the Caribbean in KH3, or even P5S!",1617250181,1617250304,True,41,1,0.790820896625518799,0,True,False,False

To get the cons out of the way, it misses out a handful of characters from the earlier games because it does not cover their arcs in the main story mode. Actually, that's the only con I can think of...Oh, actually, the game's final arc, in Wano is fun because it's pretty wacky, but it's not a particularly good story.

But as for pros, it makes up for those missing characters with some 15 or more different ones, which can be SO much fun to play as! It's so satisfying playing as each of Big Mom's Sweet Three, or each of Sanji's brothers (whose play-styles are varied in the game - I may not remember which name belongs to who, but I certainly remember their different moves!) Also, Katukiri is a boss. And each of the Worst Generation. Secondly, and SUPER random, but I thoroughly enjoy the new ""jumping"" mechanic, and it really does make it feel much more like the One Piece of the manga/anime.

Also, the giants really do FEEL like giants, and they are absolute power-houses in the game: Kaido, Big Mom, Jack, Sengoku and Whitebeard all feel physically imposing when you come up against them in a random match, and their strength corresponds with that, you have to employ a lot more skill when dealing with them.

A lot of people complain about the game not being very ""long"", but they only seem to be addressing the main storyline. At nearly fifty hours I still haven't even played all of the missions (the main story took me around 18 hours). What is also fun in the main story is that you get to pick very different characters (so not merely the straw hats, but others who were involved in the events, like playing as Ace or Whitebeard at the battle of Marineford), which is a heap of fun. Of course, you get the chance to go back and play every level with anyone you want, but these were especially touching.

With so many characters and such good gameplay, I would strongly recommend the game, whether you like One Piece (or Koei games) or not.

Putting myself in the shoes of these characters is a truly life-changing experience.

This game instead opts for expertly crafted cutscenes with beautifully rendered 3D models of the character you love, and lines of dialogue plastered along the bottom of the screen during battle. Battle binds one another and I have now battled with all the One Piece greats. From having played this game, I can proudly say that I UNDERSTAND the motivations of characters such as Big Mom, Kaido, Blackbeard, etc. No medium other than games can give you this truly in depth feeling of connection to a character because no other medium will literally place you in the characters shoes.

Aight lemme start with the positives: The story in general is honestly pretty decent it takes you through [b] main [/b] parts in each arc of one piece from the east blue to the grand line (Alabasta --> Wano Country) are accompanied with great missions which reflect the story. The music slaps, every one of the tracks fits the theme at hand. The movesets and abilities are unique for each playable character. There is Co-op missions so playing with friends makes missions a lot more fun. 

So, now we move on to some negatives: For the games price i would recommend if you enjoy the One Piece story and its characters the game would be a perfect fit in your steam library but if you know nothing about the story and just looking for another musou game this accomplishes that too but i would recommend getting it on a steam sale either way. Second point, your favourite character could have a weak unreliable playstyle or moveset, most of the main characters in the game such as Luffy, Zoro and Sanji have great movesets which are fun when playing but people like Chopper, Franky, Urouge and surprisingly Crocodile i have found to have very gimmicky underpowering movesets. The camera when using gear 4 Luffy or really fast sky type characters can be faulty at times.

All in all a great musou One Piece game I would rate it a 7/10.

As a Warriors game, it's pretty good and probably one of the best looking and most streamlined ones I've played. I'll admit, I haven't played a Warriors game in so long, with my personal favorite being Dynasty Warriors 4 with the Extreme Legends expansion pack on the PlayStation 2. But it's good to see this particular genre extending to various franchises, such as One Piece and even Legend of Zelda.

If you're expecting dynamic gameplay, you're looking at the wrong game. However, the monotonous action is GREATLY alleviated by the massive roster of characters! Each one plays completely different than the last, and all have varied combos that keep the combat fresh despite the repetitious fighting. These characters are split into four types: Power, Speed, Technique, and Sky. Power is straightforward, focusing on outward brawling and jumping into the fray with powerful combos. Speed's definitely about dashing about using the ""power dash"", unleashing quick combos. Technique is quite hard for me to get used to, focusing a lot on abilities that lay traps or inflict status effects, with normal attacks not being as effective as the combos and abilities ( which allow you to bring groups of enemies closer to you ). Sky does what it says on the box, it's all about air combos and flying from enemy to enemy unleashing attacks, with much less focus on ground combos. It's really fun collecting characters, leveling up their strength, and mastering their capabilities. This is a One Piece fan's dream come true, because anyone who's anyone is here! From my personal favorite Trafalgar Law, to complete badass powerhouses such as Whitebeard, you can't go wrong with the roster.

Like any other Warriors game, the gameplay is exactly as you expect. Missions pit different forces against each other in fairly diverse locales, and different events happen to throw variety into the mix. It's repetitive, but cozy and relaxing, with some tense moments. Unlike the Warriors games I'm used to, you can't just defeat every ""officer"" and suddenly win. There is some level of strategy at play, and it's up to you to choose whether an optional objective is more important or to go rescue an allied officer in trouble. Allied officers can actually win fights, and don't always need babysitting, depending on what mission you play and on what difficulty. This is probably one of the few Warriors games where it feels like you absolutely need everyone in order to win, and you aren't just a powerhouse who can win the entire battle on your own, especially on hard mode where you need every ally you can get. It's a legit challenge, and I'm pleased that it ditched the stupid systems of the past. Dynasty Warriors 4 was so good, but it often felt too easy to win once you closed every reinforcement gate and defeated every single optional officer to lower enemy morale. There is no morale system in Pirate Warriors 4, meaning that victory is about achieving objectives or striking specific targets rather than blowing away every enemy officer.

I'm very impressed with the amount of love and content put into this game. You can tell that the developers love One Piece, including all of the most iconic moments in the ""Dramatic Log"" story mode which acts as your campaign. I'm often left wondering ""WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE?!"" when I look at these generic pirate armies allied with Luffy and his comrades, but the story does a fantastic job recapping the anime for you without you needing to even watch ( or rewatch ) the dauntingly huge anime. Well, for the most part. Other modes including ""Treasure Log"", which is a fantastic mode featuring all sorts of fun missions. These missions act as alternate reality ""What if THIS happened..."" scenarios. They are an excellent way to earn coins ( a fun currency featuring little images on them ) and Berries ( in game currency ) to level up your characters outside of the main Dramatic Log. ""Free Log"" on the other hand allows you to play any mission with whoever you like, from what I can tell. Dramatic Log is very restrictive with who you can play as per mission, after all.

The amount of content will keep you coming back for more, and wanting to collect everything, including leveling up the quite enjoyable ""Growth Map"" progression system for each character. There's a Growth Map that powers all characters up, and then there's personal unique Growth Maps for individual characters. This system is fun because each stat, ability, or skill is represented by tiny little islands upon an ocean. I found this a really cute and thematic progression system, with some abilities being more meaningful rather than straight power increases. Such as upgrades that grant new combos, and entirely new skills. I mean, I enjoy straight power increases, but it's sometimes hard to tell when I'm playing on Hard mode! Believe me, that difficulty mode will kick your ass! You're going to need every point of health and attack power you can get!

What else is there to say? Well, I like the music sometimes and it sounds very One Piece, and other times it sounds like royalty free tunes. The voice acting is good if set to Japanese with English subtitles, which is what the game appears to be at by default anyway. Is it me, or is EVERYONE here? And I mean every Japanese voice actor for One Piece? Other than sounds, I wish the combat was more satisfying and chunky, when I slash at my enemies with Zoro it doesn't really sound enough like I'm really CUTTING into some fools. This problem persists for many characters, but luckily it helps that buildings or objects get destroyed in satisfying ways as you rampage around. I'd still say that Dynasty Warriors 4 has the most satisfying combat, with meaty metallic weapon sounds as they land on your enemies. It's a trivial thing, yes, but it often feels like the hits aren't as satisfying as they could be ( in Pirate Warriors 4 ). Maybe it's because they are often overpowered by other sounds, and even the music? As for the visuals, they are pretty good looking for a genre that is often ugly as sin and low fidelity. Unfortunately, you do get plenty of muddy textures, and low polygon details sometimes. But the characters themselves look straight out of the anime, for the most part. I'm not going to complain when the Warriors franchise doesn't deliver good visuals most of the time, I welcome these colorful and decent graphics!

Well, that's all I have to say. If you're a One Piece fan, this game is an absolute must!",1613734772,1613820857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do give it - points for not having remote play together feuture and you will need parsec to play it together, but it actually does it fine for this game. There is also online in case you have a friend whit an extra copy, but why bother when you can use parsec.

Graphics are pretty good, and i like details like the hand drawn shadow underneath frankys clothes whenever you see him running. Quite a bit of characters as well and you can unlock all of em pretty simple. A pretty nice skill tree whit some specific touches like for ex some moves from ace are only unlocked after you get his hat coin which you get after his death.

Ost is okey but sadly the anime themes are too expensive and well they are horribly looped as in not at all.

i give it a 7,5/10 it is a really well done game, but the fact that some characters cant transform and get that as an ultimate move rather then a transformation like carrot franky and so on takes a point away and the fact you need to use parsec for online local play and that the dlcs are quite pricy lower it as well, all in all get it when it is in discount unless you really wanna play it just go for deluxe edition as it got everything but the extra ost and warriors outfits which look dope btw.

The game does a great job at making (most) of the characters available feel utterly broken. The campaign feels fairly short, though I suspect it will take longer to complete for someone that's new to the series.

The in-game story only skims through the One Piece story. You will miss out on a lot of detailed plot if you haven't watched the anime.

The game itself is quite easy, especially once you start to fill out your character's map and you become much stronger. In my opinion, the old levelling system in Pirate Warriors 3 felt more rewarding than the levelling map we have now. I especially liked the old level break feature that encouraged players to farm for specific content to reach max level. The system in PW4 is similar, but doesn't have the same kick as actual levels did.

The new Treasure Log has thorough replayability, though it does feel repetitive after a while. I personally preferred the Dream Log from Pirate Warriors 3, with all the different routes to choose from. Almost 30 hours in and I've still got a long way to go before fully completing the game.

It's really satisfying to beat up hundreds of enemies, and see your favorite characters in action. In the Dramatic Log, there's a chapter for most important arcs. I'm a little bummed that there isn't Punk Hazard though lol. There's also the Treasure Log, which is fun to collect berries and coins from. Characters feel unique from one another, so if one character doesn't fit your play style you can always play from the many other characters that might.
There are some things that make the game frustrating, like the map designs. It's really easy to get lost, and sometimes I find myself running back and forth trying to find where I'm supposed to go. With how spread out your allies can be sometimes, it's hard to run and help them if they're struggling. There's a lot going on at once, which can be hard to manage. Split-screen co-op is really hard to focus on and can be easy to miss sub-missions. You can pause the game to view things like your missions and allies in more detail, but it's really annoying to keep having to pause the game to see what's going on. The pause menu is easy to navigate though, so it's not a huge pain.

- the two new arcs (Whole Cake  and Wano) are way to short with just 6 missions each)
- many important chars of that two arc are left out and only available as DLC (means they do not pop up in story mode)
- collecting specific medals is tedious as hell
- the TREASUR LOG missions are boring, unimaginativ and only serve to stretch the game further
- Logia power users are way over powered when they are in their elemental form (immun to damage)

The graphics of the character models are similar, but they are touched up and more expressive. The new lighting also makes the models and graphics stand out from the previous entry. The environments have been given a big overhaul making them match the environments from the source more closely. Also, the stages are BIG, much larger than I expected given the demo. The game is missing some arcs but for the story content they do have its far more fleshed out than in the previous game, with more scenes and no still images talking to each other. The animations for the scenes and combat are also improved, making it look and feel much more smooth.

The combat has seen an overhaul from the previous games, it feels very similar but fresh. When you first it might feel a bit more limited, and that's because it is, but as you progress and unlock more combos and skills, the depth really starts to shine through. The combo's still flow similar to the previous game, but the unique action skill is gone, replaced with specials that allow you to equip 4 at a time. Heavy combos have also somewhat been replaced with the heavy button now working similar to unique action from the previous game, but still holds its function as a combo extender from light attacks.

The game has also changed the quick dashes from the previous game to a new button and attached a stamina meter to it, allowing you to dash even farther and still use it to extend combos. Now the game includes a jump button and air combos to help further spice up the combat, its a nice welcome and helps it all feel and flow more smooth.

The game loosely follows the plot of the manga/anime (loosely = skipping the filler and abridging most of the important events) and adds ""what if"" scenarios to the mix via another game mode.

Leveling characters can be a bit tedious, because the game's coin system makes you grind more than just a few battles to get the rarest of coins. Money won't be as big of a problem. 

As a musician, I really appreciate the soundtrack. There are nice rock beats, a hint of metal and exceeding amounts of funky flavor in it. It really packs a punch and just makes you listen to it. I've sometimes just stopped fighting to listen to the BGM, it's really good!

While Pirate Warriors 3 was a great musou game with a coat of One Piece on it, Pirate Warriors 4 is a OP fandom jerk off with a mediocre musou game attached. The same OP fans that will celebrate not having lesser characters in the game but will suck Oda's balls after expending three whole chapters in some tertiary character's flashback.

First problem is the garbage story mode it has. PW4 has chapters focusing on an arc with several levels dedicated to it, it sounds good on paper but the levels are pitifully short (In the Alabasta arc two of those levels were 1v1 with Crocodile), lack unlockables, side challenges, etc.
PW3 had one major arena level condensing an arc; they were big, challenging and with a lot of side stuff in them. Not to mention PW3 had one of those arena levels for every arc (up to date). PW4 doesn't even acknowledges East Blue, Skypea and many other things.
Just to put it into perspective Alabasta was 5% of the content in PW3 and 20% of PW4 story mode.
Character models and graphics don't look that much better than PW3 and while the level assets look better they are reused a lot more as well.
Some levels drag on and on making you do the same thing over and over. The Shabondy level for example consists of dozens of minutes of fighting pacifistas over and over. It also features an optional fight with Kizaru; wich in PW3 was challenging and unlocked special items when beaten, here it just gives you a message saying ""Kizaru has recovered, please run away"".
Lastly, they ignored huge chunks of the actual series and instead put a lot of effort into that garbage fanfiction at the end. Wich of course has to include every character ever conceived by the series and turns out it has all been some Kurohige's plot, just like PW3's Dressrosa (except there it was only 5% of the whole story mode). Nobody cares about that, go to deviant art if you're so eager to write trash; your fanfictions suck. I can't stress enough how cringe inducing this fanfiction is. It's cute that they think they can write because they add little cutscenes every five minutes as if this garbage has any value. 

Tea party from hell! has to be the worst designed level in history, i'm convinced nobody tested it properly. You have to constantly deal with Katakuri wich can basically kill you in two hits (more proof this whole thing is just to jerk off OP fans) and it shows how bad the targeting system is; ""oh, did you want to lock on the hyper powerful gary stu that's murdering you? not the generic soldier next to it?"" The only way i found to beat it was using Brook's broken healing skill (i'm playing on hard though, so maybe it's not shit in lesser difficulties?).
Levels are horribly designed in general with a lot of cliffs and ramps where half of the time you can jump/drop from and half the time have force walls. It's specially annoying since enemies are blown away after every combo team rocket style completely breaking the pace of the combat, you can chain it a bit but the game has some stupid stamina mechanic for that as well; I guess for the desperate souls that want some online balance in this dumpster fire?
Another issue are the stupid npcs. A lot of missions require certain npcs to reach an area but they just get stuck watching the fucking scenery while you have to fight extremely powerful enemies that revive after a minute! And keep in mind that is the only real different objective other than beat X and is not even properly working?
You can notice how much they cared about fanservice during the Katakuri fight. Instead of simply giving you a new tool (Snakeman) and letting you figure the boss, they interrupt the fight with power ups and cutscenes to make it accurate to the series! Who the fuck cares! You do understand that people buying this already watched the series right? That fight is shit from the start, Katakuri does so much damage that it's ridiculous and the power ups seem to show whenever they want. Maybe they are expecting you to dodge as if you were playing Dark Souls or something but instead of understandable patterns you have to deal with random cum shots from the floor and attacks that can hit you from the other side of the map at bullet speed.

Next issue are the ginormous characters. Sure they are more accurate to the size they have in the series (wich in itself tends to be quite inconsistent) but for fuck sake there's a reason why PW3 kept them around the same scale! You end up so away from the action that becomes really dull, everything you fight is just a miniature figurine with no characteristics. Jesus christ create a fun game instead of pandering to OP fans!
When fighting against giant characters your biggest enemy is the camera (ironically), it has no clue what to do. It doesn't keep your character in frame, gets stucked against walls and that's when your character isn't stuck inside the giant enemy model. At this point i'm just wondering why couldn't they just use the same fucking game as before and improve a lot of stuff (unless they did, in wich case kudos on how much effort you required to fuck it up).
And you think characters will behave different when fighting a giant character or a miniature one? Of course not, giant character will swing their weapons in the air and the small playmobile enemies will get hit anyway, all giant characters are is a bag with more hit points and a bigger hit box.

Another thing is the character types. In paper sounds good, assign each character a different type (power, speed, sky, etc) but what ends up happening is that characters of a similar type end up feeling similar. In PW3 each character was unique and the lack of customization forced you to adapt to that character (wich made them more varied and fun to experiment with) while here since you can customize everything, characters become really bland and samey to play as (in a game that's already quite repetitive).
Sky characters are specially stupid since they hover above everyone when powered up wich makes your skills and attacks miss enemies half the time (and you're crazy if you think enemies won't be able to hit you during that time).
Let me tell you about the special skills, they are as everything else fucked. There's some sort of classification for them i guess; well there's different types of icons at least but they don't mean anything as far as i could tell. Half of the time they can't kill even the simplest enemies. Worst, since even the most basic elite has a shield and they can stagger you, most of the time your skill gets canceled and can't even repel the enemies a bit.

The shield mechanic is pure garbage, nothing more to add to that.
 
There's too much character moments from the series inserted as cutscenes instead of just giving the story basics, wich makes no sense. Think about it, if you're a OP fan you wouldn't care about the story bits (you've probably already read the manga, watch the anime, seen youtube shorts, etc) but how the story is adapted to this type of game. Meanwhile if you're a musou fan you couldn't follow the story because it's completely disjointed!
Let me tell you, the cutscenes in this game are so stupid and cringe inducing, it's One Piece as interpreted by the head injury ward patients. Why they waste so much time and money in those is ridiculous.

Here's a gripe i have with both entries. If you already have a lot of characters modeled, voiced and mechanically sound enough to be fighting against, why not go the extra mile and make them playable!? There has to be around 100+ characters in the game and only around half of them playable, it's dumb.

In conclusion if you want a good musou go and play Pirate Warriors 3, otherwise go and play Senran Kagura for a mediocre musou with more fanservice (considering the state of One Piece is around the same level).",1608940192,1610236933,False,2,0,0.495473235845565796,2,True,False,False

When I first saw this game, I was so excited, and even playing it made me remember all the great moments through the arcs, and bringing back memories. Too bad they didn't include all the arcs. I would of loved to play the east blue arc, as well as skypea and all the other ones. But they did include really good arcs too, even the original wano arc made up by them. One problem I have with the game is, that there isn't a big selection of costumes. The pre time skip nami, chopper, robin, and franky characters aren't playable, just the post time skip. Those aren't really a big problem, but still something I always think about. The rest of the game feels really nice, and is very much playable. In the first 2 days, I have spent 20 hrs on this game, which is quite something, cause not many games can grab my attention right away. I love all the characters, and their abilities are just like in the anime. Which makes me happy. Some more characters could of been added though. For example, to just name a few.

I would rank them both at 1 because each is doing stuff better than the other one. 4 is more to just play 2-3 rounds when u want to play a oppw title because the gameplay is much better than in 3 and u can play Kaido big mom, cavendish etc. And that u can select diffrent abilities and playstil with characters is super cool as well! 3 has kuma eneru and garp which i would love to have in 4 :( and the missions and maps are better. that u play every island in the story and battle against every antagonist is simple but gold!^^ And 3 has wayyyyy more late game content. To get all achivments u need like (as a newby) around 100 hrs! in 4 its just 25 and after that its just replaying the lvls cause u want to test out new chars and stuff. In 3 there are actually missions u have to do for every level where u have to do stuff like ""with zoro kill Mr.1"" so u have to replay the level with diffrent chars. 4 doesnt have that. Its harder to get an S rating in missions but that isnt as a satisfing reason to replay missions...I would recommend both but 3 as HUUGGEE problems on pc!!!! I played it on ps3 and it ran perfectly! On pc u have to remove folders to play the last mission and stuff like that. If u want a grindy game where u can insert 100+ hrs buy 3. If u want a shorter game with focus on combat and playable chars like big mom kaido katakuri etc. buy 4!",1606838784,1608115290,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although personally I wouldn't get it unless it were on discount. Now don't get me wrong it's a great game. It feels nice it looks and sounds nice. However in terms of content there isn't really much there besides grinding maps. (Which is upgrading characters.) Granted getting new characters tossed in now and then is great however that being said it still severly lacks content. No new maps, no new scenarios, Nothing. Once you beat story mode and treasure voyage. That's it game is over there is nothing else but the grind.

 Playing with a friend however can help make it a little less repetitive. I've had some funny moments. ""Oh man! Kaido just got straight up slapped down by Ussop!"" . They really need to add new content at some point or else it's just going to get boring and repetitive and people are going to leave. Granted as an enormus onepiece fan as well as dynasty warriors and warriors orochi I love this type of game so I would never leave.

Edit: After seeing all the dlc coming out. Still hoping for a Mink Themed DLC. Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, pedro. Hype is real.

I hope they add more maps and scenarios soon. The game is MASSIVELY to short. So in recap. Do I recomend this game? Absolutely! Do I recomend the game full price of 60$ Absolutely, NOT!

The addition of aerial combat and verticality to the different maps makes combat much more interesting. Apart from that, gameplay is not so different from PW3. 

Too many arcs have been eliminated, the game starts at alabasta, skips skypiea, water 7, thriller bark, punk hazard... It breaks the story apart. More work has been put into the features arcs though. PW3 is way better if you want to relive most of the story, but still there is no one piece game that goes as far as DBZ:Kakarot for example (the story is not nearly as big in DBZ though). 

Online is nonexistent, if you have a friend to play then cool, else consider it a single player game. I literally could only play once thanks to a stroke of luck (I guess absence of players...). 

No new game modes have been added, you could consider it a refresh of PW3.
Summarizing, gameplay is really nice, the featured arcs are worked on and graphics/sound have stepped up from the previous game. If you liked PW3 or have a friend to play with, go for it!",1607009298,1607032832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I waited 5 years to see this beauty reach the level it is now, just magnificent. Wonderful graphics, updated and more fun gameplay, giant maps and more minions compared to the third game. The game is simply sensational and I could not disagree with that, but of course not everything is perfect unfortunately, the few things I would have to complain about in the 4 game in the franchise are minimal things that in my opinion are simply laziness of the developers. To have taken away arcs, characters, not have added more npcs as bosses (seriously you only put Diamante and Pica as the members of the donquixote family).
A giant map like that and you don’t put the complete donquixote family, you don’t put Daifuku and Oven as bosses on Wholecake Island, I could mention several npcs that you could have added to this game, you could have added. Another fact that also upset me with this game (and that disappointed me so much because it was a simple thing to do as something unnecessary to have removed) is the fact that they took off various costumes from the characters, akainu without his new world costume (he had in the third game, no need to remove) I expected to update this costume and bring his scars and his white navy costume. Kizaru's new world costume (which he also had in the third game), did not update the new world smoker costume for his navy coat (seriously he doesn't even look like a vice admiral without that, they put it on the World Seeker, why not put it on Also here).
And several other characters who had their costumes removed or had no new costumes added relevant to the arcs they were on, aside from that part that left me down, the main problem was that the game was very fast, fast to finish the Dramatic Log, Free Log and Treasure Log, compared to the third game it sins a lot, there is a lack of content in this fourth game, I have 113 hours of PW3 and I didn't even reach 20% of the Nightmare Log, and in less than 80 hours I finished 100% of everything related to the current content of that game, I hope they add more content, because otherwise this game will die easy and fast.

The game is just like any other Warriors game with the typical wave of enemies that you have to beat, so it can be slightly repetitive in that nature, but if you're a fan of that genre then you have nothing to worry about. 

This game does skip a few arcs throughout the series of One Piece, so certain characters aren't in it, and there's only 7 arcs that get played in this game with a couple being tied together. However if you've played any of the other Pirate Warriors games then you'll already be expecting that. Also it comes with it's own original ending to the game since the current arc they are on isn't finished yet.

Someone who's new to one piece story and this is you'r first touch to the series it may be a downside.

All in all the game provided a pleasant experience as almost all the characters had well made skill trees and were fun to mess around but some characters were a big disappointment.
Chopper was a big let down because i would have loved to see his monster point in action but it isn't even in the game. This although didn't ruin the game for me not at all, it was a lot of fun.

But a big negative was also that they released the dlc characters way too late because as for me i had finished the game by the time they started releasing these new characters.

 If you aren't an one piece fan, this game is also good at reducing your stress. The game isn't hard to play, and all you have to do is smash your keyboard hard.
 One thing to keep in mind is that the main focus of this game isn't fully on plot. Some plots get deleted. and some plots are different than manga. Make sure not to play too long and finish the game quickly. bcs unlike most single player games that have long plots. oppw4 is kinda short. after finishing all the plots, all you can do is leveling characters to maximum level.

So, i've played the third game, because it's a great nostalgia trip for me, and i thought i'd give number 4 a try.
Played a bit of the campaign, a bit of the treasure log, and called it a day. I thought it was pretty great.
So i go to menu --> exit game

next time, it was time to start over. I mean, like from the beginning. From scratch. The game didn't remember anything. Chapter 1, part 1, no upgrades, treasure log is still locked. It was 3.5 hours down the drain.

The new aerial combo mechanics are neat and open up cool combo opportunities but I feel that the character types like technique and sky need a little work, characters like Chopper and Robin are just as not fun to play as Luffy or Katakuri and Sky types like Sanji can feel difficult to control as I am way higher than the enemy a lot of the time and can't connect any of my attacks. 

Levelling up characters is a fair bit of a grind as well and it's not helped by the smaller amount of end game content compared to what Pirate Warriors 3 had, hopefully some mission packs get included soon to add some more meat to the game.

------------------------------------
Is in my opinion not only the best one piece game on the market.
But also on of the best musou titles out there.

As a fan of the Manga series and anime, this game does justice to this franchise.
The amount of content is huge and will give you hours of enjoyment.

The combat is improved to PW3 and is one of the best in the musou genre.
The world IS one piece and its awesome to visit these maps and slash 1000 of enemies.

Its a fun and fantastic game. And its a must have for One piece or Musou fans.
I have played hundreds of hours in these types of games and it warms my hearth that Koei blew it out of the water with this title. Not just because its a good musou, but also because it combines it with the One Piece franchise in a phenominal way.

So 4 is super fun and has some great ideas, sadly those ideas in a weird way ended up being a step backwards, especially for the hardest stuff, okay so for starters the balance has been broken once again, some characters are just too good to use while others not so much, even with the new special attack system where you can press R1 and one of the space buttons for a special attack there are some moves that are just poor, especially with how the new system works for battle, you see all ""enemies"" have super armour now, it can be broken but until it does they are free to interrupt your attacks at their leisure, this becomes a major issue on harder fights in the treasure log and can even be a hassle normally as the damage at times even when decently levelled up is rather high and health drops are extremely low, this can be mitigated...at the cost of attack as there are skills that allow you to heal over time that you can equip but they take two whole slots, it's a give and take situation where your time score if that's important to you is going to suffer, the old system had some invulnerability going on for characters who powered up but that was at least temporary and only happened once, here it can happen multiple times not only allowing for them to recover their meter but gaining an insane defence boost making for some fights to be more of a chore than fun dood.

next is power up types, there are more than a few which are honestly poor, so here we'll cover the four base types, Power, speed, Sky and purple...because I can't remember what it was actually called XD still power, speed and purple are great, they all have their perks, boosted speed, seemingly a damage boost too but sky? sky is a cool concept but suffers because it makes it harder to hit...well anyone, especially boss types, it even has the flaw of the fact that it takes you a while to fall because you can be pretty high up, it also took away from Sanji's original fighting style that was pretty awesome in 3 that allowed you to basically jump to the opponents you hit with an R2 I believe it was near instantly and then there are forms, Luffy get's a certain power up form that you see on the very first stage you'll play for reasons and it's a massive degrade, besides the fact it's sky it doesn't get the speed boost and if there is a damage boost it's hampered by the attacks being frankly poor dood.

The game world is vast, the levels are nice and long and generally varied and interesting, certainly fun to play in, the soundtrack has some classics from older games, some music from the anime and some new tracks of it's own which are all real, it's fun to play in but it also makes some maps hard to read and traverse dood.

So what do I think? I think it's a stellar game even if it isn't as good as it's predecessor, it has it's annoyances but nothing bad enough that you will regret buying the game by any means, rank doesn't really matter as far as I know either outside of showing off to...I guess your friends IRL? so you can feel free to take your time playing how you want really, the fighting styles are all varied and interesting as is typical of one piece and it's just a fun time, thanks for reading and if you buy it I hope you enjoy dood ^-^",1600954180,1600954180,True,9,0,0.629173755645751953,0,True,False,False

-No official music

That's it. Yea, that's it. I see comments about a thin roster and frankly that's bogus. Now, unlike One Piece Warriors 3, you have to unlock a majority of the characters via the Dramatic Log or Treasure Log. That's it. So far there is less characters than OPPW3, but that's hard to ding when there's already so many characters in the game already.

Plus, this is the most involved combat system so far and I imagine it takes time for them to update characters to what OPPW4 is doing.

Why do characters have to be dlc? The roster is so lackluster. When these new characters are released, chances are you're finished with everything.

Played other warrior games (Dynasty/ Samurai) and the ost are great. However, for this game it doesn't stick at all in my opinion. It's insulting how they made ost from the franchise as DLC. You can easily turn off the music in game and have ost on youtube playing in the background.

In short, disappointed in missing arcs, lackluster roster, and shameless ost dlc. If you are getting this game chances are you are a fan as well. Wait 'til a sale comes on.

There's no territories you can capture which defeats the point of a musou game. There's 4 enemies, Katakuri, Perospero, Chess Officer, and Chess Soldier. The Chess Officers infinitely respawn until you kill Perospero twice which the game doesn't tell you about. The Chess Soldiers infinitely spawn no matter what cause you can't capture any territory. Most of the mission is fighting Katakuri with a character that has a heal super and hoping one of his supers doesn't hit you cause he constantly has all of his supers charged and if he hits you with one you have to charge your heal super by farming the infinitely respawning enemies. You do this for like an hour on hard mode and a half hour on normal mode only to get hit by Katakuri's command grab super and instant-killed. No one even fights Katakuri in this part of the manga or anime it's completely unnecessary. And if you look up a guide on how to beat the level they all just tell you if you get Brook and Jinbei to the end fast enough you can skip the Katakuri fight but in Hard mode you won't be able to do that because the enemies have too much HP because they can't program a decent enough AI in this game to make it strategically harder instead of just taking more time. So on Hard mode its impossible to get them to the ending before Katakuri blocks it especially when they made Katakuri the strongest character in the game to sell more copies cause of all the Katakuri fan boys.

However, be warned if you want this game for the story of One Piece prepare for a severe cut in content compared to Pirate Warriors 3 and If you want to buy the game for this I do not recommend it for you. Buy pw3 instead.

I personally did not look forward to and purchase the game for the number of story arcs included but for the new characters, new gameplay mechanics, updated maps, online game modes and future characters. For the most part it delivered on these expectations.

The new mechanics work great for a lot of characters however, some characters do not have any aerial combos.Any character you choose has a decent moveset of combos and special attacks which only expand once you upgrade that character with higher input combos, new special attacks with some characters gaining a form change which completely changes their moveset and attacks dependant on the character you choose.

The character roster overall is an improvement compared to pw3, however certain character's were cut for more questionable choices such as all of Sanji's siblings which all have similar gameplay. Otherwise there are more characters to choose compared to pw3 and they is far more variety between characters in pw4. Each is so unique in how you can play with them.

The maps are overall a nice visual enhancement, however, they are more confusing at times in tight spaces with the larger characters and take some time to learn to navigate. The online mode works ok, but doesn't have great compatibility with each player as you will have to join each other's game every time you want to start a new mission rather than make a party and be able to stay in it like every other online game has. With the gamemodes they are ok, however, Bandai has gone pretty basic with their approach to it. The boss battles are fun only if you have the difficulty maxed out on extreme diffifculty (which is only available after you complete the story) and on the higher levels, when enemy's have higher amounts of health and attack more often.

The problem I had the most with pw3 is that it takes soo long to get access to the higher level combos and abilites of characters no matter how great or trival they are between characters. pw4 solves this for the most part, however, gameplay is different in a good or bad way for some. Main enemies now have an armour you have to break before you can actually start damaging the enemy. In the early game this is fairly annoying and the animations of massive white circles forming gets in the way for seeing the enemy which makes it harder to fight them rather than easier which was the developer's intentions. They did not think this through well, the sounds everytime you hit would have been more than enough. Now in the later sections of the game when your characters are a lot stronger this does benefit this gameplay as fights last longer than in pw3 and you actually feel like you are battling the character's in the world on the higher difficulites compared to pirate warriors 3 which I felt was too short with the 1v1 battles at times. However, this can get more overwhelming to deal with compared to 3 if you are not good enough on the higher difficilities. Pretty good changes overall though for the gameplay and obtaining new abilites for you characters. Be warned Bandai has left some characters wanting with the new mechanics like air combos and form changes especially were left out for a lot of characters such as Chopper and Carrot which would have benfitted immensely from a form change.

Overall if you are looking for a good One Piece beat em up game and a different kind of Pirate Warriors game, I recommend this game with a new roster it keeps things interesting for many hours and more characters for the future will be in the character pass even if it is likely way overpriced for what we will get like Cracker, Smoothie, Judge so far and potentially the Beast Pirates like X-Drake if the scans I have seen are correct.",1595091275,1595091589,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Is this a good game? Yes!
Is it better than One Piece Pirate Warriors 3?? Absolutely no!
Is it worth it? Even if you are a One Piece fan, I have my doubts

Pirate Warriors 4 has a few positive aspects over PW3. Better graphics, new characters, the possibility to choose from several skills/moves and a few more (and new) missions. But that's it. Nothing more!

There are ONLY SIX arcs ([spoiler]Alabasta arc, the Enies Lobby arc, the Marineford arc, the New World Saga arc, the Whole Cake Island arc, and a game exclusive Wano arc. The Sabaody Archipelago arc is included in the Marineford arc, and Dressrosa arc is included in the New World Saga arc[/spoiler]).  Bandai had just ONE job: explore the Yonko saga. They didn't even manage to do it properly. There is no Zou Arc. There is no Reverie Arc. The lack of the old arcs and the poorly explored Yonko Saga disappointed me. The only thing new in here is the Whole Cake Island Arc and a poorly made Wano Country Arc.
They separated those 6 arcs in different missions. 5 of those missions are an easy 1x1 fight. Bandai should've put them inside a long mission, e.g. a final boss battle, like they did in PW3. Bandai chose to have more cutscenes (explaining 2/3 of the anime that weren't in the game) and less gameplay. Bandai randomly chose a few arcs to make them playable and the rest (the most part of the anime) to be cutscenes.
It took me a long time to get along with the combat camera. I just didn't like it. 
There are a few situations where you will experience a few bugs (Usopp's barrels don't stay in stairs, ally stuck inside a destroyed building for a long time, ranged characters have trouble to attack enemies that are on different heights, one of Luffy’s air attack send you flying above buildings, missing everything, etc.). There is also a bug where an enemy stay stuck above you (when you are close to the wall or the edge of the map) with a “falling animation”, even if you aren’t doing anything. You can attack it for free for a long time.
THERE IS NO DREAM LOG!! PW3 story mode was incredible. It was very exciting to remember the whole anime. But after getting an S on all missions, you could still have a lot of fun in Dream Log. Too bad, no dream log in here.
Besides that, there is not a single reason for getting an S-rank on all missions (and to complete the gallery) in PW4. You don’t get any reward, any achievement, nothing! The new mission rank system is completely useless.
""New characters"". Nice, right? F* no!!!! Why will I want to play with all Sanji's brothers?? Where is Moria? Perona? Eneru? Garp? Kuma?!? ([spoiler] In PW4 you battle against Garp and Kuma but you can't play with them. [/spoiler]).
Don’t get me wrong. It was funny playing with some new characters. The thing I hated the most was the lack of characters that you could play with in PW3. There are a lot of characters that you see their development and growing in the anime and you don't even have a chance to play in PW4 because more than 2/3 of the anime are just cutscenes.
I won’t say anything about the online system, because I played the whole game solo. But you can read a few reviews saying that it is bugged and poorly implemented.
Bandai don't want you to struggle to get S ranks on all missions (as I said, it’s useless). They've made an easy and short game where you'll play only once the story mode, and if you want to have all the achievements, just play a few more missions of the Treasure Log. 
What about Free log? Pointless.
There isn’t any struggling point in PW4. Despite replaying a few missions, I completed the story mode in a few hours.

I've spent 130 hours on PW3 getting 100% of it. 
It took me just 29 hours on PW4, and I think I'll never touch it again.

I can't recommend a game that explores less than 1/3 of the anime.
It would be better if Whole Cake Island arc and Wano arc were launched for PW3 as a DLC.
They could have included ALL arcs on PW4. Too bad :(
It just seems like an unfinished game.",1592975289,1595051238,False,346,18,0.847956061363220215,78,True,False,False

Of course this isn't the damning thing about the game (sure i think it's lazy they didn't even bother with over half of the main characters younger selves when clearly they had the assets and animations for it.) but what's bothering me is the DLC

DLC: From leaks we have gotten an idea of the DLC and one of the leaked names has already been confirmed (Charlotte Smoothie) and if we are going off of leaks then many of the DLC characters are simply them re-adding the cut characters for money. 

Ew.

TL;DR - The gameplay is good. The growth system was changed and some of the movesets feel a little lacking. The characters from the last game being cut and resold as DLC for this game is way less attractive.",1587316090,1594608363,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

- cutscenes are either pictures with text or badly animated with the typical anime lines on the edges of the screen to make it seem more is animated, but actually isn't

overall this game packs around 16-20 hrs of storyline gameplay, the replay value of this game is very good aswell. usually anime games combat system move list is pretty basic but one piece pirate warrior 4s moveset is honestly quite impressive, much better than onepiece burning blood or Jump force but some would argue that those games are more 1 on 1 than a classic beat them up game which is correct but that doesnt excuse that fact that onepiece pirate warrior 4 contains 2 times the amout of moves thoes mediocre game has.

I'm a long-time fan of the entire 'Warriors' style of games, and a somewhat-lapsed One Piece fan, so it's right up my alley. I played and enjoyed the first three games in the series, too. And... well, there's the rub. Frankly, to me, this sequel just doesn't feel like it's managing to justify its own existence.

Let me explain. Putting aside the first game - which was understandably quite experimental - the second title provided an engaging and original Warriors-style plot featuring all your favorite characters from One Piece. A perfect game for someone who just wants a fun and feisty hack-and-slash game featuring superpowered pirates instead of ancient Chinese heroes. The THIRD title provided a thorough exploration of the entire One Piece plot by way of hack-and-slash gameplay, clear from Luffy's first meeting with Zorro in East Blue and up to the confrontation with Doflamingo on Dressrosa, which was where the Anime was at the time. A perfect game for a One Piece fan who wants to play their way through somewhat exaggerated versions of all the major fights of the series.

This one, though... it's got a story mode, sure enough, following the plot of One Piece, but it's EXTREMELY abbreviated. ALL of East Blue is skipped along with the start of Grand Line, leaving you to start with the Alabasta Arc. Skypeia? Skipped. Thriller Bark? Skipped. Impel Down? Skipped. Fishman Island? Skipped. Punk Hazzard? Skipped. All the unique characters found in those places, who were playable in previous games? Gone. The interesting battlegrounds and armies found there? Gone. Dressrosa has been somewhat expanded, conversely, and Whole Cake Island has been added along with a game-original 'Wano Arc' tagged on at the end. So a lot less than what was dropped.

Enough new playable characters have been added to bring the total playable number up above what it was in the third game... though I'm honestly not sure HOW, since I keep noticing characters that are missing outright or have been demoted to non-playable. Also, some of the missing characters are being sold back to you as part of the extremely pricey Character Pass, which... just feels WRONG. I don't usually blame Bandai-Namco for their expensive DLC, since it's simply their way to deal with the rising price of AAA development, but selling you characters who were ALREADY PLAYABLE in the previous game just feels like cheating. And it still doesn't address the lack of variety in terms of battlefields...

Adding to my annoyance, there are a LOT of cutscenes. LONG cutscenes, cutscenes that try to bridge the huge gaps between chapters while still leaving out important details and defusing any emotional weight, cutscenes that appear in the middle of stages to interrupt the action, LOADS AND LOADS of very NICE cutscenes... but WHY?! There's an ANIME out there if you just want to WATCH One Piece. Why the heck didn't they spend all that time, money, effort and resources making more ACTUAL GAMEPLAY? More characters, more stages, more generic armies, maybe even more game-modes... I mean, yes, the story-mode obviously requires SOME cutscenes to be accessible, but you really don't need to be spoon-fed the ENTIRE plot when you can just GO WATCH THE ANIME if you want to.

So yeah. Why does this game need to exist? Between the second game, the third game, and the actual ANIME, everything it does has already been done better. The basic campaign is vastly inferior to the one from 3, the original Wano Arc is vastly inferior to the original plot from 2, and all it's really got going for it is a handful of new characters and transformations, and some halfway decent destructible environments. It doesn't even look noticeably better than the last two games. Just play them instead.

Pros

- Much better roster than Pirate Warriors 3, and the characters feel quite distinct. Additions like Kid, Hawkins, Reiju, and
  Carrot are lots of fun to play.

- Kaido's Dragon Form (and the Yonko in general) are insanely powerful and fun to play

- Better controller support than Pirate Warriors 3 but still requires some tweaking

- Pretty good quality cutscenes and animations

Cons

- Abridged story is hard to follow for beginners. Lots of important characters and side-plots are glossed over entirely. This 
  is definitely not how you want to get introduced to One Piece's story.

- The game content feels more sparse than Pirate Warriors 3. I should have 100% achievements and gotten S class finishes 
   on all missions (Story and Treasure Log) by about 35hrs in. Learning to use the entire roster will obviously add more time
   but I can't really see myself playing this for more than 70hrs in total if that.

- Camera is very slightly improved over Pirate Warriors but still pretty bad in general.

- The HUD gets cluttered very quickly and the minimap gets lit up like a Christmas tree which can make navigation a real 
   pain. 


Overall, I'd still recommend owning this game but don't buy it at full price. Wait for at least a 20-30% discount, and that's only if you're a One Piece fan. If you're new to the series or just like musou games, wait for something more steep like half off.

Don't get me wrong if you're a fan of One Piece and Warrior titles this game is fun. But they've done pretty much the same amount of negative changes as they did things right. The DLC characters however are the final nail for me because we already have 4 Germa 66 Characters and now we get another one. We already have a good amount of Charlotte Pirates but now get two more. Why aren't previously playable character no longer playable like : Caesar Clown, Perona, Gecko Moria, Magellan, Kuma, Enel and probably more. Why aren't characters like Mr 3/1 and many more avaible as Enemies but not playable? I really feel like they wasted some slots, especially 4 G66 characters, for Characters that deserved it more and also would've been more fun to play.

But let's get to the most annoying changes, because a Roster is always hard to select when you've got over 20 years to choose from.
Characters are now split into Power, Speed, Technik and Sky types.
This has turned some of my previous favorite characters into my least played characters. Because the new Full burst mode you can activate means you'll be hanging in the sky only using Aerial Combos and Attacks that all feel alot less powerful and effective than being on the ground.
To be fair however they've improved alot of the characters to be able to change somethings however, even though you only really feel this for Luffy and Sanjii. Luffy for example can activate gear 2/4/snakeman to change his moveset also changing his Type. I've always hated gear 4 and this makes gear 2 Luffy a viable option. However it feels like only a few characters received this overhaul. Chopper and Franky in my opinion really needed an Overhaul like that but didn't get it. Both of these Characters could've been great if you could just change their modes to get different skillsets...

The Special attack changes are mostly great.
You've now got 4 different special attacks you can choose from, however one of them should always be the Full burst mode whch is the new equivalent to Haki/Kizuna Rush from the old games. However as mentioned this turns Sky types into always flying characters that can't use ground moves. However choosing what ultimate attacks to use really allows some customization that feels great.

The new leveling system are essentially skilltrees which are a nice touch to level up characters the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't tell you where to find the coins you need to unlock special attacks. Which means you'll be scrolling through that mission list looking for things related to that character to find them.

Lastly are of course the actual roster and I've already mentioned that I'm missing some characters here. Logia users are no longer as much fun to play as they used to and I'm really missing Magellan here. It's a shame that Luffy, Sanjii and Zorro get 5-8 outfits while Nami only gets two playable outfits and Franky, Chopper, Brook and Robin all get no alternative outfits despite having alternative models in the game.
The game does have an great if not too large representation of the Big Mom storyline with atleast 10 and a few Worst Generation characters such as Kid, Bege, Hawkins making their debut, especially Kid play interesting while Bege is a summon type character that usually would be my favorite but this might be the worst version I've seen and I really liked this type in other Dynasty Warrior games. The Roster seems ok overall even though I'm really missing a few. Personally I would've cut atleast half of the new character to bring back Magellan, Enel, Perona and Kuma atleast if not a few never before playable characters from either CP9 or the Alabasta Saga. But that's just personal preference.

Anyway as I've said I'm really conflicted wether to give this a recommendation or not so it's a buy at discount  since it's good but it's not better than PW3",1593025018,1593025018,False,9,2,0.575287461280822754,0,True,False,False

First things first, the gameplay is superfluid. Everything flows nicely together, it's really a step-up from Pirate Warriors 3.
Also, the game is not locked to 30 FPS. One more reason why it feels super smooth. It's absolutely amazing playing the game at a nice 60 FPS. 

The visuals are also really good. Very good, no more PS Vita and switch port for us PC folks. 

Another plus is that controllers work fine, all with button prompts. For those who played Pirate Warriors 3 you know how much this was a problem then. 

I'm yet to try the online, but with the experience I'm getting now I doubt that will be a problem. 

All in all, I just hope Bandai continues with this trend because all I can say is if some anime games were like this (cough cough Jump force and One punch man), we anime fans would have been very happy.",1585270891,1592324642,True,5,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

Where PW3's story log covered the majority of One Piece from the start to the Dressrosa Arc, this installment gives a brief overview of early events with the earliest level taking place at the end of the Alabasta Arc. After getting caught up to where the previous game left off and properly finishing Dressrosa, the story goes through Whole Cake Island, skipping Zou for the most part, and finally (to a certain point) the Wano Arc. It should be mentioned that at this point the game continues with its own original story, as the Wano Arc is still in progress at the time of this game's release.

5. No level up system, instead you have to spend millions of Beli on character upgrades.

Pros
+ Special Move is a game changer, it somewhat visualized characters' iconic moves rather than using 2 musou moves
+ Grouping Each huge arc with 4-6 stages so you can delve deeper and immerse yourself more to the story

+ Some stages are multi-layered, i think it's cool

Cons
- Removed kizuna system (Kizuna rush, hero power, assist characters, etc)
- Removed comic-typed cutscenes (Merry Go's funeral is more heart wrenching in PW3)
- Missing some arc (though it might be understandable)
- Some multi-layered stages are one too many layered, it can be so confusing sometimes

One Piece Pirate Worries 4 is based on the hit anime [b]One Piece[/b] and is the predecessors of the three other games in the series. Combat is played the same, however, it is tweaked and is more smooth and air combat is much better as well. The game is sure to keep fans of [b]One Piece[/b], both casual and hardcore invested with its wonderful gameplay and retelling of the story.  

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[h3]Pros[/h3]
+ A great retelling of the [b]One Piece[/b] story.
+ Fun gameplay that can sometimes even be addictive
+ Both casual and hardcore [b]One Piece[/b] fans can find enjoyment in this game
+ Over 43 different characters to play as, plus a season pass with some more.
+ Four different subtypes to play as.

[h3]Cons[/h3]
- Gameplay may get stale for some people. 
- Some fan-favorite arks did not make it into the game.
- Some of the characters that were playable in OPW3 are not playable in this game. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
The game’s story follows the anime’s story and plays it through arks with a few levels in each and every word. The story of One Piece is great and the game tells it very well with the arks that we have been giving, the story has the One Piece charm and that is something that all fans can enjoy. 

However, not all arks made it into the game and fan favorites were removed as well. The entire [b]East Blue Saga[/b] was cut, the game starts at [b]Alabasta[/b], so no [b]Drum Island ark[/b], [b]Skypiea[/b] was removed, [b]Thriller Bark[/b], [b]Impel Down[/b], [b]Fish-Man Island[/b], and [b]Punk Hazard[/b] were also removed. This is disappointing, mainly because a lot of [b]One Piece[/b] fans loved some of these arks. [b]Enel[/b] and [b]Magellan[/b] were not even shown in the story or mentioned, however, [b]Gecko Moria[/b] was shown once in the story when the game was talking about [b]Thriller Bark[/b]. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay in the game is very fun and can be addictive at times as well, there are many characters for you to select sometimes depending on the mission you are giving. Each character has its own moves and has one of the four subtypes, Power, Speed, Technique, and Sky. Some characters can be a certain subtype in the Pre-time skip but have different moves in the Post-time Skip due to certain transformations, for example, Sanji is a speed type in the Pre-time skip but at the Post-time skip, he will be a Sky type due to some of his moves been modified.  

Every character has three special moves and a mode where they can be powered up and do extra damage. Most of these special moves will take out most enemies and will do a large chunk of damage to bosses. At some point, characters will enter a [b]Full-Force Burst[/b] mode, when this mode is activated they will get a special benefit depending on their subtype. 

[h3]Power Types[/h3]
Power Types are centered around the fact that they can deal large amounts of damage and take out enemies very quickly. When a power type character is hit by an enemy, a wall, or the floor, a shock wave is sent out and will damage any enemies that are near it. When power types are in [b]Full-Force Burst[/b], they will get more attack damage and their smash attacks are more powerful.  

[h3]Speed Types[/h3]
Speed types are more focused on combat as they have combo potential, and they can move around very fast, their stamina usage is also reduced in a power dash. When Speed types are in [b]Full-Force Burst[/b], their stamina usage is greatly reduced in a power dash. 

[h3]Technique Types[/h3]
Technique types are the most interesting as they have special moves that affect gameplay, like putting enemies to sleep, using oil, and lighting it up to make fire, and there is so much more. Technique types can also perform an attack while charging that will push enemies towards them. When a Technique type enters [b]Full-Force Burst[/b] their special traits of that character are powered up.  

[h3]Sky Types[/h3]
Sky types are a bit weird at first but they focus on air combat and have the most characteristics out of all the types. They are immune to all damage during a power dash, their power dash counties until all the stamina is used up, enemies that are not on the ground can get caught up in their power dash, and they can use stamina to start an attack when falling from an aerial attack. When a Sky type goes [b]Full-Force Burst[/b], they will have the ability to float constantly and their stamina usage is decreased during a power dash.  

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Combat is like other [b]Dynasty Worries[/b] games and the main objective for every single mission is to beat up a bunch of enemies, beat up leaders to take over territories to get more minions to help you fight. At some point, you will fight a mini-boss or a boss, when bosses come out they will have an [b]Armor Gauge[/b] if you remove all of the [b]Armor Gauge[/b] they will be stunned and put into a state called [b]Armor Break State[/b], in which they will take more damage.
Depending on who you fight, that characters [b]Devil Fruit[/b] may come into play as well if the character has one of course. [b]Peramecia[/b] and [b]Zeons[/b] don’t really have any gimmicks when it comes to attacking them other than the fact that their devil fruit is their move set mostly. However, if a Logia activates their ability, their appearance can change and normal attacks will not harm them. To harm someone with a Logia they will need to be put in their armor break state and all attacks will harm them when they are in this state.

[h3]Sub-Missions[/h3]
Sometimes a [b]Sub-Mission[/b] may take place during the level at a certain location or if you do certain requirements, these [b]Sub-Missions[/b] can be things like normal missions as well when the time comes for them. If you are able to complete these missions, then you will get rewarded barries which is the currency for the game.  

[h1]Dreamlog[/h1]
[b]Dreamlog[/b] is a mode that lets you play a bunch of missions, in this mode, you can get barries that help you level up your characters. [b]Dream log[/b] has you do the same missions as what the story mode provides but it’s mostly just you fighting a bunch of enemies, you will have different characters that will team up with you. You can play as any character in this mode if you have them unlocked, some character can only be unlocked in [b]Dreamlog[/b] after completing certain missions. 

[h1]What Holds The Game Back[/h1]
The gameplay is fun but it can get stale sometimes, especially after you are done completing the story. [b]Dream Log[/b] is a nice feature but you are doing the same thing over and over again and there is really no motive to continue playing. 

[h1]Preformance[/h1]
I was able to play the game in high settings, I used a NIVIDA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, 16 GB of RAM storage on a 2560:1440 [16:9] monitor. The game runs really smooth and I had no issues what so ever while playing, the game may look like you need a good computer, but if you have a decent computer, you should be able to run the game in low settings.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
One Piece Pirate Worries 4 is a great addition to the series and is a wonderfully made game, I have been an avid player of the previous game and this one proves once again why this series is great. Fans of the series can look forward to more of what they’ve come to love and expect.

There's so much things this game did right, and so much was improved from the previous installment.

Let's start with the roster. You get to play as your favorite characters from One Piece. From the basic Straw Hat Crew to Katakuri to Law, all favourites were included in the game. I always dream of letting me experience as the characters in One Piece, using different techniques to defeat enemies. Now you can, using different combos to defeat hordes of minions. It's so satisfying to launch a Red Hawk and wipe out over 50 enemies in an instant, or create a ROOM and see all minions turn into bombs, or use Gear 4th Bounce Man to just jump around.

Speaking of techniques, the combat is so good. The last installment isn't bad, using a combination of Triangles and Squares (or X and Y Buttons) to launch different combos, and usually 2 specials  and 1 awakening for each character. This time it's just a straight improvement from the last one. More combos and specials included, and 4 specials/awakenings can be used at once. Now you can be awakened, Bounce Man and Snake Man at the same time. Or use all Zoro's New World Techniques at the same time. Now that's dope.

The introduction of animation cancel is also really fun and makes the game more fast paced, comfortable and make the skill ceiling higher. You feel so much more powerful using different cancels, usually attack-dash combos, and it feels so much less clunky compared to OPPW3.

Air Combos are fun as hell. Using Sky characters to use air combos continuously is hella fun. Sanji with Sky Walk awakening and keep jingling Katakuri non-stop is both hilarious and insanely fun. 

And most importantly, all characters feel fun and unique to play. OPPW3 is fun, but once you realised the strongest characters and start spamming them with their broken moves like Fujitora throughout the Treasure Log, the game just gets stale real quick. Now it feels like every character has their own niche to try out and have fun with. Usopp's explosive combos are fun as hell, so is Hancock's immobilizing moves and Law's Room moves.

There's so much good things about the combat and characters, I haven't even touch on the story mode. Unlike the previous title where it goes through all islands from Shells Town to Dressrosa, this time they include the most memorable moments only, so starting from the Alabasta, Water 7/Enies Lobby, Sabaody/Marineford, Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island and Finally Wano. And most importantly, the Game Original story of Wano is so good. Compared to OPPW3, where the Dressrosa original story is an absolute mess, OPPW4's Wano original story is actually interesting and fun to watch. Seeing how Katakuri, Kid and Luffy work together is incredible, or having Bartolomeo & Cavendish come to Wano after listening to Luffy's news is really heartwarming. The final clash is real cool and intense, and the animation against Kaido is well done. It's a really unforgettable experience.

Overall a very solid beat'em up game. This review is finished by the time I've finished the main story missions, and I can't wait to jump into Treasure mode and experience more new characters.

I also miss having more of an option to choose which character you play as during the story, because I don’t ever want to play as usopp. I don’t think anyone wants to play as usopp. I am enjoying the game but so far the combos for pre time skip zoro and Sanji feel kind of stiff. Then again I have not mastered that games new fighting mechanic nor have I gotten all the skills the game for them. I have high hopes for the game and if you are a fan of pirates, one piece, anime, or dynasty warrior games I recommend this game.

EDIT: After having plenty of time with the game, and having gotten 100% of the achievements with it I can say that I fully recommend this game. One of my previous grips with the game was that the combat was kinda clunky, but after learning how to play with the new mechanics I find it even better than in PW3. Some characters are clearly better than others, like kaido, big mom, and whitebeard completely destroy everything in this game, all of them have 4 equivalent of kizuna rushes (except kaido, but his xxyyy combo is insane). I find my favorite characters in this game are crocodile, doffy, katakuri (I don't really like his combo chains, but my god he is immortal. Also his mochi foot stun prevents logia users into transforming into their forms which is super helpful). whitebeard, kaido, big mom, blackbeard (not as op in this game or fun to play as, but still powerful with his special attacks. Wish his basic attack chains were better and used more of his devil fruits) Characters I was disappointed in, in this game were Aokiji, and Kizaru. I wish the move sets were just better, Aokiji hits like a wet noodle, and his powerful specials don't do enough damage, or just plain miss the enemies. Kizaru is like sonic, but doesn't do enough damage as well. I hope the DLC roster includes Burgess ( snowballs chance in hell, I know) X Drake, Jack, and perospero.",1585344214,1587273482,True,2,0,0.506644546985626221,0,True,False,False

No point in playing the story again because there are no real objectives just time and kills and they cut out the dream log completely like the dream log for me was the best thing in pw3 because it had such a huge replay value even if you had every char on max you could just go play the dream log if you were bored cause it was random i almost never encountered the same missions and that you had progress in the dream log was great aswell now we just have this tressure log... Its like they didnt had time to do something for the dream log or the missing arks so they just cut them out completely its so sad they could have done so many things with this game. I mean dont get me wrong its still pretty good and the combat system is better too but i dont know there is just less reson to replay this whole thing and collect things for your chars.

+ Very different Characters. If you get bored by one, you can always play with another - the feeling is guaranteed to be different.
+ Even the characters, who are of the same type (Power, Sky, Technique and Speed) are very different from each other. Yes, they have similar traits, but you always know that you are playing Luffy and not just a Power Type Character, for example.
+ Maps are gorgeous, even though they are pretty similar to each other (which can be Considered a -). The destructible terrain makes it more realistic and makes you feel even more powerful.
+ Music is awesome. I personally like the OPPW3 tunes more, but these are not bad as well and the fact you can choose your favorites whenever you want is cool.
+ Cinematics are very well made - they make the stories much more enjoyable (at least during the first play through :D)

- The Story is most likely not gonna be able to grab the casual player, if they are not a One Piece fan and haven't watched the anime or read the manga. A lot of arcs were skipped, which they tried to fill with cutscenes between the in-game arcs, but I, personally, think it's pretty difficult to follow the story still.
- The game is pretty repetitive after you complete the Story and might get boring for some. DLC's are coming, which will likely fix that, but if you're not a fan of repetitive gameplay, you'll likely quit the game very fast.

Overall, I think the game does what it aims to do - provide a fun experience for the One Piece and Musou fans with a lot of the most-loved and popular Characters from the anime. If you're a One Piece fan, I definitely recommend it, you're gonna have a blast. I know I did.",1587245685,1587245685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To start off as with the track record of previous PW games, the roster got beefed up, and while there were a few characters from PW3 who were cut, the games base roster is bigger than any previous installments and has a character pass which will be adding 9 more characters total to the roster.  As far as character variety goes, this game has it.

Campaign Review:  The main campaign of the game is one of the things I see that is most upsetting to people, and understandably so.  In PW4, a few arcs have been cut, which means you aren't getting the entire experience of One Piece, however the fact that each arc has a few missions instead of each arc BEING a mission or 2, makes them more worthwhile to take home.  As far as length of the campaign, it still is something to sink time in to and feels very rewarding.

Treasure Log:  The Treasure Log is PW4's post game option which consists of multiple, non canon scenarios that add interesting team ups and rivalries.  Treasure Log is where you will be spending most of the time in the game for it's load of missions as well as character grinding purposes, missions also get progressively harder as you go through the three tiers (East Blue, Grand Line and New World).  It is a very fulfilling and good time killing post game to sink into .

Overall:  An absolutely BEAUTIFUL game, with amazing graphics, fluent combo structures with the addition of air combat and being able to replace skills and form changes, I feel Pirate Warriors 4 takes the cake on being the best game in the series.

The combat system is quite fluid, while it limits you to a ground and a air combat chain, it allows you to extend combos with the dash and change into the air combat chain whenever you want with a launch attack. Also the characters play quite different and usually have access to their iconic moves. Sadly some characters from the previous game arent in this anymore (especially as playable characters) like Kuma or Hannyabal. And here we come to a quite troublesome choice in terms of the games desing: The Story Missions. While the story arc usually get a good batch of missions to represent them, all with a certain ammount of maps of various sizes (usually cut into pieces for missions rarely left in One Piece ;) ) the game focuses in contrast to PW3 only on a hand full of arcs jumping from one to another (Arcs that actually made it in the game: Alabasta, Water 7/ Enis Lobby, Sabody Archipelago (befor time skip), Marine Fort, Sabody Archipelago (post time skip), Dressarosa, Whole Cake Island Arc and the Wano Arc (with a custom end like they did in PW 3 with Dressarosa). Also having alot of non playable characters in there that only function as enemies (usually most of the underlings in dressarosa and Wano, also drake) while some didnt make it in the game at all (just saying Biscuit isnt a thing in this game.). The lack of different scenes kinda hurts the treasure log due to it playing on allways the same maps, which are usually quite well desinged and big but at some point it kinda hurts the game. A good point are the transformations that actually change the gameplay of the character a bit though only a vew characters have access to it (sadly Chopper and Franky dont belong to those chosen vew). So I can only hope that they ll add missing arcs as dlc, though as far as I know Bandai Namco most of the stuff will be costumes...",1587191753,1587191753,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

So the game has its own version of the Wano arc. Being able to play as my favorite characters that's not part of the Straw Hat crew is a blast (Smoker and Tashigi).

A WARNING though: The game's Auto-save does not work unless you run the game as an Administrator. I lost 8 hours because of this. I recommend manually saving your game just in case.

Each character has a unique moveset, but there are 4 character types that everyone is divided into- Power, Technique, Speed, and Sky. Some characters get shafted by not have any air combos at all but not many. Aerial combat is new to this game and the gameplay is quite satisfying for a musou game.

Now of course this will vary from person to person and what they enjoy about these games as a whole, but personally I love to see what different aspects and systems a musou focuses on and how they're implemented.

PW4 is different enough from PW3 that it felt like a fresh experience, even when the story was retreading old waters. Personally I was a fan of the focus on later stages of the story, as these games tend to draw in a particular crowd that probably doesn't need to fight Don Kreig for the 20th year in a row.

The Gameplay is a whole different beast from PW3. The trait button for characters is gone, those moves instead being placed into their kit in a more streamlined fashion. There's a high emphasis on expanding aerial combat, most likely due to the existence of giant type enemies and bosses. This doesn't detract from the flow of combat however, and the high speed of the Pirate Warriors games is still there, if a bit gimped by a stamina meter stopping you from dash cancelling 100 times in a row.

Overall, its a great experience. The optional grind is still there as always, though lacking a bit in character as optional missions become a list rather than islands you explore between. Hopefully updates to the game will bring with them more character and life, but even as it is now the game rests on equal footing with its predecessor.",1586576427,1586576427,True,1,2,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The game dynamics are very diverse compared to the past One Piece Pirate Warriors games. The additional skills and combos make's the game more enjoyable. Almost seems entirely as you were watching the episode but playing within it. The Boss battles are really enjoyable. That was entirely a different playing field for me. I really enjoyed it and if you play on a harder mode you really have to be strategic on how you're going to go about it. I only wish certain events where in the story more or perhaps could be DLC in the near future. I wish Log Town, Impel Down, Amazon lily, Fishman Island, Punk Hazard, Thriller Park were playable maps along with the story. Who know's they could perhaps be added in or having Shiki the Golden Lion as a DLC character wouldn't be too bad either. All I'm going to say is this game is a well rounded game, even allowing you to destroy the environment around you. Makes the heat of the battles more intense. Well that's all I got.

As far as the game goes, gameplay-wise it's just a direct upgrade from PW3, in my opinion. It got rid of the tedious mechanic of kizuna rush, which I think just ate up a lot of time activating constantly.

Below are the pros and cons for this game, in comparison with previous game, Pirate Warriors 3.

Pros:
- Better graphics.
- Better gameplay.
- More playable characters. Previous game has 37, this one 43 + 9 from DLC.
- Characters are more diversed, gameplay wise. The addition of ""character type"", ""character size"", and ""airborne attack"" really change the feels and perspective of a musou game.
- Each maps are more unique. No more ""square area"" scattered all over the map.
- Customizable list of special moves.

Cons:
- The game includes new arc and expands arc from previous title, but they also remove some arcs, like Skypiea and Thriller Bark.
- Seven of playable characters were cut (Enel, Moria, Perona, Kuma, Garp, Caesar, and Magellan). They haven't however reveal the 9 characters for DLC. So, some of them might return as additional paid content.
- Pre-Time Skip of Nami, Chopper, Brook, Robin, and Franky also not playable. But this one is not that big of a deal since the post-TS version of characters that have playable pre-TS easily overshadow their pre-TS version.
- No more Dream Log. While I don't like Dream Log from previous game, they can do something to improve the mode instead of replacing it with a new mode that's basically just a long list of missions.

Overall, I'll give this game 8.5/10.",1586357902,1586357902,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

All the canonical techniques from One Piece are here, characters, locations, which also includes all the newer stuff like Big Mom, Kaido, etc.

The only possible downside I can find is the story. It seems they wanted to fit the whole of One Piece in this game for some reason, which results in like 75% of it being cut out, or told to us by narrator through cutscenes.

Having been following the series from the first game I gotta say this edition has the most 'immerson' in terms of story battles, in that there are multiple maps (typically 5~7) per arc. Progressing through the Onepiece storyline is more akin to the manga/anime experience and in-depth with the major highlights of each arc. 

Combat is slightly different with 4 assigned skills with the shift key and combos that are either longer and activated mid-air for some aerial characters. I do have to make the point that quite a few character has lost a bit of mobility compared to OPPW3, so AOE and large swiping attacks are less prevalent in this game. Also, characters with special forms like luffy will have a complete different set of skills and combo when activated. 

Gameplay for the campaign is roughly 15 hours as many said, and the 'dream log' end game content in this game is a similarly progressive form of individual levels, with increasing character stat requirements. This, I comment, feels less diverse and exploratory than OPPW3, the missions are more or less random and some players may lose interest.

Having said all that I still believe it is worthwhile to invest IF you are a hardcore One Piece fan and is willing to support the developer's OP related franchise. However, if you are new to the anime/manga or this type of BN musou game in general I'd recommend the wait for a sale.

It's pretty much the same old formula and it works here, too. There are quite a few changes to the core gameplay, but they all pretty much work together well and soon you'll be jumping, transforming and dabbling with different supers all over the place.

Supers are so much better in this one, since you just go from 1 to 4 supers, that you can also swap around, if you like a different kind of super more.

The roster is big, quickly unlocked and has lotsa different characters, that all play at least somewhat differently. Seeing the super clear the screen or wipe like 3 commanders is still immensely satisfying.

The ""leveling"" system is weird at first and pretty intuitive after looking at it a bit. You get one general ""tree"" for passive skills, that affects all characters. Then you get 2 separate trees for each character, the second one being unlocked after working with that char for a bit, either by having them exist in quests or just by playing them. Just make sure you actually switch over to the character sheet in the first few hours, because that's where you unlock actual combos and supers, which makes fights a lot easier (and more fun).

One negative regarding the leveling is that it's not quite transparent and needlessly complicated menuing. First off, it seems to be built around slow progression. There's no way to dump your resources and just buy all the upgrades in one node. You have to go to the node, click upgrade, navigate to ""yes"" in the pop-up, confirm and then you need to do the same thing again for all skill points.

And the later you get in the game, the more frustrating this gets, with you suddenly having WAY more resources and maybe wanting to switch to a different character, but then spending 5 minutes in the menu constantly pressing the same buttons.

You also can't easily check which quests you get coins from (that are shown in your tree). There's no ""complete xyz to unlock"" or anything. And then you also get the hidden nodes, that literally force you to guess what the ability is and how to unlock it. The ""coin unlock guide"" doesn't give you much relevant info. It's also really badly placed, because you'd basically need to write down the coin you wanna check, then completely go out of the character select, exit mission select, go to the main menu, select gallery, select the coin guide, flick through every coin and compare to the coin you wrote down.

Sounds long and complicated? Yeah, try doing that like 10 times for different skills and you quickly kinda stop caring. I'm currently looking for a coin that unlocks, what I presume to be a super for Whitebeard and it's just ""oh is it this quest? No? Cool, time to waste another 5 minutes"".

It's forced stretching of gameplay and it's too obvious and annoying to be interesting. You wanna do the treasure log with your favorite character and all their cool stuff? Ok, screw you, try guessing which of the hardest quests will get you that move you maybe want and grind for it.

And that brings us to difficulty. I played on normal, but there's a hard option right from the start and an ""ultra hard"" option that unlocks after the story. I found the difficulty to be quite ok. It's surprisingly much harder than the previous OP musou, but that doesn't mean it's difficult per se. It's just a little bit tougher than ""mash buttons = win"". You'll actually need to dodge some of the stronger attacks later on and be on top of your leveling. S rank can be a bit tough to achieve on your first run through the log, considering some of the objectives have you guess what's the fastest way to complete. It's often the time that was the issue for me; kills are usually easier to get, but vary wildly from 1k to 2.5k or more.

What can also kill your S ranks, are the weirdly useless sub-missions. Do not go for any submissions. All you get for completing them is a tiny bit of money at the end and very rarely a small bonus to aid you on the battlefield (like preventing reinforcements). Sub-missions will usually get you around 1/10th of the berry prize at the end, while attaining S rank will literally get you double the reward money.

And as ok as the difficulty is, the ""new world"" logs are gonna pretty much kill you, even if your character is maxed, in around 5-6 hits, depending on the enemy. You also get swarmed with tons of named characters that can all interrupt you, meaning you sometimes can't even get away, especially if you locked on and are now flying in a circle on accident. Buuut, if you now equip a self-buff and the ""heal while self-buffed"" skill, you suddenly have no issue with dying anymore, because the heal is so substantial.

Last point, if you like that stuff: Trophies
They are some of the easiest trophies to get in any game I've ever played. You will get more than half just from playing story stuff, more than 3/4 if you go for a bit of grinding and I'm 2 away from full trophies; literally just need to amass money now.

That's in part due to the fact that there are no trophies for different difficulty levels. There's no trophy for completely s-ranking the story (which I stupidly didn't look up) and also no trophy for completely s-ranking the treasure log or maxing out all characters, maxing out the trees of one character, even.

Tl;dr: It's an improvement of OPW3, controller issues seem mostly resolved (although my game switches my keyboard input to a different layout every time) and it's still the good old ""get big numbers; do the cool move"" gameplay that you play dynasty warrior games for.

If you like this kinda gameplay and OP, this is a pretty neat game to pick up. If not, the gameplay's gonna feel a little shallow and you'll wonder who different characters are and why they're capable of weird stuff.",1585876235,1585876235,True,2,1,0.526484191417694092,0,True,False,False

I'll run it down more detailed, but tldr: controller support is there (just needs to be enabled in properties>and controller settings), and I play on an XOne mini and it functions perfectly, the game looks good, the combo system is fun and there's a lot to sink time into. 
Now let's get more into it. 

The story: the story covers from [spoiler] Alabasta [/spoiler] to [spoiler] Wano [/spoiler] ,although it's apart from the very beginning a game original. It does briefly cover them but gameplay-wise skips over [spoiler] Thriller Bark [/spoiler] , [spoiler] Impel Down [/spoiler] , [spoiler] Fishman Island [/spoiler] , [spoiler] Punk Hazard [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Zou [/spoiler] . Playing coop (Ill cover it too) we finished the story in 20 hours. The maps are also really well done to represent the actual layout used in the anime/manga this time around.

The gameplay: classic musou style combat, aerial combos add more depth from previous titles. Musou/special attacks are a grid now, where you ""build a loadout"" of 4 different ones, ranging from traditional cutscene-y musous to transformations to heals/buffs to basic empowered versions of special attacks. Overall, very fun combat.

Other notable stuff: Coop works well and you can experience all story/treasure log maps in 2p coop, as well as a few dozen treasure log maps that can be played with up to 4 players (empty slots are filled with AI). The progression has been made interesting and instead of just levelling up you use coins and berries to progress the abilities of your characters.

Negatives: In coop the timing for invites is awkward, and sometimes I'd end up with a random player joining me before my friend could join. Also there are multiple major characters missing that were included in previous games, and while there are 9 upcoming dlc chars, missing chars they already had movesets for is kinda sad.

===================================================================
The Good Stuff:

+++ The Y / Triangle string has been removed and has been replaced with each character's unique action. It has the best move-set for all characters due to the new Jump action, harder characters like Marco plays better in this than in Pirate Warriors 3. Extremely powerful characters like Kizaru from Pirate Warriors 3 is completely balanced in this, that being said, he is still incredibly op.

++ There is a new stamina system where you cannot spam attacks using dash and constantly stun-lock your enemy anymore. Some SKY characters like Kizaru have the ability to dash across the map, flying over buildings and enemy while using up his stamina.

+ There is destructible environment in this game. This greatly help the game to look like One Piece when every fight has a building destroyed.

+ It is also easier to 100% this game since the crew level system is greatly improved. It takes a few battles to level them up to MAX which is so much better as you need the coins from them to upgrade your characters and unlock new moves. In Pirate Warriors 3, you had to really grind the crew level system to get certain skills or a better version of an already unlocked skills. 

===================================================================
The Not So Good Stuff:

-- However there is a lack of content? Some characters from Pirate Warriors 2/3 are not here, costumes and outfits from previous are also not included. Smaller arcs like Romance Dawn and Arlong Park are completely omitted.

- Bosses like Drake are incredibly frustrating to fight when using taller characters like Katakuri, basically Drake's hitbox causes you to go up in the air when you are attacking him which switches your X / Square attacks to be Air attacks.

===================================================================

Overall 10/10, Charlotte Katakuri is way too over-powered like Hello? If there is any missions I could not get rank S in. I just swap to Katakuri.",1585728888,1585750266,True,0,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,False

I feel the only two downsides are that there have been a lot of arcs skipped in the story mode, think of Thriller Bark (Brook comes just out of nowhere and Gecko Moria isn't even in the game anymore), Drum (no Wapol, Chopper joining has a little monologue cutscene and that's it), Skypea (RIP Enel), Impel Down (Magellan), and even post timeskip the entire Fishmen Island and Punk Hazard arcs are skipped, Zou in its entirety is skipped aswell.

Also like mentioned above alot of previous (playable) characters have been removed which is a great shame.

But honestly other than that the game is amazing, the combat is even more fun than before, there is actual online play now, there is alot to grind which is a great timesink if you are a big completionist, and every character feels fun to play.

= Intro =

Love 'Musou' games, love One Piece. Recently started playing Berserk again, really looked forward to this after the letdown of DOOM: Eternal.

= Gameplay = 

It's a Musou. You play an absurdly powerful hero and beat up literally thousands of enemies with a variety of splashy attacks and combos, while conquering territory to spawn thousands of your own troops.

PW3 was a lot of fun, but felt floaty, repetitive and bland at times. Fortunately PW4 fixes a whole lot of that - combat is meatier, the new specials system is a fantastic improvement, boss fights are now fully realized and have some interesting mechanics (although Pica in particular reveals one of the game's biggest remaining flaws) and you even have a rudimentary skill tree - although not quite as good as Berserk's loot/crafting system. 

Story mode is solid, with a few caveats - and the Treasure Log (similar to the Dream/Nightmare log of the previous game) is a huge improvement, with some genuinely creative and fun mission goals.

Characters are well designed and varied, with each one having a unique mechanic or two. 

Honestly, gameplay wise there isn't much to complain about here. As a Musou, this feels like the genre is heading towards some point where it's going to explode into the mainstream.

Everything feels like an upgrade - maps are bigger, enemies are more plentiful, tons of little refinements and improvements all over the place. As a game, it's really good.

That said, there are some issues. I don't like having to play through the story to unlock the majority of characters - in the previous game you could earn them gradually through the Log mode. 

I don't like how much content the game skips over (more below) and the difficulty settings feel out of whack. Hard is great - if you don't mind a bit of grinding and a *huge* difficulty spike midway through, Normal is 'my first Musou game' and Easy is 'my drunk cat's first Musou game'. 

= Graphics & Audio =

While it's not going to knock your socks off, it's a much prettier game (and a great PC port) - with stuff like tesselation adding a lot of visual oomph. The game does look slightly washed out, but pumping up the vibrancy with something like Reshade works well.

However, the camera - a common problem in Musous is really bad here. The inclusion of gigantic enemies makes it worse, when the camera zooms out and starts clipping into the boss, the scenery etc. It's been a problem for a while in the genre, and the general excellence of the game makes it more obvious over time.

Music is solid, but I turned it off after a while. 

= Style =

This is where PW4 comes a bit short. As a game, on it's own merits, it's great. As a One Piece tribute, it's...complicated. Rather than focusing on the *entire* story of OP, PW4 instead cuts things down and focuses more on depth within each arc. However, this feels a little odd sometimes - so many really great bits of the story are cut here. No Skypeia, no Thriller Bark, no Impel Down, no Zou, no Fishman Island. And yes, this means that most of the characters from these arcs are cut too - no Enel, Moria, Magellan etc.

The real shame though is that the later arcs that PW3 didn't get to also feel a bit thin. Whole Cake island is done decently, but Dressrosa is ridiculously cut down - the only Doflamingo Family characters are Diamante and Pica (neither are playable). No Trebol, no Baby 5, no Gladius and you never get to play Greenbit, the underground docks etc. Meh.

If they wanted to cut redundant content and focus on newer stuff, why not cut Alabasta and give us a more fully realized version of Dressrosa?

Beyond this, there are a few fully realized characters in the game that are not playable - evidently being kept back for DLC. I despise DLC in a AAA priced game like this.

= Value =

There is a *lot* of game here. 36 main story missions (although it's more like 30, as quite a few of these are just boss fights. Beyond this, you've got the excellent new Treasure Log to play, online features etc. Definitely good value even at a AAA price - although, again, I dislike how much was cut and the evident DLC shenanigans going on here.

I do wish skill trees were a bit more fleshed out, but with a cast of 40+ characters, that may be a bit ambitious.

= Overall =

+ The best Musou game to date.
+ Insanely fun.
+ Plenty of content.
+ Lots of improvements and added features.
+ I'm already stoked for #5

- A huge amount of the OP story is missing here.
- Giant characters are not implemented well.
- Horrible camera.

At the end of the day, this game just...rocks. It's not a perfect One Piece game, but it's fairly close to a perfect Musou. Highly recommended, but if you are in it purely as a OP tribute, you may be let down.",1585724272,1585724880,True,31,3,0.665349602699279785,5,True,False,False

1. the game is to short and missing too may arcs, Pirate Warriors 3 had 22 arcs & this has 6, what massive disappointment, Pirate Warriors 3 also had 19 locations this has only 7. 

2. Characters, yes this has more Characters for sure but Enel, Gecko Moriah, Perona, Magellan, Bartholomew Kuma and Caesar Clown and Monkey D, Garp was removed as playable Characters, i personally don't see a reason for this

3. Some Characters in the story just never got models i feel they should have proper models if they are going to be added to the gameplay. 

4. Also the game is WAY TO EASY like its stupidly easy, i would like to see 2 or 3 more difficulties added, i started on hard difficulty from the start 

5. (small one) :P i wanna play as Silvers Rayleigh and Koby :P

If the old arcs get put in as paid DLC i'll see that as a betrayal to the fans personally they should have been in from the start on release and newer arcs as DLC if anything",1585610651,1585610822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a long time fan this game has been just one MASSIVE disappointment. The ""Dramatic Log"" being the main story, skipped over a disgusting amount of the source material. After glossing over all of the East Blue Saga (the beginning adventures of One Piece, where much of the world and it's rules are explained) you abruptly start halfway through the Alabasta Arc. This game is very obviously targeting long time fans, they expect you to know 90% of this stuff going in, but they continue on at a break-neck pace to the point where the game condenses whole chunks of story into miniature cut scenes. Typically, though momentarily, touching upon the more memorable scenes from the source material. Honestly the last Pirate Warriors game did a much better job going through the story.

Aside from the bungling of a main story, there's the ""Treasure Log"" game mode, specifically there to run you through hypothetical battles and situations in order to give character specific coins that'll allow you to get specific upgrades to certain characters. 

Honestly the game play isn't half bad, (aside from the occasional frame drop) it runs great, looks pretty good too and I'd say it's exactly what you expect from a ""Dynasty Warriors"" type game, just a cathartic action game, smashing through hoards of enemies and using coins and berries to level up the various characters to make it easier to smash through hoards of enemies. If that's your jam, more power to you, it's a pretty decent game if that's all you care about. Me personally being a long time fan, I'll still play it but I am thoroughly upset at how the story was portrayed. I was hoping to get my friends into One Piece through this game and unfortunately that seems highly unlikely.

Graphically, the game is probably the best looking musou game on the market right now. It's colorful and vibrant, however the environment textures are still relatively low-rez. This, however, is made up by the fact that this game displays more enemies than any other musou before it; in some cases you can literally see hundreds of enemies at the same time, especially given the now more open level-design, another plus imo.

Musically, the game sounds good, with the addition of the anime soundtrack a bit nostalgic and perfectly fitting for this game.

The story follows the manga/anime, but it only covers a few, big arcs such as [spoiler] Enies Lobby [/spoiler], [spoiler] Impel Down [/spoiler] or the [spoiler] Whole Cake Island [/spoiler] arc. Everything else is covered in cutscenes featuring scenes from PW3, which somewhat feels lazy, but really isn't a problem. Of course, the main part of the game is it's post-game, which, just like in PW3, is amazing.

The gameplay is almost exactly the same as PW3, but with a few added mechanics to makes combos more fluent and thus more fun. Overall, it is incredibly satisfying and is now also customizable, giving every character the chance to equip any 4 moves you have unlocked, thus providing more variety. This, in turn, leads to the gamplay not becoming repetetive as quickly as other games in the genre.

Overall, if you liked PW3 and you want an enhanced version of it, this is it. If you've never played a Pirate Warriros game before or seen the anime, I recommend playing PW3 before this, to get an idea of the story and the gameplay basics.

i'm not sure how person not already a fan of the one piece series would feel about this.
but as someone who loves it a lot. this is one of the best games for it ever made.
with a base game roster of 43 characters, maps the are not bland looking squares , online coop and plenty of missions to enjoy.and beautiful character animations with a great amount of enemies capable of being onscreen.
its definitely worth a purchase.

ISSUES/NEGATIVES
but like everything there are downsides.it wouldn't be realistic if you saw a review without it.
ONLINE
-a problem with online is that you cannot set room passwords. this is important if you want to play with friends or other specific people and not randoms.

-you cannot change mic settings after you start a mission, only when creating a session

CUT SCENES
-some cut scenes are just pathetic, like one in alabasta where vivi and luffy are having a conversation in the desert and they are all just standing there talking. there is suppose to be a moment where luffy and vivi hit each other which is important when you understand vivis character.
or changed locations in events or even missing scenes like how luffy got aces cuffs off.

STORY
due to lack of npcs and such. i would not recommend this game as a viable way of experiencing the story. some things before even wanos original story have been changed a little. one such example is sengoku actually trying to stop luffy leading to a fight. which while entertaining makes is a bad adaption for this aspect.

SOUND
i notice sometimes i'll lose sound if i alt tab while in game. might be a full screen setting issue,i'm not sure. but i fix this by either restarting the game, or going to options>P1>finish. and sound is restored for me.

CONTENT
Missing post time skip costumes for lucci and akainu
does not have all outfits that were available in previous game.

The story flows nicely and it's not overfilled with unnecessary parts. My only complaint is that it doesn't have the Thriller Bark Arc but this one seems to focus more on the post-time-skip arcs, especially giving Whole Cake a whole lot of attention. Wano Arc is not the same as in the manga/anime, but that's fine because the game-exclusive Wano Arc was still very enjoyable to go through.

The character roster is quite large, adding up to 43 current characters, and of course the 9 upcoming DLC characters. Katakuri and the Vinsmoke brothers being unlockable through gameplay so you don't have to purchase the season pass yet. I would recommend waiting until they announce the DLC characters and then picking up whoever you like. However, personally, I got the season pass because I want to have all the characters regardless.

The combat is incredible. I've played many Musou games in my life, (including but not limited to: Dynasty Warriors 1 through 7, the previous Pirate Warriors games, and the Berserk Musou game), and I have to say this game is one of the best demonstrations of how fun and engaging the Musou battle system is. I feel a rush of adrenaline every time I finish a combo and topple a hundred enemies in one go.

On the completion side of things, this game is in the middle of the spectrum. There are only 3 main quest logs: The Dramatic Log which is the story mode where you play as a select set of characters each quest, the Free Log which allows you to replay Dramatic Log missions with any character you want, and the ratings you get for each quest is shared between the two logs, and finally, the Treasure Log, where you'll probably spend most of your time because it has a whole lot of quests that when completed will reward you with golden coins that you need to level up your characters skills or stats.

Speaking of which, the Growth Maps offer a decent method of progressing your characters through buffing their main stats or unlocking new abilities for them. You can choose up to 4 abilities for these characters to use during each battle but the number of abilities you can unlock makes it so you have options in case you wish to change up your play style whenever you want. The only thing that bothers me is that you have to select a mission first before you can access the Growth Map, which isn't much of a problem since you can still navigate between different characters' maps, it's just a tedious process is all. I'm hoping that in a future patch the devs will add a Growth Map option to the main menu just to make it easier to access.

Oh, right, I almost forgot. The graphics of the game are pretty good. They're not incredible or realistic to any measure, but they do the job of representing a CGI anime game. The action cutscenes are definitely incredible though. It feels like a trip down memory lane but also a whole new experience at the same time. 

All in all, I give this game a good ol' 9/10. It's incredibly fun and can get addicting if you're not careful. I mean, look at me, I played 12 hours of this on launch day alone. That's dangerous, but it's a damn good time. Anyway, that's all I got for you. If you read all that, thank you first of all, and I genuinely hope you give this game a try. As a One Piece and Musou game fan, this brings me so much joy. Can't wait for the DLC characters!",1585510737,1585510737,True,66,3,0.815928936004638672,1,True,False,False

I've played the Dynasty Warriors titles from 1 to 5 with great pleasure until 6 disappointed. Picked up PW 3 last year and had tons of fun. This 4th part however blows it out of the water.

Pros:

- The gameplay is much smoother and the combos feel great. Aerial combat is just nuts.

- You can use and choose more special moves(musou). They all charge individually.

- The coin system seems less grindy so far.

- You have a lot more freedom on the maps. There're less invisible walls which gives a better feeling while traveling/fighting and you can destroy most buildings etc. Always wanted to use Whitebeards quake powers to destroy a bunch of buildings? Well here is your chance!

- Best thing of all is you can finally play the story via online coop, though it isn't perfect. You have to invite your friend for every map and don't stay together after finishing one.

Cons:

- The multiplayer might disconnect sometimes which they'll hopefully fix. It doesn't happen to often but still sucks since the person who disconnects doesn't get the points for that round.

- Some people seem to have lost their save file after the game crashed, though mine didn't crash once I wouldn't want that to happen. Needs to be fixed asap.",1585304221,1585489303,True,4,0,0.543985188007354736,0,True,False,False

If you are not a fan of hack n slash mob games, or a fan of one piece, you wont enjoy this game. I mildly enjoy dynasty warrior kind of games where Im an OP character that can wipe away hundreds of enemies with simple moves, but I bought it mostly because Im a longtime fan of OP. The combat is simple, but not mindless. You do have to figure out how to most efficiently dispatch enemies. The bosses do have unique movesets to them, and I find myself mixing up the special moves and combos for max effectiveness. Wouldnt call the combat ""mindless"", unless you put it on easy. 

The difficulty jump from normal to hard is pretty massive. You hardly ever have a chance to regen health on hard, but on medium they're everywhere. IF you are efficient enough with wiping away enemies. More enemies killed = more likely to pick up healing objects. If you kill a mini boss, they often drop full health restoring items. But on hard, they hardly ever drop anything. On normal I hardly struggle. On hard, I have to pay a lot more attention to my health. Problem is, I watch it go down when hardly anything is happening. Surrounded by hundreds of enemies at a time, cant really stare at every single one of them and determine whos damaging me and whos not while trying to wipe away hundreds of enemies efficiently.

Graphic wise, I havent had any issue with optimization. Game runs very smooth. No issues with cutscenes. But Ive read in the forums others have had issues with them. At first I had a problem with getting my controller to respond. I had to manually go into the games settings and enable controller input. 

Would I recommend this? depends. Do you like one piece? now, how do you feel about hack and slash mob games with bosses? If you're a fan like me and somewhat enjoy hack and slash, I would recommend the game. But not for $60... I would personally wait for a sale. I bought it for $60. Not going to refund it, but kinda wish I waited for a sale.

03/28/2020 Update: Post-Dramatic Log Completion

This is by far the best entry of the Pirate Warriors series. The fluidity of gameplay is a blast

Pros

Excellent combat mechanics
Classic Dynasty Warriors feeling (Pre DW9)
Skilltree Mechanics from Hyrule Warriors
Every Character is a Blast to Play
Wano Arc original story from the game is very entertaining and rewarding, bordering on a tad cheesy at some points
THE GIANT CHARACTERS, SPECIFICALLY WHITEBEARD AND KAIDO OH MY LORD

Cons

Online Multiplayer is messy, built in voice comms are XBOX 360 quality at best, can disconnect at times. Hoping Remote Play Support or improved Multiplayer mechanics are built in soon

Getting Controller Support enabled at the start can be annoying, but every PW game so far has been that way.

Major arcs from the manga (Arlong Park, Skypiea, etc) are excluded from the main story. While OPPW3 does include these, perhaps adding them as DLC down the line to allow players to experience them in the new quality of game would be a wise choice. I could see them being added as Map Packs much like the Episode Packs in OPWS",1585274894,1585383743,True,14,1,0.628006994724273682,0,True,False,False

Content is okay but overall feels samey with each chapter. The bots are on the same level as Xenoverse 2 in that friendly AI are more hurtful to your performance than they are helpful by knocking the enemy out of your attacks constantly. Map design feels about the same as PW3 for some reason but again the upgraded art style helps to make each map feel more unique however the verticality in some of the maps feels pointless and not needed. And finally the matchmaking in this game is atrocious and some of the worst for a game in 2020.

If you're into that genre, then this is a Good One, and you should check it out. If you're interested in One Piece, you should also check it out!

Honestly, this one plays a lot better than past entries in the series. They have really nailed the feeling of being in a sort of action shonen series fight. Boosting after enemies or to avoid attacks feels great, it's easy to use different special attacks and abilities, all the characters feel totally unique, it's just great all around. 

The RPG systems are interesting, you have like a whole bunch of skill trees to fill out. One for ALL characters, so new unlocks don't start out weak, and then multiple for each character. And they're not just giving 3% increased damage or whatever, they give whole new combat abilities and skills that really change the way the character plays. It's great.

I only have two quibbles with this game:
- It doesn't cover as much of the story of One Piece as the last one. But, this feels totally fair, as One Piece is an absolutely absurd amount of story to cover.
- They replaced the island-hopping mode from OPPW3 with just a list of maps to go through, which doesn't feel as fun, even though it's more convenient overall.

That's it! Otherwise, it's real good.",1585339679,1585339679,True,2,0,0.495565414428710938,0,True,False,False

i didn't really dislike PW3 but the gap is really felt throughout play time.

I'm playing on PC with XBOX-ONE controller and at first it gave me some connection problems but there is a solution available VIA steam settings. read at the community forum for specifics.

As for the game. the Pace is great. defeating huge armies of enemies is great. and seriously. i'm a big one-piece fan and this game sucked me in.
the soundtrack gets boring after a while BUT i didn't mind it because i was too focused on kicking akainu's a$$.

As mentioned before, i think the best point is the Pace and the musuo fights (as it should be... it's a musuo game...)
the Pace of the earlier arcs is fast and you reach marineford stage pretty fast.
I liked it because the previous games of the series covered it enough times already and this time it feels like you jump faster to the more recent content.
The cutscenes are nice and sometimes give you the feel of the anime but the game itself sometimes diverge from the anime itself and after a while returns to the original script.
Anyway. there is an option to skip it or disable it entirely.

lastly, i want to mention two last points about the game - the character progression and the tutorial.

The tutorial at the beggining is very fun and very satisfying (no spoilers), i'll just say i'm really hyped for reaching the end.
that's all i will say about it.

regarding the progression - it has way more choices than in previous games and it's satisfying to improve your character through it. you do some triall & error untill you get to the point you're satisfied with your main character's build.
all in all. i like the progression method used this time around.

I actually like the game and i reccomend it. especially if you're a one-piece fan.
I haven't tried the online feature yet so i can't comment on it for now.

+Beautiful art and animation. Nami truly is pleasing to the eye ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

+++Combo system is really great and allows more options than any other game in the series I have played so far
+Destructible environment. Throwing enemies into buildings damages both enemies and the buildings, falling rubble causes damage to enemies. 
+Very fluid movement. Very few invisible walls (practically none)
+thousands of enemies to fight even in early maps, aside for 1v1 duels
+visits parts of the story not seen in previous games
--no remote play together support during the time of writing. Hoping for this to be fixed soon.
-certain maps do not allow coop at all, some allow only online coop for whatever reason.
-early on fighting some bosses feels dull, since you do so little damage to both their HP and shields. This does get fixed over time as your characters grow stronger.

The combat is A LOT faster than PW3. It takes some getting used to in the beginning but once you get it it’s really satisfying. The combat animations are all really good and the different skills and classes for each character make them all feel unique. Lots of stage destruction and character voices. All your allies talk a lot during combat which makes the whole thing feel alive (For example Sanji names all his attacks which is really cool). Ariel combat is a nice touch too and extending combos into them is easy. I played on hard mode and I gotta say it’s far more challenging than PW3. If you’re up for the challenge I recommend it.

Like I said the combat is fast paced so that meant that the camera was super fast too. Imo the camera was way too sensitive but luckily there’s options to tone it down. The environments are very detailed and beautiful and the graphics in general are a huge improvement over the last game. Not to mention the roster is completely revamped and everyone has a different fresh moveset than before. The music is amazing as well.

Now for the negatives: 

The camera itself is not the best. When running from place to place it always forces you to slightly look downwards for some reason which is annoying at times but you get used to it. When you lock the camera onto a target, I’ll be frank, it’s not good. Due to the far field of view, when you get up close to your enemy, 80% of the time the camera won’t be focusing on them. The animations during dialogue scenes are not good. Sometimes the mouth movements don’t fit the tone or expressions of the characters at all. Also, the crew from what I’ve experience in the Alabasta arc are all stuck in there East Blue costumes. Although there are small iterations like the bandaged arms and Mr. Prince but it would’ve been far more appropriate to have their proper attires. Some cutscenes are also plainly copy pasted from the previous game. Though, the new rendered animations they made are really good.

These are my thoughts for now. I still think the gameplay is the core element of the game and I just love playing as One Piece characters in general so I’m still having a blast playing. If you’d ask me, I’d recommend it but that might just be my One Piece biased talking so I tried to be as honest as possible. Whether you decide to buy it or not is up to you but I hope you enjoy it if you do. 

PS: I don’t know if this mini review came off as more negative than positive but let me say that the positives are far more impactful than the negatives.",1585331778,1585331778,True,2,0,0.537724733352661133,0,True,False,False

i've played all of the OP games. A new ""skill tree"" which utilises the characters coins which is fun to complete and not as grindy in chasing specific coins. it's now more fun (and realistic) to wanna use all the characters thanks to the variety of newly added combos that you're tempted to try out with everyone (compared to before when you'd stick to the same roster of characters). 

The negatives are movement still feels a little robotic (more than Pirate Warriors 3) however to make up for this is you can move around faster thanks to a new Dash move (has a stamina bar but this recovers within a few seconds). Only other complaint is the story starts from alabasta (and if you count the characters they cut out from this game) im not sure why they chose this specific point but we knew this from pre-release.",1585321897,1585331037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- the growth map mechanic more balance since they can affect all character

The game is great apart from the fact it seems like there are only 6 arcs which is disappointing but overall a great game.

I'm reading a lot of other reviews talk about controllers not working, but I've not had any of this. I use a PS4 controller, no extra software installed. Worked up front with no additional issues. I cannot vouch for others, but this is my experience.

While the game comes with a lot of graphical options for fine-tuning your experience, it looks as you'd expect. Graphics are not spectacular, but they are what they are. Even pushed to max, it's not a visually impressive game.

As far as I can personally speak, the game runs very smoothly (60fps) with no hitches or anything as long as you hardware can push that. I can't imagine you'd need much, but it seems to be one of the better Warriors ports that we've seen. There are more options in the menus than I've ever seen before, so it seems they've finally modernized a little bit.

Now, when it comes to gameplay, there are some very big changes for Musou fans. Firstly, the game still plays like you'd expect. Normal attacks mixed with Charge attacks to make unique combos. There are MANY more combos in this game than before, and now jumping in the middle of a combo will launch enemies into the air so you can continue fighting in the air. Because of this, there seems to be a lot more input options and ways to chain combos together. [b]Musou attacks have been removed entirely.[/b] Instead, there is now a skill palette system. You hold down RB/R1 to pull up 4 skills on the face buttons and you can use those whenever they are charged. They charge up by damaging enemies. Every character has their own skill tree that can unlock new combos and new skills that you can then slot into your character's skill palette. You can only have 4 active skills equipped at a time, so there are more skills than you'll need, offering for a lot of variation in what you can do between players. Each character also has an archetype now. Depending on that, your boost mode (called Full Force Burst) will provide different bonuses, such as faster traversal on the map or increased damage. Overall, it adds an attack speed boost to all characters. Each character has a skill tree, as I mentioned before, and there you can also find passive upgrades to damage, defense, stamina, and life. There's also one big skill tree that affects ALL characters, so you can choose to level up everyone or focus on a few. These trees are separate, so you can do both.

These are all of the major changes I've encountered in the first two hours of play; I'm sure there are more. As you can imagine, the game does feel a little different from the typical Warriors experience (to me, anyway). It feels more like a brawler with a few Musou elements. I'm a little sad Musou attacks are gone, but the overall combat does feel a little bit more varied and deeper now because of the changes. It's also possible that greater attacks will be unlocked later that can make up for that lack of ""musou attack"" gravitas.

So far, it's a recommend for One Piece fans, though it's probably not enough to bring in outside fans not already familiar, as the story also picks up in the middle of the One Piece story, so there's very little build up or background for any of the characters. Playing Pirate Warriors 3 before this one would be a better introduction to the game, and PW3 is also much more similar to the Dynasty Warriors formula.",1585273617,1585273617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most Negative Comment are only talking about the controller issue. But you can fix that with this:
In Steam go to Settings > Controller > General Controller Settings and then check for whichever controller you're using. Just turned on Xbox Controller and now the game will recognize your controller.
