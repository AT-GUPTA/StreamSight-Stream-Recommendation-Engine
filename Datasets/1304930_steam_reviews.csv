You can play with a group of four or less, and by yourself. Its in online mode both during single player and multiplayer so there is no pause, for those interested in this game for ""single player"" due to past Outlast versions. If you can't go 30-45 minutes without pausing or learning to take breaks in between trials, wouldnt suggest it. From what I saw from a couple complaints in the forums and the few negative reviews, time management is something a player needs to learn how to do for themselves, instead of complaining in reviews that a game isnt offering them time to leave themselves AFK in the middle of a horror/suspense game. There is an option to end a trial if you are mid game and have to leave. Leaving a trial will get you a not great grade, but its not like you are not going to replay majority of these trials over and over and over again anyways. You can improve and change your grade/rating on each one. I have enjoyed playing both single and multiplayer trails on this game. I have had barely any issues or reason to dislike it so far. I just know when to adult and take a short break between trials to handle RL stuff.

Game is co-operative horror survival without the PVP Killer with a lot of visual gore. Killers and bosses are non-player characters. There is no PVP and hope they dont ruin it with that rubbish. There is enough copy and paste of that style already. Hope they keep it the way it is, because thats what makes it unique and stands out. The behavior of the AI (killers/bosses) is astonishing in this and just so well polished compared to other games. Buddies and I were waiting on the release of a Triple A game, and we all had dabbled in this slightly before it. Now that the Triple A game is out, we all keep itching to want to come back to The Outlast Trials. We didn't expect this game to be as good as it was, that it is now a constant thought in the back of our minds.

Update: I decided to borrow my partners steam deck. This game ""works great"" on the steam deck. Though I could not find the slide button and couldnt see it in options for game pad controls, but I was glancing over it quickly. Later in the day I got back to my PC but I noticed when I played some of the keys were not working. The middle mouse button for emotes in game was not working on PC even after I tried resetting it again to the button its suppose to be, my slide function worked half the time, and I would get a warning that my rig was not ready, and it wouldnt work, though it was fully reloaded. I would have to scroll off of it then back onto it, but sadly that costed me damage several times cause it would randomly decide not to work. I also did not have a controller connected to my PC, so that wasnt a reason for the button being off. Validating my files right now on my PC after the issues I was having and it was during streaming X program levels at that. So fyi if you try to run this game off of both, it could cause an issue between the set ups. More than likely the PC end more so than the steam deck. Didnt have any issues on my PC prior with this game and never had it on the steam deck till today. So just a heads up.

Update: 2/25/2024
Really disappointed they took out Easterman's Dialogue when you finish individual trials. It use to be he would praise or scold you depending on how good you did or how bad you did. Sadly a friend and I returned to it and noticed a lot of changes and sadly he isnt saying anything when you finish a trial, going back into the ward region. Tried looking into this but didnt find any information as to why. Super super disappointed with that. Hoping they fix it and add it back in. We really enjoyed that part with everything else in the game.",1685237853,1708913675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I remained optimistic throughout the waiting period and I can say with absolute certainty that Red Barrels has done the impossible; properly adapt a traditionally single player game to a multiplayer game that's fun to play alone, with friends, and even randoms. 

Not only does the Outlast formula work with more than one player, but the core has been improved by adding new gameplay features that allow the player to distract, confuse, and disorient foes; things that were not present in Outlast, Whistleblower, or Outlast 2, such as throwing bottles to create an auditory distraction, bricks to stun enemies, and helpful items like adrenaline shots to run faster and for an extended duration and lockpicks to open containers that may contain loot essential to your survival. 

My two major complaints at the moment are that there's not nearly enough content at the moment to keep me coming back day after day, but that can be overlooked as the game is currently in early access as of writing this review, and that performance on a 1660ti with 8gb of ram can stutter quite a bit, but again, early access.

All in all, Red Barrels has something truly special here with Outlast Trials, and I wish the devs the best as the game is moulded into something that can be a treat for new and long time Outlast fans alike.",1686709072,1708909921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game never failed to scare me to the day I got it a few days after release day to now, though the more you play the less scary it becomes but still has you worry and stress every chase. The outlast games have a special place in my heart as they are the games that never fail to scare me.

The only downside currently would be to point that for the price it could have a few more missions since it currently has 3 Trials aka big Main Level missions with then having 2 or 3 different sub-missions in these Trials that are made with the same theme and assets but that use widely different configurations, so hopefully the addition of more Trials is done successfully with time as it's mentioned that it's indeed their plan in their FAQ.


[b] Update - Changed from Positive to Negative: [/b] 
Unfortunately with the release now scheduled and looming around they haven't addressed the lack of content in a meaningful way aside from re-using the same missions with different modifiers over and over again (made even worse for the grindy seasonal events they had for a few cosmetics pieces in which you had to do the same missions over and over again), and the kicker with trying to upsell cosmetic packs content to people that bought in Early Access for a mere discount instead of just giving it as a sign of appreciation for their support.",1685187691,1708558460,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

Whether you've played the original single-player Outlast games before this or not is irrelevant. Outlast Trials stands above every horror game in the genre. The team at Red Barrels takes the coop horror experience everyone knows and brings it to the highest levels possible in terms of pure adrenaline-inducing horror, excellent animations & attention to the worlds detail, along with masterful audio that I swear will have you screaming wherever you play this.  

So what do you do in this game? You are a patient (taken against your will) to essentially an MK-Ultra style mind control facility where the powers that be force you to undergo ""Trials"" that are meant to harden you and make you stronger in the face of pure horror & this game has so much of it. 

Each trial is a different location that has been turned into a grotesque extreme vision of whatever is being portrayed. Your job once inside is to do what Murkoff tells you & then get the hell out. Or die trying. Each character or enemy you encounter is intensely scary and satirical depending on who you get (I'm looking at you Coyle) with what I think is some of the best voice acting in the industry along with truly scary enemies physically as well.

Nothing is scarier after running room to room and being sliced up with everything wanting to hurt you in some way and you finally find a moment of ""safety"" hiding in a barrel or bathroom stall and you hear Mother Gooseberry's singing muffled on the other side of the wall getting closer to you. Or hearing your friends screams over the radio as you hear them get brutally assaulted by ""the dicked man"" as he chases them attacking the whole time. This game really is fucked up. But in the best ways.

If you want a truly horrific coop experience that looks so damn good you'll wonder why other games in the genre aren't even close, with sounds that are so realistic you'll be holding your breath to not miss what's coming around the corner, enemies that are so completely terrifying you'll literally be screaming running for your in-game life like it's real life, with levels that immerse you in every way so much so you'll think you can fucking smell it as the lighting, sound, darkness, and all of the wonderfully done set pieces and assets blend together into what I swear is an experience you have to see to understand. It is the scariest game I have ever played and in the genre it's the best there is. 

Are there some negatives to note? Yes. Quickly I'll say this game is the best to play with a friend or several (4 in total). Having your friends there, or even matchmaking while dealing with all this game throws at you is the most intense juggling act, and keeping everyone alive is so not easy. So if you're someone who solos games alone, although I believe you'll still have an amazing time it will not be easy and you'll come out of it like someone who was lost in the woods for 10 years trying to escape. 
Are there bugs? Some, but it's been less than 5 in the 60 hours I have played. Some were graphical and I think we had audio issues maybe once. 
I know some people might complain there's a lack of variety in the levels but dig this: there are I think 5 main levels currently (with the 6th coming in a month) but the replayability comes with the fact that they take those 5 maps and when they add new trials they'll reconfigure these maps and change them in totally different ways, sometimes unrecognizable with new enemies, different layouts, different objectives and for me the content has not ever lacked.

Some stuff I didn't touch on that's still amazing about this game: 
The lobby where you choose your trial you get your own cell/room that can be customized with all sorts of awesome decorations/cosmetics from good looking to guts on the night stand (your choice) kinda like the Sims in Hell. All of the cosmetics are unlocked by playing the game. Each trial rewards you X amount of cash + rewards like clothing cosmetics which are great. In the same lobby you can also play mini-games like arm wrestling & speed chess (which happens to be like the best 3D chess game on the market for some reason?). 

I'm sure I missed plenty of good, and maybe even some bad but with this game coming out of early access soon it's already the most polished horror experience on the market next to something like RE: Biohazard but because this is a coop experience also based in reality I think this stands above that as well. It's so well done and I love everything Red Barrels has made here. Completely recommend this experience & I can't wait to play the Toy Factory level when the game goes out from early access which is soon.

Combine this with objectives to do for each mission and finding resources. Its random as to how the levels will play out every time you start them. While it is fun, there are some technical issues that can sometimes get in the way, I think its a fun co-op horror game that is very enjoyable despite being repetitive. 

From my experience, once you have a good build going you will do well in the game. You'd have to go through co-op to get more XP and stages completed. Complete with unlocking all of your good amps, tier upgrades, rigs and upgrades for those rigs. I recommend unlocking stamina and exhaustion upgrades ASAP. As for rigs, I recommend unlocking stun, blind and healer rigs and upgrading those to the max. As a good starter rig, I suggest healer, because you can keep yourself alive and your sanity full. You can do the same for your teammates. In this case, if you can help yourself; you can help others. 

The key factor here is that this game a tedious Co-op play builds you for solo play. When you have good cards that you know how to play well; you will accomplish a lot. Also always explore the maps, look for items and a secret that be be unlocked (this is for co-op & solo).

The maps are confusing and it's easy to get lost but not in a bad way, it's clearly intentional and it makes it feel that much more high stakes. Leveling up and buying perks/rigs/pharmacy upgrades feels good and I like the badges as well. The reward system is very good overall. I also like that the same map layouts are different depending on which trial you select-like in the first set of trials, it's the same map but some gates will be locked off or doors will be closed. Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where your objectives are, but that's kind of the point I feel. Overall, I highly recommend this game for anyone that likes horror and gore. I'm looking forward to future updates!

Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?
SYNOPSIS

Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.
SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP

You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.
Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.
Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.

Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.
Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.
HIDE OR FLIGHT

In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.
The tools will allow you to
Stun enemies
Blind them
See through walls
Heal yourself and people around you.
Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.
CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION

Customize and create your own trial patient.
Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.
Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle.
Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?



INVESTIGATE

You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials.
Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.
The Process:
Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.
Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.
Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.",1706940959,1706940959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Trials span anywhere from 10 min to an 1 hour depending on the efficiency of your group. Recommend anywhere from 2-4 friends for maximum fun, but solo is always an option. There is a group finder but it can be frustrating due to difficulties finding people close to the same level of progress as yourself. Since a few fanatics have pretty much everything memorized, queuing with someone higher level than yourself can lead to them basically soloing the Trial. Overall I give the current game a 9/10 for anybody who likes horror types.

Edit: I hate the blind rig nerf, it makes the game harder and it's barley worth the effort to put down if it can barley keep the person blinded for just 10 seconds. The stun actually lasts longer than the blind and you can throw it instantly, i just think if it takes so long to deploy the mine down, it should at least keep some significant charge for how long it takes for the the smoke to dissipate and not have the same duration as the stun. it makes the blind rig not worth the trouble when you can get the same result with the stun, I currently do not like the current balancing of the rigs. Just make the blind rig smoke duration last longer than the stun  if it takes 5 seconds to put down the mine, it doesnt make since for both rig to have the same stun duration if the blind rig takes longer to put down.

**DISCLAIMER** I will say the things that I enjoy:
1.Progression in the game is very linear.
2. Creative styles to the game making you find your preference in play style. (Aggro, Defensive & Variable) 
3. The increasing in speed as you learn new maneuvers, shortcuts and preservation of resources. 

The things I do not enjoy:

1. What I found after achieving rebirth 6 times is the mundane and redundant aspect to the game. You definitely begin to hit a brick wall in this game for sure.
2. The development of the Antagonists is slightly incorrectly tuned, leaving us getting poor interactions and false hits. An example: When hit by a Grunt, if you are overlapping the Grunt you inadvertently become stuck between them and can sometimes die in one fell swoop.
3. Everything becomes so painfully repetitive. Yes, you're doing previous trials to become successful in Program X, but there is no real difference in Program X and leaves me feeling like ""Ah, so they quickly worked something to kind of was our throats down with something.

ALL AND ALL: I enjoyed the come up of this game, having a full week of free time and an appetite to continue on with this game, my friends and I successfully beat the game in a week. There is plenty of content, definitely worth every penny! I would totally try and play this COOP and NOT alone! It's very doable alone, but COOP makes it so much more fun and faster!

To fresh eyes this game can be difficult to start with. after about 20-30hrs of gameplay i started to figure out the mechanics and enemy limits and worked out the objectives and maps to the point i no longer feel the fearful immersion i did at the start. Human condition amirite. So basically after 109hrs, i now feel desensitised as i feel I've mastered all there is to know about this game and am now at the stage of optimising my routes and aiming for A+ scores each trial so i can unlock the best loot. This game will reach a peak for me where i won't feel the need to play anymore and i'm going to guess within another 20hrs of gameplay.

I hope that there are efforts made to increase the fearful immersion in the game as the enemy AI can be easily exploited once their habits are worked out. Additionally a lot of the loot is a bit lacklustre and some feel like re-skins. I would love for there to be more prestigious rewards for become Reborn (this game's prestige system).

The latest installment of this great series confirms the above attributes. This time in coop mode up to 4 players. The protagonists are laboratory mices who go through all kinds of endurance experiments similar to the Saw movies, in order to earn their freedom (which can still be earned in Murkoff or?). Hide and seek type of game also! If you are so nostalgic for the core solo gameplay, you can also play solo, but that is not the point of this game. The thing people are mixing up is that this is not Outlast 3, this is a brand new game (spin-off we can say) in the Outlast universe. Chronologically, Outlast Trials takes place before the horrors of the previous games, during the Cold War. I can say that the game works great, excellent optimization, without many bugs and stuttering. A rarity these days anyway. Trials are designed (judging by the game interface) to be seasonal. What does that mean? In my opinion, each season will have several Trials that will most likely be sold in packs (or come as free updates after completion). They just need to add precious content to the game that keeps it alive and people will surely love it! 
Surely I recommend this game for people that have group of friends to share horror together. If you think you are for solo experience, also this game can be fun! All in all, great idea, Im very glad Im here from very start and I will sure follow game development and contribute as much as I can through feedback!
You will love this game!

EDIT (27.10.2023.)

After few months of waiting, finally we are able to dive into Halloween Update for Outlast Trials featuring new map, new variator, new MK challenges, new skins, limited Halloween time Programs after which Weekly challenges are coming! Very excited to play this game. A lot of grind ahead of us. Game is fun. Few bugs or lags are quickly fixed. I just hope devs release this on consoles ASAP to get even more players and surely they need to speed up update process (at least small updates per month will be okay). 
Hoping to see more of the Trials in the future, but my review after 5 months stays unchanged - I greatly recommend this game! It worth of money!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT(29.1.2024.)
After 3 months nothing... not an single valid update for this game. Im angry and disappointed in develompent of this game. You can have people dry on dock for such a long time, its counter productive, even people can see it through player numbers, roughly 1000 players per day... thats nothing... Whoever thought this is good idea to keep players in dark for so long and to play with their patience is not good dev... 
Even on DC NOBODY can tell me about any updates... everything is silent and its frustrating and I can see why people are giving up from this game...
Im putting my review on negative because of this, for now...",1685141937,1706566351,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The story is all related to the Murkoff Corporation at their prime. It's so great to feel again the goosebumps of the Asylum. Lore works so good with real history and actual gameplay!

For example the fact that player can hit enemies or the multyplayer feature... and the ending.

I find myself playing just for the sheer enjoyment, appreciating the dynamic nature of each match with RNG ensuring a unique experience every time. Achieving an A+ on all the programs is immensely satisfying and makes me feel accomplished.

However, one minor gripe I have is that program X tends to get repetitive after a while. On the positive side, I adore the variety of enemies, Rigs, and Amps, which keeps the experience fresh and exciting.

On the flip side, I'm not thrilled about the repeated nerfs to the Blind rig. It can be frustrating when a favorite gets toned down. Additionally, the weekly rewards seem a bit lackluster, mainly providing posters. It would be fantastic if they offered cosmetic items like skins instead, adding more flair to the game.

I also wish there were more options for decorating my in-game room. Having a broader range of decorations would allow for more personalization and enhance the overall gaming experience.

It has enough content to feel like a pretty full game. It took me about 22 hours to get through the first 3 Trials, and I've added another 3 just doing the first 2 parts of the new one, and I haven't even touched the ""weekly"" trials they've added in yet, which adds a twist to the Trials that you already know. 

Let's start with the Rig: 

Your life line and one true friend through everything (until it gets disabled in some areas in the new map). You have access to 4 different types of rigs at the moment: Stun, X-Ray, Heal, and Blind. Blind and Stun are relatively similar, though the Stun rig gives you a little modified radio that explodes on impact whereas the Blind rig gives you a mine you place on the ground. X-Ray lets you see through walls and mark enemies as well as items for your team to see. Heal emits a healing mist and can improve your sanity.  Personally, I like to run the Stun rig, as I find myself running from enemies with very little idea of a plan most of the time.  Rigs also come in tiers, so you can upgrade them with tickets that you earn from gaining levels through surviving the trials. 

Enemies: 

The game has decent enemy variety. Nothing too crazy. Where the enemies really begin to shine is with the Prime Assets. Currently, you only have 2 Prime Assets currently in game and those are: 

Leland ""Why you runnin'"" Coyle and Mother Gooseberry featuring Dr. Futterman. HOWEVER, there is a third PA and that is Prescott Whitehorn, who will most likely be added in the next big content drop. 

Coyle is the cop that you'll see in the prison and courthouse Trials, and Gooseberry will be in the Orphanage and ""Fun"" Fair. The areas you find them in really attest to who they are as characters, as Coyle is very much on the ""justice"" train whereas Gooseberry is more whimsical and definitely won't stab you in the mouth with drill-duck. 

There are also plenty of other enemy types running around, including X-Ray eyes, A dude with a tank filled with gas that drives you insane if he catches you, a guy that will scream so loud it'll burst your ear drums if you get close,  yourself ( who's definitely not an imposter), and 2 variations of giant hulking monstrosities that will smack smack fear into you. 

I didn't mention one enemy type, and that's because he's not really real. He's all in your head, but some called it The Skinner Man. 

Maps: 

The maps in this game are amazing. Each Trial has it's own theme, and the theme carries throughout the main trial plus the side missions. There is procedural generation, so each time you play a trial again, you won't be able to take the exact same path, which is fun and keeps things fresh. Each key item is also placed differently each time, so you can't just run to the same spot each time you play through again and again. 

Each map is also littered with traps. Some of these are simple and don't really effect you like noise traps (broken glass or hanging cans), but some can really mess you up like the trapped doors that launch a spike into your chest and then proceed to emit a gas that drives you insane if you can't get it out fast enough.

Prescriptions and Amps: 

These are items that buff you as a character. They can't be taken away through the trial mutations or gates that disable your rig. These are the things that you can ALWAYS count on to be there. They do very simple things like give you more health or let you walk across broken glass without making a sound. 

Prescriptions go down a list like with your Rig, but you can buy Amps in any order (assuming you have them unlocked). Amps can make or break your build though, but don't be afraid to experiment.

Cosmetics: 

These are just fun and good looking. If you play well enough and ""beat"" the game, you earn one Legendary outfit, but the rest of the cosmetics can be earned by leveling up and completing trials for the first time. Some items are also available from the Limited-Time modes like the Christmas and Halloween events. You can also earn cosmetics for your room, which just lets you add a nice touch to an otherwise bleak and sad main facility. 

Overall, if you haven't heard of this game or are on the fence about it, don't be. This is what EA should be, and even on launch this game had so much to offer. Updates to the actual content side of things aren't particularly speedy (we waited almost 7 months for the new trial), but Red Barrels is going for the quality over quantity mindset. That being said, there probably will be a ton of content so long as they can keep dreaming up these nightmare scenarios, and we all know they can.

Lastly, if the Early Access tag scared you off originally, the game launches into 1.0 on March 5th of this year and will include another new Trial, bringing the total to 5 trials and hours upon hours of running around with friends trying to survive.",1705898884,1705898884,True,1,0,0.486853271722793579,0,True,False,True

MASTERCLASS GAME.
I CANNOT STRESS HOW FUN THIS IS!!!

There are some things that DO need work.
For example: 
Enemy ai, it can be buggy/dumb at random times.
More difficultly and random options (like randomly selected mutators for each trial that's customizable). 

After playing for even more hours, there is some negative differences compared to the closed beta:

The animation when you alert the screamer and get stunned is gone for some reason (maybe they had a last minute bug with it?). And while this is happening you're still able to interact with objects and doors.

I FEEL like they've removed some lines or change them, as I feel like it's not as impactful as the closed beta.

Some chase music has been removed. But a couple have been added as well it seems. 

Skinner man before full on sprinted after you at times and it was absolutely terrifying. Now, when you get get psychosis it's just a walk in the park with him slowly casually walking towards you while he thinks he's literally him (he's not)

Overall: Keep in mind the points I listed are still very minor and very possible to be adjusted and fixed over the course of early access, which I'm sure they will be. The game is still extremely fun and if you have to money to buy this game... BUY THIS GAME!

I would recommend this game as there are plenty of trials to keep you busy for roughly a month, depending on how you play. Just know that there is nothing else (as of this writing) after the game is completed.",1705803364,1705803413,True,0,0,0.473933637142181396,0,True,False,True

But the result of developers efforts is marvellous and innovative experience for the genre.
Is it scary? Just as much as first two entries.
Do you have to play co-op? No, you can play the whole experience solo, if you wish so. I actually found it to be more difficult to play co-op, than solo as of current game balance.

Really the only thing the game needs is just more content. Everything in the game is great but it needs more missions, enemy variety, some more minigames.

Let me explain as someone that works a full-time job and trying to enjoy The Outlast Trials on my free time:

Playing solo can be obnoxious:
You can play the trials by yourself if you want to, however you are more than likely going to be spending over an hour on one trial. Most of which you are hiding in the same spot If you're being too careful trying to slowly inch the objective towards its destination. Because someone thought It was a good idea to have way too many enemies roaming around in some of the same locations close to one another. Making it so that if you have to hide in those spots it's nearly impossible to try to do something without getting detected. And the last thing I want to be doing in my free time trying to play a game is spending most of my hour and a half in our trial hiding in the same closet for a good half of the time trying to avoid detection. It's annoying and frustrating to get through these alone, and it's really apparent that Red Barrels Studios primarily focused this to be a multiplayer game rather than a single player. However...

Playing Multiplayer can be boring:
You have people that play this game waaaaay too much to the point where they know exactly what they're doing. So if you're coming in fresh and if you have someone that is at least five times the level that you are, prepared to get carried.
I have had a few games where I was struggling to survive and try to find objectives to help out, only for them to mostly be done because the other people I was playing with already nabbed the objective and solved it without me knowing. Making me feel rather useless in my endeavors and feeling like I've wasted 10 to 15 minutes of my time roaming around aimlessly in hallways while everyone is moving at the speed of a bullet straight towards the objectives. And given the nature and layout of some of the trials, I imagine that some of the objectives are hardly randomized, meaning if you've already completed that trial, you already know what to do and where to go to solve it.

How to enjoy the game ""Just right"":
So on one end you have trials that are taking too long, and then on the other you have trials there are finishing too fast. Both, to me at least, our very frustrating experiences when trying to enjoy this game.
The only way I can think to be able to enjoy it is to play it blindly with a group of friends who also don't know much about it. Meaning that way you all can start fresh, learn how the game works together and playing the trials at a decent length of time. From the few times I have experienced it, I believe two players is the perfect number to be playing with. Just you and one other person, four people may end up ending the trial a little too early, even if all people playing did not have previous knowledge of how to play it. 

In conclusion, I would not recommend playing this game, at least by yourself.
Make plans to play this with someone close to you who hasn't played the game either and enjoy the fun and horrors together. I don't think I'm going to be able to do that now that I have knowledge of some of these Trials myself, and that some of my closest friends have already played quite a number of hours into this game.

I don’t typically write reviews for the majority of games that I play on Steam, but I wanted to give The Outlast Trials an early access review before the full game releases in March because I love this game so much. Now this review is a short version of an original one that I had, but I had to delete a lot of stuff because it was over the word count. So this review will be me talking about the most important parts from that review. So feel free to skip ahead and read whatever part you want. This review might have some minor spoilers but I’ll try to not give anything huge away just in case someone new is reading this and is interested in playing this game. 

MY STATS:

I’ve been playing this game since June and at the time of writing this I have over 650 hours played, have all of the customization and progression, and have 116 Reagents Released/Rebirths. I pretty much have 100% of this game so far and with those kinds of stats I guess I’m considered to be one of the “Veteran Players'' now. I wanted to mention this to show that I’ve been playing this game ever since it came out on Steam for Early Access, so I know what I’m talking about.  

DIFFICULTY/CO-OP:

This game is pretty difficult for someone playing for the first time or for someone that’s never really played any of the other Outlast games before, so I highly recommend playing this with friends. You can still play this game solo and it’s still possible to beat the more difficult Trials solo. I also recommend playing with friends because this game is so much fun with more people. “Yeah, that’s the problem with teams…if you don’t win together, then you die together.” -Blisk. This quote from Titanfall 2 best sums up the co-op in this game. 

IT’S STILL AN OUTLAST GAME: 

One of my biggest worries about this game when first starting out was that Trials wouldn’t feel like an Outlast game. But trust me when I say that The Outlast Trials 100% feels like an Outlast game. It still has the running and hiding mechanics, it mostly has the same Night Vision mechanics, and Outlast still hasn’t lost its identity over the years. Which is something I can’t really say for a lot of other games that I’ve played before. And no, this isn’t a Dead by Daylight copy. I get why people compare these two games and talk about their similarities. Which is fine, but I strongly disagree with the small percentage of people that say that this game is a copy. To me, Outlast Trials is literally just Outlast but with co-op multiplayer, nothing more than that really. And another thing that’s important to mention is that this isn’t Outlast 3. Sure it’s the third game in the series, but Red Barrels have stated that this is a prequel and is not the “official” third game story wise. To my knowledge Red Barrels have said that they’re going to be making Outlast 3 after Outlast Trials is fully done, and I'm also very excited about that.

NOT REALLY A STORY MODE:

One thing that I will say that is really different from the first two games is that Outlast Trials doesn’t really have a story mode. The closest thing to a story mode that it has is the Tutorial in the beginning, and the Endings. I guess you can play the whole game solo and you can kind of count that as a story mode but it’s not really the same in my opinion. If you want to play another Outlast story mode, then the best thing to do is honestly just wait for Outlast 3 after Outlast Trials is fully done.

RELIGIOUS HORROR ELEMENTS: 

One of the core aspects I think that make up Outlast is the Christianity/religious horror elements. They’re present in all of the games and It’s definitely here in Outlast Trials. To start off talking about this I want to mention one very important thing: I’m not Christian/religious. I wanted to mention this to tell what my perspective is on this kind of horror, and how you think I formed this opinion. Anyway to start, the religious horror elements are really good and in my honest opinion I think it even works better than Outlast 2. I don’t want to talk about what happens in the actual game because that might be potential spoilers for someone new that might be reading this. But what I love about the religious horror is that it’s all on one map, and all on one program: The Orphanage/Program 3. Because #1: I think that the religious horror works best in Outlast as more of the side horror and not the main horror, unlike Outlast 2. And #2: It also makes the Program it’s in stand out a lot more, which I feel like all of the Programs should be: Unique. I absolutely loved the way Red Barrels handled it in the game.

SMALL DEVELOPMENT TEAM:

One of the things that I feel like I need to remind a lot of the people that play this game is that Red Barrels is a relatively small development team of around 50 people. Why is this important? It’s important because they can’t update this game 24/7. I’ve seen SO many impatient people talk about how this game needs to get more updates/content or this game will die. I understand why they think this, but my biggest piece of advice is be patient and notice that this isn’t like CoD where you have 3+ AAA game development teams working on this. No matter how popular this game will get, it’ll still be an indie game because of how relatively small the team is. There’s nothing wrong with massive development teams, but just give Red Barrels some slack. Sure it would be nice to see more, but for right now I think that they’re doing a good job with the updates on this game. 

REPETITIVENESS: 

Now one of the biggest criticisms I see for this game is how repetitive it is and how this could lead to them getting bored of the game. That criticism is honestly very fair and I do see why a lot of people think that, but I don’t know if this is just me, but I’ve never really gotten bored of this game once. I’ve definitely felt at some parts it got a little repetitive like trying to go for 100 Reagents Released/Rebirths to get that 100 Trophy, and grinding Program Geister to get all of the cosmetics. But I don’t think I’ve ever truly gotten bored of the game. I’ve also seen people talk about how little replay value this game has. Personally, I heavily disagree with this and I think this game has a ton of replay value. For proof, I just like for you to look at how many hours I have. To be fair, most of the replay value I got from this game is from meeting and playing with a ton of other people. If this game was singleplayer then I would have way less hours in the game. But again I definitely do see how some people thinks that it's kind of repetitive. It’s most likely me that just feels the opposite from this though. 

CONCLUSION/FINAL RATING: 

I absolutely love The Outlast Trials and I absolutely love the Outlast series as a whole. I know it’s kind of stupid to say this but the Outlast games have a special place in my heart and I still think the Outlast series are still the scariest horror games that you can play. And I think that the Outlast Trials is the scariest horror co-op out there. (And yes, I have played Lethal Company if anyone is wondering.) I think The Outlast Trials is my favorite in the series, but I still think that the first Outlast is objectively better though. I give The Outlast Trials a solid 9/10 and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play a horror game with friends. Or just want to play with friends. It’s obviously on the mature side, but you probably knew this by just looking at trailers/the game rating. I’ve always been very optimistic for this game’s future and I hope Red Barrels still adds more content for this game because I absolutely love it.

This game lacks in a lot of areas, I think for starters the A.I is somehow less intelligent than a fucking zombie, you turn around a corner and they lose you instantly, the enemies aren't even scary for a horror game and I never feel like I'm at risk I am just more annoyed at how animation based the entire mechanics are because this guy will swing at me and his hit box goes across the map and since you are in the animation you are forced to get hit despite you being far enough away from the attack that it shouldn't have hit. That COULD be a tick-rate issue but I still need to play some more to for sure rule it out, regardless any game with animation based movements and attacks are always going to be a problem when syncing to other computers on the servers.

I think the item management is a drag and could be better, like for example dropping and item, switching an item are all clunky although it is helpful when you can give a player an item, dropping and item or switching it out is pretty annoying especially when the item just drops to the floor and then you have to angle your cross hair right to where it is on the ground to pick the item up and sometimes it goes to where the item you picked up instead, I do not know if its dependent on if you were moving or its just a bug.

I think they need to have more enemy variety as well, its the same 5 types of enemies for every trial, big guy, girl with puppet, guy saying some schizo shit with a machete, guy who screams really loud, and scarecrow.

I hope that when this game comes out of early access after they stop getting concurrent players (i would say like 200 people or something) theyll take it out of early access to get hype or something and then the player base drops again. So I hope red barrels adds more meaningful changes instead of just pulling a call of duty and adding a bunch of bloat cosmetics and bare-bones ""trials"" that have the same 5 enemy types to drive up the file size. I would (as someone who wants this game to do good) like it if they improve the A.I. to be a lot more interesting and unique to one another and their own behaviors and interactions, make the trials more interesting, and make the game feel more rewarding.",1704924465,1704924465,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Outlast and Outlast 2 were amazing but always wanted that ""roaming away from the storyline"" and that is now possible in Outlast Trials with different trials and different programmes.

My food tray is untouched everytime i look at it, also i have a nice line-up of aclohol bottles, too bad they’re not real, i would like to have a glass of corn bourbon…  glad i still have my coffee can. “Can you see it” says the poster on the cold wall.

May-August.
first experience.
Tried to be a good team player, and i think i still am,   i helped those “we’re friends and inseparable, do whatever you want by yourself”, i protected them, shared stuff with them, was useful, but all i got is “will you start helping us, or you going to continue hiding ?!” couldn’t bare this self entitled sh*t, so i waited until they complete all valves in “grind the bad apples”, it took them 40 minutes to finally reach the culmination point, afterwards i ran like hell to the exit, got to the shuttle all alone, initiated the countdown, watched them get bleeding, executed, both dead, got so much joy for the rest of the day, grind the bad seeds indeed….


November.
i feel changes… many new faces around, someone said we will have real halloween, that would be great…
it wasn’t easy, at all…

December.
Try to help them all, all of them, even if they locked in opposite area beyond your reach, dead in few minutes after arrival, broke your silence, stepped trap, or creating chaos. merry xmas.",1684975402,1704670830,True,3,1,0.559918761253356934,0,True,False,True

But as it stands it seems like playing on single player is nigh impossible with the high difficulty level of the trials and no way to adjust the difficulty settings. It seems like it is more adjusted to playing multiplayer rendering playing on single player frustrating and unfun and more of a chore than a fun game. 

Since the game is in early access I hope the devs will tweak this to make it more single player friendly. I understand it was primarily meant to focus more on playing together but thats not the best when none of your friends play or want to play.

Outlast Trails is an exceptional game, The atmospheric design is truly commendable, immersive environment. The gameplay itself is a amazing, keeping me engaged and excited, ensuring that boredom remains a distant thought. The game has minimal bugs as well which is a welcome change with how alot of games have been recently.

However, the challenge lies in connecting with other players, particularly for specific trails. it takes ages and alot of the time will fail due to many different reasons and when you get into a lobby with a team the host suddenly changes to a completely different trail.

another issue is some players skill levels, even at higher levels, who seem content with staying in the background, leaving the heavy lifting to others. Unfortunately, the game fails to adequately reward those who actively contribute to completing objectives, reviving teammates, keeping people alive with rigs ect, a feature that could significantly enhance the overall gaming experience.

Overall, Outlast Trails shines when played with friends especially is a great game and i cant wait for the full game release, which i hope has more trails to explore with new enemies and challenges",1704571924,1704572335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is decently fun with friends when you try to solve puzzles together as a squad. However, enemies usually camp objectives or have BS spawns and that turns it into a really frustrating and unfair experience. The game in it's current stage also lacks replayability, as such it forces you to replay levels you have completed in a harder difficulty. I've completed the game and 'freed' my character and see no point in playing the game any further.

All in all, the game has potential but can be really tedious to sit through.

Yes, buy it (only if you have friends to play with)

Long Review:
Outlast Trials is a fun and intense horror multiplayer game, at first it's like creepy level of scary; however it later on turns into a survival challenge game where you basically try to get a good rank and complete objectives without getting hit every damn second.
This game with friends is a 100% recommended and should be a def buy if you and your friends like horror or intense games. The only downside is that they should add like more things to do after you finish almost everything but it is a nitpick because I have like almost 17 hours and I didn't rebirth yet. Last thing to keep in mind is that it still would be fun solo, but it's gonna be insanely hard (it's already hard enough while playing with idiotic friends).

I really enjoy this game. My only complaint is that, generally, I prefer solo play over multiplayer and the number of objectives in a match is not balanced for solo players, so it's much more difficult to play solo than in groups, especially when you start.

Note that after a couple of weeks I'm up to level 15, have a couple of rigs, Rx, and amps unlocked, which has made the game much, much less difficult than at the start, so don't be discouraged if the game seems overwhelming, just group up with randoms and get those levels up.",1704203260,1704203260,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It reminds me a lot of independent titles like Devour or Lunch Lady, but much more polished with an adequate budget. The community is great and the gameplay is incredibly addicting. My first impression of the game left me in awe of how great the graphics and environments are. The difficulty is well balanced and the AI is largely competent and cunning. 

The Outlast Trials is an immensely enjoyable title for horror junkies and a must have for fans of co-op PvE games. Long-time Outlast followers may potentially be torn due to the lack of an in-depth single player experience, it's certainly to be enjoyed with friends.

Likes/Pros: your character starts off mediocre, a victim, everyone in the match as a villain NPC has more power than you and all you can do is run. The grind is not to bad, you quickly are rewarded for finishing matches or failing, you still get XP for failing. Once you level up, the game becomes so fun. 

Co-op communications are fantastic, the community is great. The modification to voice as you move through the levels is entirely immersive. For example, a laboratory or morgue will apply an echo to your communications with your friends in the same room.

Matchmaking, you may select to pair with people in the trials you want to do specifically, or the program or any type of available matchmaking. It's curated to support your journey through the trials how you want to play it.

When your leveled up, you feel powerful, you feel fast, you feel confident you can interact and engage and disengage with enemies. You grow confidence, and then you get yourself murdered from that confidence, it's so funny!!! I spend so much time on the floor because I think I'm going to go do this and contribute and help and save people!!! Only to get kicked through a door and end up crawling away from the beast of a man who assaulted me.

Cons: 
If you are solo and you do not like playing with random players, you may not enjoy it as much. As I will elaborate below, the community is very great though It is worth sticking to it. If you do not own a headset the ping system and emoticon wheel for communications is sufficient but it is much better with a headset and voice chat.

 I keep saying that I wish they could develop an ability to shoulder check an enemy as I am running. As this mechanic does not exist, I cannot help but appreciate the fact that they have given very little fight to the player because after all the game is supposed to have you play the role of a victim.

Do not be deterred by trying the game and failing right from the start. The game shines in co-op, solo play is ok, but nothing is more enjoyable than co-op. The community is spectacular. There is a lot of bad toxic communities out there for games and this game is uniquely not one of them. Everyone I have played with has not been a selfish individual but team focused, everyone I've played with who has a headset has been super friendly, educational if gameplay mechanics are not understood and in general an absolute pleasure.

I play this game with my wife, I play this game with my friends, I Play it after work when nobody is available and so I go on runs with rando's. it is hella fun and such a panic of fun. I have never laughed so much in a game and I'm about 20 hours into the game, it just seems to scratch the itch of social fun with friends like you might experience in an escape room in real life but a lot more fun because you can cowboy and get your ass kicked for silly behavior.

I cannot count how many times I hear a friend giggling running into my room while I'm hiding with a big naked giant person chasing him with an axe. 

I was not very interested in the single player versions of outlast I will admit, I did try them and I think DLC content but it never really appealed to me. Outlast trials is entirely a different experience, I would place this game up amongst the ranks of games like Left 4 dead, dead by daylight, the Hunt showdown etc. Not that it is anything like those games it is uniquely its own brand but I hold those games in very high regard and so does the community and this game ranks amongst them.

For the first time in years i played a game that i had insane amounts of fun at. The game is being selled for €29.99 and i love the fact that Red Barrels didn't add any way of transactions in this game for cosmetics or anything at all, the only way to get good at this game and get cosmetics such as Cell Decorations, clothing and skins for your character is simply done throught grinding the game, leveling up and completing new Trials or even ones you've already completed which will still reward you with xp, Murkoff Dollars and level up rewards.

Lore: The Outlast Trials take place in the year 1959 aka a couple years before the events of Outlast 1 and 2. The Murkoff Corporation conducts group experiments for CIA program MKUltra. You are a drug addict that lives in the streets and is one that the society wouldn't mind losing, so one day you find a poster/invitation to join the Murkoff Corporation Industry but why? When you join the doctors will make experiments on your body to change who u are to pretty much change society's point of view on yourself because they will understand that they lost someone important, and that someone is you.

Gameplay: In my opinion this game finally brings something fresh to the gaming industry after so many years and tears of companies ripping off eachother and releasing the same broken games over and over (Battle Royales, Arena Shooters and much more). The game comes with a great Coop mode which i would say is honestly one of the best we've seen in any Coop title. You can partner up with up to 4 people forming a squad and taking on the Challenge of the Trials together. The game came out 18th of May this year and since then they've added new in-game holiday events such as a Halloween and a christmas event and on top of that brand new trials for people to grind. As of right now the game features 4 different and unique Programs with their own and different Trials and Program X which you can beat to earn your freedom (won't touch upon this Program due to spoilers). When grinding this game you can unlock different cosmetics, Amps which are small abbilities that you either Sprint for longer, bash through doors while running, slide while running, make no noise when you step on broken glass that would otherwise make noise to alert enemies of your location and many more that even can't think of cause we'd be here for hours. There is a feature called Rig's, there are 4 of them and each one has it's unique abbility for every playstyle aka Solo or Squaded up. Rig 1: Is a device called ""STUN"" which whenever you hit an enemy with it you temporarely stun them and disorient them. Rig 2: is a Mine you place on the ground that when is stepped on by an enemy releases a ""BLINDING SMOKE"" that makes any enemy type blind for a duration of time. Rig 3: is a ""HEALING CANISTER"" that releases a healing cloud around you for yourself and your teammates if they are close to you. Rig 4: is called ""X-RAY"" and makes it so you can see enemies through walls and ping them for you teammates or is also really good if you are planning to go solo in the trials. I'm not gonna touch upon what missions you do in the trials cause that is gonna spoil the fun.

Characters and Maps: The Outlast Trials offer a huge variety of enemies, some more memorable than other but it is what it is, The First Trial you'll be mainly hunted down by ""THE COP"" who has a really cool design in my opinion and has a shock stick so he better not catch you roaming around. And the other one is ""THE MOTHER"" she is my favorite one easily, her voice actor did a great job and her design and lore is just pretty sick, her abbility is that she has a little puppet on her left arm with a drill in it's mouth so if she catches you then yeah. her lore is that she loves to skin people's faces and put them on Manekins and too be fair after you play Program 2 and 3 you'll realise that it's not only faces she likes to skin, super freaky and insanely cool at the same time. All of the Maps in the game are just way too good and really well designed to be honest, the game thus far has only four maps but even more trials so it's not one trials per map. this game has more content than what meets the eye at first. First we have the ""Police Station"", ""The Fun Park"", ""The Orphanage"" and finally ""The Courthouse"" until they realese more ofcourse.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack and Score of this game is just way too based and knows exactly what it wants to be without it trying to be a certain way it can't. Huge congrats on the guy who made the entire Soundtrack and the orchestra.

Verdict: The Outlast trials is as of right now on sale due to the holydays for about €21.99 and it's normal price is €29.99. In my opinion if you are a long time Dead By Daylight fan and you are looking for something new and more fresh of a horror experince, The Outlast Trials will do you just that favor. It's an amazing Coop game and even if you play Solo and have no friend you can still matchmake and find people to play with so you can make yourself friends and meet new people. This game is an insanely fun ride to go through even Solo or with friends and trust me, with friends? it's on another level cause this game is actually scary.
I love the games that are paid and don't have a battle pass system or any in-game purchases at all because that's how games should be, because it also ruins all the fun. Someone could grind their ass off to get a certain cosmetic and someone else is just gonna buy it with real money to just flex it which really shouldn't be the way and i love that this game is this way.

I'll give this game 10 because it knows what it's trying to be and the devs clearly know what they are doing, and let's not forget that the dev team is roughly around 100 people and when they made Outlast 2 they were around 20 people and just shows you what type of insane quality a team can put on a project if they are willing and passionate about it, Thank You Red Barrels.

Instead, I was chased through darkened corridors by Leatherface's wife, that one dude from the Village People, some drug-fueled, Slenderman-like apparition, and many dudes hanging dong! 

Depending on who you are that sort of thing could be a dream come true, or your worst nightmare. I personally loved it, and feel that it's pretty much par for the course for an Outlast game. Red Barrels keeps upping the ante with this series, and The Outlast Trials certainly doesn't disappoint. It looks and sounds fantastic, there are plenty of upgrades and cosmetics to earn, and if you're like me and prefer to play through these games solo, you absolutely can do so without it ruining the experience. By that last part I mean that this is a pretty fair game in that it's not too hard to run solo, as you're given a few retries in a trial if you die, and you can even unlock more if you can find some pills. You definitely don't need to be some elite/pro gamer to do this alone. 

And sure, it might be a little repetitive, but if you stick it out it's worth it - the ending will blow your mind!

P.S.   Red Barrels - now that you're mostly finished with this, and the console release is on the horizon, give us Outlast 3 (please and thank you!)",1703825212,1703825212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The standout feature of ""The Outlast Trials"" is its cooperative gameplay, setting it apart from earlier titles. Collaborating with friends or fellow gamers to navigate the eerie Cold War-era mental asylum adds an extra layer of tension and strategy. Coordinating movements, sharing resources, and relying on each other in terrifying moments of chaos create an immersive and nerve-wracking experience unlike any other in the survival horror genre.

The game's atmospheric design is simply exceptional. From the flickering lights casting eerie shadows to the hauntingly realistic audio, every detail contributes to a sense of impending dread. The asylum's diverse environments keep you constantly on edge, never allowing a moment of complacency as you uncover the disturbing secrets lurking within its walls.

The developers' attention to storytelling shines brightly in ""The Outlast Trials."" The narrative intricately weaves through the challenges, keeping players engaged and eager to discover the truth behind the sinister experiments taking place. The characters' depth and the unfolding plot twists add an emotional weight that drives the gameplay forward.

Gameplay mechanics are polished and intuitive. The incorporation of stealth, problem-solving, and timed actions keeps the gameplay dynamic and engaging. The sense of vulnerability against the relentless adversaries and the limited resources available heighten the adrenaline rush, ensuring that every encounter is heart-pounding and memorable.

Additionally, the replayability factor is commendable. Multiple paths, choices, and endings encourage revisiting the asylum, offering a fresh experience with each playthrough.

In summary, ""The Outlast Trials"" is a masterclass in cooperative horror gaming. Red Barrels has once again proven their prowess in delivering a nerve-wracking, immersive, and deeply haunting experience. Brace yourself for a chilling adventure that will linger in your mind long after the lights are back on.",1703670779,1703670779,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

First off, the atmosphere, right? It's like being in a horror movie, but you're the star. The flickering lights, the shadows, it's all very moody. I felt like I was in some messed-up episode of a sci-fi show. Gave me the creeps, but in a strangely satisfying way. Like when you find a fiver in your old jacket pocket—unsettling, but not entirely bad.

The co-op thing surprised me. I'm used to fending for myself, but teaming up with mates, it added a different vibe. You're all in this together, trying not to become monster chow. It's like a twisted team-building exercise. Who knew getting scared witless could bring people closer?

The puzzles, though—they're a bit head-scratching. I mean, I'm not the smartest bloke, but some of those had me feeling like I missed a memo or something. But hey, a bit of challenge never hurt anyone, right? Keeps the brain cells on their toes.

Controls, well, they're not too shabby. Took a bit to get used to, like trying to teach an old dog new tricks, but once you get the hang of it, you're off. Although, I did find myself running into walls more often than I care to admit. Must be a virtual version of my life.

Graphics are decent, too. Not Hollywood blockbuster quality, but I wasn't expecting that. The monsters, the setting, it all adds to the spookiness. I'd say it's like a B-movie that you secretly enjoy.

In the end, ""The Outlast Trials"" is a good time, if you're into that sort of thing. It's like a rollercoaster—you scream, you laugh, and when it's over, you're glad you did it. Just make sure you've got some mates to share the frights with. Four stars from me—solid effort, scary, but not pants-ruining scary.",1703530717,1703530717,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The problem is a lack of variety, mainly in the enemies, specifically the big figureheads. The Outlast series is known for its memorable killers and sadists, but the game only gives two notable ones.

Four maps but only two of them, you’ll be seeing them a lot and the intrigue and fascination wears off fast due to this. The generic enemies are done great but the major ones could be better.

Map design is great, gameplay is fun, difficulty can spike with the modifiers. Some difficulty ultimately derides from the maze like layout and sometimes same-y looking corridors and rooms, with no clear direction as to where the objective may be.

But that’s a problem only really in the later, more difficult missions.

Progression is interesting, it’s all stuff to give you the advantage which you will need as more and more is thrown at you.

Game just needs more notable characters and more frequent content updates, as with the start of early access to now, they’ve only added one new map to my knowledge. And with news that release will also only add one more, I fear the monotony this game will have.

Grab it on sale, 30 dollars is not a good price for the current state, but 20 bucks? Yeah that’s worth it.",1703480582,1703480582,True,4,1,0.531811952590942383,0,True,False,True

Or how about you didn't even know there weren't any checkpoints to begin with so you quit the game and planned to get on later? Welp. Guess you gotta start the whole trial all over again. 

Remember: Solo gives you 3 lives. And don't forget: NO CHECKPOINTS!

PROS:
 - Visuals are amazing, includes some ""SAW"" like gruesome scenes and imagery.
 - Sound Design is out of this world, you will crap your pants. Even speed running through trials, you still get hit with jump scares that make you squeal.
 - Tons of Cosmetics and huge skill tree to unlock which brings you back to play more
 - You get addicted to the adrenaline fueled scare
 - Matchmaking is pretty good if you're willing to play whatever other people want to play

CONS:
 - once you level up high enough and unlock a chunk of skills and abilities, the game becomes a little easy
 - sometimes matchmaking takes a while when you're trying to find people to help you with trials, but easy solution is to join the official discord and find people to play with. But that's also a chore within itself.

I didn't know what to expect from Red Barrels or how they would pull off an online version of Outlast, but they did it in style. The hub is great. It just feels like a nut house. Only activities available are arm wrestling and chess, yet somehow I still found myself spending a ton of time in the hub messing with randos, beating on tables. Game play is fun, immersive and challenging. I managed to beat the first 3 levels solo with a D rating first try. The game is exceptionally difficult solo, but not impossible. I love how humble the devs are, encouraging feedback on how to balance the game and improve it. One criticism I have is that grouping up with randoms is daunting. They need to make a way to one button team up with people you meet in the hub (maybe similar to the way rec room does it?).  Definitely worth the low price.

Now you and your friends can enjoy stealthing through disgusting twisted play sets themed around courthouses, carnivals, prisons, and orphanages while dodging traps and gangs of murderous mutants and lunatics.

The game loves its gore and shock value imagery. So be aware of that. Dicks, tits, sexual content, a racist sodomizing electro cop, songs about kids doing lines of cocaine, its all in here. Fully R rated game here.

The controls are smooth and the stealth is pretty decent. Enemy variety and behavior is also better than I expected.  You have solid character progression with upgrading your toolkit, amps, and questionable medication regime which all make you significantly better at this or that. Personally I am enjoying the stun set up and just hoarding batteries and chain stunning baddies while my friend does a loud objective. Which brings us to

The co-op. The game can be played solo, you get extra lives to make up for the lack of teammates. But it really shines in its 2-4 person co-op. You can break down heavy doors for better shortcuts or lift each other over a high wall or kick an grappling enemy off an ally. And this is where it starts to feel like DBD survivor bullying without the guilt. You can really get up to some Benny Hill shenanigans with the killers. Sure there are multiple threats on each map to even it out. But teamwork really can make the dream work here.

So if you want to group up with your friends and throw bricks at evil lunch ladies together its all here.

There's also a wide range of difficulties with earlier levels pitting you against maybe three threats in a map and later maps pitting you against 2-4 enemies per objective and then you start running into the chaos of fleeing from one and bumping into a giant before a gas masked goon hoses you down and a crazy person jumps out of a locker to punch your face in.

A good set of maps and varying objectives and seasonal conditions and rewards keep the game feeling fresh with tons of character unlocks, customization, and interior decorating where you can collect the most hideous wall papers the 1950s ever produced.

Cons:
This game does have its flaws though, I feel for the wait we had (2017-2023) the game does not come with quite enough content. Though I understand that they have it marked as early access, a smaller team and there were complications with the pandemic. One thing I do not understand about the game though, is how the characters lack any memorablity how they did in the first two or even the whistleblower DLC. I do feel that there are hardly any memorable scenes such as ""that"" scene in the whistleblower DLC. It does leave the game feeling a bit dull at times. But this game definitely has a massive potential and with updates I could see this game being very replayable. They have laid the groundwork for an amazing game and now just need to continue working on it. Now those are about the only cons that I can think of when It comes to this experience and I would like to go over some of the pros of this game. 
Pros:
Items:
This game has a bunch of unique and fun items to use, (though there are the boring, (but needed) items such as batteries), but using the bottle to create a sound distractions adds a lot of layers and depth to the gameplay that can make the player strategically get out of any bad scenario they could be in. The bricks are also a fun addition, as this game can be a lot crazier than the past two so being able to slow down the enemies is sometimes needed. 
Rigs:
There are ""powerups"" in this game, also known as ""rigs"" that can drastically change the experience of the game, the rigs in no particular order are called, 
1.X-Ray, the ability of this rig is, as I'm sure you could guess, being able to see through walls, not my personal favorite of the rigs but it can have its moments. 
2.Blind, this ability, once again as you could probably guess, makes the enemies that you face during the trials of the game, go temporarily blind, this rig is another sort of lack luster one.
3.Stun, now I'm sure that this will be unbelievable to you but this rig actually STUNS the enemies that you go against during the trials, this rig is a lot more useful than the last two but it does not even come close to the next one
4.Heal, this rig is EASILY the best, this rig helps you and your team in the trials immensely. I recommend every player use this rig while experiencing this game for an optimal experience.
Map Playablity and Functionality:
This game has a (small) but wide variety of maps, you can go from playing on a map where a lot of fun activities are held, such as carnival games and boat rides to going on a map where most people would dead going, a school. But unlike its real life counterpart the school map in this game is very fun. Every map in this game has its specialties and its own standout moment but my personal favorite map in the game has to go to the police station. 
Atmosphere:
Though as you play more the atmosphere does dwindle a bit, the atmosphere is made very well and provides for some very scare, but fun, moments during the gameplay of this game.
Final Thoughts:
I definetely reccomend giving this game a try as it is a blast with friends and I think the game will just get better as time goes on and it is updated more and more. 
Final Rating:
8/10 (could change over time)

FEEDBACK: There is way too much loading, an unnecessary amount of waiting time between sessions, and then there's the loading screen on top of the waiting in between more waiting.

EXAMPLE: start mission, wait 20 seconds, go into the shuttle, wait for teammates to get into chairs to start mission AGAIN, get briefed on the mission, watch a silly cut scene, exit the shuttle, NOW YOU'RE PLAYING... now once you've completed the mission and return to the shuttle, you have to go go through a load screen AGAIN, then exit the shuttle, get debriefed and roasted by an AI before you can return to the lobby, but wait theirs one more damn hallway and a gate before you're finally back... NOW WERE FINALLY IN THE LOBBY... rinse and repeat.

SOLUTION: Load the game while we are watching the cut scenes, and get rid of the the time between sessions so we can play quicker. immersion is one thing, but to be slugging along waiting to start a game or to return from one that we completed is boring.",1702190464,1703013743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It launched with no server issues

The devs listen, they might not release a ""major"" update every 3 months like other games or whatever, but they do listen to feedback, change, adjust and balance things.

It really feels like the devs actually care, for the game itself and its community.

Its worth its money and only feels early access in terms of content (4 main ""maps"" 100+ cosmetic items, a bunch of lore files), but even then. You will probably spend like an hour in the first trial but the more you play the faster you'll learn the games ins and outs. Making you progress faster through each trial and programm. The rigs (basically special items you will bring into the trial) will help you overcome trials easier, and you can pick the one that suits your playstyle (or the situation). You'll unlock more cosmetics for your character and cell (your room) which you need to buy with INGAME money, which can be earned through playing.

I could say more but honestly, If you like outlast, having some fun with friends (or strangers, or alone) or love being fast, optimal and just all the speedrunning things in general.

The game has limited maps for now but new maps, missions, and modifiers keep getting added every couple months alongside seasonal and weekly events. The random placement of the objectives, items, opened / closed doors and traps give them decent amount of replayability.  Late game the modifiers can increase the difficulty or way you play the map quite a bit.  This combined with the randomised elements and weekly events make it so you can keep replaying the same maps and have it feel fresh.

Issue 1: Enemies camping objectives and new enemies being released near objectives, there is quite literally no incentive to play objectives because you get more experience screwing around. Playing objectives is so unfun and punishing it ruins any excitement you get, the entire game feels like a chore because of this. You might be thinking ""oh just lure the enemies away"", we've done that and they lose interest and run back to the objective, if you're doing co-op it releases enemies on the objective whilst your friend lures the camper away. 90% of this game is about sitting and waiting.

Issue 2: The movement etc is so clunky you either get stuck on everything or start doing a glitchy jumping animation if you slightly clip something, on top of that interacting with objects doesn't seem to work the way it should. I've died numerous times when I've run through a door and tried to close it behind me, instead the character steps back through the door next to the enemy chasing them and closes it on themselves. I could go on but there's no need, within the first mission you'll experience all of the clunkiness.

This game has great potential, there's no denying that but the awful AI and clunky movement don't make it fun. Missions are all about spending 90% of your time hiding and avoiding the objective or dying to silly things like getting stuck on terrain. It seems the overwhelming hype from the Outlast fanbase is giving this game positive reviews without considering the glaring downsides and it's a shame. These issues if searched online can be seen from the games release all the way till now.",1702761980,1702810953,False,30,6,0.539932608604431152,1,True,False,True

This is more competitive than horror and It's annoying to keep dodging the monsters to even do your objective.

I enjoy this game a lot but I know a lot of people won't like it and find this game too competitive.

This is probably the first game I'm negative reviewing and I'm having a good time playing this anyway because I love outlast

Edit: I finally won the game, Took me awhile to get people to finish the last program for me.
The final mission was a disappointment to try to find the last item, The ending, It was really bad, Worst ending in any video game.

Was 36.3 hours worth my time? Sadly, No, I didn't enjoyed it too much but was it alright? Yes. Fun for me? Yes.
I got this game because I'm a fan of outlast, I loved the first and second game, This was nothing but irritation and I was just annoyed the entire time playing this, A lot of times I had to have people carry me because It was so bad. (I'm not really great at remembering where things are and where to go)

I will give out why I probably didn't liked this game.
The enemies weren't great, Enemies usually camp when you do the objective so It's a cat and mouse situation. The only enemies I really enjoyed was mother goose and the giant guy with chains for arms.
I don't really remember outlast but idk what the green smoke is about and those cut scenes.
When you see an open door and run to it, when you left click the last second it closes behind you but sometimes you get glitched and I really hope they will fix that (Please make it hold left click to shut open doors like that) This is a cool mechanic.
I didn't liked the objectives being in like the same spot mostly all the time and people like me will get lost easily and can't find the objective even If I go around the entire map and I have to look very closely.
The lobby room feels empty like all the time so please make it so you join one with like 20 people in.

If this game had a very similar feeling to 1 and 2, This would've possibly been better.
This game is more of a singleplayer/multiplayer objective game running from enemies than a multiplayer horror game. Dead by daylight but enemies are not players.

When I play with randos, there's usually zero communication (or maybe that's just my luck with lobbies). Speaking of, lobby times aren't bad. The way to search for parties is cool. You can search by random, or trial, or program. Depending on what you search for, is how long it may take to find people. The official outlast trials discord is also a great place to find players. Gameplay is great for the most part. I don't really like the new changes (nerfing rigs and bricks don't have multiple uses when hitting enemies anymore), but I'm sure I'll get used to it and make it work. Enemies are really cool and powerful, with a good balance of being annoying and dumb. I really love the specials and weekly challenges. It doesn't feel like a dead end game. There seems to always be new stuff being planned and in the works. The Geiser and Winter specials were really enjoyable. Cosmetics and room decoration are also a huge plus, along with arm wrestling and chess in the waiting room.

What I am hoping for in the future are more rigs with different specials, possibly a ""create your own"" trial where you can choose the variators and how difficult (or easy) you want to make it. Another thing that would be cool, is possibly a 2v2 type of game, where two teams of two compete against each other in a trial to see who finishes their tasks first. The team who doesn't finish first gets gassed to death or something lol. Also, for the love of cosmetics, please bring us hats that have hair. I'm tired of being shave headed with a receding hairline when i want to wear a hat accessory.

original positive review:
Been playing on and off since day one of early access. May seem hard at first but your character levels up very fast with prescriptions, rigs, amps, etc. Definitely the most unique and visually beautiful co-op horror game i've ever played. Tons of scares and fun with friends. I highly recommend it. 

For new players you will get a lot of fun and content out of this for the price. on the other hand, it is lacking content for the ageing trials players. many of the players since day one are fizzling out again but this is in no way a jab. It's still one of my all time favorite games. I just hope red barrels keeps aiming high with this title, and if not i've definitely got more than my money's worth already!",1701428433,1702720221,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Edit: i cant recommend this game no more we work our asses off to get good upgrades for rigs and we get rewarded with nerfs beyond reason other than ohh you all like that rig or this rig haha have fun now cause we like loosing players for the point of making it boring rigs were the only thing taking this game away from a generic task horror game

 I really do hope they figure it out cause i can't imagine this game lasting long if all they wanna do if Nerf everything to the point of not having any replay-ability and if anyone thinks they wanted to make it harder for people who wanted it there are many ways to make the game more difficult without destroying the base mechanics of rigs from the closed beta to launch to current day. 

RB you need to step it up cause this latest update is not it the game will die if you kill everyone's favourites i can't even stand the x-ray Nerf/mini buff it was unneeded like many of the nerfs before.

we need some variety in this game again cuz it can get boring.

also i really hope for more coop moves like helping your teammate across a big jump or improve coop animations we already have im not sure im the only one but sometimes when i revive a teammate (or i get revived) the teammate magically ports a few centimeters away making it look like im pulling up the air other then those few issues i have with coop its more visual the mechanics of coop are fine.

my opinion on the rigs they are pretty much alright for now but we do need a few more, in my opinion healing and blind are the META in this game for now (Meta means basically what most people use) i really wouldn't mind more rigs in this game.

Alright now for the good stuff, the enemies and scary factors of this game can really be shown in some places like: The Basement of the police station or any dark place while you are sneaking praying not to get caught. i had a moment where i was in a dark corner with 1 hp with no way out while mother goseberry checked the locker nearby me and left truly terrfying. 

Being chased in this game is one of the highlights. i have a few words to say on the stamina in this game, the newbies have no idea about stamina management nor how to identify stamina depletion in this game cuz the default stamina bar is horrendous without upgrades, many many MANY times i have witnessed a newbie/Friend of mine get caught by the police guy or any enemy and die because they didn't know about: Stamina management,There being a stamina bar at all,or how to identify you are low on stamina. alright for anyone new to outlast trials and you see this review, your screen slowly gets more blue and blurry thats how you know you are low on stamina and should start walking a bit, and yes i do recommend doing this in a chase aswell. Some people think stopping while being chased is a bad idea i agree BUT there are some exceptions like: Locking a door behind you and walking away,After vaulting obstacles,after making distance ect ect basically you stop everytime you have time to take a breather then keep running.

Also i kinda wish they add more gore related scenes like cutting someone open for an item/key or something like that im pretty sure they could make something really awesome with this game.

Alright thats about everything i have to say for this game this is easily one of my favourite games of all time by far, and i really hope red barrels adds more maps and campaigns for us gamers who already were reborn over 10+ times. Also thanks for reading this review of mine, Remember to measure twice cut once and ill see you in the sleeping room. Bye!!

Let me start by saying that buying Outlast Trials for myself and three of my bravest (or not-so-brave) friends turned out to be the best and scariest decision we've made in a while! This game is like the thrill of a haunted house multiplied by a thousand, except you're not just a spectator - you're IN it! 
From the moment we dove into this immersive horror fest, it was like strapping ourselves into a rollercoaster with no brakes.
The proximity chat? Pure gold! 
Honestly, the Outlast Trials isn't just a game; it's a lesson in teamwork, survival, and how many ridiculous noises one can make when startled. If you're ready to be scared silly, laugh hysterically, and throw digital bottles like a circus act, this game is an absolute must-have!

Kudos to the developers for creating such a nerve-wracking yet ridiculously fun experience. We'll be stocking up on more bottles and bravery for our next session because once you start, you just can't stop. Cheers to the clown fest of terror and friendship! 🎉👻

These objectives are also not quick time events. They make you sit there for a few seconds holding down a button or pressing a button multiple times. If an enemy hits you while doing an objective you have to go back to and click that objective again. There were many times were if a player was in front of the cart it would stop moving.

Even with friends, the game can still be scary and at times frustrating, but it comes down to what you make of it. 

They tease or promise little and deliver a ton, easily surpassing any expectations. Very quality. Much wow.

Every update shows it was done with care and attention to details. They made the entire game very seamless, as even the tutorial is an important part of the story. They set up the lore/environment to enable them to make content updates for as long as they'd like. 

Despite being a serious horror game in its gameplay, the developers at Red Barrels seem to love fun, because they make the Sleep Room awesome. The Sleep Room for those that do not know is a 3D lobby where you spend your time away from the actual missions/trials, and, like the tutorial, is integrated lore-wise and story-wise quite well. They give your own safe space in the form of your room, they give you mini-games to play (arm-wrestling and chess so far; that's 3D chess btw) and they decorate for the holidays! Lots of wholesome fun in addition to the horrifying gruesomeness that is the trials; well balanced.  

Oh, Red Barrels also demonstrated how cool they are to their users already, like when they released an open beta last year for Halloween, so lots of people could test it out for them and demo the game. It was even then in a great state which is awesome to see in this current video game landscape. It gave me confidence that they would make an awesome game. I'm not sure how else to explain it, but everything is coherent and quality in what they do so far and I doubt that'll change. 

They move in silence but let their work show their merit for itself. 

Looking forward to what they do next! ❤️

Would you look at that the game using a dedicated server and not some poorly jank p2p horsefuck and there are no in-game purchase to shove it up your mouth (at least as of right now, Hopefuly we never get to that point).

Now it's not all sunshine and rainbow there are still some issues, like how the horror can get stale especially when the game wants you to unlock new gadgets and new perks, matchmaking is also a mess there's a lack of filter for the group finder so it's one of those games where if you want to have a good teammate either bring a friend or use an LFG discord.

If you're playing with a shitty teammate in a higher difficulty the game turns from horror to a slug fest of rage and it's even funnier to play it with 3 other friends turns the horror vibe to a clown circus (in a good way)

Another masterpiece from RedBarrels, now we have a perfect multiplayer Outlast game to play with your friends and have a lot of fun.

One thing to highlight is the difficulty of the game, it is not easy to pass the levels and get the maximum score, you need coordination and know how to make quick decisions, if you come from playing Outlast1,2 you will already have a good base on how to escape from enemies, It will be easier.
But there are still some levels that are a difficult challenge, and replaying them to get the maximum score is not boring.

Totally recomended this game(better with friends)

The AI are terrible; there are many instances where I should not have taken damage from enemies but did anyway. They also just spot you through walls. All of the missions are the same - there are less than 10 missions that are replayed over and over. The whole point of the game is to play coop; to play with friends - yet the final mission is solo and more difficult than any of the others. The worst part? It's not hard because the game is hard, it's hard because the game's mechanics are poorly implemented.

I recommend hitting up the Red Barrels official website to read all the Outlast comics which add a lot to world you'll be exploring.

The game still keeps the sense of fear and horror with out relying on cheaply timed jump scares.

The game is great solo but if your lucky enough to have friends then its a lot better although if your a sad loner who has no friends you can join a group with randoms. The multiplayer game play has embraced true Co-op game mechanics like the ability to scale high walls to make areas of the game easier also there is the ability to help a team mate who has been grabbed by a mob and of course you can trade items and also resurrect downed team mates.
The solo game play is set up so that players who prefer the ""lone Wolf"" experience can still have fun with without finding things too difficult.
The game has 5 different main story missions consisting of about 3 - 5 tasks on each mission and each mission takes an average of 40 - 60 minutes to complete. There is also ""MK"" missions that expand on each main story mission but require you to complete just one task and will take a lot less time to complete. 

The game runs flawlessly with no crashes or bugs that I could find, there was however a run where a patrolling mob decided he was going to camp the one and only path from a room and forced me to get creative and use the bottle throwing mechanic to distract him while I slipped past. I don't class this as or simular instances as a bug though as he chased me in to that room so IRL the mob would stick around while trying to find me.

Its worth mentioning that the game from the start is harder due to not having unlocked any passive skills or perks (Amps) also unlocking and levelling ""Rigs"" helps loads with both solo and Co-op runs. 

At the moment there is no ""Battle pass"" or ""Item shop"" but there was an in game survey that listed both of these in a list of things that you could vote on if you wanted them adding to the game so there is defiantly discussions going on in the background about adding them, I myself however feel if these do get added and that if done right it might help the game grow its player base a little by introducing ""Battle pass"" or ""Item shop"" results in lowering the price of the game. not to mention that Coop horror games don't seem to last long thanks to the cost of running the servers and sales of the game dropping off so if there was more ways for income to made from skin sales it would defiantly help with keeping the game around for many years to come.",1701346144,1701346144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Then the game makes you watch a long ass cut scene every time you start a mission, the same overarching villain for every arc gets really old and the game in general becomes this samey, grindy slog where you are forced to play the same mission on repeat with slight variation, the multiplayer is fun but the game really gets annoying, i especially do not like the tracking most enemies have as they tend to lose you the second you turn around one corner so you end up just goofing off with the ai rather than dealing with a tense chase. The halloween event also had this effect where the skin man just constantly barrages you which made me very annoyed with the whole mechanic rather than trying to avoid it.

Outlast Trials proves to be something of an outlier from it's single-player predecessors, with it being multiplayer, set far in the past, and encouraging the player to fight back, even if your efforts are temporary at best. 
Playing through the Trials from Level 1 cowering in the corner, thru Level 56 efforts to optimise routes and tool utilisation offer constantly new experiences, all of the time. Learning the maps and the enemy AI, adapting to RNG elements, and battering Coyle with an arsenal of 16 bricks is a never-ending fun. 
The menagerie of unique characters, the set design and atmosphere all build on the insurmountable standards that Red Barrels had previously set. 
Outlast Trials is a game that, while still in Early Access with it's flaws, is without a doubt in a league to be at an equivalent level to other multiplayer horror titans, like Dead by Daylight. Even after 120 hours (my playtime at the time of this review), Red Barrels continue to update OT with weekly trials, high-level trial shuffles for returning expert players, and events. And there are more core trials to come.

After completing most trials it becomes repetitive and boring. Yes, the trials are harder but its the same story line/same outcome. There isnt much to work towards other than new cosmetics/more kit. 
If you could progress through the trials, opening up the game to new bosses on each floor in the Murkoff Corp I think a lot more people would commit to the game. 
Right now, the game feels like something you would play to kill 30 mins while waiting for something else etc. 

There are only 2 bosses, Madam Gooseberry and the Warden. I feel like by now, there should be more than 2 bosses and a handful of trials. 

Id like to see more bosses in the future and some more incentives to play as right now there isnt much to really work towards.

To provide replayability, the game introduces a skill and leveling system. This system is a little lacking, as some upgrades should be available to everyone such as a slide or kicking. Some of the skills are also so good, that some trials are near impossible without the team having it, such as the stamina/endurance upgrades.

The game also put the lore/story to the side, and is very difficult to find from random dossiers in the maps, rather than the more active storytelling that the previous Outlast games give you. But this development is natural, as you are expected to play the same maps multiple times, and storytelling would grow repetitive.

Movement and mechanics work like a well oiled machine, the trials are amazing enviroments, twisted in every way they can be, character progression and customization works wonders, and well, the multiplayer, altough not mandatory to enjoy the game, really turns this game into a brand new experience.

The only real down side I can point to is the little amount of content available so far, however the devs are spoiling us with free updates left and right and a pretty meaty development roadmap to keep us up to date with the game's future.

This game actually scared the shit out of me. It's so much fun with friends, and I would recommend playing it with friends. The game allows you to play with up to 4 players to complete the trials in which you will receive tasks to complete to escape. I would recommend giving it a try.

1-2 players. A stealth experience and a lot scarier.
3-4 players. A chaotic experience with a lot of trolling.",1701022268,1701022268,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

It plays great on desktop and the steamdeck which is a nice added bonus. 
The Outlast Trials is more of the same from the first two games but this time rather than one long story you are placed in trials within the Outlast universe to be judged playing either solo or in multiplayer. Solo is a more sneaky experience at least till you level up and can be genuinely scary at times. Multiplayer is a a great laugh to play whether played with or without comms and can still be scary but the threats are more manageable with a teammate to help distract and save.
Levels are distinct and challenging, some may take you 5 minutes once you've memorised a route but some can take almost up to an hour and are multi faceted. 
One word of warning if you are new to the franchise, these devs pull no punches when it comes to gore and religious taboos, so if your a bit churchy maybe give this one a skip as some levels go beyond blasphemous but its all very tongue in cheek but no less brutal.
An intelligent and engaging experience that has loads of replay value with weekly, monthly new challenges, loads to unlock and of course the game is not fully released so plenty more in store. Big thumbs up from me.",1701020104,1701020104,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

Instead of fear, you often find yourself laughing at the absurdity, with friends mocking you from hiding spots. The enemies, rather than clueless protagonists, exhibit hilariously poor decision-making skills. While the early access version introduces the cooperative horror game concept with memorable maps, it lacks content and polish, expectedly featuring bugs. Despite these issues, the game provides a fun yet uneven experience.

In The Outlast Trials, you and up to four friends face Saw-like ""death games,"" combating gory terrors together. The story revolves around being abducted by an evil corporation for apparent rehabilitation but subjected to random murder scenarios. The lore, collected through evidence, adds mildly interesting details. However, the game's emphasis on over-the-top violence, lechery, and on-the-nose subject matter can be overwhelming. Despite attempts at humor, the tactless, extreme approach feels like edgelordian overkill.

The early access version includes three maps with bizarre objectives, such as transforming an orphanage into an unholy establishment or punishing animatronic children. These macabre tasks become chaotic challenges as psychopaths hunt you amid the noise. The game's intensity arises from completing mundane tasks under the duress of relentless pursuit, adding panic-inducing chaos.

The Outlast Trials is a unique cooperative horror game with a fantastic premise and some really memorable scenarios, but while the early access version proves the concept there’s a lot of work to be done to make those ideas pay off. Running around with friends as you hide from murderous killers and complete utterly insane (and sometimes too edgy for their own good) death games is paradoxically tense and hilarious, but the fact that the enemy AI is about as effective as a concrete parachute and two of the three levels share too much of the same DNA certainly leaves a lot of room to grow on.

The team is extremely dedicated and value the money and time you devote to the game, so they try the make the best product they can.

Das Spiel nimmt die Spieler mit auf eine verstörende Reise, die sich perfekt für alle eignet, die nach einem intensiven und gemeinschaftlichen Gruselerlebnis suchen.

Die Kreativität der Game Designer zeigt sich in jeder Ecke des Spiels, von den makabren Umgebungen bis zu den beängstigenden Kreaturen, die die Spieler verfolgen. Es ist erstaunlich, wie tief die Entwickler in die Dunkelheit der menschlichen Psyche eingetaucht sind, um eine Atmosphäre zu schaffen, die selbst den mutigsten Spieler erschauern lässt. The Outlast Trails spielt gekonnt mit den Ängsten der Spieler und liefert Momente, die unter die Haut gehen.

Ein herausragendes Merkmal des Spiels ist die perfekte Interaktion zwischen den Spielern. Das kooperative Gameplay ermöglicht es den Spielern, sich auf innovative Weise miteinander zu verbinden, sei es durch das gemeinsame Überwinden von Hindernissen oder das Teilen von Ressourcen. Dies schafft nicht nur eine immersive Spielerfahrung, sondern fördert auch die Teamarbeit und Zusammenarbeit, um den schaurigen Herausforderungen des Spiels gemeinsam zu begegnen.

Die Entwickler haben auch in der Lobby des Spiels für Abwechslung gesorgt, indem sie unterhaltsame Features wie Schach oder Armdrücken eingebaut haben. Diese kleinen Details tragen dazu bei, die Atmosphäre aufzulockern und den Spielern eine willkommene Atempause zwischen den nervenaufreibenden Horrorsequenzen zu bieten.

Insgesamt kann The Outlast Trails allen Horrorfans wärmstens empfohlen werden, die nach einem intensiven und gemeinschaftlichen Spielerlebnis suchen. Die verstörende Kreativität der Game Designer, die perfekte Interaktion zwischen den Spielern und die unterhaltsamen Features in der Lobby machen dieses Koop-Horrorspiel zu einem Must-Have für alle, die sich dem Grauen gemeinsam stellen wollen.

It's more a challenging game to master those trials. For some casual playing at a evening with friends it's quite funny, after a time probably too boring because of the lack of content. If you've friends who love to grind some cosmetics and little perks, you will have the fun of your life.

Great performance for a Early Access (in comparison to other releases this and the last 3 years, it's insane how good this game is optimized), some bugs still available but overall a neatless experience.

For all real horror fans; wait for the official third Outlast game... this one is only interesting in solo for challenge-enthusiasts.

I love the atmosphere of the game. The Cold War-era facility is well made, and the sound design with the buzzers and the unsettling voice-overs in Murkoff is superb. Props to the voice actors as well. Their performances give a distinct character to each of the enemies, even those with fewer lines.

The co-op is fun and adds a lot of strategy to the game as you work together to evade enemies while getting objectives done. Although the cooperative gameplay is thrilling, it's not particularly scary. In my opinion, the co-op aspect diminishes the scariness of the game, compared to a solo experience.

I'm also happy with the customization options for your character and the little room you stay in. It's all acquired through currency you earn by playing the game and doesn't involve any microtransactions (and I hope they never add any).

Right now, my only pet peeve would be the lack of replay value. Because you and your teammates are up against AI enemies, they become easy to predict and dupe after playing for a while. If you know when and where they will appear, they become more of a nuisance than a scary threat. This does make me put the game down for longer in between updates.

Review:

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The Outlast Trials takes the harrowing horror of the Outlast series to a whole new level by introducing cooperative gameplay, and let me tell you, it's a heart-pounding experience like no other. As a long-time fan of the franchise, I was eagerly awaiting this installment, and it did not disappoint.

The atmosphere is as chilling as ever, with the abandoned Cold War-era facility setting the stage for a psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Outlast Trials successfully maintains the trademark tension and fear that the series is known for, and the addition of multiplayer only amplifies the terror.

The co-op aspect adds a new layer of strategy and fear, as communication is key to survival. Navigating the nightmarish experiments and eluding the relentless pursuers becomes an intense team effort. Whether you're guiding your partner through the darkness or desperately running for your own life, the shared experience of terror is both exhilarating and nerve-wracking.

The visuals are top-notch, with grotesque enemies and detailed environments that immerse you in the oppressive atmosphere. The sound design is exceptional, contributing significantly to the overall sense of dread. The Outlast Trials doesn't rely on jump scares alone; it builds an unsettling ambiance that stays with you long after you've turned off the game.

One of the standout features is the variety of challenges and puzzles that demand collaboration between players. It's a refreshing departure from the conventional horror formula and adds depth to the gameplay without sacrificing the fear factor.

While the difficulty can be unforgiving at times, especially when coordinating with teammates, it only enhances the feeling of vulnerability and the adrenaline rush that comes with narrowly escaping the clutches of your pursuers.

In conclusion, The Outlast Trials is a masterclass in cooperative horror gaming. Red Barrels has once again delivered a game that will leave you sleepless and questioning your sanity. If you're a fan of the Outlast series or survival horror in general, this is a must-play. Just make sure you have a reliable co-op partner—you're going to need all the help you can get in this descent into madness.

The game succeeds in replicating the atmosphere of the previous entries nicely. This can be seen in the amazing composition of the soundtrack, the layout of the levels, the horrifying visuals with the occasionally surprisingly high amount of gore and the design of the enemies which can create a lot of fear and tension. The gameplay is highly diverse and random which gives each map a great replayability. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the difficulty scaling. It is done very well with the introduction of the grading system. This encourages players to act more carefully and learn how to properly use items and gadgets. This is also accompanied by the evaluation at the end of each trial which shows what you could’ve done better. Furthermore, there are some quality-of-life features that give the game a nice touch like the arm wrestling and chess minigame in the lobby and the option to customize your character and room.

However, there is one substantial difference in this entry that doesn’t show up in any other Outlast game. You can attack, fight back and slow down enemies. This has not been done previously, thus making the game a bit less scary. The defenselessness of the original games was a big part in the process of creating fear and horror. Another thing I’d like to add: the final trial is unfortunately a solo mission due to how the game’s story and progression is handled. This is a negative aspect because you play the entire game with your friends only to finish it without them.

All in all, the Outlast Trials delivers the best possible version of itself. If I had to imagine how an Outlast co-op game would look like, I’d say it would pretty much go like this. It delivers in almost every possible way that the previous games have while still being in Early Access. Let’s hope we get to see this game fully develop with the addition of more maps, main enemies and maybe a co-op ending.

The maps are quite complicated, and although there are some arrow signs here and there, I still get lost a lot. I know it might be part of the enjoyment, but if you don't have that much time to invest in this game, a mini map would have been really useful. 

It does offer replayability, but not as much as you would think.
When you replay scenarios, things have some random spots, let's say 10 and the game uses 5. After a while you kinda know where these places are.
In my opinion the replayability is how you and your friends challenge yourselves to to a scenario (without powerups, a max of 3 uses of powerups, do not hide in barrels etc.)

I loved playing Dead by Daylight in its infancy. It was fun, it was my niche, and I always withstood the growing pains through its early days, and headaches it gave me. This game has been a perfect replacement, [b]without any of the growing pains and the headaches.[/b]

The graphics are unreal (minimum spec players beware), seriously beautiful. The horror aspect is done just perfect. Not too ""scary"", but also not for pussies. I can't even play alone, I've gotta be playing co-op. The horror is also perfectly balanced with humor. The circumstances of the game-being captive in a facility and being forced to run these trials of demonic and extremely brutal challenges-is so horrifying and absurd that it actually ends up being more funny than anything.

The gameplay is smooth and satisfying. Clearly the work of well-seasoned developers. I've personally never played any of the previous Outlast games, as I am not a fan of singleplayer horror experiences, but I can see why so many have enjoyed Red Barrels' previous work. They've done a wonderful job of making the game have a fairly challenging learning curve, yet still be exhilarating and absolutely worth playing for even the most novice of players.

It also seems that, the way they've set the game up, they'll never run out of new content, unless they have to stop putting time into the game (say if there is not enough active players, not enough money rolling in to pay the bills). As niche as it is, that is certainly a possibility, but I'm hoping it won't be the case.

While Outlast was highly acclaimed, Outlast II fell a bit short in quality, although it was still quite the frightful experience.

What's common to all three games, is the setup: You are being hunted by demented inhumanly strong victims of  medicinal experimentations, who are ready to maime you at any given chance in melee. While trying to navigate the levels you stealthly evade or try to outrun the AI controlled opponents, mainly by using battery limited nightvision and any kind of hiding spots like lockers or empty oil barrels. 

With Trials being a Multiplayer experience you obviously lose some of that ""you are all alone and nobody can help you"" feeling, as is with any other of these games, especially if you don't use the in-game voice chat and opt for discord. Still, the game is plenty difficult and can be refreshingly exhilerating when you finally achieved your mission objective and try to get safely back to your extraction point while all hell breaks lose and every enemy on the map seems to center onto the extraction area.

There are some points that dampen the experience, connection problems leading to disconnects of your coplayers (and the inability to reconnect, once you are out you get a fail), some random enemy spawns that will always know your exact position even navigating through vents or hiding in far distanced dead ends and that can be only avoided by hiding in a locker in time, and a somewhat limited map selection. Especially the last part is problematic for longtime enjoyment, given that players have to replay every map in various difficulties and handicaps as a padding for content prolongment until they are finally allowed to the endgame level. Paired with various ability-trees that have to be unlocked by currency only given out upon initial mission clears the long time motiviation and skill wall is somewhat unfriendly for the general public in my opinion. 

Still, the game IS fun and, more importantly, still in Early Access, so I hope they can iron out some of these annoying corners.",1700671559,1700907861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Good game-play: If you like the dead by daylight style of game-play then you'll love this. The chase is the whole aspect of the game, you micromanage your supplies and get chased. 
2. Visuals: Its a simple concept, but the game looks amazing. The blood and gore are spot on. The wood, stone, metal, and even the enemy design is amazing.
3. Community: The player-base for this game is equally good. Very friendly and open to teach if you do not understand the game.
4. Repeatable game-play loop: As mentioned, the game-play loop is similar to dead by daylight, so if you enjoy the chase then the trials will be repeatable for a long time.
5. Intensity: The trials hold a intense feel the whole time, from murdering people to throwing hearts at targets, you'll get shocked once and a while at what your really doing if you pay attention. Not to mention the actual chases and hiding is intensive as well if you want to get that high grade.
6. Items: There is a wide assortment of different cosmetic items that you can collect. Each time you complete a trial or level up you unlock a new item for you to use on your character, which gives your character a sense of identity. 
7. Grade system: Each time you finish a trial you get a grade showing how well you did. The amount of times my friends and I have played through trials to get that A+ is astronomical.
8. Friends: This game has the same style as a party game so its made to be played with friends (But every game is more fun with friends so take this as you will)

Cons:
1. Repeatability: If you do not enjoy playing the same content over and over again with small differences then don't bother.
2. Performance: If you do not have a strong computer, then you will not be able to run this game. Before I had got the computer I have now, I had a lower end computer and ran the game at 30 - 45 fps (Can be dismissed if you have a good computer)
3. Difficulty: Once you understand the basics of the game, it becomes a easy game to play. In fact, the ""Hardest"" trials become so easy that the trials without modifiers become boring with how little of a challenge they offer.

I have put many hours into this game, and I can say for certain that it is a amazing game. I can fully recommend this title with high regard. If you enjoy the scary atmosphere, intense chase, hide and seek style, you'll will absolutely not regret buying this game.

This new Outlast, which is a prequel of the first games, is a nice change of scenario, however there is some lack of terror with clumsy “jumpscares” and usually not very frightening events. One should think, as a game before the events of the first games in the series, the change to heavy survival horror and cooperative was needed to build it. It still remains within the Outlast lore where violence and crazed up enemies are present, only from another era.

In every trial you must complete a set of objectives with different gameplay factors, some better suited for up to four players. Singleplayer is still an option but when it comes to primary trials, doing those with teammates is a must. As a guinea pig you must tread with caution, observe the enemies around, and do the best to outmaneuver their movements. Of course, there is special bosses who move and attack faster and harder than your regular foe. Stealth remains as a loyal companion but eventually you have to run and hide.

What it surprised me is that you actually can defend yourself (finally!) by throwing bottles and bricks, and using special equipment that stun your enemy population. No longer one has to depend on heavy stealth and shutting doors to stop anyone. Although if you don’t have nothing on you, or the boss is on your tail (as they’re only stagger by projectiles, but still vulnerable to Riggs), they become a decent option. Vaulting remains here and you can also slide while running. Jumping through windows and breaking doors while running remain available, but you have to watch for the noise you make, or someone nearby may listen.
Featuring coop moves such as rolling gates, barricaded ones, and also reviving are some of the features in the Trials. 

There are more items to use than Outlast 2 and you can share them. Everyone will have to take care of themselves as it remains the core of the whole game: don’t get hit, don’t die. It will seem selfish, but because even when reviving and healing, Murkoff will know someone died and it will have an impact on the group score after the trial. Triggering loud traps, getting hit, knocked out and executed, will lower your personal score. 

And that’s all there’s to it. You can buy cosmetics and better gear, but at this point there isn’t much to do, other than playing timed chess at the lobby. For a title still on early access, there is some fun and can be quite teaching to help new players, but it will get quite repetitive and for that I won’t be playing it soon until new stuff is released. It’s still quite addictive if you want to do what I did.

So goodbye for now, and don’t let the doctor teach you about dental hygiene.

From the moment I fired it up on my 4K, 144 Hz monitor paired with a 3080 ti, I was blown away by the jaw-dropping visuals that brought the terrifying world to life.

The co-op gameplay adds a whole new dimension of excitement. Team up with a friend and brace yourselves for intense moments of panic and teamwork as you navigate through the dark corridors and face unimaginable horrors together. Trust me, sharing the scares makes it much more enjoyable... or should I say, terrifyingly fun!

But let's talk about those graphics. Oh boy, they're a treat for the eyes! The level of detail is mind-boggling, from the flickering lights casting eerie shadows to the meticulously crafted environments that send shivers down your spine. Playing it at 4K resolution with a buttery smooth 144 Hz refresh rate truly enhances the immersion and adds an extra layer of realism to the spine-chilling experience.

Now, I must warn you, this game is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to jump out of your seat, scream like a banshee, and possibly even shed a tear or two (don't worry, I won't tell anyone). But hey, isn't that the point of a good horror game? To push our boundaries, test our courage, and keep us on the edge of our seats?

In conclusion, Outlast's new co-op adventure is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies alike. With its stunning graphics that take full advantage of 4K and 144 Hz, combined with the heart-pounding co-op gameplay, this game will have you and your friend screaming, laughing, and begging for more. Just make sure to keep the lights on and maybe grab a spare pair of pants. Enjoy, if you dare!

The game's attention to detail in creating a creepy ambiance, complete with unsettling visuals like gore and unnerving enemies, contributes significantly to the overall immersion. The contrast between the solo gameplay, which can be quite frightening, and the hilarity of playing with friends in co-op mode adds versatility to the experience.

Beyond the main gameplay, the addition of extra activities like room editing, character customization, and mini-games such as arm wrestling and chess brings an element of fun and interaction between players, diversifying the overall gaming experience.

Overall, the game seems to offer a comprehensive package of horror, tension, cooperative play, and additional entertaining features, making it an engaging and multifaceted gaming experience.",1700635750,1700813453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I haven't played any of the original Outlast games, but I am familiar with the series and its gameplay. My friends and I joined the closed beta last year, October and we had a lot of fun (and scares) playing this game.

If you're looking for a game that's horror, with a lot of jumpscares and terrifying moments (PT, FNaF), you might not find that in this. This game is not that, but more so horrifying, adrenaline-pumping situations. 

Outlast is a game about avoiding enemies, hiding, sneaking around them and, if worse comes to worst, getting the absolute fuck outta of there by running as fast as your chicken legs can run, slamming doors and using whatever you have to delay your unstoppable pursuers. The Outlast Trials is that, but less story, more gameplay with co-op. 

I know some of you might not get this game because of co-op, as it might ruin the horror of the game. First things first, Red Barrels did an amazing job balancing the horror with the co-op. The game is full of situations where you are separated with your team, confronted with unstoppable enemies and the only defence you have is a single glass bottle. Secondly, you can play the game solo. Red Barrels have optimized the gameplay for both solo players and co-op players.

TL;DR - The Outlast Trials is an adrenaline-pumping, gameplay focused, horrifying game that is perfect for both co-op and solo players, and I would recommend it to those who want a gameplay-oriented, survival-horror game.

EDIT: After 25 hours of gameplay, the game has come a long way already in support of the community. The new trial is amazing (probably one of my favourites) and it hasn't gotten repetitive or boring just yet.",1684475057,1700812452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not only as a new game in a sea of dying games and recycled ideas, but as a refreshing example that there are developers and publishers out there creating NEW IP, NEW Genres of Games, and they aren't afraid to be the first in a particular space. Outlast Trials is something of a marvel to me. I played it for 65 hours in a 5 day period without even trying, and I don't even know why in particular it draws me in, as I have historically not been the biggest fan of most ""horror"" in general. 

At a base level, the co-op horror game has been done before, and some of them are even pretty good! But nothing has ever been done like this. This isn't just a horror game that ALLOWS co-op, but a game designed from the bottom up for it with engaging interactions between players. Every single layer of this game is a delicious treat of endorphins and dopamine from the engaging and suspenseful gameplay to some of the best customization options I have ever seen in a co-op game. You earn EVERYTHING in the game just by playing with no option to use real money on anything, and you receive a random cosmetic reward every time you complete a mission. Every time you play the same levels it feels like a completely different experience, and the bones that make up the game itself are rock solid.

The leveling/perk system in this game is FANTASTIC. There is always something to unlock or buy for your kit/character, and every single upgrade has a tangible impact on the way you play the game. There are different types of gadgets you can bring called ""Rigs"" which allow you to choose how you prefer to play and it adds to the already unmatched replayability by allowing your squad to run different combinations of loadouts. In regards to performance, after 100 completed trials I have never once ran into a bug, glitch, or disconnect at all and the one time a friend did disconnect mid game due to internet instability, they were able to rejoin flawlessly with 0 impact on our run. The graphics are immersive, and the options extensive with Ray Tracing support already optimized on launch. The controls feel intuitive, despite having no real precedent, as this game is completely independent of the other Outlast titles. 

Overall, I find the premise of this game hard to explain because there is no comparable. I HIGHLY recommend trying out this game with you and your friends, and it even holds its own as a solely single player experience once you figure out the levels. It may be somewhat shocking and scary the first couple times you play as it is a Horror game, but once you learn the mechanics you will be itching to get back in it and hone your skills against all odds regardless of whether or not you scare easily.

has some stuff that i wish was a bit better made like the Geister event (first in-game event). Clothing token price needs to be reduced from 2 to 1, and if its kept that way there needs to be more token gains from longer trials like Kill the snitch and Cleanse the children, those 2 trials take nearly 15 minutes to complete if you're not speed-running (and if u are it still takes nearly 10 minutes) you only get 2 tokens out of it when you could just spam Cancel the Autopsy  and get 1 token every 2-3 minutes depending on how fast you are. It gets VERY repetitive and boring quickly if you're trying to grind out tokens as fast as possible for every item in the event.

TLDR:

event changes i would love to see: 
-make event clothing and room items cost 1 token instead of 2 (costumes should stay 20 tokens)
-event trials that take 10+ minutes give 4 tokens instead of 2
-spamming cancel the autopsy/trials that take less than 4 minutes is faster than doing longer trials and give more tokens

Here’s the negatives:
-Keep in mind I’m bad at video games-
Just wish the difficulty would scale with how many people are playing in the level - it’s almost impossible to solo, but very manageable with 4 players. Its just very obviously designed for 4 players. If you don’t have three friends and don’t want to team with strangers, then you’re in for a rough time.
A friend and I played it together - while it was manageable with just two people, it tended to cross a line into “too challenging,” and we weren’t able to complete the first level without large difficulty. 
I almost want to recommend a way to control the difficulty of the levels (easy, medium, hard, that type of stuff), but also I hate those settings in games, and firmly believe in the “time to get better at the game” mindset.

That’s my only complaints with the game. Otherwise, its really fun and easily one of my favorite games to play with friends.

Why 8½? 

Gameplay is fun and engaging, music is good, there are things to grind towards but  as if early access i'd say content is lacking *duh* (maps, rigs, enemies, trials) but more is on the way.

I forgot to mention it gets a bit repetitive at times when you are playing the same trials, i could imagine the modifiers were made to spice things up but in my opinion doesn't do it enough until then it's 8½.

I play this game solo, it gets little easy after some time.

Currently there is enough content for a couple dozen hours, so not the eternal live-service games that currently flood the market, but enough (re)playability to last you a month or two if you really like. 
Story wise, the game takes place before the first Outlast, and seeing the state of the trials, and how the original games have evolved to this it is a real pickup for an Outlast or general horror fan. Also the lore drop is exciting and finding new documents scattered around the trials is always fun and is a nice read in between trials.
Gamplay wise, while it is possible to play solo, keep in mind that the game was made primarily for co-op play. There are some systems created to make the solo experience better, but it just isn't the real deal. That said, the ingame systems for partying up are great and you can see which kit your teammates are bringing, which helps in organising (even though later on you will find 1/2 are way stronger than the others).

Also the sleep room (lobby) filled with randoms and being able to challenge in little minigames or chess is so much fun. Hope to see some extensibility in this regard as it brings so much joy to this bit of the game (maybe open up a new area?)

Can't wait to see what kind of programs the devs have in store for us. I'd love to see some customizability for difficulty and variant selection (even in custom/non-xp games).",1700742350,1700742350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Red Barrels went above and beyond in their vision with the fresh cooperative horror, The Outlast Trials, also the third game in the Outlast series. Players can work together or by themselves to complete Saw-like Trials, organized with smaller challenges in into 4 separate groups called ""Programs"", which are typically separated by different maps. With over 20 challenges and Trials in the regular Programs, there is not any shortage of content for a player to enjoy with their friends or alone. Not to mention that each level has randomly generated characteristics, so every run can be entirely unique in how it plays out.

If that doesn't sound good enough in itself, there are also hundreds of cosmetics to unlock all with in-game currency and efforts. It's such a fresh breath of air in this world of injected microtransactions that you will want them to actually hand over more premium cosmetics so that you can applaud them for the work they've already provided on the free cosmetics for the game for the price the game is.

Speaking of the price the game is, this is all coming in at $30 for Early Access and even less if you get it on sale. The fact that there are games being released for $70 with the quality they have is ridiculous when we are getting even better quality that Red Barrels provided here for $30. People would pay that price for the pre-game lobby mini games alone! Stunning AAA graphics, seemingly infinite replay value, phenomenal story that ties in brilliantly with the original Outlast trinity, and nothing but an absolute blast with your friends. The Outlast Trials is sure not to disappoint, as one of the greatest cooperative horror games conceived yet.",1684470582,1700718116,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played this game in a duo (two people) and we had to do the first level (the SNITCH) and it was so hard, it literally took us 3 times to do.
another thing is the audio, sometimes the audio is correct and it sounds like somebody is on the right but their  on your left and that sometimes costs the game.

Playing with more people, up to 4, greatly enhances the trial experience compared to going solo. While some may enjoy playing alone and maybe even succeed, it's different from the older Outlast games—it's a new concept. One major advantage is the friendly and cooperative community, at least from what I've experienced. They're very tolerant of beginners, mistakes, and so on.

This game has the potential to be amazing, but it requires significant work. I hope the developers remain open-minded and, most importantly, attentive to the community's feedback. Communication and public discussions are crucial. I've already shared an idea I believe has huge potential—to introduce a parkour run challenge. With a touch of creativity, this game could evolve into something far bigger, better, and more expansive than anyone anticipated.

This Expansion on the Universe and the Gameplay is super super Fun. I love playing this both on my own and with Friends. The Visuals are great, the Performance is great and honestly it does not feel like Early Access at all. It is super polished already and very fun.
The only thing I would say is a negative, is that Updates are quite slow. Since release there has only been a single Update with new Content which was Halloween. Now to be fair, this Update was great and I was extremely excited for the New Trial.
I have no idea how long it takes to put these Maps and Trials together so I won't say too much negative there. Just a heads up, don't burn yourself out too quickly because new Trials take a while to come. I do hope this is something that will change in the Future and considering it's Early Access, I do believe that Cycle will speed up.

Either way, I love this Game and highly recommend it. It is both scary and funny and I really love everything about the Gameplay and Atmosphere, it is very immersive which is impressive for a Multiplayer Game and I still get a bit scared sometimes after 50 hours.

Starting off, this game is tagged ""Early Access"" but it does not feel like your average ""okay very buggy and messy performance, lacks content"" EA release, like at all, there are only a handful bugs that I can count on one hand that I encountered in my 80 hours of play so far, and the game also runs smooth as butter. So dont let yourself be fooled that it is a messy release and that it needs alot of work in that regard, it does not, it feels more like a ""glorified content roadmap"" release.

The core gameplay loop is to participate in trials/missions where you can - either solo or up to 4 players - complete objectives while running or hiding from various enemies and avoiding traps in parcour style. This works like a charm and has a funny duality, when playing single player it does feel like a proper stealth game where you can learn enemy patterns and patrols and play the game very tactically, while when playing with other people more often than not its chaotic fun and madness all around.
You level up your character from beating missions to upgrade either base abilities that permanently gives you advantages (e.g. more stamina), upgrade your RIG your ""power"" (e.g. a mine that blinds enemies) or perks that give you other strong benefits (for example to not make noise while walking over glass). These upgrades have a ton of weight and are the main reason you can do higher difficulty missions more confortably over time even solo. Which talking about the difficulty, it can be very challenging solo but from practising without RIG or AMP upgrades I noticed with practise every mission is very doable no matter how hard it is as long as you go at it tactically and dont rush like a headless chicken, and even if you struggle, the upgrades will carry ALOT, so no, in contrary to a lot of people's claims in the forums, the game is very doable in single player.

The story is the one point where Id say avoid this game if you want to experience it for that. Its basically documents that you collect in the trials and analyse outside of them to piece it together. I like it personally when games do storytelling in that type of fashion, but I know alot of people dont, and if you sign up for a compelling new ""outlast campaign"" you will be disappointed.

This game, just like all the other Outlast titles, is also again very gorey and disturbing, so if you cant see extreme violence or you dont want tits and balls flying around you (not literally) then dont get this game as well. It is very intense with its extreme content, now more so since they are sometimes tied to trial objectives [spoiler] like cutting the legs off of a naked dude nailed to a cross with a saw [/spoiler] . As a massive fan of intense horror, this is obviously much apprechiated.

Other than that there is not much else to say. This game is very fun and really holds me with its gameplay loop and atmosphere - mind you that I mostly even play singleplayer 90% of the time and Im still having the time of my life in a game that is promoted for multiplayer -. There is quite a bunch of stuff to do already, Im writing this as the release hotfix 1 version, and with time there will be new trials and other content on the way.",1685755141,1700667588,True,5,1,0.570011019706726074,0,True,False,True

* Runs on Linux since the latest patch.

The bad :
* There's a reasonable amount of grind here, you do the same levels over and over albeit with modifiers to switch up the challenge a little, I think I'd appreciate just more content overall, more types of enemies, more levels, different themes.

* You cannot help but become desensitised a little to what you're being shown because you're shown the same stuff so much.

* I'm sure the game actively tries to screw you over every now and then by releasing enemies closeby and having an AI find you in your hiding spot.

This game is surely my favorite horror game of the year, possibly my favorite horror game of... Forever.
While I wouldn't exactly call it an ""horror game"", as the scary elements are not the most present, the gameplay is wonderful and its atmosphere, its universe... It is unmatched. I truly love this game, and I am really excited to see how it grows and evolves in the near future ! Thank you, Red Barrels, for this banger.

Lots of cool cosmetics for your character and more.
Progress feels great, you get good amount of money and new stuff at a fair rate.

You unlock an awesome legendary skin every time you finish the final trial.
Super polished and runs great, especially for an early access game.

I've generally played this with friends, but I have done some solo rounds and some with randoms too.

General premise is that you're some sort of patient and undergoing therapy 'trials' for a shady corporation - with a view to eventually escaping back out to society. Not quite there yet myself... but maybe one day, if my performance is acceptable.

Trials themselves are sets of different maps, with different tasks to achieve - Map knowledge is important. The maps are never setup the same, a route you have in mind for a trial may not be easily available because of a randomly blocked doorway or something like that. The dice-roll randomness of how the maps are prepped I think is excellently done and the trials can be done again with harder 'modifiers' as you progress, such as harder enemies, more trapped or blocked doorways, less equipment lying around etc - Outlast Trials is still in Early Access and there is currently a handful of maps. The maps are highly, highly detailed and very well crafted, and there has recently been a Halloween event running.

Once you've got a bit of map knowledge, the game flows a little better - before you know it, you and your friends are sawing off the legs of a crucified naked man in no time at all!

Enemies on each of the maps are one of the main factors of play throughout the game - and also the most frustrating aspect of the game too - there are a few different enemy archetypes; your general stabby psycho, a few heavy hitting big dudes, a guy who gases you, a couple that respond to sound plus a couple more. Then there are a couple of 'main' enemies on each map - my particular favourite is Dr Fudderman who, along with her hand puppet, [i]will teach you about dental hygiene[/i].

Typically enemies are dealt with by kiting. A lot of kiting... to the point where its almost comical. Forget the tools lying around on each map, your best tools are running, evading and hiding - even though the game doesn't penalise you for how long a trial takes, there isn't much point hanging around, executing tasks quickly seems to be the way to go. Sneaking has its part, but in my experience sneaking is merely the filler between running and performing tasks. The best tool outside of this are bottle and bricks you can throw in the faces of your enemies when you're in a pinch.

I think once you understand that kiting is the game, and not thiefy style hiding and ghosting, Trials plays pretty well, although sometimes a bit glippy like closing doors under duress could be more fluid and when there is more than one enemy attacking you, it gets a bit clusterf*ckish. It's still Early Access and incredibly well made at this stage, so I can't complain too much here.

I recommend. The entire game looks great, amazingly optimised. I'm excited to see how it progresses through Early Access to release.",1700643930,1700643930,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Not too bad for early access, although there are a few bugs at times (which is to be expected). I hope more rigs, amps, customization options, and enemies/maps/trials are added once the game is fully released.

Omega trials are a bit more difficult than all other trials, with some of them having very minimal items (one health potion, one battery, one antidote) and no rigs. When having to electrocute the snitch, the enemies seem to always camp where we need to be, so we end up with an inability to complete the trial. I am sure we all hate being called a failure, haha.

Arm wrestling with everyone was a neat addition, and it aids in the preparation of opening locks. They added speed chess as well, which is pretty fun.

The Halloween event (Program Geister) was cool, but it would be nice if we had more time after the event ended to use up our tokens. There were a lot of cosmetics I unlocked, but missed out on purchasing. :(

All in all, still a pretty fun game to play with friends. Here's hoping for a Christmas event and/or cosmetics~!

[b]A defintive journey into the Outlast universe, with all the nudity the previous games had to offer, but you're no longer alone [/b]
Having played all three Outlast games now, this one is currently standing strong and proud as my favourite of the bunch. Sure, it may not journey to the psychological horrors that 2 would throw at me, nor is it perhaps as Iconic as Mount Massive, but the amount of theoretical content this game will have in the future, with many updates yet to come, constant new programs coming out, not to mention all the sheer character that the Programs and their many Antagonists exhibit is paramount to phenomenal!

[h2]Did I mention that this is the single game I've seen thus far that has actual accessibility options for Tinnitus?![/h2]
The depths of customisation this game allows you to access in its settings alone should become the new standard. Graphical fidelity settings are varied and allow people with all kinds of rigs to run the game, not to mention the accessibility options available which help more than a few of my friends get the very best experience possible.

[h2] Characterisation is Strong [/h2]
The enemies in this game vary in a few ways. At time of writing we have;
2 Outstanding recurring major antagonists which will hunt us down throughout the many trials.
A Myriad of side opponents from Slashers, Shriekers, Giants, Psychological Gas wielding maniacs and Night Vision lurkers
Not to mention the many, many hidden nutjobs hiding in nooks and crannies, let alone the imposters which will regularly make an appearance and try to trick you into thinking you were safe when this isn't your friend Steve, it's St3vE with a shiv.

You are left constantly on your toes in a thrilling game of cat and mouse as you complete your objectives, each time you learn more about the maps, the AI, the world, and it's a fantastic journey that doesn't pull its punches.

[h2] The future is grim (but bright for us!) [/h2]
With more content on the horizon, our poor characters are bound to face many more horrors in the future. At the time of writing, we've recently recieved a new major area with the court and I'm looking forwards to seeing even more from Red Barrels work. 
It's great fun to just grab some friends and hop in, and if you're alone? Fear not, there are more than enough players looking to party up in the lobbies, and whilst you wait, you might as well challenge some folks there to arm wrestling or chess on the side.

When the AAA gaming industry seems to have run dry on ideas and decided to start milking their previous successful titles with remakes or unnecessary sequels, The Red Barrels have proven how much potential this game has to become an horror experience to last for many years to come and properly justify and promote the Outlast saga legacy.

+ Impressive character and cell (your room) customization.
+ Smart and beautiful level design.
+ High replayabilty.
+ Many unlockables, both cosmetics with in-game currency, and skills with in-game tickets.

A little exagerated but everytime you want to go into a mission and complete to end is around 5 cutscenes/decent length loading screens. 1 at the start when you enter the pods, hallucination, one cutscene in the middle of the trial, forced loading while watching your results for the mission, then doctor examination before fully leaving the trial back into the lobby. For EVERY TRIAL and if you want to be a stickler 1 forced cutscene at the start of the game unless you go out of your way to remove the video itself in the files.

Outlast Trials feels like the best of both worlds for co-op players and solo players providing a Left 4 Dead style of map design and enemy variety. There are plenty of abilities and perks to use that are acquired through gameplay leveling just by doing the trials/quests. With solo gameplay in mind, there is plenty to love as a horror game with a tense atmosphere, decent use of keeping players scared and set of mechanics to challenge players. The only drawbacks are that the game seems to require an online connection, which can dismay those that prefer single player gameplay and that some might find the game getting stale after awhile. Plenty to like with a spine chilling horror atmosphere, might even be arguably better than Outlast 1.

Long Version:

Outlast Trials is the third entry into the Outlast series by Red Barrels and takes place as a prequel from the first Outlast. Instead of taking control of a character, players are given the option to create their own character with a set of cosmetic choices. Neat. After that, players will be put into a Prologue to set the stage. Personally, I do not like games that do not let players set options before starting any gameplay. Just from the gameplay, it's easy to ease into the horror atmosphere; which is designed and modeled to near perfection with the Unreal Engine, just as good as Outlast 1. The gameplay is pretty similar to the first two games minus a camera being the source of a night vision point of view. Differences come down to the unique abilities players can equip to stun attackers, see through walls with x-ray, blind enemies, and heal your teammates. With a full team of 4 people, there's a lot to be able to pull off in co-op. Veterans of the Outlast series might be deterred by the co-op option but it's not required, there is a solo option for them. Some mechanics are changed out such as doppelgangers of teammates are not present in solo (Which is a dirty trick in co-op lol). It's more difficult in solo but it is possible to complete a trial to gain exp or cosmetics that are not locked behind a paywall......yet. Always be cautiously aware of that especially with Early Access titles such as this. There is a argument to make where Outlast Trials is a far better horror game than Outlast 1 and 2. Trials relies on RNG horror events to trigger plus mechanics that require players to use dark areas to hide (Or light with some enemies using night vision), the start of every trial however does a predictable jumpscare flash and it got old REALLY quick, removing it would change nothing as it's there purely for reactions. Back to the gameplay, there is a level system that allows players to upgrade their abilities or acquire perks that can change the game slightly or greatly. The maps are very similar to Left 4 Dead as the current trials present have subtle variations that either block doors, remove hiding spots, limit items, or add enemies so experiences might change in-between each trial. I can imagine people might find the same maps stale after awhile, a test of time so to speak. Left 4 Dead and Payday 2 maps haven't gotten old so there might be some lightning in a bottle somewhere in map design for Outlast Trials too. We'll see, this is an Early Access title so please bear that in mind as content is a mystery before making a purchase. When you start the game, you'll see 3 maps with one locked marked as Season One, it is playable after completing every trial but seeing 'Season One' does make me wonder if a Battle Pass is on the horizon. Caution to the wind, as the saying goes.

Update: So far, there is no battle pass. Different challenges are presented in currently existing maps with a big update that added some useless perks and some great perks and abilities. Not much has changed, but the game is still worth it. The 'endings' to the 'story' are pointless so don't mind the story potential as I can't get motivated into exploring it as it just does the same problems that hindered Outlast 2's story.

    This is coming from someone who as played every entry in the Outlast games, including on the highest difficulties.
I never really find horror games that scary and I play them for the anticipation and atmosphere that the developers created. Outlast was an exception and it was genuinely terrifying only being able to rely on your camcorder, reading Miles cynical monologue. The Outlast Trials keeps the same gameplay as the previous games: running and hiding from psychotic people while trying to escape. 
Your main goal is to complete objectives for the Murkoff Corporation to test out their therapy techniques, and only then will you be able to earn your freedom. These are split into Programs, which have one long trial and two challenges. There are also two harder versions of the trial.


[h1] The Good [/h1]
    The only hope of defending yourself is to hide. The stealth from the last couple of games has been improved with the ability to throw objects to quickly stun or distract enemies. Other than than you can hide in plain sight in the dark because most enemies can't see you in the dark like other games which is really cool.
The atmosphere, which is really important for me, is really interesting and reminds me of the first game, as I was a fan of the asylum environment than the outdoor one from the second game. (hopefully we see something like this in this game soon) As a personal bias, I didn't really find this game scary, however I don't really find horror games scary, but this game was excellent at stressing me the fuck out and I applaud Red Barrel at making a good horror game once again that focuses on the psychological aspect rather than cheap jumpcares. There are jumpscares in the sense that you will be caught off guard while doing objectives and its not a bad thing at all.

[h1] The Bad? [/h1]
    So far my only criticism is the small amount of content currently available for most people. I've have 100% completed the first game and it's DLC, and the second game, so I have a lot of experience and in my opinion, the game is decently balanced while solo, and generally easy from a multiplayer perspective. This changes as you scale up to Program X. A lot of the hard missions are fun for the most part, but for most people its really difficult.
This game doesn't have as much story content as the previous entries because it is primarily a multiplayer focused game and may be off-putting for solo players because most of the ""end game"" content so far is just harder versions of previous trials and challenges.

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
    As of right now, the game is worth getting if you plan on playing it as a multiplayer game, with friends or with random people. Regardless of who, its a fun and chaotic, and sometimes scary. If you want to play this game solo, I'd wait for a sale or until more content because as of now it may be a little too repetitive for how little story content there is. You will be getting the same game-play experience as a typical Outlast game but without the story which will only get better with more updates coming to the game.",1685379059,1700631476,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Trials can be played alone or with up to four people. Players are transported to a PVE environment (5 maps as of now-- the final map is exclusively singleplayer) with a handful of enemies, at the moment, the enemy variation is pretty sparse, but the randomness of where they spawn keeps things interesting for the most part. Gameplay focuses on performing a handful of morbid tasks, sneaking around, hiding, inventory management, and a bit of quick thinking. There aren't a lot of different maps right now, but the game does have variants of the available maps to mix things up and open up parts of the map that you would otherwise miss if you only play the default. 

The main mechanics of the game revolve around skills and perks. There are two types of skills, aka Upgrades (Prescriptions and Rigs) to unlock. Prescriptions are passive and Rigs are active. The Prescriptions have to do with stamina, health regen, being able to slide (a must have) and that sort of stuff--while the Rigs have to be activated manually and revolve around stunning enemies, enemy detection, and healing. Meanwhile there are also perks that need to be activated, you can have up to three active perks that can help you move quicker, retaliate more accurately, or be stealthier. 

I started playing the game a few weeks after it was released on Early Access and have been having so much fun with it. There are mini-games that you can play with other players whether or not they're part of your party. Originally, they had two tables dedicated to arm wrestling but in October they added 5-minute chess and 10-minute chess-- I've never had more fun playing chess with friends. So far my favorite non-gameplay related aspects of the game are the character customization and room customization. These small bits of personalization gives the game a touch of hygge despite its contents.

The Outlast trials for the short time I've played the game was an instantaneous favourite game. Personally, I don't overly enjoy first person horror games but the addition of multiplayer gave the gave a goofy style type of play. I can just remember the times when an AI was chasing myself and my friend down a corridor and I would close and lock my friend out of a room. The game has a fair amount of problems however and this has already caused a dramatic fall in player count. Problems such as AI characters becoming stuck on walls whilst in a chase with you or them camping your only way out, it kind of removes the scary ""how am I going to escape"" aspect. Another problem is the rate the developers are adding new content and trials (maps). In my 9 hours of game play, I managed to complete the full two series of trials and play some of them again. If the developers don't start adding more content, the game will continue to decline..

It's also a cool game to just play on your own if you're up for it, sure it may be slightly more difficult if you don't really know what you're doing, compared to not knowing what to do with friends, but once you get the gist of the game you'll like it.
The only downside to that is it gets a bit repetitive once you've done everything a lot more times over and through, but each time you load up a trial it randomizes blocked/locked doors, cabinets (mechanical and medicinal), and sound traps. So it adds some fresh variety.

Overall really cool game, I've played it a ton, made me love the rest of the Outlast series.

The Outlast Trials place players into a myriad of situations and areas within which they are meant to fulfill their goals and then return to the home base. This is a fine start, but the problems arise for the single player when you find yourself being subjected to some of the restraints and restrictions of this being treated as an online multiplayer game:

1. You are restricted to three lives per therapy session, and you can't quit the game and resume a session from where you left off.
2. You cannot pause the game, even when playing alone. If players could join an ongoing game of their own accord with your input, this would make perfect sense, but not allowing players playing completely solo to pause a horror game seems a bit iffy to me.
3. If a player is idle for too long, they will be booted from the game, regardless of how much progress they've made and whether or not they were playing alone. Again, this is a decision that makes perfect sense for an online game, but considering you already can't pause the game and are on limited lives, this seems extra punishing for solo players. I found myself needing to step away to walk my dog, only to find myself having been booted to the main menu when I return with nothing to show for the hour of gameplay I'd engaged in up to that point.
4. When you are booted from the game this way, you don't gain any experience or rewards like you would have if your character simply died and ran out of lives. Again, this is a design choice that makes sense for the online aspect of the game: why reward players who were potentially dragging down their partners? On the other hand, one could argue a player who was playing alone is already being punished by the game enough by losing all of their progress.",1684873354,1700611645,True,6,0,0.610750675201416016,0,True,False,True

there's a lot of in-game story content too, especially with the amount of files. it has gotten a little repetitive up until now, but after the halloween event, there'll be weekly programs. 
game play is also a huge W, having to avoid traps and making sounds while also placing your own down for the enemies to fall onto. having to learn the best routes and all the locations for specific objects you have to find is also pretty cool.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

There is permanent progression through level-ups, skill and customization unlocks, which incentivises players to continue playing long after they've completed the final stage.

Regular content updates such as new challenges, trials, maps and monsters encourage players to return often to experience something new.

Players are weak, but not defenceless. Bricks, bottles and Rigs let players buy precious time to avoid enemies or slow them down. This rewards a more aggressive play-style compared to most horror games which rely too heavily on stealth. Due to offensive items, matches don't need to be unnecessarily prolonged and waste time.

Mini-games let players occupy time while waiting for groups to form, players to join and trials to start. They also have ranking systems that give a sense of accomplishment, so players can treat these side activities just as seriously as the main game itself.

Customization for characters and their cells give players the chance to display their visual flair and personality without the need for words. Want to show that you're a wannabe serial killer? Dress in the skin of your victims and display their body parts in your blood-drenched room. There are hundreds of individual items to unlock and buy and more are frequently added.

Players can choose how accessible or immersive they want their game to be played. Show or hide all HUDs and indicators, or choose from a mix. You can feel more in control or feel more helpless depending on how much info you are willing to see on your HUD.

Enemy designs are creative and each enemy character has a distinct personality, from the small grunts to the large ones and the prime assets which are the ultimate villains, each the centerpiece of their particular program. When enemies grab, beat, choke and toss you around, the first-person perspective puts you into the action and you feel absolute terror and fear.

Sounds in the game are eerie, especially when you hear distant screams and nearby mumbling from unknown sources. Is it simply your imagination, or are there enemies lurking close by where you can't see them? The senseless ranting and menacing monologues by the enemies tell you there is no reasoning with them- you must flee or die. Every movement and motion has an impact, because sound is also crucial to the gameplay and scoring.

The visuals are incredible. Everything is visceral and realistic, to the point where the player feels truly immersed in each location. The bloody set pieces and makeshift infrastructure show much attention to detail and every prop is well-placed and tells a small story in the overall setting. Spend time appreciating how objects are placed, why they are placed there, and you can see how each prop fits into the lore of each program perfectly. From the scratched writing on the wall, to how the mannequins are violated and posed, the player can almost perceive the madness of the world from the antagonists' minds.

A well-optimized game that runs at consistent and high frame-rates even on lower-end PCs at maxed settings. Lots of settings to configure graphics, interfaces, volume and regional servers. Server disconnections or interruptions are as rare as to be almost non-existent, and I've only been disconnected twice- that was on launch day itself.

A must-play game for all fans of survival horror, whether you intend to play solo or with others.",1700601031,1700601031,True,1,0,0.522821545600891113,0,True,False,True

My initial thoughts of this game were clouded heavily by my love for the first game and it's DLC; this the intro mission to this game not really hitting the same vibes in the same way as they both did. 90 hours in...well I'd say that the vibe still doesn't hit the same, but that doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable and a hell of a lot of fun with friends.

Outlast Trials for me fails to capture the terrifying atmosphere, the tension and the complete powerlessness that you feel when walking around in the first two games; so as an Outlast title, I feel as though Outlast Trials falls flat in this area. The game however does excel completely when it comes to artistic design, map creation, character development, lore and it's multiplayer aspects. The trials have been thoroughly enjoyable both to tackle on a solo run or with a group of friends.

For an early access game this is polished; and at first glance you might even think it's a completed title...even when it isn't. The content currently in the game will keep you occupied and wanting to continue playing for hours; and there is still more content promised for future updates, during early access leading up to the final game release (although I'm not sure how frequent updates will be). With a few more maps, characters and a whole bunch of lore and maybe even collectables added, this game has so much potential. I'm really excited to see where the developers are planning on taking the game as it moves forward.

The only cons I have with the game in it's current state are the psychosis affect; it gives me incredibly bad motion sickness because of the way the camera moves. Maybe there could be an accessibility toggle or it could be changed altogether to something else. The other con I have is that honestly the game isn't dark enough. Which sounds dumb but when I think of the original games they were dark, and terrifying, it made navigating so difficult; these maps in comparison are so bright it's hard to feel scared at all.

First of all the Gameplay, the Graphics, and the Controls are spot on, they feel like an Outlast game and play Exactly like that, it's also Smooth as hell, tho I would not Recommend Ray tracing, I had it enabled at Launch and it crashed my Game, after Update #1 I tried it again and had 20Fps, with a 3070 TI, that's not supposed to happen. 

Now at the Current state, you have 3 Unique Scenarios, with Project X and Project Omega just being recycled and harder versions of those scenarios, making for some people that can't get enough more and harder Content. This brings me to the issue of the game, it is sadly not Scary, rather the game does not focus on horror at all and just on Replay ability and Fun, now some things can catch u Off guard like the Fake players (which are well made and fool you, even tho they can see you everywhere even in the dark, so there kinda stronger than the normal enemies)

The 3 Scenarios or Trials are good, with the first 2 (Police Station and Carnival) having a nice theme and cool design, but it already stops at that because the third scenario (Cult/Church idk) already starts Reusing ideas, like the Children and the mother which were already present in the Carnival scenario, the game has also some MK Challenges which are 30-40 min little adventures ig you do in the about same/little difference areas of the Trials, as I said I played all those. This made the game's replayability suffer imo as we were already a bit unmotivated after the church scenario was so close-themed like the Carnival scenario.

The Main hub is also well made, cosmetic items that drop from trials can be used to change the style of yourself and your room, so u can pump up your crip (I love that ), its also cool that different characters upgrade your Rig or give you permanent upgrades to your character. The coolest feature of the Hub is the arm wrestling, It's just a fun Dead by Daylight Style QTE Minigame against someone else, simple but effective, love that. 

the Different gameplay mechanics, all fit well, the rigs make for nice change and coordination and different playstyles, these are all great, even tho I think the hiding psychos and the doc that just spawns randomly at a door that alarms like 3 seconds before that, is hard to avoid and needs improvement.

The Foundations of this game are Great, now it just needs the Content to Support it, and because of the lack of content 30€ is a bit Harsh, if it gets more content I'm happy to give it a better review. For now 6.5/10

The pacing is right, it starts the levels off fairly mild, 1-2 enemies, if any until the first objective, then it's like ""welcome to outlast, go F yourself"" which i love. further trials past main story adjust difficulty well, it scales properly, not just an ""easy mode -> you're dead mode"", it's a lot of enemies or traps, but if you play through the first of each program, the later trials are fair.

Coop is probably a must

While there isn’t a full story like the previous outlast games there is a short  story told through the mission that you have to compete .The introduction also has a short story of how you ended up on the trials to begin with. Inside the missions you will also find evidence folders that contain more lure to give you more insight on the project you are being used for.

Inside the mission you will be met with various tasks of finding keys, powering generators, looking for missing ingredients, disabling gates and doors, killing key targets, hacking off limbs, and a variety of other things.
You will be chased by enemies who can stab you, punch you, infect you with gas that causes you to go mental, electrocute you, and a sock puppet thay will drill through your face. There really no end to the multiple ways you can die here, and almost all the enemies can execute you so you will need a revive to continue playing.

Each map is very large and takes about 30min or longer to complete the first time. Each map has different missions to choose and each has their own layout of that map so you aren’t seeing the same area for 5 different missions. It’s very well done how they keep things familiar but make it different.

When not playing trials you are placed into the hub which is like a prison block where you can decorate your room and level up skills to your character and set different optional skills and offensive tools depending on your play style like healing or placing traps to slow or blind enemies.

So far this game is extremely good and does what it does well while keeping you on the move for fast paced horror action or slow stealthy sneaking.

I played this on steam deck and the game is very optimized and maintains 50-60fps all the time with ultra textures and medium everything else using FSR 2

• Absolutely blown away by how fun and smooth it plays it does not feel like an Early Access game what so ever feels more of a complete game than Jedi: Survivor and that's saying something.

• 4-Hours in and I only have good things to say, the universe they built is one of a kind, grimmy, dark and specially gory I love Red Barrels for going all in and not holding back when it comes to art direction.

• The CO-OP gameplay just works and plays amazingly and to think this is their first ever Multiplayer/Online game is crazy. they've nailed the things that make a CO-OP game unique and fun, even playing with randoms that don't really cooperate still feels like they cooperate if that makes any sense. 

• Not introducing any kind of MTX is a big win also, I can only see this game blooming from here on out. Red Barrels is yet to disappoint. the future is very bright and has big potential and I'm all for it!",1684447210,1700592047,True,21,0,0.689705312252044678,0,True,False,True

I thought compared to the other installments in the franchise this one was lacking in overall story.  This game is not a linear story like the other games. It doesnt require you to keep playing for long periods of time to gain progress. Red Barrels has done something wonderful with this game. The stories in this game are crafted well and tightly packed in small vignettes. I think as life has gotten busier for me this sort of horror game really suits my time while still giving me little jumpscares. The Coop feature is also quite nice as it gives my buddies and I something else to play other than the usual suspects. This game is still in beta but from beginning to now Ive seen the events they have put in + the new trial; so far this game has been very promising. Its still in early access but so far this studio has delivered (there's always a need for more content).

Also the leveling system and all the unlockables are very satisfying. The game play is fun as in solo as in a party. It is even fun to farm. The levels and the missions vary much, which makes you think that every level is unique, especially when not all the missions use the same parts of the level. There's always something you haven't seen. The only thing it may lack is special characters ex. old lady or the guard, I've only seen them so far, which may bee enough for several levels, but then it gets a bit tiring. The positioning of the enemies is very good, since it slows down the tiring of the lack of unique characters and make the level more interesting.

Another thing I want to add is the customization. I think its incredible that we get to make our own characters and rooms. Only complaint I have for the game is the ""No God""  that flashes on the TV screens, but I understand why they would put that for the story, so it's okay.

My only gripe is how some challenges in the higher difficulties seem a bit cheap. There are these guys that mimic other players, and if you're near them they'll pull out a knife and stab you. You would think the challenge would be to identify who's a real player and who's the imposter, however in the later difficulties it seems more of a cheap way to knock your grade down if you're surrounded by multiple enemies- because they will walk straight over to you and stab. Overall it's a multiplayer game, so sometimes things can seem cheap/bullshit when in reality it's not, however I do genuinely think difficulty scaling leans towards throwing more enemies at you instead of providing a real challenge.

The game allows players to team up with friends or strangers online, creating an intense and nerve-wracking experience as you navigate the nightmarish Cold War-era environment together. The cooperative aspect adds an extra dimension to the horror, as you must rely on your teammates to survive the relentless onslaught of terror.

Visually, The Outlast Trials is a stunning masterpiece. The developers have meticulously crafted a chilling atmosphere that immerses players in the eerie, Cold War-era setting. The detailed environments, ominous lighting, and spine-chilling sound design contribute to a palpable sense of dread, ensuring that every corner turned is fraught with tension. The graphics are not only a feast for the eyes but also an integral part of the overall horror experience.

The narrative in The Outlast Trials is another strong point. While it maintains the psychological horror elements that the series is known for, the addition of cooperative play introduces new dynamics to the storytelling. The game delves into the mysterious experiments conducted in the Murkoff Corporation's facility, creating a captivating and suspenseful plot that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

The gameplay mechanics are intuitive and responsive, allowing for a seamless cooperative experience. The Outlast Trials retains the heart-pounding stealth elements and resource management that fans of the series love, while also introducing new challenges that require teamwork to overcome. The variety of enemies and unpredictable events ensure that each playthrough is a unique and adrenaline-fueled adventure.

In conclusion, The Outlast Trials is a triumph in the horror gaming genre. It successfully builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessors, introducing a cooperative element that elevates the fear factor to new heights. With its exceptional visuals, gripping narrative, and immersive gameplay, The Outlast Trials is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and a testament to Red Barrels' mastery in crafting unforgettable gaming experiences. Brace yourself for a relentless journey into the heart of fear, where survival depends on the strength of your alliances and the resilience of your nerves.",1686391730,1700189473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Basically? Gameplay-wise It's Outlast but how you thought it played watching some youtuber scream their lungs out at the funny naked men. Sound especially plays a big role with there being various traps and things in the environment which can give away your position, coupled with a whole cast of funny specialized variants who are out for your blood.

My only real complaint would be how unlocking cosmetics is handled - grinding for them can definitely get really tedious if there's a specific outfit you want, otherwise you just sorta gotta make do with what you're given, and having to replay a mission tons of times for a single outfit you might not even get can get really frustrating I bet.

Oh, and some missing content from the closed beta (specifically peeking around doors when opening them, less this is part of the second pharmacist upgrade tree)

Also, please re-add the ability to holster items! I do like the option for auto hiding but personally pressing X to hide the item manually was more intuitive in my opinion. Along with making it so you don't accidentally use an item.

Regardless, that's really my only set of criticisms, i'm glad to see the game is really polished as well despite being in EA, coupled with having some really good optimization, which is a trend I'm happy to see Red Barrels stick to after all this time.

Definitely really excited to see where this goes over the coming months/years.

Halloween update thoughts: (10/31/2023)
Pretty neat update all around! New trial is spiffy, I liked the acid mechanic, real neat.
A lot of the unused cosmetics datamined from the closed beta have been finally added, plus some new ones which are super neat to see.

I think Trials is in an ideal state to be enjoyed, however there are some slight annoyances I have:

New MK trials are fine, but have some issues:

The halloween  NV goggles don't change the night vision color! I feel like that'd be a really cool effect to aim for in the future, especially since you're in the dark a lot - and the different color would really help make the goggles feel more important and worth it in the end.

Free the prisoners is an absolute joke in singleplayer, I'm not sure if it's better in multiplayer but it deadass feels like cut content hastily slapped together. All you have to do is get the key and make it to the center room, press the button and then get out.
It took me around four minutes to do my first go, which is whack.

Feels like one designed for grinding rather than a substantial MK trial addition.

Orphan abduction one is definitely better, I don't really have any complaints, it's a nice little addition which changes up the design of the orphanage's interior to feel different and fresh enough.

I have yet to do Drill the futterman.

I wouldn't exactly mind these if Vindicate The Guilty(tm) actually had MK challenges of its own, and the other three were added to the previous trials (I doubt anyone would complain.) but it lacks any unique ones using the courthouse map, which is quite strange-

Weirder enough is the acid bucket mechanic - that could really make for an interesting mk-challenge focused scenario, since I always saw the mk-challenges as focusing specifically on elements from the main trials in bite-sized pieces which were quick and more focused.

Vindicate the guilty has none of that, so I am curious if these new ones were rushed out, potentially?
I don't think they're bad, just a tad bit underwhelming.

Otherwise? I think the update is quite good! Hopefully we get a christmas update to follow - however game design is difficult and a pain in the ass, especially with what Red Barrels is trying to make and maintain. I'm willing to be patient and trust that RB knows what the hell they're doing.

Don't crunch your employees uwu, do your best and we'll wait patiently.

Trials isn't a live service experience - it's an early access game.

This game is such a breath of fresh air and proves that it is possible for modern games to release in a functional state these days.

The night vision is the worst part, too painful for my eyes because the white light emitted is too strong, especially when I end up in illuminated areas it is even worse and I am literally blinded, rather than adding a green filter which would have been less invasive and much lighter.
I guess the developers didn't try to play it for several hours, otherwise they would have realized the huge mess.

🎀Initially it was quite interesting, it seemed like something different, it really isn't.
After just 35 hours it became very repetitive and boring, just like other similar games.
The mechanics are all the same regardless of what you have to do in different missions.
Did I say different missions?
Oops, my mistake, there is absolutely nothing different.
All comes down to searching for the same objects to complete the mission and escape.
The perks to unlock or upgrade are only useful to make things easier for you or the other players in the party, obviously, but they don't change anything in terms of fun.
The labels on the store page are wrong, the game has nothing horror at all it's just a link to the world of Outlast, unless someone gets scared by a bunch of funny pixels, rather than horrible enemies.
Technically it's done well but this title really offers very little for an online version that should try to entertain the players for a long time.
Gameplay aside, but with the problem of the white light emitted by the night vision device, it is unplayable for me.

🎀I don't know, but for me it's years of development thrown in the trash.
A horror series turned into an action game.
Search, run, hide, finished!
Without even a shred of history, only mentions found on pieces of paper scattered around.
The game is still in early access, the price is very low, there is content to come, probably new maps.
Bored after only 35 hours, for an online game it's really too little and it's not a good sign.
I would have preferred a normal single player.

🎀In development for years to find a castrated gameplay, an incomplete game with only one mechanic, apart from the maps and different difficulties, in addition to the fact that users feedback is asked for development, which to me seems to be synonymous with lack of ideas on further development.

At the moment, source SteamDB Dead by Daylight exceeds 37,000 players online, while Outlast only has 2,200, there must be a reason.

🎀Should I recommend it?
I really would like to, but I don't feel like deceiving anyone, you can always try it and at the latest ask for a refund within 2 hours.

It turns out on the one hand that the fact of playing the game with someone else does not make it less scary even though playing in singleplayer provides an unrivalled feeling of heart-crushing abandonment that can't be replicated by the presence of a second reagent. The sleep room on the other hand is not as convincing and it keeps me from reaching the levels of fear I experienced playing Outlast 1 & 2. More on that below.

The graphics are properly incapacitating sometimes. The level of detail as well as the care going into the crafting of these different biomes - prime assets characters included - are astonishing, borderline insane more often than not while still being early access. The mere fact that all of the events take place in gigantic warehouses turned into joyous psycho-horror-fu*kfest movie studios makes it even more stunningly frightening and beautifully disturbing. This game's artistic patte is a masterful take on how graphics can be used to enhance fear and deepen the sense of danger in a horror game.

The Trials as well as the submissions can all be completed in solo as well as in multiplayer. My experience involves both types of gameplay and I'm really impressed by Red Barrels for bending the rules as well as the interactions with the surroundings according to how many reagents tackle the trials. The randomisation of the state of doors as well as the spawning of traps is another brilliant way to add replayability. Exploring the concept of being a guinea pig experienced on alive is a fantastic idea to give more insight into Murkoff's agenda and background. A perfect excuse to flesh out the lore.

I know the game can be played solo but it sells itself more or less as a live-coop game, and that's where the itch becomes the scratch for me because it takes away one CORE component that the first two games exemplified to an indecent degree, far more than any other game before : loneliness. I know you have Silent Hill, SOMA, Amnesia, Resident Evil Rebirth but loneliness in Outlast feels like the main antagonist because there's nothing more terrifying than being hunted alive by crazed psychos completely unbeknownst to the rest of the world, knowing nobody can hear you or save you. Then kicks in the lack of respite coupled to the lack of safety, keeping you alert because you have no idea when the next atrocity will hit, nor how. As a player, that gives horror a entirely new dimension. As said by the first Outlast, your only choices are to run, hide or die. Straightforward. That means you're gonna suffer.

In Trials, it's toned down mainly because of the sleep room. That's how I feel about it.
It's a beautifully crafted interlude between two trials and it gives lore, but it takes too much of the scare factor away with it. Outlast's safe havens (maybe heavens here) have always had that phenomenal particularity that whilst they could be devoid of enemies they never brought down the level of scare, because sound fx kept you on edge (be it music or scary winds, creaking planks, etc...).

The sleep room almost feels like my house. It's white, clean as f*ck, full of questionable looking items that make the bulk of the decoration and I've got my own sleep room. I even laugh when I see other reagent's sleep cells and realise they've got even shi**ier decoration tastes than I do. That's the fun part but to be honest, the problem I've got with it is that I feel too detached from the survival-horror experience I enlisted for when roaming the sleep room and the fact that I can socialise is actually my biggest complaint. Seeing other reagents controlled by real people is an immersion breaker when it comes to horror. I wish the singleplayer component was actually separate from the constantly-buzzing-social-hub-tailored experience should the player so wishes. The sleep room has tons of features to fall for but that social component - knowing there are other real humans with you  instead of quicksilver reagents - takes all the unique and defining scare-worthy component Outlast patte away. It dispels the fear of the unknown because there's no way you can get in danger in the sleep room. It's too mentally comfortable. Some people will hallucinate reading this comment I'm sure, but I signed for an Outlast game, a digital entity known for pushing the boundaries of horror in many ways and so far I've yet to experience what Outlast 1 & 2 made me go through.

I wish that I was given the full solo route option by replacing the other players with NPC reagents (nice potential extra lore here) suffering through their therapy in their own unique way (like turning briefly hostile towards me if I beat them at arm-wrestling or go in their room and they spot me for example) so I can feel forsaken and left on my own to rot in my cell contemplating the failure of my last trial F Grade because I got ra*ed and face-grated by a terrifying boll*cks-hanging grunt while knowing that the only way for me to get rid of all this is to delve back into that nightmarish trial and face my demons. In the first two Outlast games, if you sh*t yourself, no f*cks were given. Deal with the terror and inch forward or digitally die and leave. Run, hide or die situations everywhere from beginning to the end. No respite.

Can terror-lovers get this please RED Barrels *_*?

Exceptional level and sound design, careful use of prime assets and wonderful replayability safeguarded by the randomised placement of assets, items and traps. make The Outlast Trials the epitome of mechanical efficiency and matured gameplay in many ways.

Don't take my previous points as a negative review, FAR BE IT from it. The game is really well-crafted in many ways. It's a solid 16/20 so far, I really hope some adjustments can be made to entice me to raise the score.",1699318706,1699319357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Old: Saying not recommended until they add mission/trial specific group queues.

Your other option is to find a group on their discord. Why would I want to use a 3rd party app in order to find a group?

--Staying true to the old games--
1. The vaulting is not as nice as it used to look in the old games, in my opinion the vaulting animation look really bad now, you barely can see your arms and legs and some people like this but as I mentioned earlier it's in my opinion. It would've been better if you could see your character actually vaulting instead of just the camera moving
2. You can now defend yourself which I mean it's fine but in the old games all you could do was run
--Outlast & gameplay--
1. The feeling of playing an OUTLAST GAME some what dissappeared because of this game, I do think I am playing an outlast game, I just don't feel the same vibe as I do with outlast 2 and 1.
2. The game does jumpscare me when I'm catched out of guard, which I like that from the game since I haven't been afraid of a horror game in a long time.
3. You will probably experience this but the enemies might be extremely annoying and bothersome for you, This is my case. Besides some times jumpscaring me I feel really annoyed when I'm interrupted doing something but of course, it's the point of the game and they did a great job on doing so
4. As I mentioned in the previous section, the parkour animations is not so good as I would say like the previous games, if you liked the bouncing camera from the previous games sadly and I'm pretty sure it will not come back, I hope it does though. One of the main reasons why I loved to get into chases in purpose just so I could see the camera wobbling around because it immersed me, I understand some people wouldn't like this and that's perfectly fine, I would like it if they did added it and if people don't like it they just choose the reduce motion sickness option so they can have that view bouncing that is currently in the game
5. Graphics are pretty good, not a massive upgrade from Outlast 2 but they are pretty solid
6. Replayability I'm not so sure but you can check other people's reviews but as far as I've seen, it's got a TON of replayability I think
7. The facility is AMAZING, I love moving around and interacting with other people and I love to walk to some place I need to upgrade something instead of just clicking some buttons which for me it is kinda boring.

In conclusion: The game is good and I'm currently playing it a lot more than any other game I have in my library, it doesn't stay too true to the old games but it's fine because this game differentiates itself from the last couple of games in a good way.

Does for Outlast what Resident Evil outbreak essentially did for Resident Evil, but I would go further and state that it probably mechanically speaking has the best gameplay of any outlast game with the most stuff going on mechanics wise. Lots of mechanics here and some of them you just have to learn by playing the game or talking to people and having them teach you and are not straight up explained to you but that just makes me appreciate them that much more. I always thought that the previous games were a little mechanically lacking for my taste and kind of simple so this is very much a treat in my eyes. Also the map design is just good. The singleplayer outlast games felt very linear but here we have maps that are all basically designed around the objective and expanding outward from it rather than the exits which is the superior way to do it IMO and more closely aligns with map design trends from older survival horror games.

This type of horror genre is the best genre considering it’s crazy storytelling and backdoor political horror. I won’t spoil anything but wow, the story of the Murkoff Corporation and their experiments to create a different type of ‘weapon’ for the state is just incredible. 

It’s not just about running, hiding and achieving the goals of the trial. It’s about the process of getting perfect in your trial runs and how sharp you have to become after trying over and over again. Like the doctor says after you complete a trial. ‘If I say jump, you jump. But I want you to say.. how high? Can you be my how high?’ These type of quotes describe the intensity of the trials and man, what a masterpiece. 

I’m looking forward to the future development of the Outlast Trials and I have great hope that Red Barrels will become even bigger then they are now, as long as they keep this game updated and start lobbying for an Outlast movie/series. 

Keep up the good work Red Barrels! :)

I got pretty far in the Halloween trials but I got to one where Gooseberry can 1-shot you with 4 bars of damage, got to the end and died and failed. I tried matchmaking, waited 5min to get a group for Halloween trials, only for everyone  to leave after I queued the same trial, leaving me solo. I tried my best but died to Gooseberry again, instantly failing the mission just 2 disarms short of the exit unlocking. WTF happened to having 3 lives? I'm supposed to be at the mercy of AI RNG deciding whether they find me or not and insta-killing me and forcing me out of the whole trial if they do? I get that there's pills now to give you extra lives, but that's created a new problem where if they just don't spawn, you're forced to play in a pseudo-hardcore gamemode where you have 1 life and most of the enemies 1-shot you. I didn't even mention the other modifiers, typically making the enemies faster, more alert, less lenient during chases. The original problem with solo was always how stacked it felt against you. I had a game where there were 5 special enemies constantly hovering around me, there were times where I had to sit in a locker for several minutes because when one guy left another entered the room. The last objective was at the end of a linear hallway that happened to attract 1-2 enemies every time I went to work on it. These types of missions take almost an hour to complete as well, it's such a waste of time. The reason it's so stacked is because the levels are designed with 4 people in mind. So why is it the developers insist on adding extra lives instead of balancing the levels based on player-count by removing a couple enemies, or making their pathing spread wider throughout the map so you bump into them less frequently? Lives and pills will never be a replacement for teamwork and being able to split enemy attention. This game is fun with a friend, and really fun with 3 friends, but I can't recommend it because of how unfair and frustrating the solo experience is.",1698974669,1698974669,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Players are thrown together and must work together to survive. Well, they don't have to, but it would be greatly to their detriment. Powerless to fight back (except for the occasional brick or bottle), terrifying NPC enemies will patrol the grounds of the Trials, watching key objectives and keeping you on your toes. It's up to you and your team to use your wits, surroundings, and crucial teamwork to lure enemies away from key objectives while solving puzzles/completing these objectives at the same time.

The game, in my opinion, is best experienced and discovered freshly and for the first time with friends who are also discovering it for the first time.

Considering the game cannot be as cinematic as the single player experiences by sheer nature of being multiplayer, this game's AI does an incredible job of facilitating fun chases, as assailants will weave in and out of rooms, and naturally coerce players into leading enemies to each other, creating a terrifying domino effect. The game's proximity chat is an absolute blast, and playing with friends or strangers while being chased and bumping into each other through the winding halls of Murkoff is hilarious and fun with incredible acoustics and quality.

The game experience, especially the UI, has been optimized for casual gameplay, but the game allows for incredible experience customization - allowing you to flip as many switches as possible to tailor the experience how you want.

The vibe, design and core gameplay loop are very well done. This game begs for more content though, the new Trial and Halloween event are cool but on a regular play through, once you're done with all the challenges (and maybe even halfway through) you feel that you've seen everything there is.
The real shame here is that they made 3 great 'bosses' or antagonists for the trials and they just repeated them on the rest of the trials. They even repeated the cutscenes you get at the start of the trials :(

I'm an old survival horror fan, like I played the first Silent Hill when it came out kind of old.
I loved the first two Outlast games and was very cranky and skeptical of Outlast, or any survival horror, in a multiplayer format. I was happily proven wrong by the Trials.
I play this on solo more than multiplayer and when you play solo, the game takes that into consideration and caters your experience accordingly, I hope it remains that way with future updates.
It's simply a masterpiece, extremely well crafted and thought out. With limited content released, since it was only in Early Access, it still managed to keep my hooked and playing daily since May of 2023. It's replay value is ridiculously good, it's just so much fun.
I highly recommend this for solo or multi-players, I've also been playing it on the Steam Deck and it works flawlessly. Very well crafted in every aspect there is, from music and sound design, all the way to game play and plotting.

Game has poor implementation of DLSS also does suck that modern games tend to make sure you cant not use other forms of AA and just stuck using TAA because engine and graphics stuffs

from the amount of content there is for the money is lacking and since its mainly a coop online game a high price in EA might not be a good idea

as well as how this game strays away from how outlast, the franchise is and has been a singleplayer game
though knowing that this is more for coop can tell it can be a fun horror game WITH FRIENDS really only

but I'm playing solo and this game so far is not fun even when I first tried multiplayer it was a horrible experience
playing the second trial for the first time as a lvl 3 player with like lvl30/40+ people on the hardest difficulty trial. 

That was not fun and made me so far as of writing this review not making me WANT to play the game sadly
also nobody talks and again hopping on the game as a kind of a newbie feels like I'm forced to play solo to rank up and learn stuff on my own, anyways lagging and dragging behind everyone else which for a horror game nonetheless shouldn't feel like that

I could add a bit more but feel tho this is pointless since I'm probably a super minority willing to be critical of this game(the community of outlast lets just say they probably are currently living at a certain rehab center funded by the Murkoff corp. with how you may not be able to be said critical of their baby), loved red barrels they do put out quality content even under this case that was feeling lacking of said quality content tho

I'll admit I was sceptical when I heard that a series known for its cinematic found-footage formula was going to venture into the co-op multiplayer genre. Startling, however, the result is mostly true to the previous entries, and does an excellent job of making a co-op horror game that can house some really thrilling moments.

If you just plan to play very casually with friends, this game is good. If you plan to play solo though, and want to speed run or improve upon your own scores, forget it. There is not a restart button. There are ""multiple lives"" now that let you resume the game. This is not a fix since using these penalize you, which shows how stubborn devs are in not allowing a restart button to be present. Actually restarting (backing out, being called a dumbfuck for one minute, going to the terminal, waiting 20 seconds, and going through the dumbass cutscene for one minute) takes two to three minutes at least. Also no offline mode. Even in single player you cannot pause. Not having a basic FUNCTION such as a restart or pause button is embarrassing. It's not even a matter of a feature, because calling a restart button or pause button a feature is like saying a settings menu is a feature. It's a function. A function that should be EXPECTED to exist. The devs have said a restart button ""takes away from the intensity"" but this is incorrect. Not having a restart and pause button ""takes away from the intensity"" because the player should just refund and/or uninstall the game.

This game is not meant to be a completely immersive horror story, though the elements are there if you look for them. This game is meant to increase the amount of fun that you already experience in a group, as you run yelling and screaming from insane doctors, police, and naked people.

If you go into this game solo expecting the type of gameplay that is engaging to solo play, you are not going to have fun. If you go into it with three more people that you already play games with often, you are probably going to have the time of your life.

As for the gameplay itself, very good. The only things I would want to be different are a mode where the enemies can hear you talk to eachother. And if I don't see Whitehorn in the next trial I'm starting a riot.

The gameplay is a mix of stealth and puzzle solving like most survival horror experiences, however this one shines with its thought provoking narrative. Its also highly repayable especially with different party sizes. Different group sizes will require different strategies based on the map. Weighing the pros and cons of staying together vs splitting up is definitely part of the fun. I also personally LOVE all the body horror in the game. Without spoiling too much, killing the judge and cutting off the legs of jesus christ are top tier moments for this game.

My biggest (and pretty much only) complaint though is the lack of communication from the devs. Ive been playing since the player test last november and i can confidently say this team is known for going radio silent for months at a time.

New Halloween update looks absolutely amazing and adds many things necessary to prolong this games life. It isnt dead yet, and with the biggest and best update just having dropped, it seems this game will only increase in popularity. 

Got it yesterday. Ended up playing for 5 hours with my girlfriend. Playing alone definitely provides a great horror experience. Playing with friends is less stressful and at times funny. Game pretty much seems like what ""Blackout Club"" was trying to become over time before it was abandoned. There isnt a ton of content yet... Though after 5 hours I still havent beat every mission. The way the missions are designed, there are 4 Levels/Areas and each of those have 4 or 5 missions in them which change up the objectives and goals in game. A really cool feature that we loved is that we get our own Prison Cell / Bedroom in the lobby, which you can decorate and design, as well as unlock lots of cosmetics for your character. Theres nice perks and abilities to buy as well. Other players can visit your room. A great part of the game is that there is text quick chats, so a mic isnt absolutely necessary like in phasmophobia and other popular horror multiplayer games. As well, there is of course voice chat if you prefer talking. The maps are great designed, it pays homage to the original outlast games, the enemies are great, etc. If games like World War Z were too repetitive with not enough missions for you, you might experience that here. While i havent finished everything yet, I can definitely see the point where missions just being overly repetitive will come, so hopefully the developers continue to add new maps, missions, objectives etc. Worth the price though, thats for sure.",1684589946,1698343826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Like in the previous Outlast games, you need to go to point A and retrieve stuff while simultaneously trying to avoid killers. That changes a little bit here. Think of the SAW movies, and then mix it into a kind of gameshow-esque kinda setting. It even brought back its charming weirdness, like full-on public nudity. Penises are abound here, along with decaying tits stapled to nuns. Yeah, it's Outlast alright. ._.

The Perks you can unlock and upgrade as you level up are great uses, and having a squad that can come in with different equipment can help you as you try and beat each game. There are unlockables you can use for your own little room to show off your own personal flair, but they're not really super satisfying to unlock. You can unlock some desk unique items for completing certain map challenges, but that's really about it when it comes to the cosmetics.

It's fun for a good while, but after you play through all the maps through all their difficulties so many times, you kinda lose interest as it gets a little easier to do every time. But I'd say the biggest letdown of this game is that there's far too little content to keep gauging my interest. It was fun, but in the end the $30 I spent on this game doesnt seem all that worth it when I only have 22 hours on this game.

I know we're only in 5 months on this game so far, but I feel like there 'should' be more, but there just isn't. And that's the biggest letdown of them all. I'd give it a thumbs up, but the above reasons are just why I can't. I'll come back to this game in a couple months to see if new content drops.",1698125792,1698125792,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

Each mission is in a distinct location with set objectives that will increase based on how many you have in your team. The first set of trials are not difficult and things get progressively easier as you level up on how you deal with threats and how you move about the map. There are quite a few types of roaming enemies and there are new threats based on the difficulty of the mission. There are various fun cosmetics you can unlock and to make your character look like a goofball as you run with your crew of clowns. The levels themselves look great and creepy as hell as each location will make you feel a bit uncomfortable as you play through the missions. So far I absolutely love this game and I have high hopes for it as the release more content.

1304930,148365679,76561198849048652,60,7,917,0,390,1702170829,"The Outlast Trials"" had the potential to be an innovative addition to the world of horror gaming, but it falls short in several key aspects, ultimately making it a lackluster experience. This essay will discuss the reasons why this game can be considered as ""really bad,"" from its overreliance on shock value to its lack of content and disappointing AI.

First and foremost, the game's primary downfall is its blatant overuse of shock and gore. While horror games often aim to provoke fear and discomfort, ""The Outlast Trials"" seems to have confused genuine horror with gratuitous violence. The game frequently thrusts players into scenes of grotesque brutality, often veering into a realm of tastelessness. Shocking imagery and extreme violence are indeed essential elements of the horror genre, but ""The Outlast Trials"" takes it too far, sacrificing subtlety and storytelling for cheap thrills. The excessive violence, unappealing lechery, and over-the-top subject matter often leave players feeling desensitized rather than genuinely frightened. Instead of inducing genuine horror, the game often elicits eye-rolls and frustration.

Furthermore, the game's storytelling and narrative development are weak at best. It lacks a compelling and coherent storyline, opting for a shallow premise involving an evil corporation abducting individuals for ""death games."" The game's world-building is limited, and players must scavenge for tidbits of lore scattered throughout the levels, making it challenging to become emotionally invested in the game's world. The lack of a captivating narrative robs players of the opportunity to feel connected to the characters or immersed in the story, a critical aspect in the horror genre.

Another significant issue with ""The Outlast Trials"" is its underwhelming artificial intelligence (AI). The enemies, who should be the primary source of fear in a horror game, often come across as bumbling and unintelligent. They frequently get stuck or lose sight of the player when they should not, diminishing the sense of peril. This lack of intelligent AI results in an annoying rather than a genuinely terrifying gameplay experience. In a horror game, the enemies should be relentless, unpredictable, and smart, keeping players on edge throughout. Unfortunately, the AI's shortcomings rob players of the suspense and tension that is crucial to a horror game's success.

Moreover, the game's overall lack of content is a major drawback. With only three levels and a few variations, players can exhaust the available content in just a few hours. The limited variety of environments and scenarios contributes to a repetitive gameplay experience, making it challenging to maintain player interest over time. Additionally, two of the levels share a significant amount of content, making them feel less distinct and reducing the sense of novelty that each level should bring.

In conclusion, ""The Outlast Trials"" is a game that falls short of its potential as a horror gaming experience. Its excessive focus on shock value, lack of a compelling narrative, subpar AI, and limited content all contribute to an overall disappointing and underwhelming gaming experience. While the game's future updates may address some of these issues, it currently fails to deliver the gripping and immersive horror experience that gamers deserve.",1697506981,1697506981,False,12,7,0.483343243598937988,0,True,False,True

In fact the firs one if my favorite game of all time. So with that being said, I was VERY excited for this game. And then the game play teaser came out. I saw how you were able to 'defend' yourself against enemy's. I thought it wouldn't effect anything until i played the actual game. Playing both outlast 1 and 2 for years on the various difficulties, knowing where each jump scare is, knowing every shortcut, cut-seen, all words of dialogue, and just knowing every things there is to know about these games. I always thought these games were above all other horror/survivor games for many reasons. To list a few, the environments of the first two games were incredible, the soundtrack, the characters, the documents, the level design, and many many more. But what I thought to be the most pivotal part of the outlast games, was that you couldn't fight back. 

A major part of why this game was so terrifying to people is if you encountered a threat, you had no other option but to run away and hope you can hide to escape. This game basically takes that and throws it out of the window. You don't have to be scared if you have a stun because you can run straight to the killer knowing you can delay a chase. You can't do that in the previous installments which is why i love it. You have to be smart around the AI because they can kill you very quickly if you don't know the layout, where you're supposed to go, or where to even hide. In this game it can feel like you can have no idea where to go but you can have a 2 stuns that can help you search the map without a threat. Having to run away and not be able to fight back against something that is doing everything it can to kill you and all you have is you're ability to think on your feet. I love red barrels and I appreciate all the time it took to make this game. And I can appreciate them trying to take a step in a new direction, but I just feel like they fell a little flat. Don't get me wrong it's still a good horror game, but not as much as it could've been if they just followed their own formula. This feels like the assassins creed odyssey of the outlast franchise. Its a good horror game, it just doesn't feel like an outlast game.

P.S. I hope they add a single player campaign that follows a story like the previous installments. They do an amazing job at world building and making a interesting story that keeps you engaged start to finish. I know this is still early access, and i'm not trying to trash the developers, nor tarnish the game itself. And yes, I still recommend that you play this. It's still a game that does what it intends to do, which is to scare you.

For whatever reason the devs decided now to ""rework"" the matchmaker like this:
Youre still joining into random lobbies but the only difference is that the group leader cant decide which trial you all will play. Instead the philosoph devs adding a vote mechanic so you can vote for the trial you wanna play. Really fun actually right?
If you solo que then youre jsut a little biatch that is forced to play the trial that other people voted for - sounds fun. So you still need luck to run into a lobby that is picking your trial? ? ?

For now the 30 bucks felt like a waste, but we will see. Its still scam access right? I wish the devs actually would listen to the community and not just say so to bait people into early access.

Also in the current state of the game its completly for dogs exclusive. The trials might be fun on your first run but when you realize that you have to run each trial 3 times on different difficulties to unlock the other programs, then the reality will hit you hard and the new matchmaker will change nothing about it.
Idk why every dev group tries to build their online games around WoW mechanics and make it grindy af, but I hope they will change this ASAP

About this game
-Gameplay : 8,5/10
-Arm Wrestling : 20/10
Played half the time on this game arm wrestling with my friends. One time it was all about winning and I won like 80 matches or something and my friend won only like 20 and now it was all about how many final white hits can we get. We played one last match and he got 9 whites and I got 11.

It is so much fun and terrifying running from the demented bad guys. I try to be super sneaky and stealthy not to trigger any  traps but as soon as one of those guys is chasing me I am running blind into the broken glass, the strings of cans, and triggering traps. 

 I only play solo when I want to win arm wrestling matches (I am becoming a CHAMPION) Such a fun thing in the game!

Some not so favorite things: when you are crouching hiding and the giant man comes around and his wee wee is eye level with you, absolutely frightening.

Looking forward to future updates, my friends and I got this game for one of our spooky games of the month. It definitely covers the spooky category, there is a lot of gore and just some messed up scenes, overall super fun and challenging. Think ultimate hide and seek because you will be hiding anywhere and whenever you can. When you get your first A+ you will feel so proud of yourself!

the good:
-pretty scary
-challenging but not impossible
-fun environment
-cool lore
-AMAZING audio
-banger music
-good gameplay on first playthrough
-great with friends or randoms
-has some great characters
-great themes
-cool powerups

the bad:
-my god this game can get repetitive, once you have beaten some programs and unlock ""Program X"" or ""Program (Special Character) it is the SAME things you have done in past programs (with higher difficulties and modifiers) and it's really frustrating. 

-not much content left after beating the game.

-needs more content

-needs more main characters and more unique enemies

overall, the game is really well made and it deserves the ""Very Positive"" steam reviews and i had a blast playing it. but in its current state, it is lacking in content and really drags on with its gameplay and repetitive content.

I now DO recommend this game. The only thing I'm not so happy about is the lack of any updates (last update was a month ago and this is before a fourth trial was added) and small cosmetic updates would have been appreciated!

Note:
The Outlast Trials does require you to have quick decision making skills so please buy it with that in mind
Also you can read my original review if you want, it is below :)

----------------------------
[strike]
I'm going to be 100% honest. I love this game, but it has serious flaws that just makes the experience so mute compared to Outlast 1 & 2.
First, the singleplayer. I've played this game exclusively solo and I can without a doubt say that the AI has regressed since Outlast 1 and even Outlast 2. Either half the time you're waiting for an enemy to leave or they just camp the objective and you have to play cat and mouse with them so they move away for long enough you can get something done.

The first exam is hard, and a good challenge for singleplayer, but the second main exams are bullsh*t beyond comprehension. I really gave the final exams a try but they are next to impossible to complete solo. All main enemies in the area will camp the objective and if you're going for a higher than D rank (which is most likely what you're getting) you're f*cked because you can't distract them because if you do it goes on your testing report and you get penalized. 

Now, I've TRIED to hide, even in the best circumstances it's about a 50/50 if I get found or not. Even if I haven't made any noise, and the noise stinger hasn't played, I will get found.

Now the things that really bug me. The dudes that hide in the closets and barrels. Most of the time you can't even see the visual cue they're there because either you're passing by or just looking for something else. They make no noise if you're running by and it because super tedious and annoying to deal with them where I just leave the trial and quit the game.

I understand Red Barrels went for something different with how the FPS camera is set up but it doesn't feel good at all. It feels like you're loosely in the shoes of whoever you're playing as and sometimes it's hard to read where you REALLY are (ex: sliding over a box to get away from someone) I could not tell you how many countless times I've thought I was completely out of the way of something and really wasn't so I either got hit, or died.

Too long kinda read;
AI camps objectives, aimlessly wanders. Bullsh*t hidden enemies that jump out at you. Singleplayer is terrible.

I honestly WOULD like this game if these issues weren't so apparent. The regular trials are fine but the average andy isn't going to be able to complete an exam on their own even though the game is ADVERTISED as singleplayer or multiplayer. It needs a heavy singleplayer rework for the exams.

EDIT 10/5/2023: after 30-40 hours you will run out of stuff to do, I haven't played this game in a while because I simply ran out of new things to do, you can only run the same missions over and over before it gets boring. The MK challenges in general aren't fun, because they usually involve ""one shot main enemies"" and they are almost always gonna hit you with bugged hits, through walls or they'll miss and hit you anyways, and you instantly fall on the ground. Being one shot is terrible, all it does is make you run a mission like it was a speedrun and try to just get it over with. Also updates take forever, the last dev announcement was 2 months ago, and nothing has been added or said since. I fear red barrel will abandon this game because there's not enough incentive to add stuff to it, they got their money and have no will to add maps and features.",1691056947,1696532319,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've got a tale of terror, in a coop game you must see.
It's called the Outlast Trials, a frightful multiplayer delight,
With four brave souls together, we'll be scared all through the night!

Now, don't you worry, it's all in good fun, but grab your pals so tight,
For in this spine-chilling thriller, you'll need all the help in sight.
Four players in cahoots, exploring horrors in the dark,
But trust me when I say, it's a rollercoaster, not a walk in the park!

The graphics are so eerie, with shadows in every nook,
And the jump scares are aplenty; you won't know where to look.
You'll scream, you'll shout, you'll laugh until you cry,
As you and your brave comrades attempt not to die!

With flashlights flickering, and monsters on the prowl,
You'll race against the terror, with a nervous, sweaty scowl.
But the best part of this game, and let me make it clear,
Is watching your buddies jump, and squeal in mortal fear!

So, if you're seeking thrills and chills, with friends who won't bail,
The Outlast Trials is your ticket to a multiplayer horror tale.
Gather 'round, my gaming crew, and prepare for spooky spills,
In this coop horror adventure, that'll give you Outlast thrills!",1696366815,1696366815,True,144,24,0.797359704971313477,2,True,False,True

My problem is probably just not being good enough at the game, but I find myself becoming frustrated very frequently while playing. I've only played co-op, but with any more than 2 players, the game became significantly less enjoyable. 

Difficulty scales with number of players. 2 players was great. Any more and it seemed like there was no escape from enemies, and on the chance I did get away, another would spawn soon after through the sliding doors placed throughout the level. If I had to guess, the intention is to use Rigs while playing with that many people to offset the increased difficulty.

Skill issues aside, my only real gripe with the game's design is the fact that after completing a trial, players need to go back to the beginning of said trial to leave. While I understand it makes sense in the game world (being sent on a test and needing to come back to be graded), it is extremely annoying.

This game is the biggest disappointment I have played in a long time. I did not watch gameplay for this, only watched some of the trailer and having recognized the enjoyment I got out of the other game I bought it. The game has no real enjoyment. Laziness is the only thing I can say. There is only like 6 chapters in total. Each chapter has roughly 6 missions to it. The 6 missions are literally the identical mission as to the first, with modifiers making it harder each time. I cannot recommend you to stay away from this game more. Nothing but rewashed repetition. On top of it, nothing about this game is horror in any way compared to the singleplayer games. It is in no way scary, it only feels like you are playing a regular old game, exploiting weird AI interactions to try to achieve your goal.

the game is lore heavy, a bunch of documents you can collect and dialogue you can pick up on. it's probably the most interesting part of the game and it's amazing how historically accurate it is. the designs for characters and locations are stunning, esp the prime assets. the graphics are also pretty kick ass.

the actual gameplay is fun! it's kinda stealthy and running from enemies when you get caught is absolutely terrifying. you can do upgrades on things, make a silly decorated room (the bloody chest on my table is pretty fire), and the arm wrestling mini game in the lobby is fun. the grading system and levels system for the main game is great, and it feels immersive with the world!

Only a couple of things I hope will be added by full release or sooner. As someone who enjoys achievements because it gives me another reason to keep playing the game, I hope they will add achievements. One complaint I do have, I feel like the sneaking around could be fixed a bit more. A few times I would get spotted through walls or I'd get spotted when I'm not even exposed. I play a lot of stealth games and I love them, but it can get frustrating when you get punished over nothing because sneaking around is a lil buggy. One last thing, it would be super cool if there was a mechanic in the game where you can kill the smaller/basic enemies by sneaking up on them with a brick or bottle, also if you were to hit them enough times with throwables. Because a lot of times the basic enemies can just feel like a chore and less fun when there's so many and it would feel satisfying to fight back in some way. I think a way to balance that kind of killing mechanic though so is not to break the scary aspect and the pacing, maybe every time you kill a smaller enemy your sanity will start to decay with each kill and other enemies would get more aggressive. Especially the big bad of every map. I just think it would add more to the dynamic of the game if there was a way you can eliminate the small guys but at a risk. Other than that though.

The Outlast Trials is a unique cooperative horror game set in the Cold War era. Players take on the role of test subjects in a mysterious government facility, where they are forced to participate in sadistic experiments. The game is currently in early access, but it already offers a compelling and terrifying experience.

One of the things that makes Outlast Trials so unique is its focus on cooperative gameplay. Players can work together to solve puzzles, complete objectives, and escape from danger. However, the game also introduces some interesting mechanics that can sow discord among teammates, such as doppelgangers that can attack players if they're not careful.

The Outlast Trials is also incredibly atmospheric. The game's environments are dark, claustrophobic, and filled with disturbing imagery. The sound design is also excellent, creating a truly tense and immersive experience.

Of course, no horror game would be complete without its fair share of scares. Outlast Trials delivers on this front, with a variety of jump scares and disturbing sequences that will keep players on the edge of their seats.

Overall, The Outlast Trials is a promising early access game that offers a unique and terrifying cooperative horror experience. Fans of the Outlast series will definitely want to check it out.

Here are some of the things I liked most about the game:

Unique cooperative gameplay: Working together with teammates to survive the horrors of the game is a lot of fun, but the doppelganger mechanic adds a nice layer of tension and distrust.
Atmospheric environments: The game's environments are dark, claustrophobic, and filled with disturbing imagery, creating a truly immersive experience.
Effective scares: Outlast Trials delivers a variety of jump scares and disturbing sequences that will keep players on the edge of their seats.

Though the game would have done better if it released finished with more content, it still delivers with its chilling scares, interesting maps, and its anxiously tense gameplay. If you're a fan of cooperative horror games, then I highly recommend checking out The Outlast Trials

For me atlest i didn't feel like the game is rewarding me for grinding further on these 4 missions. 

Each of these missions (at the time) had difficulties.

Some harder than other. 

And to continue to the next one you have to do the other one in a way that the score is above what they want. Not if you complete the level. 

I havn't got to play Program X due to that,


But otherwise i don't think it should cost as it dose now. Since you play 3-4 diffrent levels and that's it.

Compared to other AAA games, outlast has little to no bugs, a solid gameplay loop, fits to its themes, has perfect/fitting voice acting, and delivers on a solid horror and co-op experience. It's even got lovely little details in the lobby, the minigames, the upgrades are built into the facility instead of just being a menu, and the story is fitting.

It's about time the co-op horror genre had a good entry.

All the elements and details play together well, the mechanics work to provide a solid experience, and the fact that foes can take you down in more ways than just one is a plus.

The only flaw is that it doesn't have enough trials, and that's a good flaw in this regards. It means that the trials/content/missions that are available are good, and have me thirsting for more.",1694739800,1694739800,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The Outlast Trials did not get old for me quickly.
It took about 60 hours of playitme before I had to even take a break from the game. Once you max out a skill, the scares & excitement start to wear off a bit. 
Never really got tired of the trials themselves, the circus one is easily the worst (Especially the mannuequin children one where you have to backtrack from end to beginning) as sometimes games can just go on & on & on. 
Other than that, their variables + random generation are plentiful & you'll rarely ever notice a pattern repeat. Definitely the most impressive random generation I've seen in a game like this.
Something that would extend this games life cycle greatly would be an Asymmetrical game mode, except focus less on it being a sweat fest like DBD & more of just a new avenue to scare & excite players.
Customisation is brilliant & the biggest most common prize you receive for completing trials, its in abundance here. 
What kept me playing Outlast Trials is it's not very sweaty player base, 98% of players treat it as a horror game, which is what separates it from other games in it's genre.
Players have a pretty perfect level of fight back, I wish there would be an option to completely reset knowledge on your weapons with an encouraging cosmetic. 
The aesthetic of the game is one of the most impressive, immersive environments I've seen in recent gaming, the level of detail is staggering & everything works towards making the world scarier. You won't find a cosmetic with a monkey costume here. Everything fits the universe Red Barrels have built.
Again, the scares stopped in or around releasing my second agent (see it as a sort of prestige, kinda, not really) but yeah, if they find a way to keep this game and it's scares going for players that have been here since the beginning, I'll have a new favourite multiplayer game.

The maps are so detailed and brimming with personality, as are the enemy characters and tone the game gives out. This is also the most diverse set of items/mechanics we've seen from the Outlast series yet. The addition of AMPS, modifiers, throwables, and a sanity system all make the game much more complex compared to the first two games.

This game is a rollercoaster of fear, survival, and psychological torment, and I must say, it's one of the most engaging horror games I've ever played.

From the moment I stepped into the dark and foreboding world of The Outlast Trials, I knew I was in for something special. The game plunges you into the midst of the Cold War era, where you're trapped in a disturbing experiment orchestrated by a malevolent organization. The atmosphere is thick with tension, and every corner of the eerie facility feels like it's hiding secrets and horrors just waiting to be uncovered.

The Outlast Trials is a masterpiece of horror gaming. It's a game that gets under your skin and refuses to let go, thanks to its engaging gameplay, well-balanced difficulty, and expertly crafted atmosphere. My heart raced, my palms sweated, and my mind was thoroughly twisted by this psychological nightmare, and I loved every minute of it. Thank you, Red Barrel, for once again proving why you are the masters of horror.

The sound design and visuals are nothing short of exceptional. The hauntingly realistic audio cues had me jumping at every distant creak and whisper. The visuals are nightmarishly beautiful, with grimy, and especially dimly lit environments that draw you deeper into the madness. The character designs are grotesque and unforgettable, and they will haunt my nightmares for weeks to come.

What truly sets this game apart is its accessibility. The Outlast Trials manages to strike a balance that caters to all ranges of players. The difficulty settings are thoughtfully designed, allowing newcomers to the horror genre to enjoy the story without feeling overwhelmed, while veteran horror enthusiasts can crank up the challenge for a truly heart-pounding experience. It's a rare feat in the world of horror games, and Red Barrel deserves praise for it.

If you're a fan of horror games, ""The Outlast Trials"" is a must-play. Just be prepared to lose sleep and question your sanity in the process.

Thank you again Red Barrels for giving this gift to us to enjoy, and I hope to see more outstanding development from this wonderful team.

My only gripe would be lack of content. It's fun to replay levels to try beating your score, but eventually those get played out. Especially once you master a certain level. There are 9 levels in total in the base game across three locations. And there are additional ""levels"" that act as more difficult versions of previous levels. But the difficulty spikes also cause you to try different strategies, so it does feel like a new experience on higher difficulties. But again, the low amount of content can indeed be a bummer because the game is so fun.

But everything else about the game is fantastic. Highly recommended if you have friends to play with.",1694145341,1694145341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Can probably count them with one hand. Some have gone too far from horror, so maybe even less. As it stands, this is an absolute banger of a game.

That being said, my only concern for the future of Outlast Trials is it being always online. Its an Early Access, but its such a solid experience, both solo and coop. It may seem like such a small thing to worry about now, but as much as I hope for a bright future ahead of it, there's a chance something might go wrong, and this gem goes offline forever.

Just to end it as a little letter to any dev that might stumble upon this review, thank you. There's so much love and effort put into this game, and it shows. I could nerd out on everything I love about it, but it all sums up to this, the care a small dedicated team, willing to go through their own trials to bring out such a solid game. No editions, no microtransactions, no passes, an actual game.

But for those looking for a thrilling horror game to play with friends, this is that game. I'm not even joking. I always wanted a co-op horror game that didn't feel so gimmicky/competitive since every multiplayer game is competitive nowadays. I understand that this game is early access, but for what it has for now, it's wonderfully rewarding. I feel incentivised to run through each trial and aim for a higher score, meeting people who have a similar mindset, and reading over the hidden files that game has scattered across the maps. It's even crazier that this game's co-op experiences is treated as such. You can't do everything alone without going through great difficulty. You also have different roles that people can play to make running through trials a lot easier. Strategy, of running through, horrors of the location and the killers' themes. The puzzles that are fair but very slow burning(for the first time around).  And as a bonus, this game is coming to console!
One thing I worry about is the microtransations and the longevity of the games life. It's a great game that I can play for hours on end, but this game is simply not for everyone. So I pitched(as well as many others) that their should be a way to create your own trails/ experiences since I can see how big this game can get.

[i]There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.

And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of.  Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;
thinking.

But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing.[/i]

- Look for rectangular blue buttons stamped with the Murkoff logo, then use your middle mouse key or voice chat to call a friend over to press the second one simultaneously. You'll unlock a room filled with goodies. The buttons and the room are always very close to each other.

- Blue document folders are like crack for you. Grab them, always.

- Never play solo. You can adjust your matchmaking settings to only join groups of 4, which is ideal.

- On harder Trial difficulties bottles and bricks to the head don't seem to do much to enemies. You need to use the explosive Rig or avoid them completely. Enemies will also be more likely to check hiding spots and pull you out.

- A special sound effect will always play when an enemy spots or hears you. You have a few seconds to leave or hide when this happens. Being detected by enemies never reduces your score, but being hit and stepping on noisemakers does even if you have the Slippers equipped.

- Your middle mouse button can't mark the Pouncers in hiding spots even if you're pointing right at them. You'll have to use voice chat to warn people.

- The Giant's axe is a one-hit KO and his reach is always longer than you think.

- In Trials, the people standing or sitting alone will hit you if you go near them.

- In the carnival you're meant to grab hearts from the steel bin in the diner to get tickets. I mention this because me and everyone I played with had no idea you could interact with what we thought was just a gory detail - we spent like 20 minutes hunting for bricks and bottles to hit the targets.

- You can't time the flame jets in the river of blood to get past them. Don't even try.

- When a Prime Asset is holding someone else you have a few seconds to run over and boot them loose. The same goes for downed players being executed, but you'll have to run in a circle so you can lose the enemy, then double back and revive him.

- You're going to lose a few Trials because you got stuck with a stupid team that doesn't cooperate.

The best part is that they did change the gameplay but they kept the core gameplay the same for an example you can now explore the map rather than running around and have no clue what to do next or where to go next. You can actually fight back a little (you can throw bottles at enemies lol). Soundtrack could be a little bit scarier or like outlast themed but it is still a little scary. I haven't played it with friends but I bet it is very fun but I'm going to guess that more than 2-3 friends it's not that scary anymore but still very fun.

Imagine this, the traditional outlast formula, with all the hiding, running and pissing yourself, but you can now slightly slow down the enemy. Gamechanging.
I will say this, if you don't have friends, get some and buy this game. It's worth it. But really, from my experience, it's really damn difficult if on the highest level. Shit, it's difficult on almost all levels, especially alone. In my quest to get every level to an A+, I had to turn everything to a science, memorize how the lunatics move, what they do, how close I can get without getting my ass beat. Really damn difficult, but a great time. Sometimes if you get caught by what my friends and I call ""tweakers"", that is, the men that stand in place and scream, immobilizing you for an excessive amount of time, which allows the man who is now inside my asshole to royally ruin my entire year, making me have to reset the level. Also, there have been a few times where I have been insta killed, like being immobilized on an electric trap because I was running from a man, but was stunned by a tweaker directly on top of the trap, and it activated, bringing my health low enough to be oneshotted by the man who is now balls deep in my colon.
9/10 Buy this game

Ps. Men chase you with their dicks out all the time, I would 100% recommend this.

- Too many loading screens
- Information only shows up once. Items, Missions etc, Yes u can check ur Current Objective with Tab but it might not go any further into detail other then Find X.
-  Missions or Trails as they call them are pretty simple run from multiple AI hunters well u search for Key/Object etc, This in itself isnt bad but it dos make things fairly simple..
- Attacks from the hunters can be grabs and you honestly cant tell if one is coming.

My daughter got this game last Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and she started playing. By the end of the week she had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my daughter, as she is always out with her friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my daughter for help and she invited me to a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my daughter since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my daughter closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories.
