Graphics are pretty bad for todays standards, but back then it was decent.
The story is pretty interesting, well at least to those of us who have played/watched previous Resident Evil games.

 I mean look don't expect too much the game is pretty old, but for a game that was made in 2009, it looks awesome and back then these controls were probably just fine, unlike now (controls). 

There are some pretty fun puzzles, combat is exciting, game's pretty hard tho or at least it's one of those few games that I've found to be a bit harder to play 'cause enemies are pretty strong and at times a bit unpredictable I love it tho hahahaa.

Look game is pretty cheap and it's often on discounts, so yeah if you've enjoyed the previous Resident Evil games why don't you give it a try aswell? But, but I gotta warn you they're remaking this game, so you might wanna wait for the remake to come out. I mean just look at the RE2, RE3, RE4 remakes, they're beatiful, so yeah if you want a better experience wait for the remake, but if you can't wait that long, then yeah give this one a try. But once the remake comes out, be sure to get it, since it's gonna be a top looking game with a fantastic gameplay.

Most of the gameplay issues I can blame on Sheva's braindead AI rarely follows your commands and ends up in your constant death.

Double dipped on PC sale for nostalgia

Another game that does not age well.

Game is only fun when unlocked infinite ammo weapons.

Quick time event polluted game with garbage controls.

It's what PS3 era gamers have to put up with the crappy game design.

Stupid AI limited by either dumb programmers or crappy console hardware.

Action heavy and move like a soldier on two crutches.

[h3]AI Character[/h3]

Dude the AI character(Sheva) in this game is just [b]mind blowing[/b](imo)!

» If you give Sheva a second better gun besides her pistol like for example a sniper rifle or any other better gun which is better than her pistol, she always first uses her pistol if she has ammo for it and if she runs out of pistol ammo, only then she switches to the better gun - which can save ammo ammo of the better gun for later.
» When fighting against a boss and the boss uncovers it's weak spots, Sheva really shoots on the weak spots instead of keep shooting anywhere at the boss's hitbox - which is freaking impressive!
» In chapter 4-2 there's a situation where you have to hide repeatedly in wall gaps and wait for the light-laser to pass by and then you can keep going and the impressive Part (imo) is when you as Chris are too far away from Sheva [b]but[/b] still in the same area, Sheva will find cover in a separate wall gab and don't just stand there like an absolute idiot and getting killed by the light-laser - I completely freaked out as I have seen that.
» If you have to pull on 2 levers at the same time and you as Chris are already stand at the first lever and pressed ""V""(on keyboard), Sheva gets by herself to the second lever and pull's it wihtout manually positioning the AI character at the second lever like in Resident Evil 4 2005.
» Sheva [b]always[/b] gives you that kind of ammo for which gun you currently have in your inventory.
» If Sheva has a red herb and you have a green herb and you give her your green herb and you or both of you are on low HP, she automatically will mix the red herb with the green herb together and heals you or both of you.
» If you keep standing in a room or area with loot or crates for a few seconds, Sheva will loot the items / destroys the crates independently and then gives you that kind of ammo for which gun you currently have in your inventory [b]or[/b] heals you if you need healing.
» If you have to do something where you have to pull the lever to raise a bridge and the Sheva has to open a locked gate from the other site, Sheva runs all the way to the other site of the gate and unlocks it for you.

I just love that AI in this game!

[h3]Controls[/h3]

The controls in this Resident Evil Part is already better than the controls in Resident Evil 4 2005 especially for keyboard and mouse players.

But there's a small kinda bug(idk if it is a bug) if you move with WASD and look around with your mouse at the same time, the mouse sensitivity reduces to about 50% to 75% of the original sensitivity [b]IF[/b] you stand and look around.

The next down site especially for keyboard and mouse players [b]also[/b] in this Resident Evil Part is, that there are many situations throughout the game where you have to press either ""A"" and ""D"" together(which is easy) OR ""F"" and ""V"" together(which is hard) to dodge certain attacks + you have a extremely short window of time to react like 1 second which is hard frustrating if you don't expect to dodge a attack while you use WASD for running.

You can't turn quickly 180° with ""Q"" in this game like in Resident Evil 4 2005.

[h3]Jill[/h3]

Duuude, Jill in this game looks sooo good and the prehistory from her and Chris is very sad.

Idk in which Resident Evil Part that prehistory is playing but judging from Jill's outfit, i'd say Resident Evil HD Remaster..? (which I have played but don't remember these scenes)

God I love Jill in this Part!

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]

Like in Resident Evil 4 2005 already, the gameplay is veeery stressful on some stages and you quickly become overwhelmed.

For my personal taste, there are way too many enemies at one spot/area especially if they come towards you - i'm not a fan of that big masses of enemies. 

The worst situation (imo) was in chapter 3-1 where you step into a cycle trap and you only get released when you killed a certain amount of enemies(or just the enemies which are trapped with you in the cycle).

Also the documents and notes are for my personal taste way too long, you're reading about 10-15 sites full of super long texts.

[h3]Enemies and Bosses[/h3]

The ""Chainsaw Majini"" is (imo) like the ""Regenerator"" and the ""Iron Maiden"" in Resident Evil 4 2005 the most annoying enemy (also besides the bosses) in the entire game because he tanks sooo much ammo.

The ""Wesker"" boss is btw even much, much worse than the ""Krauser"" boss in Resident Evil 4 2005, just saying..

[h3]Bugs[/h3]

» The ""UROBOROS (5-2)"" is bugged af - little advice; buy an RPG and thank me later!
» If you buy repeatedly the same gun like for example a S&W M29 and sell it again, you'll get the 6 magnum rounds of it - it's a kinda unlimited ammo glitch if you have the money for it and no ammo lol.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]

There's not much to say except that I love games with this type of old graphics.

Your mileage may vary depending on your partner. Solo play would be an entirely different experience, and I have heard that partner AI is frustrating.  

I personally enjoyed the emphasis on action over horror in RE 5's gameplay, puzzles, and storyline. Playing in co-op gave more meaning to each aspect of the game, from weapon choice to inventory management to executing Quick Time Events (QTE). Failing partner-dependent QTEs was actually hilarious in this context. I definitely did not let my friend die as revenge for killing me in the previous chapter. (:

Item scarcity preserved some of the survival horror feel of RE. Starting out with no guns and no bullets kept us under pressure. There was even an entire subchapter in which I could not use my handgun at all, because my friend had none. I gave him all of my handgun ammo to replenish while he passed me ammo for my other weapons. Even though some boss fights that left us with a surplus of ammo and heals, they were quickly depleted, sometimes right at the start of a chapter. Inventory space was also limited, so we had to be selective about what to bring from our stash of goods. 

Game session connectivity was relatively stable; I only disconnected two or three times over the 10-11 hours it took us to complete the game. Puzzle mechanics were responsive, as were other actions that only your partner can do. My friend and I put our heads together and strategized as a team. We coordinated roles for our exploration, looting, resource management, combat roles, and combat positioning. The camera was a bit clunky, but not unplayable for me as it was with RE 4.

The only true BS we encountered was the Chapter 5-2 Boss, which we had to look up after 30 minutes of fighting it the “right way” and using up ALL of our ammo. It was apparently bugged on PC port, but it could be defeated in a very specific manner which made the fight only 1 minute long. We also struggled with Chapter 5-3, but I don’t blame the game because we had failed to try one possibility that we had discussed.

As with most games, replayability comes from New Game+, unlocking new weapons, achievement hunting, and beating chapters on higher difficulty settings. RE 5 has a Survivor mode, which I personally have not tried but appears similar to Left 4 Dead Versus mode (multiplayer team death match of infected VS. human players).",1587009626,1706952209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, we have come a long way in terms of control; were the games back then really this stiff? I mean, it's playable but there are certain aspects (and I'm not comparing it to newer RE releases) that could have been definitvely better. I dunno if its because I've been playing with key & mouse but you can't strafe diagonally or change the camera direction, which can be a bit annoying.

Second, it's the AI of your partner. This is definitvely a co-op experience, and while the AI is decent, specially after the absolute f-up Dead Rising's was, it may not be the best way to play the game.

Third and final, because I'm trying to keep it short and believe me I have lots of things to say about it, its the story and gameplay. Gameplay wise its pretty good, it's obviously a departure from previous RE titles just as 4 was, but I think that was OK, it's a different game, it's an evolution if you will, but I can totally understand naysayers given that it almost takes the whole horror element away in favour of that cliched overstuffed action tropes that plagued this particular generation in gaming. Then there's the story. Well what's to say about it? This is clearly the point were the franchise started to go south if you will, not just for all the previous things I mentioned but specifically for how it has evolved. The more I've gotten to know about RE 5 in the passing years, the more ridiculous it became, and believe me it just goes beyond the boulder punching. How did they go from the terrifying ""trapped in a mansion full of zombies!"" and the pharmaceutical bioterrorist accident to loosing all subtlety (and there was some) for this? Well, it's definitively not just the game's lead character the one on steroids.  I haven't even played this series before RE 2 Remake and I can realise that. From absurd Matrix like cartoony villain Wesker and it's tired world domination plot to lameass twists in the story that will have you going ""uh? that's f****** ridiculous!"".

Anyway, RE 5 is still a good game, a different game for better and/or worse, but a little bit too much on the story side (and what came after for the franchise). Maybe one of the last little goodies before Capcom's fall from glory (and then absolute redemption, I know), worth checkin' out.

PD: there are a couple of idiotic glitches that have never been solved, including a game stopping enemy AI in chapter 5 or 6.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td] The graphics are pretty good for a 2009 game. I’m not a big fan of the green filter though, but you will get use to it after a while. The game looks really sharp with amazing cinematic cutscenes. The level's all look pretty good, but the early stages look best to me. The UI is pretty simple, with a box like shape inventory menu that works pretty well with controllers and even keyboard. Overall the game looks pretty good. Despite the green filter, the game still holds up pretty well![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td] I love the gameplay in this installment of Resident Evil. Playing the game solo is pretty fun, but the main enjoyment is Co-op. Co-op campaign is so incredible and addicting to play with your friends. The movement is pretty good, and it has a Resident Evil 4 feel to it when it comes to movement (some say it's tank controls, but once you get use to it, it's no problem). The enemies are really fun to fight as well, and the bosses are pretty good in terms of gameplay. If you are looking for a Resident Evil 4 like game with Co-op, here you go![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 5 had a pretty fun and engaging story. You play as Chris Redfield, and with a companion named Sheva Alomar. The story had a good consistency, and the pace was really good. The villains were pretty interesting and kept me interested throughout my playthroughs. They did the boss fights really well in my opinion and were really fun to go through. I beat this game so many times on Xbox and had an absolute blast.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]I would honestly just play this game on multiplayer. The co-op mechanics are so well done. You have to stick together and conserve ammo because you have to share (which is so cool). Besides the campaign, you also have versus and a mercenaries and it’s actually a blast to play (well the mercenaries mode is a blast).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With multiple different campaigns and game modes, you will spend a lot of time on this Resident Evil installment. The Mercenaries mode is a great time with a friend and really challenging as well. The unlockables are pretty cool as well which adds replayability. I added 80 hours into this game. It’s just a blast to play with a friend.[/td]

        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The voice acting is pretty good in this game! The voice actors for Chris and Wesker are absolutely incredible. Sheva is also really good. The gun sounds are pretty good in this game, but nothing jaw dropping. I’d say it’s pretty average, but still good. The Music is so good in this game. I mean it’s Resident Evil, they always do an amazing job with the music score.[/td]

        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I had no serious problems with this game. no bugs that caught my eye that I can think of. They recently fixed the windows 10/11 issues with the latest update which was a huge quality of life change.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The game runs pretty well for me. It is an old game so it’s to be expected. If you have an average PC, you should be good here. I was able to max this game out no problem.[/td]

        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]7.5/10
Purchase the Gold Edition for around 25% or more on sale if possible (full price is still worth the money in my opinion). [/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This game is pure joy with a friend. The companion is horrible in my opinion, although it is possible to beat solo. I had so much fun in this game and it’s one of my favorites. The only real issue I have is the filter and the AI companion. Besides those problems, you will have a joy if you are looking for a Resident Evil game that has co-op.[/td]

     It's a lot of fun with a friend, or multiple in the DLC, especially in the Mercenaries mode. The characters in Mercenaries are fairly well balanced -- aside from safari chris lol -- and the maps are very fun aside from the boat stage, it's way too small for having so many chainsaw enemies.

Never mind the fact this game still has that mid 2000s control scheme. At least they tried making the mouse / keyboard experience a liiiittle better. For me, I still enjoy this game and I learned a few things completing it. I'd first say that fully completing this game kinda sucks. There's a few BS achievements I don't really like, for instance upgrading every single weapon. This requires a pretty intense level of grinding chapters or mercenaries to get enough money to pay for all of it. I also don't like multiplayer achievements in general, but this game isn't the worst. I found some people to basically boost them with after playing a few rounds for fun. I think the multiplayer is actually kinda fun, but the achievements turn it into a chore. 

If this game gets remade, it could do with a little re-working on the story but I think with the updated RE engine, this would be a super fun co-op experience. If you don't have the nostalgia for this game, however, I would probably not recommend it.

And thank God that same ""protection"" has been implemented into single player games to prevent players from ""cheating."" Holy shit, just the thought of that makes me sick! It's a good thing Capcom requested the service of only the most reputable and professional DRM company to protect their games from these [i]psychopaths[/i] who dared to buy their game and play it the way they want. I feel like I can sleep much better at night knowing these games are protected from dirty cheaters and pirates. I bet those dumb paying customers are just mad because they can't cheat anymore hahaha XD

Ignore the haters Capcom, you are totally doing the right thing by protecting your ancient games from these total losers. You only stand to gain from this decision, and I'm sure if you just keep doubling down, nobody will dare cheat or pirate ever again, and the world will finally know peace from this menace. Like, for real, who needs ""fan goodwill"" lmao. Come on, there hasn't been a single time when fan outrage alone almost killed one of your IPs for good, right? Nah man, course not!  Just keep doing what you're doing! Trust me bro! 

-This positive review is DRM protected so players won't attempt to add valid, potentially negative feedback to it that might improve it (that would be modifying the review, therefore cheating). If you wish to improve your experience with the review in such ways without cheating, please purchase the upcoming ""I <3 CAPCOM"" DLC that will enable you to do so, which will be released later tonight in your toilet.-",1706211975,1706211975,True,35,17,0.719893693923950195,0,True,False,False

•	Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection
•	Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection
•	Strider
•	Resident Evil 5
•	Resident Evil Revelations (temporarily removed, but Capcom confirmed their intention to reimplement it)

For those wary of clicking the link, the above list pulled from the [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/195n8st/about_enigma_drm_and_whether_or_not_capcom_is/] reddit source[/url], detailing confirmed Capcom games running Enigma DRM. 

Additionally, I came across a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1sKwev21gE&t=615s]YouTube [/url]video that offers a detailed breakdown and guide on identifying if a Capcom game is utilizing the new DRM. The video notes that the RE5.exe file may trigger a (1/68) rating on virustotal, but clarifies that while showing characteristics of malware, it likely represents a false positive.

While I respect Capcom's right as a developer to implement DRM in their old games, I personally disagree with this decision. Consequently, with Capcom’s decision to insert this questionable DRM into their old titles, all that have already been cracked, I will no longer play their games or invest in future IP releases. I believe transparency is crucial, and I advocate for informing buyers about the presence of DRM on the store page. Failing to provide this information conveys a message of secrecy, and I feel it raises concerns about transparency on Capcom’s part.

In general, DRM doesn't prevent piracy as someone who wouldn't buy your game isn't a customer to begin with & often DRM will instead provides a worse experience to actual paying customers. It's case by case but it can often lead to performance issues especially on older systems & make your PC more vulnerable to attacks in future. No developer or publisher should be adding DRM to their products as this overall will hurts consumers as it can prevent them from playing or modifying their games.

In terms of modding, there shouldn't be any issues with it especially in a single player game & should only become an issue when it's negatively affect other players. To clarify the online aspects, a privately hosted sessions or a 3rd party server which states the mods is fine & some games even include this in the official server browser.

In terms of the game itself, it's a fantastic game to play with friends despite some minor issues with net code & inventory management. This is also where Albert Wesker shines the most in terms of his appearance in this franchise. It was one of the best versions to get with the option to play either the Games for Windows LIVE or the Steamworks version until the update in 28th February 2023 which added Enigma Protector DRM to the Steamworks version.

This review is negative because Capcom added DRM to their old games which blocks mods. This game was very broken until last year when they removed GFWL (while also adding the Enigma DRM). This game lived only with the help of the community which fixed the broken enemy AI and allowed you to use features that were not present in this release but were in the 8th gen console ports. Out of those features present in the console ports only the wide FOV feature was implemented in last year's update, shadows, enemy AI and mercenaries united was still unavailable in the PC version. 

Modders have been fixing this game to prevent the enemy getting stuck and not being able to progress but now Capcom has gone against the PC community by adding anti-mod DRM to their games. If Capcom successfully added this DRM to all their games then I am afraid that the games that have been broken for years will stay broken because Capcom doesn't fix their games, they make them worse. For example, they have added a patch to RE Remake which removed a file used to connect to RE.net with an empty folder which will crash the game if trying to connect to RE.net.

Please stop what you're doing and remove all this DRM, Capcom. If PC is going to be your main platform for games in the future then this is not how you treat your customers.",1705367048,1705367048,False,10,1,0.54611515998840332,0,True,False,False

Due to Capcom's recent actions adding Enigma Protector, this has nearly screwed up my PC, and has even bricked an IRL friend's Steam Deck due to the DRM. Instead, I am writing this to detail the following.

Resident Evil 5 IS a good game. However, due to the addition of a DRM that contains rather malicious code, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this at all.

The game's mechanics are rather fluid for its time, however, until Enigma Protector is removed, my review will remain as such. I've played all the way from the original Resident Evil, even to Village on console. However, if this is Capcom's business direction, I cannot support this. And yes, if I were to leave the game installed, it would count as supporting the actions of this company.

At this point, it seems Capcom is currently crumbling, given their recent decisions. The fact that Enigma is in the game's executable, (Which I found via VirusTotal), sickens me. The fact that I had to uninstall RE5 was a really hard decision, and it's a decision that deeply saddens me. However, I value being able to use my PC, over playing a game with possible malware in it.

O DRM é uma prática de instalação que não tem nenhum sentido e nenhuma razão, além de ser perigoso para os PC's e deveria ser considerado uma prática criminosa.
Mods nunca atrapalharam em nada (nenhum jogo), pelo contrario, eles sempre ajudaram os jogos a nunca serem esquecidos, por exemplo, Skyrim ta ai para mostrar; outro bom exemplo, olha o que CD Projekt RED faz com seus jogos (a comunidade de Moders de Cyberpunk 2077 e The Witcher 3 é incrivel).

Capcom has been sneaking in Enigma DRM on their older games with an update purely to block modding.  This DRM causes performance issues, crashes and has broken Steam Deck support on some games.

The horror is completely gone from this one. I'll admit that RE4 wasn't very horror, but it still managed to keep some amount of creepiness. This game has none of it. It's a full on third person shooter. By chapter 5 it's pretty much just a Call of Duty game with tank controls (because they legitimately give the infected enemies guns). Speaking of the tank controls, they completely fucked them up. Instead of turning left and right when pressing A and D, you get this weird strafe that isn't very useful, and, unless you're playing on controller, they don't give you any options to turn it off. To me, full tank controls allow for much more precision when compared to the strafe. You have to deal with the strafe for the rest of the game instead of having access to full tank controls. And exclusive to the PC release, they replaced the laser sight with a really disgusting looking cross hair, and, again, you don't have any options to switch it out with the laser sights. You have to deal with the new cross hair for the rest of the game (unless you install a mod). Throughout the whole game they also give it this gross filter that makes the whole game look like shit. It makes the game not very fun to look at.

Gameplay is just okay. A lot of the guns don't feel very good to use because their sound effects are too wimpy and the enemies are bullet sponge to make up for coop tag teaming so you never feel like you're doing any amount of damage. Firing a magnum in RE4 and firing a magnum in RE5 are two, VERY different experiences. One makes you feel like you just unleashed one of the most powerful attacks in the game on an enemy once you hear it's loud blast and the sound of it connecting to an enemy, and the other one just feels like a slightly more powerful pistol that did slightly more damage. On top of that all the guns feel the same in their respective categories. If you made me use each handgun in RE5 and told me to tell you the difference between each of them, I'd fail to do so, but with RE4 I could easily tell you all the difference between the handguns, all the way down to their sound effects. 

The melee attacks from RE4 have been changed so that, depending on what part you shoot on an enemy to stun them, you get a different melee attack, but 25% of the time the melee attack will mess you up or disorientate you. For some reason they decided to give the melee attack a much smaller AOE, so the risk reward factor from RE4 is completely gone. Instead of risking running into a group full of enemies in order to make them all fly back with a kick, you risk running into a group of enemies in order to make one of them go flying and maybe make one of them do a stun animation while the rest of the enemies that are surrounding you get ready to attack. 

They also got rid of the brilliant attache case item management from RE4, replacing it with 9 measly slots for items between each character, which can't be upgraded, and is way too small, especially later on when the game shoves as much ammo as it can up your ass. The layouts of the levels in this game are also very boring to traverse, which makes it worse when everything is already very boring to look at. Most bosses are annoying as well. Most of them have gimmicks that aren't very fun, and some of them (especially the final boss) requires a lot of guessing work.

I think the idea of giving the player a partner throughout the entirety of an RE game is a horrible idea, and I think allowing a real person to take control of the partner and play alongside you is even worse, because it makes the game less horror than it already is. I think removing the partner gameplay and coop entirely could've improved the atmosphere of this game by a large margin.

BUT, I know a lot of people hate the Sheva AI, and looking purely at how her AI functions, I actually didn't find her to be that bad. As long as you make her piss off with weapons that are different from yours, for the most part she won't be that much of a problem. If you have a handgun and shotgun in your inventory, give Sheva a SMG and Rifle to mess around with so that you don't have to really worry about both your and the AI's ammo. There are parts where she's just completely useless, but those parts are few and far between. I will say that I played through the game on normal, so I have no clue how she acts or how useful she is on higher difficulties.

I don't want to say the characters are bad, because they're not, in fact, I think when it comes to depth, the characters in this one are better than the characters in RE4. But even with the added depth, they just aren't very entertaining and end up being very boring. They certainly have depth, just not enough depth, and I rather take a character without depth that's entertaining (like Leon and his really stupid one liners), than a character with a small amount of depth that isn't very entertaining. I think if Chris and Jill were both given depth before hand in the previous games, we could've bonded much more with these characters in the first place and the story in this game would've hit much harder. Also wanted to say that the reveal of the plague mask woman is one of the easiest things to guess in a video game. As soon as they said that a certain character from previous games died off screen, it immediately clicked.

A lot of people love Wesker in this one but I think they completely fucked him up. In RE1, Wesker felt like someone who has a plan for literally everything and doesn't like to get his hands dirty, so he uses others to get the job done. In RE1, he fakes his own death and everyone believes it. In this game, they give him access to the fucking matrix and he acts like a cartoon villain the entire time instead of that smart, calculating villain from RE1. The real Wesker would've hopped on his ship and released Uroboros without fighting Chris and Sheva and giving them the chance to weaken him. They even turn him into another BOW at the end. Wesker shouldn't go out as a BOW, he's smarter than that. Wesker should go out as Wesker.

Overall, it's very disappointing considering that it came out after RE4. It's got it's flaws, but I wouldn't call it bad by any means, but it's not very good either. It's mediocre.

so fun with a friend! not sure when this change was added, but QTEs are optional now, so if that was something that annoyed you before due to input delay or the weird button choice for MNK (F + V??), then you can rest easy. i find that the QTEs make the gameplay funnier though to be honest, but it's much nicer to have it off if you're trying to get S ranks as you won't get a death from falling down a hole or something.

when it comes to playing on MNK, as mentioned, the QTE buttons feel a little awkward, but it's not the end of the world; as said, you can disable (most of) them. the movement is a little wonky, but personally i found it wasn't that difficult to get used to. alternatively, just plug in a controller.

if playing online, make sure you both have good connection because getting kicked out midchapter really sucks - especially for whoever isn't host because they won't get achievements for chapter completion.

it seems most issues with the game have been patched as of this date; if you're having black screen start up issues, try verifying your game files - worked for me! if that doesn't work for you, there are several guides and yt videos that can help you.

This version has bugs not present in the originals and every major update manages to maybe fix a handful (some are not even fixed properly, meaning side effects), while introducing brand new ones.

Capcom now considers updating old games to add anti-tamper protection is better than updating said games to fix them or add missing content, so I'm done being hopeful and lenient, giving the game a positive review just because it can be made less bad with third party fixes (which they apparently dislike).

RE1 now crashes if you try using their RE.net service because a somewhat recent update somehow replaced an important file with an empty folder of the same name.

As many are pointing out, Revelations 1 got an update that added nothing useful to the game other than DRM, pirates can enjoy their old complete cracked versions.

I'm so tired of these things, it's so discouraging as an RE fan wanting to see each game shine in its definitive form and all you get is incompetence and negligence with silly bugs and issues that can be fixed in minutes. How do you even break some of this stuff in the first place? And not only do you not fix them, you bother adding obstacles to people who care.
And if the concern is cheating, these games have been pirated and hacked in almost every conceivable way, many years ago.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

""Well, I don't mod so that's fine with me""

It also makes the game perform worse, has kernel level access and some software is flagging as malware. Some are reporting making the game unplayable on steam deck too.

Capcom has screwed up and I encourage others to review this game negatively till they reverse this. 

I erased my old review because Capcom has updated this game RECENTLY which blew my mind.

So, disregard reviews saying you need to patch out the old Games for Windows Live DRM, it's been completely removed and any problems launching are fixed.
Capcom also added in split screen! This was a pleasant surprise since it was missing from the original PC release. They also expanded the FoV to match the PS4/XB ports so now you don't even need to mod the game.

The game runs great, if your machine is even remotely recent you should be able to run this at high framerates- which this does support over 120fps. 

And they seemingly removed 99% of the quicktime events, only leaving where you press a button to duck from an attacking huge enemy. All of the cutscenes can just be, watched now with no insta-death. Thank, goodness.

As for the game- I've never, played this game single player so if that's how you plan to play this, keep scrolling. For the rest of you, this is one of the most fun co-op games there is. You and a buddy have to watch eachother's backs while fighting and help solve fairly basic puzzles that do change the gameplay up. They will even have you separate to get secrets or in the story - meaning your friend has to help keep an eye on you to help. 
What makes this game unique is you and your partner have 9 inventory slots each and you two need to manage your weapons, items and ammo together. You can do this in gameplay where it can be heated if combat is going on- but that's what makes it fun, or you do it between missions where you have access to an item box where you can store any items and gear you have gathered. 

There is a ton of weapon variety and a good amount of enemy variety forcing you and your partner to pick who takes what weapon and how to deal with threats. There's a ton of weapons to unlock through the game and through upgrades (certain guns if upgraded will unlock special guns). This makes the game super replayable and fun. 
Combat is fun where you'll stun an enemy, then kick them which leaves them open for your partner to kick them back or shoot them again. 

The game is a LOT of fun co-op, one of the best co-op games I know & loved playing it since the ol' 360 days. Now it's vastly better with the wider FoV, split screen and such.

Oh- and the game has mercenaries mode which can be played co-op and has a ton of characters you can use with totally different load outs. 

The only downside is, as far as I know no-mercy mercs mode is not co-op for some reason. 

I know people don't dig this game because the partner is apparently an issue in single player but, if you got a friend online or on your couch this game is FUN.",1483133853,1705067895,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd say it's worth the price you pay for it, but only the base game, the gold edition is definitely not worth it as it only adds a little over 2hs of even more very mediocre gameplay and the DLCs story is already told in the base game.

My biggest issue with this game is the partner's AI, thankfully my first playthrough was in normal with my brother, which was a great experience, but when I decided to try veteran and professional with AI partner, my opinion dramatically changed. To give you an idea of what level of AI we're working with here, if you tell it to cover you, it'll stand directly behind you and shoot enemies, but every shot will land in your head because, as I said, it's standing directly behind you, and if you move to give it room to shoot, it'll move again to be directly behind you and keep shooting you in the head. Now if you tell it to be aggressive, it'll go away from you, stand in the middle of the horde, use all the healing, and get killed. Normal difficulty is very forgiving with the errors, but Professional specially is impossible without at least infinite ammo magnum and a rocket launcher, the window for revival is very small so your partner needs to be beside you at all times, and despite having specific commands for that, sometimes it just likes to wander around and get itself killed regardless, even worse is when it's right by your side and an enemy hits you (Because everything 1shots you in pro), and instead of reviving you it decides to keep shooting enemies every, single, time.

Aside from that, enemies sometimes get stuck in corners, you frequently get stuck in corners, overall feels dated (Even more than 2005 RE4 because of the AI mainly), but the action gameplay still delivers. The story is bad, the classic silly supervillain that will cleanse the rotten world, but you're not playing this game for the story anyways.

So to close things out, if this didn't have a co-op option, it'd be a rotund no, but since it does have, it's a 6/10 yes. If you still decide to play with AI, I'd recommend that you play in normal, have it in cover at all times and only give it the first sniper rifle you find and take away all other guns, The only thing it's good at is sniping enemies, upgrade a magnum to max and unlock infinite ammo, and then play veteran and professional if you want to have a bad time

Also you can't 100% this game in a legit way because multiplayer is dead",1704401691,1704510166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game boasts impressive graphics, especially considering its release date. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and visual effects can be a selling point for players who appreciate top-notch visuals. 

The control scheme on PC might indeed pose challenges for some players. The control layout, especially for those accustomed to more modern control schemes, can feel clunky or hard to manage. 

For those who prefer action-packed sequences over survival horror elements, RE5 might be a good fit. Its focus on action, intense combat, and varied scenarios might appeal to gamers seeking that type of gameplay. 

Compared to its predecessors, RE5 leans more heavily into action-oriented gameplay. This shift might appeal to gamers who prefer faster-paced, combat-heavy experiences rather than the slower, survival horror style of earlier Resident Evil titles.

Ultimately, ""Resident Evil 5"" is a great addition to a gaming library for those who value cooperative gameplay, action-oriented experiences, and are willing to overlook its deviations from the series' earlier survival horror elements.",1704078557,1704078557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is because these games have tank controls, where your character can't strafe. Instead, they have to turn in place, like a tank, before pushing forward to go in that direction. They also can't move and shoot at the same time. So, take a moment to let that sink in if you're coming off the latest Call of Duty... or any other modern FPS, really.

The other K&D control issue has to do with how the mouse snaps away whenever you look around and then push WASD to move. The onscreen character is restricted in how quickly they can turn in place, but you are free to pan the camera as fast as your hand can move the mouse. So if you push WASD to move before your character has completed their turning in place, the whole screen snaps back to wherever they were currently facing before they completed their turn, and you're left with a jarring effect that drastically ruins your aiming experience. The easiest fix for this is to always hold WASD before moving the mouse. As long as your character is walking (in any direction), the camera-panning speed binds to the character turning to create a fluid aiming experience. There won't be any snapback. But it'll be a while before that becomes muscle memory.

After that hurdle, you'll be left with one of the best co-op experiences you can have. The game was a strong 8.5/10 back in the day, and still holds up now. The graphics are even better and the loading times are even faster. Only shortfall is sometimes enemy pathfinding is bugged - and sometimes enemies get stuck behind walls trying to jump out at you. It's rare, but it does happen.

The story is silly and over the top, and you just need to turn your brain off for it.

Gameplay is great. Shooting has great game-feel, bullets have weight and enemies have excellent feedback. Shoot them in the kneecap to stagger, run up and combo into a melee attack to save ammo. Even better: run up *BEHIND* them to break/cut their neck to suppress and negate any and all post-death surprises, like the wigglies that might have sprouted from their neck, or the fliers that could have spawned from their corpses, etc.

Fair warning: Of the 4 times I've beaten this game, I've never touched the single-player. I've heard Sheva's AI can make it very frustrating as she'd waste your precious bullets and ruin certain setups, but I can't speak to it. 

If you can find a friend to play it with, you'll have a really good time for at the very least 15 hours, until you decide you want to beat it again on a higher difficulty and then blast into the Mercenaries mode where you'll rack up several more",1703743032,1703743032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get home, it's my 13th birthday, and this friend of my father's, Michelle, wants to jailbreak my PS3 as a birthday present, but says he can't because of its model. Instead, he lends me a copy of RE 5, the second game he's lent me. They obviously want me to give it a try immediately, and I only do for a couple of minutes before getting bored, giving up on it, and going straight back to Far Cry 2, the other game Michelle had lent me; my father and his friend are kinda disappointed. Once Michelle is gone, I notice he took MK: KE and Gran Turismo 5 in exchange, I'm not very happy about it.

RE 5 was weird, its mechanics were unusual, its system was awkward for me, I didn't like it. Shortly after, I decide to give it a try just in case, and long story short, that was one of my best decisions ever. The game was awesome and fun, and it only got better through the years when I met people and found out about modded weapons.

This game was the very first game I ever played online multiplayer, and it was on accident because I didn't know I was setting my session to public and someone joined me in chapter 2-1 at the bridge. I was so scared, we had internet connection installed for the first time recently, and my father had told me not to play online. Long story short, I liked it and so began playing with people, then blocking them and unblocking them in order to clear the “Recently played with” section of the PS4, I didn't want my father finding out and that list didn't have a delete option.

So, so many years later, and I'm still enjoying this game like crazy on PS4 until its last days. The game is now nearly dead, and just like PvZ: GW, it will always be an unforgettable part of my story. I never got either my MK: KE nor my GE 5 back, and I couldn't care less.",1703654695,1703654695,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With customizable weapons, special outfits to unlock, and silly DLC like mercenaries mode, there's plenty of gameplay to bond over. No better way to strengthen a friendship than surviving a horde of frenzied parasitized villagers together!

There's no survival horror, just a lot of action. It went from running away from zombies in a creepy mansion to punching a freaking big boulder and hooking off giant monsters like it's nothing.

Oh, and the controls on PC? Horrible, seriously horrible. Get yourself a controller if you want to play this game. But yeah, the camera control is also pretty bad; can't escape from that. Well, it's a very old game, can't complain too much.

Capcom updated RE5, it's playable now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resident Evil 5 is a great game, but this port? isn't that great.

RE5 is probably the best RE game I've played from the series (in my opinion), I love the plot, the characters, the stages, everything about it.

It is great that the DLC released on consoles was finally released on PC, Lost in Nightmares and Desperate Escape are amazing and great if you want to know more about the story plot, and the VERSUS mode and The Mercenaries Reunion are good for online playing, but sadly, this port is full of bugs.

Sometimes you just can't finish a chapter because an important item won't appear

You just can't play Versus, Mercenaries or the Mercenaries Reunion Online because there's a region lock on the online mode, there's no one playing near me, so that makes those unplayable online, and the only reason buying this port was because of the DLC that was finally released on PC, but this really takes all of the goods away.

I don't recommend this port of the game because the game is broken, online mode is dead because of the region lock and sometimes, it crashes for no reason at all.

I recommend playing the Games for Windows Live Version, PlayStation 3 (or PS4 w/ PSNow) and the XBOX 360 versions of the game, online is still alive on those (GFWL through other servers), I also recommend that before buying this port of the game, do a little research if there's a new patch released to fix this several bugs on this broken port of the game (if that ever happens, the game came out MONTHS ago and we still don't have a proper gameplay).

Again, I don't recommend the game because of the crappy port Capcom made, Resident Evil 5 is a really great game, but this port isn't.",1448418156,1701993153,True,0,0,0.478613048791885376,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 5 presents a mixed bag of intense action and divisive design choices. The cooperative gameplay, featuring Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar, adds a dynamic element, encouraging teamwork in the face of relentless bio-organic horrors.

The characters, while visually impressive, receive a mixed reception. Chris Redfield's return is welcomed by series fans, but some may find his character lacking the depth seen in previous entries. Sheva Alomar, though a competent partner, occasionally falls into the realm of AI predictability, affecting the overall immersion.

The cooperative aspect, a departure from the series' survival horror roots, offers a unique experience, especially in the game's intense combat scenarios. However, the focus on action may leave traditional Resident Evil enthusiasts yearning for the atmospheric tension of earlier titles.

The African setting introduces a fresh backdrop, but the game occasionally succumbs to stereotypes and a lack of nuanced storytelling. While the visuals and set pieces are impressive, the pacing and tonal shifts may disrupt the overall immersion.

Resident Evil 5's mixed reception stems from its departure from survival horror conventions, favoring action-oriented gameplay. Despite this, the cooperative dynamic and impressive visuals contribute to a memorable experience, especially for those who embrace the series' evolution toward a more action-centric style.",1511473375,1701516701,True,5,0,0.597070693969726563,2,True,False,False

If you're looking for a 3rd person coop shooter to play, RE5 is without a doubt one of the greatest coop shooters of all time. So yes get it now!

If you're looking for a great Resident evil game, than RE5 is both great and awful, it ultimately ends up to what you can tolerate and what you prefer. If you love the horror in RE, its almost entirely gone here. If you love the lore, its hit and miss. Things like the new virus(parasite) and enemy type Majini are great, so is Wesker as a returning antagonist and the setting in Africa, but things like the plot and the tone are weak. Lastly the game unfortunately cannot be played solo, the AI is way too frustrating and ruins the experience. Thats the biggest issue with RE5, if you want to enjoy another great RE imo especially one that's a gameplay successor to RE4, well it cant be solo.

I'll rate it as follows. As a coop shooter 5/5. As a horror game 2/5. As a Resident Evil game(post RE4 era) 4/5. I personally rank this game in my top 5 RE games, up there with RE1R, RE4, RE2R, RE8.(yet to play RE4R",1701320693,1701321067,True,1,0,0.509493708610534668,0,True,False,False

What I disliked about RE5:
This game has a more frustrating movement system than RE4. Which shouldn't be possible because RE4 uses the tank control system and this game doesn't. Kinda. The problem is that this game does a mix of the regular 3rd person shooter controls and the tank controls, which is a little disastrous.

The AI is also so bad that you they will legit softlock you in certain areas. I did when you're in the room right before the Jill boss fight and your partner has to climb up a platform to push this container/dumpster. They kept dying to the BOW's crawling on the walls because I couldn't cover them, nor could I cover myself when I went because I had to push the damn thing.

What I liked about RE5:
The characters are pretty phenomenal. Chris is nearly as big as the boulder he punches in the final act and Wesker was Resident Evil's most compelling and coolest villain. I used to not like Sheva all that much (large reason being because of the AI) but in hindsight, she's a pretty good addition to the series. Jill's reveal is pretty cool, and the enemies (both the Majini and the BOW's) are pretty menacing.",1700965163,1701100097,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Marking the debut of co-op in the Resident Evil series, experience even more intense action compared to Resident Evil 4 as you're bombarded with hordes of zombies and militants.

The story of RE5 sees Chris Redfield arriving in Africa on a lead that his presumably-dead partner Jill Valentine is still out there somewhere. Teaming up with local counter-terrorist Sheva Alomar, the two discover that an evolved version of the Las Plagas virus from Resident Evil 4 has been released into the local population, later finding out that the Umbrella corporation is once again behind this nefarious plot, spear-headed by none other than Albert Wesker. The plot of RE5 is so stereotypically action-packed, so quintessentially late 2000's, and frankly it's both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand you get all kinds of cheesy action moments and explosions and goofy-ness, on the other hand you get some really rough dialogue moments and arguably some racist undertones present throughout the game (even outside of being infected by the virus, the locals are often depicted very primitively, plus the whole idea of ""U.S. military steps into underdeveloped country to save the day""). The plot quality of this game feels like watching a low-budget Transformers movie, if you don't pay too much attention it's very 7/10 brain candy.

In terms of gameplay, RE5 is very rough around the edges. The system is still rooted in late 2000's technology, so you've got tank controls and rough weapon handling and inability to move while ADS'ing and other elements that would be fixed in more modern games. The upgrade system and loot economy is decently solid, though I would argue that the inventory is a tad too small for the amount of weapons and items the game expects you to hold at any given time. I played the entire game in co-op with a friend, and from what I've heard that's the only way to truly play it, as the Sheva AI is relatively uncooperative and hoards loot throughout the game. RE5 has a high reliance on quick-time events in combat, both scripted ones and spontaneous ones. On keyboard these quick-time events can be a pain, as they are either ""F"", ""A+D"", or the dreaded ""F+V"" which is a nightmare to hit while using WASD to move. Some bosses also relied heavily on quick-time events to defeat them. Other bosses relied so heavily on gimmicks to defeat as opposed to traditional combat that my friend and I would get stuck for long periods of time wondering what specific conditions needed to be met to damage the boss. Additionally, the PC port of this game seems quite bugged in a lot of areas. My friend and I frequently encountered bosses that would glitch to never expose their weakspots or never lose health when damaged. In the final boss fight my friend and I progressed so quickly through the arena that we accidentally skipped over two important cutscenes that would've caused the boss to go through a specific sequence for us to damage him, leading to an unwinnable fight that we had to restart.

Despite all this, Resident Evil 5 is a blast to play in the worst way possible. So bad that it's good, RE5 gave me some of the most hilarious moments I've experience in a videogame in a while. From a series that traditionally takes itself pretty seriously, you can tell that Capcom's direction shifted with this game towards a less-serious action-focused approach. Once you recognize that, RE5 becomes at the least tolerable, and at the most a semi-decent goofy co-op experience. If you have a friend who's willing to burn a few hours on some objectively ridiculous zombie action, then I'd check it out, but otherwise just skip this one.",1701036525,1701036525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Need two people to play
-AI is absolutely brain-dead and will get your or themselves killed nonstop.

-Movement is fucking horrible, it's like going to Walmart on black Friday at 6PM. 
-Story is bland and boring.
-Game is called Resident Evil, but this was made back in 2009 and they thought it would be cool to make a horror genre into some generic ass third person shooter.
-Speaking of 2009, they couldn't even get the third person shooting part correct because of how awful the movement, camera, and gun-play are. Tons of third person games were out by that period, I am old enough to remember playing games in that era as a kid. No excuse for this game to be so shit. Even by 2005 when this game was in developed, you had games showing you how it was supposed to be done.

This game is so bad that I had to stop playing it. I would rather stick 2 needles up my dick while drinking chocolate milk than to replay this game.  A PIECE OF SHIT GAME

EDIT: beat the game the next day and was glad when the game was over. boss fights are all boring. Grab ""item"" shoot at weak spot.

When you hear people talk about Resident Evil, most agree that 5 and 6 are amongst the worst games in the franchise, and i honestly can't say why. I have not played 6 yet, but if you liked 4, then you should definitely check out 5. It may not be as good as 4, but it still feels like a proper sequel, and it does many things right. Especially the bosses. Nearly all bosses of this game were super fun to face, even if one particular boss was bugged for me, so i had to use the Rocket Launcher.

The game does have its shortcomings though. The settings of Chapter 1, 2 and 4 are incredibly similar, so they did get old rather quickly. This game also has you fight much more enemies at once, compared to Resi4. Sometimes it did feel a bit absurd and overwhelming, but the game does give you plenty of ammunition to make up for it. 

Your companion, Sheva, can also get in the way rather often, and she also gets caught by one-hit attacks from time to time, which can be pretty annoying. Mutliplayer is probably the better option, but Singleplayer is still far from unplayable.

This game also completely lacks the survival horror aspect of the older games. There is absolutely nothing scary about this experience, and resources are rather plentiful, so you're almost guaranteed to never run out of ammunition or healing items.

Well now there's hope my friend!
Introducing Resident Evil 5, the game where the series sold out and where our ""western pandering"" dark age began! 
""Good writing?"" How about a prepostorous, overly serious cliche-fest of action movie cliches taken out of a bad seinen anime, with characters who you don't give a toss about barring franchise mainstays Chris, Jill and Wesker (who dies in this entry)? We've even thrown in ridiculous stunts, motorcycle chases, bullet-time slow-motion and even made the Helicopter from last time a mainstay in the first three levels to make sure we've kept Anderson film fans happy!

""Horror?"" Toss to that! With Resident Evil 5, we've taken out any and all elements of tension and suspense despite using the gameplay formula from our most acclaimed outing, and have turned it into a full-on action shooter with bulletsponge mini-bosses, an AI partner who accompanies you throughout, neutered monster designs, bright settings, exploding red cans and level design built ENTIRELY around Co-Op, because Gears of War is the hip thing with the wider audience we're trying to chase.

And with Resident Evil 5, you won't need to worry about being vulnerable, because you and Sheva will be flushed with handgun ammo and frequently given ammo for your other weapons, too. In fact, we hope you love making monsters your bitches because we've made the enemies total pushovers and the minibosses as annoying as humanly possible because they instakill you most of the time and we still aren't allowing you to move whilst shooting. So good luck!
And the DLC? Want to experience the events that set the main game in motion? TOO BAD! You're gonna have to play through the main game beforehand even if you have it, because our game is a masterpiece that deserves your time and attention, because with Resident Evil 5, we've stripped almost all of the identity away, to make the HIGHEST-GROSSING RE GAME OF ALL TIME!

[groan] Okay, enough with the mockery. This game is NOT better than you remember. I can understand why it has a fanbase (sometimes, you could do with a co-op action game starring characters you know and love), but to me and a fair few others, the glimpses of brilliance and traces of Resident Evil DNA you'll get in 5 are best experienced in Resident Evil 4 and its Remake, because this is what that game could've been in the wrong hands. There's no tension, no suspense, barely any puzzles to solve, and a shitton of baggage. Sheva Alomar is actually not one of them, her AI actually functions well, but when you're being pelted with a genuinely bad story, frustrating inability to move whilst shooting (which you'd need), ridiculous action setpieces and lame characters, you'll forget that fact. The only reason you'd want to play this is to see how Chris Redfield finally defeats his nemesis, Albert Wesker, but even then I don't think its worth it. Buy Resident Evil 4 (2005) instead, you'll thank me later.",1699811963,1700227514,False,2,0,0.499092549085617065,0,True,False,False

Some people find this unfair, but it's the immediate follow up within the same franchise, so why the hell not? This thumbs up comes with plenty of caveats, but I still wouldn't call it a negative experience.

As a follow-up to Resident Evil 4, this game is a disappointment. The core gameplay is almost unchanged, meaning you can strategically shoot limbs to stagger enemies and then melee them when they're recoiling, while keeping the tanky controls and inventory management. The inventory space is much more limited than 4, although the upside is the ability to quickly swap between weapons, which is a nice change. All that aside, every other aspect is a strict downgrade.

The characters are more stoic and less playful, and very little of the charming banter from RE4 has transferred over. The story is equally less interesting, leaning fully into the over-the-top action movie aesthetic without much personality or flavor. The only character that turns up a good performance this time around is Wesker, who is kind of goofy and absurd, but he just doesn't have a protagonist that can match his manic energy.

The levels and locations are also uninspired and forgettable, and even as I write this review I struggle to think of particularly fun or visually interesting parts in the game. This goes doubly so for the bosses. Resident Evil 5 has one of the worst batches of bosses I've seen in a game, with only one that I can say I actively enjoyed (flying bat creature, sorry I don't know your name). Not only are they mediocre or flat-out miserable as gameplay, but they also bear very little weight to the story with a couple of exceptions. In RE4, just about every boss you fight is a memorable character, with suspense building up to the point where you fight them.

I know a lot of people give RE4 crap for being too action oriented, but I would argue it has plenty of atmosphere and some scary bits to balance it out. In RE5, no such attempt was made, which I do find a bit of a shame. So why give the game a thumbs up at all....

.... because co-op, bam I said it. Co-op! RE5 might be flawed up to its tits, but it's undeniably fun to get to experience that juicy gameplay of Resident Evil 4 with a friend. And to the game's credit, its campaign is built from the ground up to be a co-op experience, as opposed to it being a tacked-on mode. It's fun to think about who's gonna take what weapon, for what situations, and healing each other strategically and thinking about who carries what items. Would I recommend you buy and play this game if you don't have a friend to play with? Honestly, no. Because even if I was to stop comparing it to its predecessor, Resident Evil 5 is still just a mid-tier action game, and it needs the co-op to lift it up.

When I first played this game I played it with a controller on Xbox One, going onto it with a keyboard and mouse I had a feeling that the game was going to feel super clunky but surprisingly it controls really well in my opinion. Instead of having only around 4 slots for quick access with a controller, you got all 9 slots for quick access and I honestly prefer the aiming crosshair over the laser aim with a controller. The only part about M&K the movement feels a little sluggish, as while moving looking around is very slowed down since you're technically moving your character around while you do it. Other than that, the game controls perfectly.

Very fun action experience, horrendous horror experience as it's non-existent. The temple levels really makes me wish that there was some kind of... Tomb raiding game with the control scheme and action that RE5 has. But a man can dream, I guess.",1698933017,1698933017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Half the time, even on normal difficulty, she just runs around and doesn't shoot.

It doesn't matter if I set her to cover or attack mode, the result is the same. 

She has plenty of ammo, a shotgun, and a rifle. But just doesn't actually attack.

She's worthless. 

Ashley in Resident Evil 4 was more helpful, and she doesn't even fight. But at least Ashley is predictable. She follows you around closely and tends not to get in the way.

Sheva just does whatever the Hell she wants. She gets in the way, doesn't shoot when she should, takes a century to heal you when you're bleeding out, she'll stand around just waiting to be killed by those dumbass bug things that unfairly kill you instantly, will screw up your attacks at the worst possible time when you're trying to do a melee attack by actually shooting when you DON'T want her to, and the list goes on.

I mean, it's just ridiculous. This is a game that should've never even had a single player mode, because this is not a single player game.

[i][INTRO - Honest Trailer Voiceover Guy]
In a world where viruses make you look like you just stepped out of a GQ magazine, and punching boulders is a legitimate survival strategy, comes a game that will make you question... everything. It's time for the Honest Trailer and Pitch Meeting for Resident Evil 5!

[PITCH MEETING - Conference Room]

Screenwriter: Okay, so here's the pitch. We take our hunky hero, Chris Redfield, and send him on a mission to Africa.

Producer: Africa, huh? That sounds different.

Screenwriter: Oh, it gets better. We're introducing a new character, Sheva Alomar.

Producer: Tell me more.

Screenwriter: Well, she's hot, sexy, and a total badass. Players are gonna simp for her like there's no tomorrow.

Producer: Simping, you say? Excellent. We'll need that.

Screenwriter: And there's a twist! Jill Valentine is back, but she's blonde and brainwashed, even sexier and deadlier than ever.

Producer: Sexier and deadlier? I'm starting to see a pattern here.

Screenwriter: Exactly. And, Chris? He's practically roided up, like he's been eating steroids for breakfast. He's so strong, he punches boulders.

Producer: Punching boulders? That's...creative.

Screenwriter: But here's the kicker. The game's basically a harem for Chris. He's got Sheva, Jill, and then there's Wesker.

Producer: Wesker? Isn't he the bad guy?

Screenwriter: Oh, he's more than that. He's yandere for Chris, like obsessively in love with him.

Producer: Yandere? Interesting choice.

[INTRO - Honest Trailer Voiceover Guy]
From the studio that gave you more bizarre plot twists than you can shake a boulder at, comes a game that answers the age-old question: ""What happens when you mix a virus with a soap opera?""

[HONEST TRAILER - Game Footage]

Voiceover Guy: Resident Evil 5! Get ready for a whirlwind romance between Chris and his biceps, Sheva and her impeccable fashion sense, and Jill, who somehow manages to look hotter while brainwashed.

[Clip of Chris punching a boulder]

Voiceover Guy: Chris Redfield, the only man who can defeat global bioterrorism with his fists! Because who needs guns when you have biceps the size of small cars?

[Clip of Wesker dramatically monologuing]

Voiceover Guy: And then there's Wesker, the villain who's not just evil, but yandere-level obsessed with Chris. Talk about a complicated relationship status.

[Clip of Sheva taking down zombies]

Voiceover Guy: Sheva, our favorite zombie slayer and eye candy. Seriously, who has time to reload when you're too busy simping?

[Clip of Jill kicking ass]

Voiceover Guy: And Jill Valentine, who proves that brainwashing can turn you into the ultimate fashion icon.

[Clip of the game's absurd moments]

Voiceover Guy: Get ready for a rollercoaster of insane plot twists, over-the-top action sequences, and a deep exploration of Chris's love life. Is it just us, or is this game secretly a dating sim?

[Clip of Chris and Wesker's intense showdown]

Voiceover Guy: Will Chris and Wesker ever resolve their complicated feelings? Will Sheva and Jill continue to be smoking hot while saving the world? Find out in this unforgettable, action-packed adventure where boulders are the true villains!

[INTRO - Honest Trailer Voiceover Guy]

Voiceover Guy: Resident Evil 5, where punching boulders and complicated romances are all in a day's work. Grab your controllers, folks, and get ready for the most bizarre virus outbreak yet!

RE4 fixed the inventory system only for RE5 to break it again. Firstly it's too small, secondly why does an egg take up the same amount of space as an RPG, having your dumbf*ck AI partner hold half your inventory makes it needlessly complicated.

As a follow up to RE4 this game changes up the scenery and moves to a more action-centric style of gameplay. The story is solid, and gets more over-the-top, with a few twists and turns. Having even smarter zombies then in RE4 was fun, but some of the movement and gun mechanics were super frustrating. The fact that you cant move while reloading or aiming got me a few times. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. I just haven't played as many games lately with that style of movement/gun-play. Also was not a fan of all the QTEs, but it's a remnant of that time in gaming. The inventory system could be a bit frustrating at times since you can only ""store"" or buy things when you die or are in between chapters. I definitely preferred the item box and merchant from RE4. Minor gripe though. The game is split into 6 chapters. Several of these felt a bit long, but not too bad. The environment changes with each chapter giving you some new scenery and baddies to deal with. The game is solid and enjoyable, but modern gamers may have some frustrations with some of the mechanics.

I played entirely on the Steam Deck and it played near flawlessly (it crashed once during a cut-scene). I had it set to high graphics and locked to 60fps and 60hz refresh rate. It took me about 16.5 hours to complete.

Overall, I enjoyed the story and the more action oriented gameplay. My only real gripe had to do with some of the movement and gun mechanics. Definitely recommended for anyone who is a fan of the series.",1698416816,1698416816,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

Half a year after completing the revolutionary Resident Evil 4, here I am writing a review for its successor – Resident Evil 5. In contrary to the previous game, I found that this game wasn’t nearly as well received and that some people actually hate this title. After completing the whole main game and both DLCs, to be completely honest, I really don’t understand why. Because in my humble opinion, this game is as great and as fun as Resident Evil 4, it just isn’t as iconic.


This is the first title of Resident Evil without its original creator Shinji Mikami. I thought that would change the storyline approach, but in reality, RE5 has much more connection with the earlier parts than RE4. The emphasis is back to the original protagonists from the first title – Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, but this time they got separated and Chris has a new partner - Sheva Alomar. The story is set in Africa with African native black people, which actually caused a backlash when the trailer got out. Apparently Chris being a white guy killing black parasite-possessed people is racism (please remember that Sheva is also a native African), even though Leon does the same thing to Spanish guys in RE4, but whatever. 

This is, in my opinion, a great example of how RE0 could have turned out if the things were done differently. You are playing with your partner (offline with a bot or online co-op) and he will help you all the time while you can exchange items when near to each other. I played the game with my friend online, and I have to say it was like none RE experience before. It was fun and very dynamic. The best thing about playing online co-op for me was the boss fights, because you need to work together with your partner to bring your enemy down. You need to time your attacks and be extremely precise. Also you can boost each other up on broken ladders, open stuck doors together etc.

The game is, you could actually say, a carbon copy of RE4 in 80-90% of things. It’s the same third-person shooter, with the identical gameplay mechanics and also same quick time events, both during cutscenes and the general gameplay. Even some of the bosses and enemy NPCs were used again. Stunned enemies animations and reloading animations are also the same. Even the sounds of picking up items, main menu and inventory sounds – they are all identical. The difference is that the survival horror part is now completely gone (but that’s the consequence of RE4 pushing the survival horror away to make way for the third person shooter) and it’s even more reliant on action, with much more enemies and more weapons. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that RE5 being the copy of RE4 is necessarily bad, because it’s logical that Capcom tried to repeat the previous success and wanted to please the fans. And to be honest it worked, since this title is the best-selling game from the whole franchise (and even was the best-selling Capcom game until 2018). 

Of course, again the con for me is the same as with the RE4 – the game is not survival horror anymore, there is no scary moments, the ambience is not that of RE1, RE2 and so forth. 

Graphics are obviously the best so far. I absolutely adored the action packed cutscenes which I think are really greatly done.

The story is now back to Umbrella, and covers the background around its creators and numerous personnel. You can again read dozens of documents about Umbrella Corporation and their many biological weapons.

The DLCs are short, but effective and fun to play, so I recommend getting them too for the full experience.

To sum up, don’t listen to negative reviews of this game. I had my friend babbling how this game is just a downgrade of RE4 which I think is just not true. It’s the same formula with some upgrades and some downgrades.

21690,143181871,76561198083376855,0,57,416,0,347,1690946804,"RE5 is a tricky recommendation.

Super Bunnyhop, an excellent critic of the old days once said that ""Everything RE4 could be, it was. From here on out they can't go in any direction but backwards."" Which rings more true than ever, given the retrospective of releases within the franchise.

Every Resident Evil that was made along the lines of RE4 failed to achieve the same resounding quality presented in what is perhaps the most important game within its genre. The biggest problem with Resident Evil 4 is that it was too good.

5 is basically a stripped down version of 4, without much of the charm and vitality that emanates from that game. However, its ""novelty"", at the time, was cooperative gameplay.

RE5 has refined the combat and simplified a lot more. Thoroughly action-focused, its design is essentially about long, claustrophobic segments of combat against large amounts of enemies (Suitable to be tackled by two players at once), and light and extremely linear exploration (Much more than the RE4 itself). All in favor of focusing the experience to support a fast-paced game.

Atmosphere is secondary. This is not a horror game, nor does it claim to be one. It's an action game in a dark and grungy guise.

Presentation and pacing is, however, still excellent. It is indeed a solid application of the combat mechanics of the original RE4, accompanied by all the technological potential offered by the seventh gen. It's fluid and satisfying enough to please fans of this formula.

And to our delight, the story is still extremely stupid. Even worse by the undertones of political commentary sprinkled throughout the narrative. It is wonderful.

But the biggest problem comes precisely from trying to play it in single player mode. It just doesn't work.

Being forced to accompany and babysit an NPC with no sense of self-preservation or ability to make smart decisions, any difficulty outside of Normal becomes a fest of unnecessary frustration, with you having to divide your attention between the game and your ally, lest you fail because of him.

Your partner is unable to position himself correctly; Manage their own resources intelligently; Save ammo; Prioritize correct targets; Avoid enemies or divide their attention; Create opportunities to use melee attacks or simply wait for the best moment to use a healing item. Your partner can shoot and follow, and that's it.

As if that weren't enough, his basic behavior is to stay glued to you, always in your field of vision... In a game with an over-the-shoulder camera, with a considerably reduced overview...Yeah. Expect his constant intrusion tripping over you, barring your path and obstructing your view.

The other behavior option is ""kamikaze mode"", even worse than the previous one.

Imagine that of all your deaths, the overwhelming majority will be because of your partner not being able to perform fundamental actions for the game to work. You will have to manage his life and share resources with him. And outside of mods, there is no option to make him invulnerable or exclude him from the experience entirely.

But considering it a bad idea to try to play a co-op game alone, I say that there is no good reason for you to do so except with the intention of getting to know the game. If you're after a single-player experience that offers a similar gameplay loop but is a million times better executed, you've already got RE4, offering what you want, negating the need for you to try this one. 

Take it from me, Resident Evil 5, despite being solid fun, is far from reaching its predecessor. If you don't have anyone to play with, I'd say skip it. 

Or at least go after those mods I mentioned.

[b] Resident Evil 5 [/b], as a direct sequel to the highly acclaimed ""Resident Evil 4,"" aimed to build on its predecessor's success by introducing various improvements. However, many of these improvements either missed the mark or resulted in a letdown. While [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b] remains a solid game to this day, it's often considered one of the weaker entries in the mainline series, especially after the groundbreaking experience offered by ""Resident Evil 4.""

In [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b], you assume the role of either Chris Redfield or Sheva Alomar, BSAA agents working to unravel a terrorist attack in Africa. As the game progresses, Chris realizes that this is no ordinary terrorist attack and decides to go it alone. Sheva, witnessing her comrades being killed, chooses to accompany Chris to the bitter end. Throughout the game, Chris must confront his own past, facing off against his enemies and dealing with the loss of his former partner.

One of the major improvements [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b] introduced was cooperative gameplay. While you can play the game entirely solo, you are accompanied by your partner. The significant twist is that both players share the same pool of resources, which means that effectively managing ammo and healing items between you and your partner becomes a critical aspect of survival. While cooperative play can lead to chaotic and fun moments, playing with a stranger can feel somewhat awkward. [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b] uses a host system where Player 1 hosts the game, making the quality of the online connection dependent on that player.

While cooperative play can be enjoyable, [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b] falls short of improving the survival horror experience introduced in ""Resident Evil 4."" The game shifts the focus even further towards action sequences, with the new enemy type caused by Uroboros hardly invoking any sense of horror. These enemies act much more like typical humans, using weapons and even riding motorcycles.

Many of the game's features also feel outdated, which is understandable given its age. You cannot remap controls, instead being limited to choosing from existing control formats. Playing as Sheva means you have a permanent left shoulder perspective, a lore-based decision, but one that might take some time to get used to.

The merchant system, a beloved feature from ""Resident Evil 4,"" has been reworked in [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b]. While you can still purchase weapons and sell treasures, the implementation feels somewhat barebones. Trading is now automatically initiated at the end of each chapter, lacking the interaction and charm of the mysterious merchant in the previous game. The inability to combine treasures, as you could in ""Resident Evil 4,"" results in players simply selling all they acquire without the strategic element of choosing what to combine.

In conclusion, while [b] Resident Evil 5 [/b] remains a solid game to enjoy, it falls short in various areas where it had the potential to improve. It also misses an opportunity with its characters, particularly the long-anticipated confrontation between Chris and Albert Wesker. The game doesn't strike the right balance between action and horror that made its predecessor so successful.

Following up Resident Evil 4, I am just baffled.
The locations are more dull, the inventory system is worse, controls feel clunkier, puzzles are even less frequent than RE4.
As an entry in the series, this feels nigh unrecognisable, with its only selling point being that you have a partner throughout the entire campaign, whether you're doing co-op or not.

To be somewhat positive, let me just say that I actually thought this was a good conclusion to the narrative they've set up throughout the entire series thus far, it's well acted, it's absurd at points [spoiler]especially in the finale[/spoiler], it's still wonderfully animated for a 2009 game, and overall I'm not mad with the plot they went with here.

The environments can look really bland at points, and the game feels boring at a lot of points, but there are some rather fun spectacle moments on occasion, such as a classic village assault, motorbike gangs and [b]CHRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!![/b]

But moving onto the negatives, the game itself is a generic shooter, I genuinely can't think of many reasons to recommend this over RE4, let alone other shooters.
On PC, the controls not great, very iffy dodge keys, aiming felt off, and controls felt stiff in general.
Furthermore, if you play this anyway, do yourself a favour and play it in co-op.
Withoutout co-op,
[h1]The AI is atrocious[/h1]

This was by far the worst part of the game playing alone, they constantly walk into killzones, can't take commands effectively, absolutely chew through ammo and healing items especially.
The commands of cover or attack mode are so iffy, command basically turns your companion into a pacifist, and seemingly forces them to equip their weakest weapon, and by the end game it was common for them to have multiple stacks of ammo just because of how little they actually felt like shooting, despite the genuine need for assistance.
The attack mode however just makes 'em stupid and rabid, charging forth without any regard for their health, but on the upside, sometimes it works out and they just MAUL enemies, but it's a coin flip when it comes to effectiveness.

When they get downed, as far as I could tell, if you have a healing item you have to use it to resurrect them, instead of just picking them up normally. This is a pain because there's a good chance they'll just get insta-downed, and this'll render your heal moot.

Lastly, there are sections which just feel hollow if you have an AI, needing to separate feels lame when you're the one standing around while your companion does all the work, again you really should have a friend if you play this.

[h1]Wrapping up with the DLC[/h1]
It's harmless?

Both of these episodes last less than an hour your first time, and add nothing to the narrative.
Honestly I think only one of these is worth playing, to an extent, and that'd be Lost in Nightmares.
In short, it's a love letter to the original Resident Evil, with some cute aesthetic and gameplay design focused around short puzzles instead of action combat, final jank boss aside, I actually enjoyed this.

Desperate Escape however doubles down on the generic shooter aspect by just being a few large stretches of land packed with enemies until you reach the end, which is gated behind a seven and a half minute encounter with no checkpoints. There's just no selling point here besides having the games hardest encounters, but I found it more tedious than anything else.

[h1]I just didn't have a good time here[/h1]
Maybe if I played with a friend or had no prior experience with the franchise, I might've had an alright time, but I had neither of these things, and as such I just kept wanting better which previous entries provided.
I just can't help but recommend you spend your money and time on something else.",1696750430,1696750899,False,1,0,0.496599197387695313,0,True,False,False

Il sera accompagné d’une protagoniste que je n’ai pas croisé dans d’autres opus, du nom de Sheva. L’histoire se déroule dans le village de Kijuju d’abord, en Afrique et apparemment il n’est pas utile de préciser le pays, ce n’est pas si grand comme continent[...]Très vite, Chris et Sheva vont être à la poursuite de personnes transmettant le virus « Uroboros » (Ce qui signifie sans doute « j’ai appuyé sur les touches de mon clavier au pif »). Il s’agit simplement de la suite des expérimentations du manoir Spencer, et que celle qui chapeaute le projet de contaminer la population est une certaine Excella Gionne (ce qui signifie « ce nom, il claque trop, … non ? … Non ? ») et on retrouvera aussi notre increvable Wesker. Bon, le scénario n’est pas intéressant, il n’a aucune subtilité et en sautant régulièrement des cinématiques je n’ai pas vraiment la sensation d’avoir raté quelque chose d’essentiel, le jeu se terminant sur Chris qui se demande si ça valait le coup tout ça et il se répond en disant oui… Merci bonhomme !

Le jeu datant de 2009, il propose un système de jeu proche de RE4, mais pour une raison qui m’échappe, avec une lourdeur vraiment excessive dans l’ensemble qui se fait toujours sentir. Le personnage est mou, les ennemis ne sont pas très vifs (heureusement d’ailleurs), les animations sont lentes, les interactions avec Sheva aussi. Chris ne se déplace pas en visant ce qui, vue l’ambition entièrement portée vers l’action du titre, est vraiment ridicule et condamne Chris au statut de plot bodybuildé. L’inventaire est réduit à 9 cases, pour chacun de nos personnages, mais, contrairement à un RE Zero, impossible de permuter à la volée de l’un à l’autre, le jeu étant vraisemblablement pensé comme multijoueur avant tout puis adapté en solo. Les menus et l’interface sont épais et sans doute beaucoup trop mécaniques pour être agréables déjà à l’époque, alors avec nos standards actuels... Il semble toujours y avoir le même système de « Rang » que dans RE4 (plus on est mauvais, plus le jeu offrira balles et kits de soin, et vice-versa), mais ici, les calculs semblent un peu étranges. [...] Mais surtout, ce qui oriente RE5 dans une direction complètement action et qui ne respecte pas le matériau d’origine du début des années 2000, c’est surtout que l’intégralité de l’aventure est un immense couloir, et c’est un immense couloir bien plus que RE4 (qui l’est déjà à moitié) ou que RE Revelations (qui propose au moins quelques aller-retours). Ici, ça avance et ça dégage le chemin jusqu’à la prochaine porte à coups d’armes, à coups de poings aussi parfois, les énigmes sont inexistantes ou quasi (et parfois reposent sur la force physique de notre gros beauf de Chris qui casse et pousse des cailloux), pendant une dizaine d’heure. Enfin, un peu plus en jouant en Pro, mais je pense sincèrement qu’en solo, le mode Pro n’est pratiquement pas faisable au premier essai. Si l’IA de Sheva m’a quand même agréablement surpris (pas trop de soucis de pathfinding, elle récupère des objets et les apporte, elle se défend et attaque, elle soigne aussi etc.), elle se retrouve trop souvent passive, voire gênante car elle aime bien se mettre en face de notre viseur (heureusement les dégâts alliés sont désactivables). [...] 

Du point de vue des graphismes, je dois admettre que Capcom avait quand même sorti le grand jeux à l’époque, c’est finement texturé, les explosions sont belles, les filtres apportent une propreté d’ensemble bienvenue, il y a tout de même pas mal de détails dans les décors. Les reflets manquent cependant, les effets de lumières sont assez timides (relativement à un FEAR, à un Crysis ou un Bioshock) et surtout, il y a ce filtre jaune-maronnasse à la mode à la fin des années 2000 qui vient certes, appuyer sur l’aspect chaleur écrasante de l’environnement au début du jeu, mais qui est lassant et franchement employé de manière inintéressante la majorité du temps. Les ennemis ont un design assez bon et plutôt varié … enfin jVoilà !usqu’à la moitié du jeu où d’un seul coup on se retrouve (comme cette merveilleuse île de RE4...) devant des simples soldats aux yeux rouges et sensiblement zélés.[...] À propos de l’ambiance sonore, j’ai d’abord tenté de modifier le mixage, les bruitages des ennemis sont assez bons mais répétitifs, le doublage des héros est déjà très moyen, Sheva ne nous laisse pas cinq secondes avant de nous dire ce que l’on doit faire, et les musiques sont honteusement génériques. J’ai fini par mettre mes playlists Qobuz pour noyer les sons du jeu. 

Alors, qu’y a-t-il de plaisant dans ce RE5 ? En pratique, je le comparerais facilement à un Dead Space 2 mais qui a le mérite de ne pas se prendre au sérieux, ou plutôt, qui autorise le joueur à ne pas le prendre au sérieux. Par rapport à RE4, il y a tout de même bien des éléments qui vacillent : il y a moins de tangibilité à l’ensemble, ne serait-que parce que la progression est trop souvent interrompue par un menu de changement de niveau et donc la sensation d’avoir à faire avec des environnements jetables est trop forte. Il n’y a pas véritablement de défi puisqu’il est techniquement possible de cumuler des objets pour passer un chapitre, même si j’ai été aussi très frappé par l’énorme écart de difficulté entre les modes « normal » et « pro ». Les personnages sont globalement placides et même Albert Spehiroth Wesker est au sommet de l’absurdité (je veux dire, même dans la lave il revient nous embêter… arrêtez les dévs… s’il-vous-plaît ?). Après, j’avoue, je cherchais à compenser mon manque de nanardises et j’ai été relativement servi d’un certain point de vue, surtout que Chris n’est pas avare en réflexion idiote, notamment devant un cadavre empalé « hmmm ce n’est pas la mort idéale »… encore une fois, merci bonhomme !

Accessoirement, je me souviens aussi de la polémique sur l’aspect raciste du jeu [...] il y a cette mission où on se retrouve à quelques encablures du village de base, avec un gros malabar blanc dans un territoire tribal de maisons sur pilotis qui ressemble aux zoos humains des années 1930, à piller les cahutes, tuer les poules, récupérer des idoles qui ont l’air d’avoir 20 siècles, et de se faire attaquer par des infectés (les Majinis) avec des boucliers en bois peints et des sagaies. Ce passage du jeu m’a semblé bien plus problématique que la polémique qui avait fait du bruit à l’époque. Et je me souviens aussi qu’à la sortie de RE4, il y avait déjà eu des remous à propos de l’Espagne. Ici, ce qui a dû limiter les risques de plaintes est sans doute qu’aucun pays n’est nommé et officiellement personne n’est visé. Par ailleurs, mais je me trompe peut-être, n’est-ce pas le seul RE où l’on ne sait pas dans quel pays se situe l’action ? Il y a aussi ce chapitre où l’on se retrouve dans un temple à la Indiana Jones. Non seulement ça n’a rien à faire dans un RE mais j’en suis venu à me dire qu’en fait les développeurs ont peut-être confondu les cultures d’Afrique de l’Ouest, comme l’empire malien du Moyen Âge, avec celles des Mayas ou des Incas d’Amérique du Sud. [...] 

Dans tous les cas, je ne conseille pas ce jeu. Il y a des signes qui ne trompent pas : le fait de ne plus supporter de suivre les cinématiques, de faire en sorte de ne plus entendre l’ambiance sonore, et mon impatience pour terminer l’ensemble face à un boss débilisant me font clairement penser que ce jeu est juste raté. [...] Quitte à choisir, le meilleur compromis entre action, exploration et survie reste sans doute le premier RE Revelations je pense.

21690,147202296,76561198805875388,0,3,1557,0,1443,1695912313,"I have only played this game on single player, and that is what I care about, so read this review based on that. The game is actually in general a good game, but some very key aspects make it borderline unplayable and incredible frustrating at times, especially once things get tense towards the end. Most of these problems are due to the port as far as I know, and some are not present in co-op mode, which again I don't care about.

The game's controls have huge problems. First there is this annoying, pointless reload shortcut button called Reload 1. When you press Run+Aim together, you reload your gun. Why this is present is beyond me, as you can just press R to reload. It only makes it frustrating, because when you are running and reflexively aim your gun at stressful situations you will stand still while your character reloads and probably die. You can't turn this annoying feature off. The game doesn't let you for some reason.

The second problem is Sheva herself. She can make your game unwinnable at times. For example you can't switch weapons with her during the game, and she will sometimes take dumb decisions, or sometimes none at all. If she has the rifle for example and you have the Shotgun, she may never fire at an enemy far away, you are just a target practice at this point. Commands you give her don't seem to work when this happens, she still won't fire. And yes she has ammo.

Again at some parts, your winning is beyond your control due to Sheva's AI. There are instances where you get seperated and you can not do anything about her dying. This problem comes up rarely but boy does it hit hard when it comes. At the Wesker fight the whole annoying fight was like basically reloading until a good dice comes. It was beyond my control if Sheva died or not, as I can not reach her in time to revive her. Sometimes she dies, sometimes she doesn't. Very annoying when she dies when you are doing good on your own. The fight is already frustrating due to the quicktime problem, and on top of that there is this.

Another problem apparently coming with the port is the Quicktime buttons. Only played this at hard mode, but the period you can press the buttons on the screen are very limited, like shorter than a second? And the keys you have to press is terrible in keyboard, F+V, are you kidding me? How can I switch my left hand from WASD, press F and V at the same time in a second, especially when I am not expecting it? It won't change if I change V to any other key, besides sometimes it will also switch A+D so I can't just put my hand on F+V at the ready. You made this stupid mistake in Resident Evil 4, and you still did not learn. Unbelievable. On top of that, I have heard Console version is way easier, which is extremely unfair and pointless to add to PC. 

Shame, because outside of these problems the game is quite good. Not very Resident Evil-like, but still fun and rewarding. But sorry I can't recommend this game to singe PC players.",1695903318,1695903318,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I anxiously await a remaster for this game like they've done for every installment up until this. Now granted I was never into the ""Resident Evil"" series at the time, I just personally like this game specifically. However, I have played through the entirety of 7 and since initially leaving this review I'm now on new game plus, max difficulty of the 4 remake on PS5, which has been amazing. For your understanding I will be laying this out as how the remaster could be better and using the RE4 remaster for comparison as they feel largely similar on mechanics and some co-op elements. So every time I mention RE4 I am referring to the remaster, not the 2004 original. I also had the bulk of my hours when it originally came out on PS3, in case you looked at my play-time a little funny.
This RE5 is frequently on sale for about 5$ so get it when you can. Now into the meat:

The game's difficulty, writing, controls and of course graphics are all certainly dated. The game came out in 2009! Fights on paper are very very easy as I've been replaying on max difficulty through til about half the game so far. Only difficulty increase is in the health enemies have and damage they deal, which can be obnoxious as one of the games fundamentals is ammo management. I also want to say that the fights aren't even bad, it's just that the fighting is the focus of the game-play. Adding more horror and puzzle elements to the remaster will make everything feel more well-rounded and traditional to the usual Resident Evil formula that most fans want.
(The DLC did well on this with a semi-short puzzle based prologue ending in a ""fight"" with Wesker. This should've just been the start of the game to be honest as it added nothing new story wise.)
 
Controls are very interesting and take getting used to in that in order to shoot you have to right click and aim. When aiming you cannot walk. Feels like maybe some idea they had to pad out fight sequences, not sure. Your mouse sensitivity also lowers dramatically while moving versus standing still. These two things together make it feel like your controlling a tank. There is a quick turn option but this also feels unfortunately slow at times.

The story that you're a part of feels weak. Chris and Sheva's interactions are few from a lack of downtime to talk making their relationship feel entirely forced when factored into a dramatic  scene. The remaster would benefit from a marginally slower pace to give these two more time to shine as actual characters instead of being simple hosts for the player and Sheva being attractive. Better puzzles, again, would help with this.

The entire game is online co/op! This is both good and bad. I feel the modern game landscape desperately needs some fresh multiplayer co/op story titles. With this game if you don't have a buddy, the partner is controlled by an AI with the IQ of a bullfrog. Thankfully there are really cool mechanics to navigate this AI for you. You can open both character inventories to request the others items or give them your items independently. You can also at anytime hold Q to have your camera directed at your partners position so you don't get lost. You can press V to call your partner to move their ass if you need help with a door, getting a zombie off you, etc. The partner can then press V in return to acknowledge the request. All pretty neat, just the AI itself needs some improvements. 

I actually REALLY like this game's unique inventory system. Pressing E will open up a 3x3 grid with all your goodies. Each slot can be quick swapped to by pressing the respective number on the top row of your keyboard. Healing items do not stack and everything you carry goes somewhere. However no matter the size, it only takes one slot. I prefer this over the other remakes where you have to fit them based on size into a much larger grid. Tacky trend IMO. Though I do wish there was one separate slot for vests. It wouldn't take up your normal inventory, but you'd only be able to wear one. RE4 basically did the same, but with durability bars which I think is fair. Carrying a stun baton should also replace your machete.

All in all, the game is OLD and it shows. It needs a lot of help, but the base and potential is there for an amazing co/op game in the modern day. I still have fun with this after all these years and would give anything to see it brought to a greater place. As I mentioned before the game is often on sale for about 5$ so if you can  look past these problems I DO recommend you playing it, probably with a friend.",1690426650,1695227168,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is similar to the original RE 4, but the movement is quite a bit better. When Sheva's AI decides to work, she's pretty helpful (and great at healing you).

The story builds off of characters introduced in the first game, but it's still understandable if you (like me) haven't played it.

I recommend checking it out if you're into the series, but try to get a friend or two to help as the default AI just doesn't cut it when it matters.

Below are my reviews of the content from the Untold Stories DLC.

==Lost in Nightmares==
Having to fight Wesker for a third time after already going through 2 infinitely frustrating forms in the main story is absolutely dreadful. I should've know it would happen, but at the same time I thought it'd just play the cutscene to spare us from the pain.

Other than that (and me missing 1 goddamn collectible, just like in RE 3) this is a neat addition to the game. Fills in what happened before the cutscene in the main game.


==Desperate Escape==
The ending of this was absolutely dreadful, but as with Lost in Nightmares it's a neat addition otherwise.

Not sure why they'd introduce Doug only to kill him off like 10 minutes later, but I guess they didn't wanna retcon the ending or something.

I guess it's worth a shot if you wanna find out what happens, but be prepared for an awful gauntlet of an ending.

If you have someone to play the game in coop with, I'm sure you'll have good time with it.
But if you're playing solo...eh...not so much.

First of all, this is an action game, with forgettable story and characters. (Except 2, they're memorable for entirely different reasons)

[spoiler]Wesker[/spoiler]what's not to love about him? He's so over the top and goofy that he's, honestly, the best part of the game. Shame he's not in it that much...

Sheva... oh dear lord Sheva... She's memorable alright. She is by far the scariest part of the game. Nope, not the monsters which range from giant to tentacle and to giant tentacle variety. No, she is. I had to several times run way from the npc who is supposed to assist me, purely because the moment you sneezed she would waste a healing item on you.
 (Or herself, that didn't happen to me much because I didn't give her ""good"" healing items. The exception to that would be when she would B-line to a green herb I didn't see, then rush towards me to heal and ""boo-boo"" my health bar had.)

Also, the lack of a merchant type character like in RE4 not only breaks the immersion, but also makes the experience not as special. 
Furthermore, the inventory system is straight up bad. Both you and your partner have 9 inventory slots in total. So, let's say both of you decide to run with 2 guns, 2 healing items and 1 armour item. That in total is 5 slots taken out of 9. That problem was made slightly easier in me playing solo because I would just use Sheva as an item mule, but even still there were times in the game I would definitely feel the lack of inventory space. And no, it doesn't turn this action game into a horror game, it's just tedious.

So, after complaining so much, what did I like besides that 1 character? I liked when the game ended. No, this isn't a sarcastic remark, the last few hours of the game were actually enjoyable, culminating in the last boss fight which was so over the top I just couldn't help myself smile. 

Overall, I will give this game 2 ratings, one for coop players and one for solo players. It was also a bit of a pain in the butt to setup due to Windows Live which I am not sure if it's still required by the game or not.
I am still going to recommend it because I did enjoy it at the end, but it is certainly not a game I will revisit anytime soon. 

-If you have a coop partner, I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience as it's a decently fun shooter. 7-10

-If you're playing solo, I wouldn't blame you if you decide to drop the game before rolling the credits.

I would forgive myself were they mere daydreams at the back of my head at any given moment, but these are not mere passive thoughts; these active machinations of the mind keep me chained to the mines, picking away at the internet like maggots upon a carcass, squeezing out every nutrient, every bit of sustenance that is Albert Wesker content. What is there to say about him? My adoration may be unhealthy, and he may be the type of man to kill me upon meeting me. Nonetheless, my love for him extends beyond any reason, any words. To encapsulate this feeling would be impossible and to attempt would be futile. The only reason to pen words such as these is to express my love in a tangible way. When one desires the intangible, one will do whatever they can do to make it physical in some form. Reading this means that this concept, this idea of my doting regarding Wesker, is touching the mind of another in a way I could only dream of.

When my heart beats, I imagine that it is his heart beating alongside me that causes mine to palpitate. When I blink, I see him staring back at me when all I can view is the blackness beneath my eyelids. When I breathe, I have the idea that perhaps it would smell a little sweeter if he, too, breathed the oxygen I indulged in. Without him, there is a void in my heart, an Albert Wesker-shaped hole. My life is not lived and my paths are not trekked are they not to be shared with Wesker. If I could hold his hand, I would do so every step of this rocky road. Life is meaningless on its own, thus, one must forge their own meaning, and without Wesker, I am unable to do so, for he is my Alpha and Omega, my beginning and my end. The day his concept fizzles out and disappears from consciousness is the day I too shall die.

Question me not, for if you do, you shall not receive an answer. There is none that I can provide that would properly explain my affection toward a man so cruel and heartless. While his actions are terrible, I excuse them with my southward moral compass as it is the man I love behind them. A million could die and I would not care if Wesker was the cause. A billion could die and I would love Wesker all the same. If the two of us were the last on Earth and it were him behind the slaughter, I would find it so endearing that I'd likely resign myself to his love for a few decades more. Even killing me would be something I would forgive him for. In fact, I would be grateful that he would give me the time of day to kill me at all. Were it his hands wrapped around my throat- his gloved digits squeezed tight- that strangled me until I would not face any tomorrow, I would finally go down happy and fulfilled. My dreams are something I cannot achieve, but with each piece of media I consume with him within it, I feel a bit more whole.

Anyway, Resident Evil 5 is fine I guess, thanks for fixing local co-op and game launch, Capcom! Whichever intern was behind that should get a raise AND a pat on the back. I applaud their craftsmanship. The game is fun to play with friends, and as long as you have a Sheva to accompany your Chris, it's worth buying Gold Edition.

Pros:
-Unique take on inventory management
-Faster paced than other RE games
-Upgrade system is very satisfying and buying non-upgrades is actually useful
-Visiting other chapters is nice for new game+
-High replayability post campaign

Cons:
-AI is absolutely AWFUL! So bad that I actually discourage playing the main campaign without a friend.
-Inventory management is clunky when transferring between partners
-Bosses are boring in the beginning chapters
-Melee attacks, other than stomp, feel very weak and/ do minimal damage. Also, your partner can stun you by mistake which makes for some frustrating deaths with insta-kill enemies.

But seriously, I cannot stress enough how awful the AI in this game is. Half of your strategy involves how to ensure your partner will not DIE but also not waste a metric ton of ammo and heals. Quite the conundrum and not a good one. If you don't have friends, I'd advise against playing veteran difficulty.

However, despite the issues, when playing with a friend or playing at a lower difficulty, the game is actually really fun and has high replayability. Don't torture yourself for this game by playing veteran solo. It's not worth it. Swallow the pride and go normal difficulty.",1693883176,1693883176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

21690,145509275,76561197998835516,0,75,1222,0,1222,1693509486,"Resident evil 5 is an action adventure game. As usual in the franchise, you will be dealing with biologically mutated hostile entities, the results of unscrupulous corporate research – summed up much nicer in the actual Japanese title for the franchise - biohazard. It is intended to be played as a co-op game. If you play it in singleplayer mode, like I did, your partner will be controlled by the AI. It won’t be as intelligent as a fellow human, but the game can be completed this way too. Just switch off friendly fire, Sheva likes to waltz into your fireline. There will be a lot of environment types in the game, and the developers got creative with setups to spice up the encounters. While I wouldn’t say the ammo will be abundant, you won’t have to be judicious in its use either. As such the game is closer to a standard shooter than a survival horror. Reading the documents will unveil a coherent lore throughout the game, taking into account some core information from previous games.

I played the game on normal difficulty. The lesser enemies will be reasonably forgiving on that difficulty, but some boss fights were quite lengthy and I had to retry some of them several times. I even had to look up solutions for some online, as I couldn’t figure out how to deal for example with an endlessly regenerating one. 

The graphics of the game is good. The models and the textures are the same as in the 2009 game, which just shows how stellar graphics it had back in those days. The remaster added only a few extras to the game, like higher resolution, better shadows or supporting higher framerates. Some cutscenes will be rendered at a predetermined resolution, if you play on high resolution you will observe a downgrade during those. Not sure about the other languages, but the cutscenes were lip synched with the English language.

The voice acting in the game is reasonably good. This time I played with the English voices, since there will be combat remarks, and I didn’t want to read those during combat. In fact I just switched off the subtitles altogether. The music is also good. There will be a clear danger music playing when there are still enemies in the field. When that music stops, you can explore without zombie interference. The sound effect of the weapons were adequate too.

The game can be played with a controller or with keyboard and mouse. Since there will be a lot of aimed shots, I opted for the keyboard and mouse. Either way, to get used to the archaic control scheme takes an adjustment period. Don’t give up right at the beginning if you find it horrible. What irritated me the most is the rooting in place when shooting/reloading/melee. In either of those situations you won’t be able to move, which is jarring especially for melee, as you cannot close the distance if you start it too far.

There is a toggleable minimap in the upper right corner of the screen. After the initial level I toggled it off, the maps were easy to navigate even without it, and exploring without the minimap felt more immersive for me.

The game has autosaves only. There are two kinds, checkpoints and (hard) saves. If you exit after a checkpoint, you loose all your progress since your last save. Those saves are fairly far spaced, there were maps where it took me 40+ minutes to reach the next savepoint. Starting a new sub-chapter (like 4-2) will add an option to play from that point any time from a chapter selection screen. There you can change the difficulty if you wish, or hunt for some emblem, as the number of the missing ones will be displayed. I kept an eye out for those, still missed most of them during my playthrough.

The inventory system is very restricting, forcing you to strategize your loadout. There are only 9 inventory slots. Each weapon uses up one, and each weapon ammo stacks to a smallish amount in other ones. Grenades take up a slot stacking up till 5. Healing items takes slots too. Speaking of them, there will be green and red herbs. Both of them will be scarce on the field. Green herb heals up only around 20% of health, if you combine it with a red herb then it will heal 100%. My end game loadout was 3 guns, 3 ammo slots for them, 2 protective vests for Chris and the stun rod, completely filling up my inventory. The stun rod can be bought in the shop, a lot of players overlook it. In most games such powerful items are restricted in use by charge mechanics, but strangely not here, even if scarcity should be a core gameplay element. Buy it when it becomes available, makes the melee combat much easier, and since it has infinite charge you won’t have to worry about dealing with recharge.

One infuriating thing about the inventory is the lack of free control of your partner. I cannot make Sheva drop anything from her inventory. There is a green herb to be picked up, I’m full, she is full. Lets drop some random grenades she picked up, to free up a slot for that much needed herb. Nope. Another case is when I use her to pick up a new weapon. We are facing a though enemy, I’m already out of ammo, so I have free slots. Will she give me that fully loaded grenade launcher I trusted on her. Nope.

There will be a lot of weapon types, and even within a type there will be several alternatives. During my play for example I have collected 4 versions of submachine guns. Each weapon can be upgraded, but in a standard playthrough you will have enough currency for only 4 weapons at most. I left the pistol to Sheva, and used the submachine gun, shotgun, sniper gun for Chris. I tried too keep those weapons upgraded as higher upgrades were unlocked for them, but didn’t have enough money to keep them fully upgraded. Eventually both received the stun rod too.

There is a cover system – but only at some clearly marked spots, by white and red stripes. They can be found generally in zones where there are enemies with guns, and in those cases they should be used. 
The game is quite forgiving for turtling up during these encounters. While most times you have to clear zones to proceed, there will be some cases when running through/past enemies is a valid solution too. In particular, you should just run past crocodiles, as fighting them is just a waste of ammo, for no gain.

After finishing the game, a new game+ mode is unlocked, where you start with your already gathered equipment, and can choose Sheva as the player controlled member if you wish. Also only after finishing the game you get access to the two minicampaign DLC’s included in the Gold version. Lost in nightmares is a short exploration in a mansion, supposedly the one from Resident evil 1. But since it doesn’t save after quit, I only played it for an hour, and didn’t bother to replay that content again to finish it (I later looked it up, made to around 75% of the content). Desperate escape is a stroll through constantly regenerating enemies, took me a bit over an hour, with a restart in easy mode after my swift failure on normal. The mercenaries reunion is a short timer countdown encounter, the more enemies you kill during that the better. The countdown can be extended by picking up items or with special takedowns.

There are some mods for the game on nexus, mostly replacing (or removing) the clothing of the protagonists. I didn’t install any of those, the standard clothing felt immersive enough.

I kinda liked this game, despite its archaic controls. While normally after finishing one game I look up related games in a franchise, I didn’t have to this time. I had already bought the remake of Resident evil 2 and 3 even before playing this game, and look ahead to play them in the future. But since I researched a bit about this game, I found out it was a huge financial success.

But the absolute best of this game is the coop mode. The game remains a blast of the past. 14 years and i keep coming back to play another playthrough with another friend who has never experienced this absolute gem of a game. I wish they'd make a remake of this like they did with Resident Evil 4, keep the coop mode and they would have something to play and meme about boulder punching for another 14 years.

First off, most aspects of this game are a step down from previous entries in the series (looking at you Resident Evil 4), and has far more action than horror elements. The combat feels clunky due to not being able to move when shooting weapons. While some of the boss fights are good (namely the final Wesker fight and one of the Uroboros), a few are downright terrible. Some of the chapters are not great, but the ones that succeed are amazing. 

In the positives, there are a wide selection of weapons you can pick in this game. Snipers, smgs, magnums, you name it and Resident Evil 5 probably has it. The game is also pretty hard on a first playthrough, since ammo and healing items are limited. Enemy variety is decent, and the co-op in this game is the real deal. It's a great game to play with friends despite the various faults I mentioned earlier. 

In short, this game feels a bit unpolished and still manages to be fun. There's nothing like getting infinite ammo for the magnum and watching every enemy get melted in one hit. I will say that I bought this game when it was on sale and $5. At that price, it's worth it. $20 might be pushing my recommendation a bit far. Overall, buy it if it's on sale.

You get stuck between wall and boss monster and stupid AI stays near you makes boss attack you forever while you are stuck. this will makes you mad, but beside that, it's fun.

The map exploration, puzzles and action all balanced each other very well. The controls weren't hard to navigate (at least on PC) and other than that one boss you have to kill with a rocket launcher the patterns for defeating the bosses are easy to figure out. The characters are cool, the scenery is nice, and the voice acting is good (ESPECIALLY WESKER! He has the same VA as Yoshikage Kira isnt that cool?) I usually hate replaying video games but I have to get Wesker in Mercenaries and I need that man like a fish needs water.

It is a straight up successor to RE4 in game play; Find treasures, upgrade guns, kill RE style enemies and bosses, occasional ""action button"" scenes. You can certainly get multiple play throughs out of this game. 1 for the story, 2 for the guns, and 3 for speed runs.

Unfortunately the multiplayer for this game is moronic. It will allow you to jump in a quick match with strangers easily, but if you wanted to play this game privately with a friend, it just doesn't do that, which is a shame because while this game is worth a play through alone, the real charm of it comes from cutting through it with a buddy. The store page actually does list it as ""single player"" (as of 7/29/2023). 

Also, while the new game + feature is great, lets say you wanted to create a new save to start a fresh play through. Get ready for some rigmarole because there is no in game way to do that. Hopefully you have some IT skills or are good at watching how-to youtube videos.

I do think this game is underrated, ""if"" Capcom does remake this amazing title they will need to do it right (maybe even bring D.C Douglas back as Wesker) story wise it is entirely carried by Chris and Wesker, characters like Irving are campy but not in an annoying way.

1. Good coop (play with friends) game

Cons:
1. Bad survival horror game. Less item management skills needed. Can just play one of the level, collect ammo, not killing all the zombies and quit half way, then the ammo collected is in your ""item management"" page
2. Not horror enough for either a ""Resident Evil"" game or a survival horror game.

The times it does take place a night does't really feel like night. At one part of the game you must play through a boring vehicle turret section that is just one wave after another of the same cannon fodder. After that a boss fight that you have to do the same thing 3 times with no variation.

You have a constant partner character Sheva that is either controlled by AI or another player. The AI is a joke with just to commands follow (cover) where she just follows you around and barely attacks anything even when the player is getting absolutely hammered. You also have attack where she is a bit more active but not much. Whether controlled by AI or another player it completely destroys any really sense of horror atmosphere at the few times there actually is any. Sheva should have been Jill since its about fighting Wesker but the top execs at Capcom would never allow that as it needs to be as open to new players as possible. Even though you could easily do that with Jill as you just do a previously cutscene and maybe have some game play. The way it is done doesn't help new comers anyway.

Speaking of giving a back story to the events leading up to Resident Evil 5 after Resident Evil 4 you have to pay for that. Don't bother. Lazy uninspired DLC which is poorly ported from the Xbox 360.

The level design, story, dialog, etc is very uninspired, lazy and lacklustre. A number of things feel very much copied from RE4. I can't say I'm surprised as I suspect this isn't the game the developers wanted to make but execs, execs, execs.

This isn't Resident Evil.

Capcom didn't learn from this and instead made Resident Evil 6 which is even worse.

Basically don't buy this and instead save you money and go buy RE4 either original or remake. Not this lazy  rubbish. Its a shame as I think it could have been a great game if execs weren't obsessed with money.",1688500593,1688500593,False,1,3,0.477419346570968628,0,True,False,False

Completed story mode several times, and still playing Mercenaries to this day. Decent linear story, most of the visuals still hold up, and there's a bunch of little things on the side to occupy your attention. 
Unfortunately, I've only briefly played one other Resident Evil game, and that's 6. As such, I cannot compare this game to other RE installments. The pros and cons listed are simply for this game. 

--Pros--

-Weapons. Handguns, magnums, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, ROCKET LAUNCHERS-- ahem. Whether you like hitting enemies at a distance or prefer being right up in their grills, there's a gun for you, and several different versions of that gun. There's three different hand grenades, a grenade launcher that can fire six types of grenades, and exclusive weapons for both characters. Eventually, you can even get yourself infinite ammo for your favorite guns.
-Enemies. Every new chapter brings new types of baddies to stomp. 
-Soundtrack. It's pretty good! Sad But True, Winds of Madness, and don't even get me started on Majini In Flames.
-The Mercenaries. A fun way to show hordes of zombies who's the boss. You unlock levels and characters as you go, which doesn't take very long. Each character comes with a preset inventory, and each level has it's own big bad guy you have to contend with. For certain levels, multiple big bads will spawn, increasing the difficulty.
-No Mercy. A solo-player version of TM with increased spawn rate. An absolute blast (literally, if you can find the rocket launchers!) 
-Boss designs. Grotesque abominations. Super cool.
-Stupid sexy Wesker.

--Cons--

-The combat system. Whether you're using a gun or a knife, you're forced to stand still. Getting accustomed to this can be difficult if you're used to games that allow you to run and gun. 
-Inventory. In between chapters, you can purchase items from the store and organize them into a decently sized storage. In-game, you're limited to nine slots for storing equipment and ammo. You can organize this however you want (and re-organize when using ladders and ziplines, super convenient lol). Treasures do not take up any of these slots, but certain levels bombard you with stuff that quickly fills up your inventory. 
-A.I. Sheva, I'm barely hurt, don't use that herb, NO NO NO-
If you're playing solo, your A.I. partner can generally hold their own and usually not die. But don't ever let them have herbs. They will be used on you if you take the slightest bit of damage, and now you've just found a red herb, which could've been combined with the green herb that Sheva jUST USED arwhtvoukgbawfikscknhac.
-Mercenaries inventory. This one is more personal preference than anything. You can't rearrange where each item is located in your inventory until you're in-game. 
-No frames. I love playing No Mercy, but if your RAM sucks like mine, you can kiss your frames goodbye. 
-Reapers. I shudder just thinking about them.
-Spoiler. Chris punching a rock. 
-I cannot face backwards in elevators on PC. This is a complete and total travesty.

Anyway, give RE5 a try if you want! I haven't regretted playing it all these years, it has a special place in my heart since it's something my brother and I enjoy playing together. Have a good day ;D",1688497780,1688497780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved this game and played it back and forth multiple times, unlocking all the best weapons and even doing some speedrunning to unlock the infinite ammo RPG.

Unfortunately, it's not 2009 anymore. Fresh off my playthroughs of RE8, RE4: Remake, and RE4: Original, I decided to dive headfirst into RE5, and... I can't finish it. This game just doesn't provide a quality experience that's worth my time anymore.

Let me emphasize something. In March/April, I played through RE4 Remake, then RE4 Original, and then did an entire play-through of RE4 Remake again. They're longer games than RE5, but I STILL couldn't bring myself to beat RE5. I'm a fan of these games; I'm not here to tell you that I don't like the arcadey-shooty action, but I am here to tell you that this is probably the worst RE game, with 6 not considered because I haven't played that one.

Let's begin with the gameplay in particular; despite being a sequel to RE4, it somehow feels clunkier. Weapons like the shotgun lack their weight and wide spread from RE4, and melee attacks are much worse at crowd control, making it much easier for enemies to frame trap you in the animation and hit you immediately afterwards. The inventory is frustratingly limited, with 19 slots shared between two players, but you can't drop items; weapons and ammo take up entire slots, so you'll have at least 12 slots dedicated to weapons and ammo. Leaving only six slots for consumables or additional ammo slots. Not to mention you can't drop items, so the manic trading and fiddling you'll have to do just to get a red and green herb into one person's inventory so they can combine them is ridiculous. If you want to wear armor or hold grenades, That's another slot, too.

Your AI companion may be the dumbest AI companion in gaming; Sheva has literally stood there and stared at me throughout the entire dying state before. There were three times where I fought entire boss encounters and she didn't fire a single bullet, and she would often ignore combo melee attacks at crucial times. The AI is also hard countered by the chainsaw boss' rampage, causing me to get two game overs in a row despite not getting hit a single time in either boss attempt, and due to adaptive difficulty, the game was suddenly dumbed down on the third attempt, and I don't enjoy that at all. They're also just not coded very well, so often they would cancel their action to loot a nearby object, or they'd refuse to use the right weapon for the job, instead prioritizing always using the pistol. I had to force them to run out of pistol ammo just so they would use some of their 40 rifle ammo, only for them to start aggressively picking up every handgun ammo drop in the level.

Level design feels very uninspired, Instead of set pieces it feels like a lot of similar, boxy rooms filled with a horde of enemies that funnel in from one direction. Later on it becomes a cover shooter with gun zombies, yeah, seriously. This game somehow feels like a slog to play, even if it's quite short. My 7 hours of playtime were broken up over about 5 play sessions over weeks because there was never a hook to keep me playing or excited compared to past RE titles. A few highlight areas are the marshlands and the pitch-black mine, but such set pieces are few and far between, and are brought down by incredibly boring puzzle sections like the mirror puzzle in the ruins. 

The game also heavily features on-rails turret segments and QTEs, and... they're not great. Particularly the QTE bindings, how am I supposed to quickly press F + V when my fingers are on WASD? RE4 may have had QTEs but they weren't overly aggressive and had better bindings than this. 

I'd also like to bring some attention to the story and cut scenes, which are a massive step down from the original RE4. With low video and audio quality, some of these cutscenes are just shockingly bad, and not in a campy, fun way. 
When the protagonists are being morons and refusing to shoot a war criminal, Irving, that has killed thousands of people, who's vulnerable and right in front of them, I'm left a little confused and frustrated. I've shot people so many people during gameplay, why am I giving this guy an opportunity? Then when they're dying, Chris even feels sympathetic for them afterwards, sympathetic for a man that catalysed the deaths of 1,000s with potentially billions next. It leaves me in complete disbelief at the low quality of the writing. 
Chris is a personality black hole in this one, but Sheva is honestly a good character even if her design is pushing it in terms of being too sexualized over practical function. I liked Wesker, but with every year that passes, his entire character archetype only ages worse. The game is fortunate that it's just self-aware enough to not be cringe. It's also a story about how colonialism is bad while using a lot of racist tropes, such as implying the tribals are savages or giving them generic Native American war cries. The fact that there isn't a bigger emphasis on how the Africans that were used as a test bed for this zombie outbreak are the real victims in this kind of situation makes the story collapse into itself. And while I appreciate that's not really what RE5 is going for, it still went places it really didn't need to, mostly out of ignorance.

I can see how this game could be fun if you have a friend you can bounce off of; I really do, but everything is more fun with friends, and as a single-player experience, I can't begin to recommend this.

I'd give the original RE4 a 9/10, but RE5 is more like a 5 or 6/10. 
And this rating makes sense, RE4 was built with a lot of time and care. It had so much talent and loved poured into it that not even the remake over a decade later can best it in every area. RE5 was likely made with tighter time constraints with fewer of the talented staff that worked on RE4. Sorry if I've mentioned RE4 a lot in this review, but it's important to recognise how similar these two games are, but how a lot of insidious changes can make or break a game. 

I hope they don't remake this.",1686997295,1686997295,False,3,0,0.499896317720413208,0,True,False,False

This is where the series really derails, turning from mostly grounded horror survival to Micheal Bayesque action shlock. There is no real craft–heaven forbid masterpiece status–to be found here. It is unabashedly a time sinker–a total distraction that offers no stimulation. Only mindless fun allowed. The world building in the previous games of eerie notes and forgotten journals has been turned into a dozen novellas spread throughout the game. They jam so much backlogged text into one journal, I ended up skipping through it. Well that and I do not care what's happening here at all.

RE5 comes off heavily influenced by Tomb Raider: Legend and Tomb Raider: Anniversary, except without the puzzles and problem solving. Likewise, the exploration puzzles of the previous games in the Resident Evil series have been abandoned for, “See that switch? Press it. Congrats, kid.”

The antagonistic forces come from the mind of a middleschooler bored in study hall: giant ogres with corpses hanging from his loincloth, flying bat slugs, and a man that grows into a Biblically sized leviathan in 15 seconds due to a shot. (The law of conservation of mass is a victim of political assassination from Capcom.) I get a kick outta some lame goon named Irving who sounds like a 1930s gangster from a Saturday morning cartoon. And while I wouldn’t call the game’s portrayal of Africa and its peoples overtly racist, it certainly is dated even by 2009 standards. It falls back on negative cartoonish stereotypes and brings about scenarios reminiscent of colonialism.
 
Lastly, the story really starts to get confusing and kitschy, possibly relying on side games to know what’s going on. Did I miss something? I can't say for certain. Matrix derivatives and slow-mo are everywhere. What happened to this series? I guarantee this is Paul W. S. Anderson’s favorite as the next of his sloppy fanfic films to release after this borrows heavily from it. Stupid loves stupidity I suppose.

But by about the time the game is over, you'll be relived. Too much dummy fun is not good for the brain. Oh what joy.

edit: At how poorly designed the final boss of this game is, I've switched recommendation to a no. If you move the infamous punching bag boulder too soon, it breaks the level and you have to restart. Sometimes the cut scene to continue with the next segment doesn't happen. Restart. Other times, it happens instantly without you doing anything. And once the heft of the battle begins, it is a boring grind of shoot and move ad nauseam. You and your partners will run out of bullets and guess what? Time to restart. Brave choice to let the interns design the final part of the game.",1686607505,1686758820,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Easily one of my comfort RE games. It's definitely different than RE1,2,3 and 4~, but man. The co-op feature is amazing with friends, and the overall goofiness of it completes it.

I can understand how some RE fans can have problems with this game. It strides very far from the usual ""horror"" and slow pacing from the previous games of the franchise... I would describe it as highly entertaining, captivating, overflowing with content and collectibles ; it's harmless fun along with non-stop action thrown at you, and all you can do is sit back and enjoy yourself!

21690,139944724,76561199487692522,0,2,1338,0,1311,1707477206,"One of the standout features of Resident Evil 5 is its stunning graphics and detailed environments. From sun-drenched African villages to dark and foreboding underground caverns, the game presents a diverse range of settings that immerse players in the haunting atmosphere. The attention to detail in character design and animations is commendable, adding to the overall sense of realism.

The gameplay in Resident Evil 5 strikes a delicate balance between survival horror and action-oriented combat. Players take control of Chris Redfield, a familiar face in the Resident Evil universe, and his partner Sheva Alomar, as they investigate a sinister bio-terrorism plot. The addition of cooperative play, both locally and online, enhances the experience, allowing players to strategize and face the challenges together. It adds an extra layer of enjoyment and makes the game even more engaging.

Combat mechanics in Resident Evil 5 are refined and responsive, providing satisfying gunplay and close-quarters combat. The game features a wide variety of weapons that can be upgraded and customized, allowing players to tailor their arsenal to suit their preferred playstyle. Facing hordes of infected enemies and terrifying boss encounters, the action sequences are intense, and the sense of danger keeps players on the edge of their seats.

While Resident Evil 5 excels in many areas, it does place less emphasis on the survival horror elements that defined earlier entries in the series. The focus on action may not appeal to purists seeking a more atmospheric and tense experience. Additionally, the AI-controlled partner, Sheva, can sometimes exhibit questionable decision-making, leading to frustrating moments during solo play.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Resident Evil 5 remains a highly enjoyable game that offers a thrilling blend of action and horror. With its impressive visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and cooperative play options, it provides an adrenaline-pumping adventure that is hard to put down. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer, Resident Evil 5 is a worthy addition to any gamer's library.

[*]Sheva’s/partner AI: when it works, it works well, when it doesn’t, it makes you want to tear your hair out. Friendly advice:[olist]
[*]Do not play on difficulties above Normal when starting from a fresh save solo. Even if you know the game as well as I do, you’ll be forced to farm ammo and money for upgrades mid-campaign on Veteran.
[*]Give the AI high damage and low rate of fire weapons, i.e. the S75 bolt action rifle is arguably the best weapon for them. The AI does a remarkable job at scoring headshots. If you unlock, and use, infinite ammo, give them a Magnum and watch them clean house.
[*]Set it to Attack/Assault mode (Gesture 1) for the AI to start running around gathering stuff from breakables, use the most powerful weapon in its disposal, and be ignored by enemies: they will focus on you instead. Be warned though, the AI will most likely ignore you entering dying mode until you perform Gesture 2 or Partner Action.
[*]Set it do Cover/Defense mode (Gesture 2)  for the opposite: the AI stays glued to you and resorts to a much less powerful (per shot) weapon. It also becomes a target for enemies.
[*]On Professional the AI is never a target for enemies.[/olist]
[*]In Desperate Escape DLC the AI is somehow even worse than the base campaign. It’s so bad that it seems as if the AI is trolling or sabotaging you. I completed it on Professional with the AI, but not without exploits and shortening my life span by a few years. Desperate Escape in general is very mediocre.
[*]Some of the chapters are rather boring and take too long, most notably chapter 4 with the underground temples.
[*]Forced turret sections. Chapter 2-3 with its savannah race and boss section will 100% be cut from the inevitable remake and the game will be better for it.
[*]Versus mode is awful and I used bots from a trainer to farm achievements since I couldn’t be bothered to force people to play it with me.
 [/list]

What I do love?
[list]
[*]Gameplay is a much more refined version of RE4 with mouse turning, strafing, expanded melee attack system, all the while retaining all of the incredible responsiveness and snappiness of Leon’s grand Spanish adventure.
[*]Inventory system is amazing for a Coop game on PC. Being able to drag and drop items at will, while performing animations, and reload weapons at the same time? Awesome. Thanks to this feature, if you’re quick enough, you’ll never ever have to see the reload animations of any weapon. Invaluable at higher difficulties and in Mercenaries. Additionally, all of the slots are assigned to number keys, making it incredibly easy and intuitive to switch between items on the fly.
[*]Graphically it holds up surprisingly well.
[*]Music is nice, especially the end credits song.
[*]The campaign, despite the mentioned chapters, is overall very well paced and doesn’t overstay its welcome. It also allows the gameplay to shine.
[*]Story wise it wraps up the primary storyline really neatly and involves the OG characters, i.e. Chris, Jill, and Wesker.
[*]WESKER!!! CHRIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
[*]Professional difficulty is built around NG+ and even with infinite ammo Magnum and Rocket Launcher you still have to remain focused since you die to a fly’s fart.
[*]Mercenaries + Mercenaries Reunion are awesome.
[*]Lost in Nightmares DLC is a great tribute to RE1R with many call backs and easter eggs.

Set in a remote African village plagued by an insidious virus, Resident Evil 5 follows the story of Chris Redfield, the protagonist from the original Resident Evil game, and his partner Sheva Alomar. Together, they must navigate treacherous environments, face hordes of aggressive enemies, and unravel a conspiracy that threatens the world.

One of the highlights of Resident Evil 5 is its stunning visuals. The game's graphics are top-notch, with detailed character models, impressive environmental designs, and breathtaking cinematic sequences. The African setting is richly portrayed, immersing players in a vibrant and dangerous world.

Gameplay-wise, Resident Evil 5 takes a departure from the series' survival horror roots and embraces a more action-oriented approach. The controls are smooth and responsive, making it easy to engage in intense firefights and execute satisfying melee attacks. The cooperative aspect is also commendable, as playing with a friend adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the gameplay.

The arsenal of weapons at your disposal is extensive, ranging from pistols and shotguns to flamethrowers and rocket launchers, although the limited and non-expandable storage quickly becomes a pain to manage. The game encourages experimentation, allowing you to customize and upgrade your weapons to suit your playstyle. The variety of enemies you encounter keeps the combat encounters fresh and challenging, requiring you to adapt your tactics accordingly.

The campaign itself is lengthy and engaging, with a mix of thrilling set pieces and pulse-pounding boss battles. The story, although not the strongest in the series, manages to hold your attention with its twists and turns. However, the game's AI-controlled partner can sometimes be a hindrance, as they occasionally make questionable decisions or get in the way during crucial moments, as such it's recommended to play with a friend in co op.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the Mercenaries mode, which offers a satisfyingly fast-paced arcade-style experience. This mode allows you to compete against the clock, racking up points by defeating enemies and chaining together stylish kills. It adds a significant amount of replay value to the game and keeps you coming back for more.

While Resident Evil 5 may not recapture the pure survival horror essence of its predecessors, it still delivers an exhilarating action experience that fans of the franchise will enjoy. Its stunning visuals, intense gameplay, and cooperative mechanics make it a worthy addition to the Resident Evil series.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 5 successfully transitions the franchise into a more action-oriented direction, delivering an adrenaline-fueled adventure with impressive graphics and addictive gameplay. Despite minor flaws, it remains an essential title for fans of the series and action gaming enthusiasts alike.",1684976701,1684976701,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I had to re-bind some controls for the controller (mainly the goofy xbox triggers), and there are a lot more bugs/removed features in this ""PC port"".

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1684855733,1684855733,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Back when I was ignorant (and unfortunately uninformed and bigoted) I played this game thinking nothing of it's messages and just enjoyed playing video games. Now thanks to modern day politics, I can now truly enjoy this game in a new light. I also Appreciated the accuracy that this setting offers, as well as the political issues that it presented which reflects a lot of our racial issues today. In Africa just like its real life counterpart there is danger around every corner for any imperialist occupier, I know this may seem problematic to some people who have pronouns in their bio but the reality is when you travle deep into the heartland of African communities, trying to gentrify marginalized communities are NOT TOLERATED as you quickly find out from the crowds of people clearly upset at Chris Redfield's presence.

Now Imagine this, you are a working middle class African male and have faced oppression throughout your entire life, and then find yourself at the mercy of some random bug eyed people who drag you into an alleyway and liberate your toxic independent thinking mind with some weird flesh parasite they regurgitate from their mouths, only to later find out that an imperialist uninfected free thinker who abuses indigenous boulders recently arrived with his British sounding traitor to gentrify your community, worst of all they consider you a byproduct of ""bio terrorism"" and also in their bigoted ways refused to ""accept your gift"". Now I for one was once taken aback at this new borg like culture when I was young and ignorant and unfortunately acted bigoted against the flesh borg's attempts to equalize me into their collective, and playing as Redfield a white outsider I found myself forced to Debate this new philosophy in a more physical manner against the act of forceful parasitical borganization.

Thankfully due to my now enlightened mindset from my critical race theory class, political science class, and gender studies. this game showed me the dangers of such notions of ""viewing a ""parasite"" that only wishes to unify everyone's differences as a whole and create a macro community around equality (while chasing down screaming naysayers to forcefully infect them) as evil"" and instead boldly put aside petty outdated things like ""free will"" and ""individualism"". In a rare subversion of story telling Wesker was not a villain and had the best of intentions for humanity as a whole to act as our grand equalizer with the Ouroboros gift, If only Wesker succeeded in his plans we as a divided humanity would have a better world free from division and oppression. I mean sure we will be a bunch of walking tentacle things but that's far from the point. True equality is embracing the tentacles of Ouroboros and embracing the macro community or a ""hivemind"" as some bigoted people would call it. I hope Capcom stays faithful to the remake of this game and showcases that mandatory hiveminds are the new way to bridge differences towards communities. I for one am for Wesker's final solution against this division we face.",1684126725,1684127990,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First off, not a horror game at all. There is just nothing scary in this.

Second off, it's just not a good game.

Inventory: The worst inventory system I have ever used. 9 slots is a rather small inventory and whilst your AI partner also has 9 slots, you have to juggle around ammo, health and guns constantly just to be able to pick up a small amount of ammo or health, it's so dumb and frustrating. Also doesn't help that the AI uses a lot of what you give it and there's no way to stop it. Also why in gods name does armor take up a slot? I'm keeping my armor in my armor??? waaaaat

Gameplay: Similar to RE4. I appreciate them adding the option for aiming to be closer to how aiming is done for third person games these days. The game is largely your standard Resident Evil affair though there are way too many gun turret segments which are incredibly dull and in the third act it sort of turns into a cover based shooter but a really terrible one.

Story: Pretty much total nonsense. Wesker is a big bad that has infected everyone with a new plagas strain for reasons and wants to infect the world with a tentacle virus cause apparently the world would be a better place. Man loves his tentai I guess.

Honestly just better to wait for them to remake it which they probably will. Hopefully they're able to improve on this as this is the only RE game I've played that I really haven't liked.",1684022055,1684022055,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

This would only be a minor inconvenience, as you can just re-join and continue playing from there, but the game doesn't consider the chapter completed for the person who has to re-join. It means we would have to beat the whole chapter two separate times if we wanted to play through the game on professional mode or achieve S ranks or obtain the infinite rocket launcher. Just a totally demoralising and discouraging bug. 
I don't see any other way to report this kind of bug so I'm writing this review in hopes that the gigachads who recently removed GFWL support, implemented split screen functionality and fixed other bugs on a game released in 2009 might see this and address the issue.

Overall, the game is an underrated gem and is amazing fun with a partner and yes, I do absolutely recommend it, despite my official rating. The controls feel natural and satisfying and the game runs really well in all other aspects except the one I stated above. The game's setting is varied and detailed and just fascinating to experience and the graphics still hold up today. Lovely, emotive music that is split perfectly between haunting ambience and heart-pounding orchestral pieces. The writing and characters are cliché and cheesy but very loveable. Classic Resident Evil. There is lots to do after beating the game and I would like to follow up with the Lost in Nightmares DLC but I can't quite justify it when I can't trust the game to hold an online connection. Or at least don't punish a player for getting disconnected! 

Perhaps the answer could be a slightly more sophisticated matchmaking system which keeps tabs on who you last played with and roughly how much progress was made with them before they got kicked out.

EDIT: We all should do... but we gonna hate it at Late game :DDD some of the boss fights just nearly impossible to solve.. they are not consistent.. For example Uroboros Mkono at Chapter 5/2 ... its just not continuing the scene.. U burn it like fck... 5 times.. 3 tentacles grows in him... which i know i should shoot (and then scene goes on.. it takes damage) u just cant :DDD no way 3 tentacles goes out... 1,5 sec...and it goes back! no way that one bastard on this Earth got the speed to shoot out 3 tentacles from 50 meters.. from close attacks u cant even see all of them.  

summarize: something grows out which is impossble to shoot in time.. and then this fight goes Infinite! 


Wesker+Jill fight  Nothing tells u wat to do... nothing tells u ""we should go away :D   guys... u can keep fight them 500 hours... nothing happens.. if u dont go up and downn.. and up again. Wat IQ bastard had this plan in a fight... where there is no Instruction. If no insturction i m like okay i shoot him somehow. -.- which u cannot do :D

===<3===
- Gameplay : 9.5/10 !!! (which is pretty good for old games! at first I thought it was gonna be a fixed camera pov! The QTE is very fun and a bit hard but not hard for me and my friends lol- even we died at some parts but it's funny! The QTE when using keyboards is sometimes confusing but not that hard, if you have a controller then you should use it lol cuz' it's better.
The boss fights aren't that hard and fun!)
- Story : 10/10 (I love Wesker lol so I give it as a 10 but it's not boring at all. If you buy the DLC too, you can play it as a Chris-Jill duo! Yay!)
- Characters : 100/10 !!! (the models are super cool and lovely! Chris is hot af and Wesker is zaddy! And Sheva- Sheva is hella hot and badass ayyyyyyyy triple smashes ;) so it's a yes for me)

****
- Warning!! ; if you don't have any friends to play with, it would be annoying and hard cuz' Sheva bot is stupid. I'm telling the truth cuz' when I first played alone, Sheva keeps blocking my vision when I'm shooting the zombie ;/ so I would recommend to play it with friends lol. The game would be a lot better and fun ;)
****
===<3===
So buy it! and play it with friends! Idk why ppl don't like this game. I love it and I almost finished this game <33
I will wait for the remake for this game in da future. I hope they still do the co-op! Peace!

The AI is so bad, it can't combine any herbs, and it sometimes doesn't help, in one mission, I could take two different paths, one is getting up and Running away from Lickers, and the other was just defending the guy who went up, now I chose the path to defend the AI because the AI was too dumb to Protect me, but I saw my Playthrough before that there were like 12 grenade launcher acid rounds, which are huge for damage. So after I went there I wanted to get up again to get those rounds because the ai doesn't pick up anything, but the AI just didn't want to help me activate the Elevator again, if I was playing this with someone else it was easily possible but the AI just downright refused to do it. Also, Ammo/Gun management for the ai sucks balls. 

the game might be fun if you play it coop but solo it's bad. Sometimes there is more action in cutscenes than in the game itself, the bosses are boring as hell, generally, the first half of the game was boring af, I don't even know what to say. The story was okay tho. Everything this game do does RE4 Better, The inventory system the atmosphere, the Enemy/boss Design, etc, the only thing this game does better is the PC port being smoother as it is a PS3 game and not a GC game, it has better graphics and more satisfying animations, otherwise, RE4 is way better than this. IDK why the fuck Jill looks not even close to how she looked in RE3 to this lmao.

There were also some good parts, the end of the game was pretty good, Weskers Boss fight, and Last boss fight was good, except for every other boss in the game all pretty bad, Especially the one with the Flamethrower which took me like 20Min to beat, that was the most boring boss fight I ever had, I liked the free roam Mission with the boat, and I also liked the Zombies getting guns and I Could take cover and take them out, was refreshing but otherwise bad. 4.5/10

The first DLC: Lost in Nightmares, is Probably the best content in the game, but the Wesker boss fight was trash, with an Instant Death move, the AI would be able to stop that move, but it doesn't do that. So yeah you can just spam A and B the whole time as soon as the Animation starts and you can always 100% dodge. Otherwise great atmosphere, nice puzzles, and the monster you fight is also pretty cool, I liked it and it shows if Capcom Tries even with the RE5 Action game engine, it can be a good horror game. 7.5/10

The Second DLC: Desperate Escape, is just Trash, infinite zombie spawn, and guys that shoot at you with rockets. It's just bad and no fun. 2/10

There is absolutely nothing special, unique, or standout in the way this game plays as a game. Basically just you and your partner enter an area and clear it of enemies before advancing to the next zone clearing it of all the enemies and repeating again and again with the occasion quick time event and boss fight. If you just look at it as an army shooter like gears of war or army of two and consider the time it came out its a decent game. Not better than either of the previously mentioned from the same era, but decent. However when you look at it as a Resident Evil game and consider the six previous installments that came out before it ( one through four, the prequel, and code veronica) than it's an absolutely terrible sequel to those games. Like truly abysmal. They gave up on survival horror and made a mid co-op shooter with zero depth that you absolutely can have fun playing through over a weekend with a buddy, lots of fun even, but this game is honestly just mid as hell and not a Resident Evil game other than in name and abuse of the IP's namesake. I guess just kind of think of it as a side game or just pretend it's not even a resident evil game switch your brain off and shoot some monsters, yeah it's fun. It's just kinda dumb. It's like a beat em up but you just shoot em up and move forward instead of right. The plot is completely wild and the villain from the first game is back and now has mind control capabilities and it's all just very cringe.

1. Weak story
There is not much to this plot. You're kinda supposed to investigate some viral outbreak which then is kinda abandoned in favor of Chris looking for his old partner while facing his old nemesis.

2. Weak villains
There is not enough material to give the villains decent personalities or something for me as a player to care about. Each major villain appears in some video sequences and is just as quickly disposed as they appeared.

3. Bullet sponge enemies
Resident Evil 5 early on starts with similar plaga type enemies as RE4 does. However the game then also starts to throw in enemies with a ton of health even on normal mode where you quickly end up blasting all your ammo and grenades into. Especially some bosses are just insanely tanky.

4. Technical problems
The game is over 10 years old and they haven't fixed issues related to graphical settings. If you set the game to unlimited FPS in the graphical settings one of the bosses basically becomes impossible to defeat if you don't have a rocket launcher. The flamethrower intended for the boss fight doesn't deal any damage if you have over 60FPS (the recommendation is to lock it at 30). Something like this is just extremely bad.

5. Cumbersome item management
You only have 9 item slots per character (18 overall). All items are the same size and you can only exchange ammunition and healing items during missions. Weapons will be locked on the character until you reach the end of a chapter or die. 

6. Co-op
The game is designed around co-op where it wants you to play with two people. I'm not really interested in this kind of thing and I just want to play the campaign on my own being stuck with the AI partner. The AI is not exactly smart and often causes problems.

This game is a product of its time where someone higher up at Capcom though Co-op shooters are the current big thing and RE needs to jump on the band waggon causing a lot of problems. It's unfortunate as characters like Sheva actually were decent and had potential to be used later again in the franchise.

It can be quite frustrating and dull sometimes, but nothing in this world is perfect, and as soon as you find out that you can perceive beauty in the most simple and mundane of things in life, the more happier you'll be.

The entire franchise (this game included) truly shine in it's environmental storytelling and small details. I mean, it's got everything you need to appreciate an amazing and touching story, once you let yourself be amazed by it's features.

Besides of that I meet many other great people on that game and spend just on steam over 1147 hours. With GFWL, Xbox Live platforms, I spend the last 10 years for sure over 5000 hours on that game, so that speaks for itself how great that game is. I spend several hours playing the main story, bonus episodes, versus, reunion, mercenaries, team mercenaries mod and team no mercy mod with 4 players. Of course, you can just play 4pl team mercenaries or team no mercy it if you install the 4 player MML mod of Maluc and this you can find if you search the RE5 game guides in steam.

Gone is the merchant, or an equivalent character, replaced with a bland upgrade screen that you can only access between chapters.  The game's sprinting control makes no sense and is a blatant lie as you do not sprint when using it, only do a slow jog.  Capcom's choice to set this game in Africa is... questionable, to say the least, but it gave them the opportunity to add a variety of Plaga-infected animals, something they completely failed to do and instead filled the gap with generic motorcycling Majini.

The PC port is absolute garbage.  It's fun to get melee hits off on enemies, but the controls are otherwise clunky and very, VERY finicky when it comes to QTEs.  Also, I'm far from the first one to say this, but the AI for Sheva if you're playing solo is, well, stupid.  Like, UNOKAY levels of stupid.  I don't think a game has ever frustrated me more than RE5 thanks to its tank controls and unforgiving enemies.  I played it up until the Wesker-Jill fight initially, then had to come back to it after about a month because I simply couldn't beat that part.  The Mercenaries mode is also okay but very difficult to do well in on the PC port, and the whole game has to be beaten to even unlock it (which is no small feat).

RE5 may have been okay for its time of 2009, but its gameplay and story are nowhere near on par with those of its predecessor, and neither has aged well.  Capcom would never have gotten away with making this game today, especially after the BLM movement.  Did I have fun playing this game?  In some parts, yes.  Any part with lots of Majini was generally pretty fun, but the bosses were often BRUTAL, especially the first Uroboros creature, which I had to buy an RPG just to deal with because it was bugged and simply would not die.  Would I recommend it?  No.  Not unless you're a hardcore RE fan or you enjoy punishing, unforgiving games.

Edit:  I can appreciate that this game doesn't hold back at all on the corniness.  I mean, seriously, you have NOT lived until you've seen Chris Redfield PUNCHING A FREAKING BOULDER.  That said, its frustrating gameplay, at least on PC, makes it not my style.  I realize that this game has a special place in a lot of people's hearts and they love it a lot; not me, sorry.",1682317800,1682713951,False,2,1,0.446252703666687012,2,True,False,False

The combat is simply not tuned to work for the fights you face in the game unlike RE4. It's embarrassing how much better Lost in Nightmares is compared to the base game. Here's hoping the remake fixes everything and makes this a good game. I'm sure I may have had a better experience with a friend, but putting aside the issues with Sheva, the game still has a ton of flaws. I genuinely feel a combat overhaul is all this game needs and maybe tone down some of the action a tiny bit.

Boss: Uroboros Mkono

If the game seems hard then you just have to follow these steps and the game is easy.

First step:

[Yesterday, 21:43] Alice Koreu:
1.0 WE SHOOT HIS F ARMS AND HEAD OF#
1.1 THEN HE PICS THE BIG RED THING UP
1.2 THEN U FLAME HIS ASS
1.3 AND I KILL HIS KIDS FROM HIS BACK3

Unless your partner doesn't listen to you. Then the game is GG (what Happend)
But be careful. When your partner insists on writing you such comments as:''[19:55] G/-/OSTYYY-:U WILL BE IN THE KITCHEN WHERE U BELONG''

Then just give him a roundhouse kick in the face so he flies 2 meters to the opponent + don't forget to give him a flamethrowing lesson too. He won't die from it, but he can't move.

Step 2:

write him:''[19:14]Alice Koreu: U TROLLED YOURSELF''
If that should be denied, then you tell him:''[19:10]Alice Koreu: put on your glasses and then you will see the reality''

Step 3:

You send him the wiki link on how to fight the boss.
If he still doesn't get it and shoots wild fire around him, you tell him
[18:56]Alice Koreu: I SEND U THE LINK GOBLIN

You have to spam your partner in caps to stop and only attack when told to.
Also compare to:''[Yesterday, 11:57 PM] Alice Koreu:ur my dogo now''

If your partner is frustrated or demotivated, dont worry, he got this.

Bonus information:

Bonus 1:
If you're waiting at a door and your partner is still fighting, you can help him by spamming V all the time. That makes the fight easier for him

Bonus 2:
It's always important to get ahead. While your partner is busy with the opponents, we kick open all the doors and collect everything we can.

Bonus 2.1:

You always have to let your partner open the boxes, the animation of the hit gives you enough time to collect everything in front of his feet


Bonus 3:

And if you want to be fooled again in the game, then you should die for it, because there are points for that.


[19:14]G/-/OSTYYY-:i hate me

that's exactly what we're getting at. If he admits that, then we've done everything right.

The final boss was pretty flawed because up to that point, the game was holding your hand to guide you, and at the finale you just can't damage the final boss until after you bring the boss to a certain spot, which removes his immunity for whatever reason.

It's still a pretty fun game and has replayability in coop, so it's only worth getting it if you plan to play with a friend in my opinion.

Anoyances: geting a critical instakill headshot will not stop an enemy atack already in progress, a shot to the limbs will though so one can avoid unfortunate events
Using mouse and keyboard gives you a crosshair insted of a laser ( I think laser is superior), crosshairs are 90% of the time lined up with where your gun will shoot  but not always, like in point blank range you need to estimate where your gun is pointing because crosshairs are lying,  or with the minigun, the minigun being the biggest offender, I have to lead my shots on target with that thing because it overshoots by a lot.
With another competent player it can be quite satisfying to pull of combos but I wish there was a chat option so we can strategise instead of hoping our playstiles complement one another.

Also If you are playing this game for the first time, DO NOT Immediately go and punch a boulder in the last level,  you need to climb onto a raised section first and wait untill the baddie starts swinging so I as sheva can do my job otherwise I can not help you and you die.

1. During the marshlands, my game likes to crash. This happens when my partner interacts with the door that leads to the village within. (Please note that I'm not entirely sure if it is me, or if it the game. And no, reportedly, it doesn't happen to me when *I* open the door.)

2. There're quite a few times when the audio level becomes all fucky for seemingly no reason. Notably during the cutscenes. 

3. There are cutscenes that feel like they should be QTEs, but aren't. I reckon it's fixed in the Gold edition of the game, but don't quote me on that.

Onto the good stuff. I loved every second of this game. Chris and Sheva, as a duo, in my opinion, rival Chris and Jill. Both in character development, and in bonding. The boss fights are incredibly fun, save for the bastard in the progenitor lab room. That one's a fucking nightmare without the rocket launcher. The story itself is actually quite good too. There're a few nods to RE4, which was a pleasing sight to behold.

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/352000

It's at times like these I wish there was a mixed option for Steam reviews. RE5 isn't bad it just doesn't have enough quite enough good elements to out number the meh and is NOT worth 39.99 in 2016. I don't care if it's horror or action so long as it's fun which frankly RE5 is some good mindless fun in COOP. It's just that it's unevenly designed. I'll mostly be covering what is in this version of Resident Evil 5 which like Resident Evil 4 is constantly re-released.

The PS4 got a far better version recently (In terms of features) that has an official FOV option (that has since been added into a recent patch), an improved Mercenaries that combines Mercenaries and Reunion , retains local COOP, and No Mercy mode for the combined Mercs content. The original PC port would have been excellent had it not been for the terrible tacked on GFWL and lack of the Gold content which was previously console exclusive and added content like Desperate Escape, Lost in Nightmares and the afformentioned Mercenaries Reunion.

The default FOV has always been an uphill battle for modders as every time it got fixed some small problem would arise or it wouldn't be compatible with other versions of RE5. The default FOV really didn't bother me anitially but Chris fuck Boulders Redfeild is so beefy that he often obscures a lot of the screen especially if you use the unlockable gatling gun later on. Other than some design quirks that really should have been fixed after 4. The focus on COOP has led to a pretty shoddily designed singleplayer experience as there are some levels/sections that mesh quite poorly with worlds most infamous AI partner SHEVA.

There's no local COOP and the mod that added it only worked on the GFWL version meaning if you don't want to deal with Sheva you need to copies or a friend who also owns Resident Evil 5 and is willing to play. Speaking of modding you will need a couple of community made patches to fix some bugs Capcom missed. At one point in the game you'll need a card key but the enemy that would drop it upon dying won't drop down meaning he can't be reached or killed and that you are stuck. That's a game breaking, progression halting bug right there and it's not the only one. Here's a link to the fixes: http://steamcommunity.com/app/21690/discussions/0/618458030688121927/

I reccomend RE5 but only if you have a HUMAN partner and all the content.

I would recommend running through the game on normal and easy to get the infinite rocket launcher to speed run through re5 on hard and on professional since it can get pretty hard on some of the levels, and especially the level designs is pretty dope as well.

The Co-op can be fun, especially if you want to run the game with one of your friends is new to the game, I ran a few missions with a friend of mine and he enjoy's re5 with me having infinite ammo so he won't have to run out of ammo as much with any weapon type which is pretty cool.

Two issues I have with this re game is the grind to get each gun infinite ammo is kind of a pain to get ALL the guns infinite ammo is quite tedious but it would be worth the hassle and playing on professional can be REALLY HARD at some of the levels but it is worth the $20+ game.

To give this re5 a rating, I would say that it is a 9/10.

It steers away from the survival horror premise a lot and instead employs a heavy bit of action. Now while that's somewhat of a problem for me, I do still like the title as an action game. The action is actually fun... it's just not Resident Evil.

Pros:

- The setting is nice. The claustrophobic back alleys, damp caves outside the settlements, the densely-populated settlements themselves and the Licker-infested underground base make for some of the more interesting areas to explore in the game.
- Dove into the rich backstory of RE and helped to explain some of the franchise's early days with Umbrella's founders.
- Albert Wesker makes his villainous return to the spotlight. Made for the best final boss fight in the entire series.
- The boulder scene.

Cons:

- Like I said before, too action-oriented for an RE title.
- Your companion, Sheva, has way too much of an underdeveloped and uninteresting backstory for someone who is making their series debut.
- Shared resource management has A LOT of drawbacks in this game. But the most annoying aspect of it is that Sheva can actually run out of items, relying on you to provide in whatever is lacking. Very annoying.

I recommend this solid installment from the RE franchise. If you're an RE fan, or just a survival horror fan in general, I totally understand if you can't stomach this action-packed title. But at end of the day, it's still pretty fun and engaging. --- [b][i]7.9/10[/i][/b]",1495275804,1681339560,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Why l call it ultimate? Because both you and your partner can interact with each other in (melee)combat and with inventory management.  One of the most important parts in a coop game is to [b]always care about your partner; the relationship between players must be mutual[/b]. This game makes it happen; obviously not 100% but it succeeds with distinction! Your partner isn't just there, so you can say for the sake of it "" l am playing coop"", you need to take notice, get close to do melee combos(which truthfully, are complicated in this game), save each other, share items and more. [b]Most coop games l see, especially story mode ones, just lack that feeling of actually having a partner[/b]. Those games just have you and the partner shooting things and if someone goes down, that is the only moment in which there is any interaction between players. 
[i]Its sequel removes that feeling and makes it even more linear, but also lengthens it[/i]. This is one of the main weaknesses of Resident Evil 5(RE5). The moment you start having fun and get going, the level ends.
Moreover, on the weaknesses, the game loves to put Quick time events(QTEs) for the sake of it. Some are fun and worthwhile, however, others are just a nightmare that your life depends on it. If you play on the highest difficulty and have a poor connection or poor reflexes, one mistake is a game over. Talk about ""good game design"" eh? Even the lower difficulties have the problem to a lesser extent. You just need to remember which spots or situations  to avoid that force you to do QTEs.
Outside of gameplay. The story is just filler and non-existent in a bad way. Without any themes, Aesop or life-lessons. It is just  meaningless non-stop action, at least it is better than RE6, but that doesn't say much. The humor of RE4 is not here, [b]everything is too serious in a regrettable way here[/b]. Only the main antagonist and the protagonist saves it. While the partner gets underutilized and never appears again in other games. There isn't even any  meaningful character development between them. A wasted potential! But the voice cast is impressive.

In this game, it is just RE4 with coop but without the humor, lines or fun bosses.  The gameplay saves it since almost any time you play with other players, the experience gets a bit different(not like Left for Dead 2). 
About the trainer: This game has a trainer which makes both RE5 and RE6 fun to play. You can change a lot of variables, insert unobtainable weapons, use vocalizers (lines) that make the fun and make you wonder why it isn't in the game. It also lets you change characters and their moves change too, every character is unique. It is sad that the story mode doesn't let you change characters to make the game more sandbox like. 
To me, to make the coop experience feel more alive, it should have the experience of L4D2 where every encounter(and dynamic too), level is unique and the use of vocalizers, so we can have humor in a serious situation. Where it is possible to correctly use a line in a situation and laugh immensely. In addition, it should let you have even more coop interactions, more freedom and let you change characters and not just stick to story characters. 
If only coop games let you do more personal interactions like hugging, touching, high five. 
l had and still have fun playing this game till this day. It is one of the few true coop games, despite being obviously made for consoles only.
Grab yourself the patches needed(got to wait as of writing this review) so you can trade weapons with your ally (this is an error of porting it to PC as far l know).
It is a shame the (online)cooperative element is gone from modern games. It all feels lonely despite having someone beside you. This is metaphorically true in all aspects, even outside the game. Why is this happening? There is a reason, my guess is that they aren't trying enough. Not hard, just not trying enough. You have Kane & Lynch  series games where there is connection between the protagonists and both feel unique, but you can't have this in our times?
Like RE5, if you want real coop action and meaningful experience, try Kane & Lynch Dead Men, its sequel(KL2), Left For Dead(1&2). RE6 has it too, but in a heavily less extent. Its coop factor is gone, and it is like any other mediocre/typical game that has COOP, still its action is at least unique.

Resident Evil 5 is a good game, but not a great one. It’s a game that tries to follow the footsteps of its predecessor, Resident Evil 4, but fails to capture the same magic and quality. It’s a game that has some strengths and highlights, but also some weaknesses and flaws. It’s a game that is enjoyable and entertaining, but also frustrating and disappointing.

One of the strengths of Resident Evil 5 is its main antagonist, Albert Wesker. Wesker is one of the best villains in the franchise, and his presence and performance in this game are outstanding. He is charismatic, menacing, and ruthless, and his motives and actions are intriguing and compelling. He is also a formidable foe, with superhuman abilities and intelligence. He provides some of the most memorable and challenging moments in the game, especially in the final showdown.

Another strength of Resident Evil 5 is its co-op mode. The game is designed to be played with a partner, either online or offline, and this adds a lot of fun and strategy to the gameplay. The co-op mode allows you to coordinate your attacks, share your resources, and help each other out in sticky situations. The co-op mode also enhances the replay value of the game, as you can try different combinations of characters and weapons.

However, one of the weaknesses of Resident Evil 5 is its story. The story of Resident Evil 5 is convoluted and confusing, with too many plot holes and inconsistencies. The story tries to tie up some loose ends from previous games, but also introduces new ones that are never resolved. The story also lacks the tension and horror of previous games, and instead relies on action and spectacle. The story feels like a generic blockbuster movie, rather than a unique survival horror game.

Another weakness of Resident Evil 5 is its gameplay. The gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to Resident Evil 4, but with some changes that make it worse. The gameplay is still based on shooting enemies and solving puzzles, but with less variety and creativity. The enemies are mostly generic zombies and mutants, with few surprises or scares. The puzzles are mostly simple and repetitive, with little challenge or reward. The gameplay also suffers from some technical issues, such as clunky controls, poor camera angles, and annoying quick-time events.

Another aspect of Resident Evil 5 that is worse than Resident Evil 4 is the inventory system. The inventory system of Resident Evil 5 is limited and cumbersome, and it hinders the gameplay rather than enhances it. The inventory system only allows you to carry nine items at a time, and you cannot access them from a pause menu. Instead, you have to access them from a real-time menu that leaves you vulnerable to attacks. The inventory system also forces you to constantly manage your items and share them with your partner, which can be tedious and annoying. The inventory system of Resident Evil 5 lacks the flexibility and convenience of Resident Evil 4, and it adds more frustration and difficulty to the game.

Resident Evil 5 is a good game, but not a great one. It’s a game that has some strengths and highlights, but also some weaknesses and flaws. It’s a game that is enjoyable and entertaining, but also frustrating and disappointing. It’s a game that tries to follow the footsteps of its predecessor, Resident Evil 4, but fails to capture the same magic and quality.",1679260823,1681261133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My friend and I have played and beaten this game 3 times on Normal, Hard, and Professional, and every time we come back, we are always having fun and learning more about the game.

Shows how poorly the game was designed when the biggest challenge was your A.I companion doing everything in her power to waste your heals and get herself killed.

Especially when you realize that you don't need to resource manage. It's very generous with ammo, even for the more powerful guns, but just makes it seem like you can run out.

Super cheesy and over-the-top, but I always find this game hilariously entertaining. This game is alright single player, but it's way more fun in co-op. if you like other modes, there's Mercenaries (where you just kill all the things in the time limit and can play as unlockable characters) which most people really enjoy. 

Positives:
1. Graphics are sharp, nicely rendered African locales, shadows and light. This was the first RE to incorporate shadows and light more integral with the game than past RE's and it works beautifully.
2. A wide range of weapons and upgrades, with something to suit everyone's style.
3. Nice relationship development between Chris and Sheva, great script and some truly repulsive bad guys such as Irving and Excella.
4. Game length is probably 12 hours without dlc, not too much not too little.
5. Lots of unlockables.

Negatives:
1. Sheva's AI can be stubborn at times, ex. she doesn't always follow Chris. Her command set is limited to Attack and Defend. She will burn through SMG ammo like nothing and heal Chris sometimes when his health is near 100%, wasting the herb/spray.
2. RE4 was easier in that you could pause the game in the middle of a fight to change weapons or take a moment to relax. RE5 does not have this. You can bring the inventory up but the game still runs, so be ready to swap guns and items fast.
3. Some may not like the whole Uroboros story, that their are no zombies, but to each his own.
4. Chris still cannot move while aiming. They didn't change this until RE6.",1680963889,1680963889,True,2,0,0.525899946689605713,0,True,False,False

I have mixed feelings towards this game. Resident Evil 4 Remake hype brought me to continue this game after dropping it last year. I started my Resident Evil last year with banger after banger from RE1 to RE4 and this game is where it finally stopped streak. So yeah, after finishing it right now, I have some thoughts and opinions as a newcomer.

Resident Evil 5 is the fifth mainline entry of the Resident Evil franchise where you play as Chris and your partner Sheva journey through Africa to investigate a dangerous plague turning everyone into murderous monsters. I'll start with what I like and enjoy first and that is the gameplay. The gameplay is the updated version of RE4 with faster controls and new weapons. Being the one of the games revolutionise the third person view in videogames, gameplay can be abit rough even for 2009 standards. There is strafe and shoot, meaning shooting something will have you stayed in place. It is very fun in RE4, but in this game, that'll be something I'll explain in the negatives. But overall, I've had fun with the shooting and fighting here.

Somewhat of a mixed bag are the enemies. Every Resident Evil has that one scary looking enemy that represents the game, such as Tyrant or Lisa in RE1, Licker or Tyrant Mr X in RE2, Nemesis in RE3, and everyone in RE4. In this game? Black noodle monsters. That's it. There are some that are memorable like the big axe guy and also Wesker, but the big enemy being teased throughout the story being black noodles are kinda dissapointing. It doesn't help that other than their designs being not scary, fighting them are a toy in the bum to fight.

On to the downsides, being on topics of enemies and combat, every enemy is a bullet sponge in the game. I know that technically, every enemy in any combat-focused game is a health sponge but here, that sponge is BIG. Especially for the bosses. Some bosses are health sponges and focused more on spectacle than your prowess. Shoot certain types of body parts to reveal weakpoints, rinse and repeat. Or doing a certain specific weapon only available in the place you are fighting and wait for it to recharge when out of ammo, rinse and repeat. Even worse, the game teaches you that in early game and changes it up towards the end. But I'll get to that later.

Being focused more on spectacle, meaning this game is not as scary as the last four RE games. I'm not even sure 'Horror' is even a tag for this game since there is nothing in the game that can define it being horror. This game is more of an Third Person Shooter, Action, Survival game like the typical Resident Evil game but ditching the horror. The scariest part in the game is just copied from RE2 with Lickers, but even that the game intends on you gunsblaze them all to the Nether realm. But not being a horror game is what the devs intend from what I know.

I haven't told about the Multiplayer Online Coop aspect of the game which I'm about to. I have not played this much since my friends and I have some barriers between the things between our thighs but from the limited time I've played, it is fun. I've heard from the discourse between players where this game is the best coop game in the market, and I can definitely see why. Your partner can be controlled by other people or AI if you want too. But since being a coop focused game, the whole other mechanics of the game are based on this philosopy making the health pools of enemies tankier, and the changing of battle mechanics in boss fights. You are meant to find out what to do together. And me playing with only one hand, brought some frustrations because of how the game is designed.

Which brings me to the story. Resident Evil at this point always have a very simple story but with very interesting lore and backdrop. Here, its an action movie. With all the beats that is hype during the 2010s. With the brown filter, edgy art style and all. I did not follow or care about the story at all. Since its coop focused game, the story can't be too non-existent like the last games because it'll get boring, and can't be too serious because it won't be fun. So, the typical B movie action is the way to go. I... kinda don't want this. 

Finally, the final battle is kinda the peak of what I'm not enjoying the game. Without spoiling, you'll do things very different from the rest of the game, like RE5 to its predecessors, to defeat the final boss. I've spent thirty minutes shooting the guy, only to find out it can be done in like 5 minutes because I didn't do something specific.

Overall, I can see why its fun, but its not what I want from an RE game.

At this point though, it's only fun as a co-op game with a buddy. Doesn't really have much to offer that classic RE fans expect from the series. This was the game that solidified the series's transition from survival horror to action horror. 

As a die-hard fan of traditional survival horror, this one is very stale to me. It's not terrible or bad by any means, just not what makes Resident Evil, well.... Resident Evil. Was fun revisiting with my good friend, but will likely never play it again(not solo anyway)

You fight more against the controls, small inventory and your mate then against anything else in this game. The camera sensitivity is different for standing still, for running and again for aiming. That makes your hand hurt in the first 5 minutes and wont go away, because your muscle memory will go nuts like that.

You have 9 inventory slots and you will get spammed with new weapons really early, real fast. That results is constant inventory mangement between you and your mate wich was already extreme anyoing after an hour.. Also your mate sometimes takes the ammo you need, but to be fair also sometimes gives you the ammo you need.

These two things alone made me quit after 2-3 hours or so, not to mention the extreme bad graphics wich burn out your eyes. Do your self and especially your hands a favor and avoid this trash game, you have been warned. We can only hope that a remake will fix all these issues in the future and i think thats what we can expect.

If Resident Evil 5 is given it's fair shake, It's a lot of the same environments, just more decidedly sun-drenched, and arid. And I honestly loved this game at release, especially with a friend. It's just a damn good time, even solo. And Sheva's AI (Or Chris's depending on who you're playing of course.) has a few dedicated hiccup moments where she decides to be a little...finnicky, and throwing items around can be a bit rough in the heat of the moment....but for the time this game was made in, it's quite remarkably solid. It's a bit rigid, but it works wonders to keep things on track.

You have the upgrade system, which makes it feel like you're spending money to order parts from HQ more than some random shopkeeper that's popular because of his voice. With no disrespect to the actor, It's great. I love him. But he's a weird unexplained magical man stalking Leon for no reason but is happy to take your money....that LEON, A COP TURNED FBI AGENT, suddenly cared to take off of the locals after shooting them? 

See, this is what I mean.

RE4 wasn't the ""final survival horror"". That was RE2.

Ever since RE3 the games have focused on pulse-pounding action and running for points to upgrade things and unlock goodies. Even back in RE2 they had a mode for high speed action, so just going ""Ew, RE5, the game that killed resident evil / started the trend of action over horror"" it's....kind of hypocritical, when most of those same people wouldn't dare say the same thing about RE4.

But this one is still an incredible game by any shooter's standards. Probably the best co-op game of all time too. And being on steam we can always play it online without having to pay for PS plus or whatever.
It's got a darker tone to the story, it seems to respect and embrace the fact that it's a resident evil game more so than RE4. And it's not afraid to be batshit insane and ubsurd in every way it can. And everything that was great about the gameplay in RE4 is carried over to this one with improvements.    THAT BEING SAID this one is way more inconsistant in terms of quality and fun. There's quite a few parts in this one I just DREAD having to go through again. And most of them are the TERRIBLE BOSSES.    Granted all of it is better actually playing with someone because you can't trust the AI partner to do Jack. (except you can always rely on them to spray all of your best ammo into a wall.)

But I think it's really a testement to how fun this game is, that even in spite of some glaring issues, i've replayed this game like 20 times over the years on different consoles.
BE WARNED THOUGH THE PC VERSION HAS A BIT OF ISSUES YOU'RE GONNA NEED MODS AND WORKAROUNDS TO FIX.
Unless i'm mistaken I still believe you need an RE5 FIXES patch to get this game to boot up at all without the windows live bullshit. And you're going to have to get rid of the dumb crosshair on PC and get the laser sight back yourself.
But a massive benefit to the PC version is that you can disable the ugly green yellow filter on everything with the help of the RE5 FIXES patch.  It's such a massive improvement that it's geniunely appauling and shocking the game doesn't look like that all the time.  Also, you can make sheva invisible and invincible with the help of the ALONE IN AFRICA MOD. So if you ever wanted to remove sheva from the game you actually can now. Although she's not actually gone. She's just some invisible presence in the game. Which is hard to explain unless you see it for yourself. 

Bottom of the Line. 
If you somehow haven't played this one yet, maybe you're new to the series and always wondered what RE5 was like in spite of some of the negativity surrounding it, i'd say give it a go, I couldn't think of a better use of $20 than playing RE5 for the first time.   And if you have played it.  You get to enjoy the disabling of that damn color filter and see how the game was always intended to look and maybe get to play at 120fps or higher if you have the monitor for it. It's a no brainer to get on PC even if you've played it.

Все мною пройденные хоть и были со своими раздражителями, но здесь раздражает буквально все: от топорного управления до навязанного кооператива с ужасно реализованным ботом-напарником. Единственный положительный момент, который я выделил для себя - это рассказ событий, которые остались вне игр серии, но имеют вес и значимость для лора.

⠀⠀⠀Начнем с управления. Оно мерзкое и будет с вами на протяжении всей игры. Со временем с ним свыкнетесь, но само его наличие будет подводить и раздражать во множестве игровых моментов. Хоть управление и базируется на наработках четвертой части, тогда он на удивление не отторгал. В пятой части топорность и неманевренность во время перемещения и стрельбы возведены в абсолют. Атмосфера в игре отсутствует напрочь, ибо элементарно нет музыкального сопровождения на фоне по ходу прохождения. Всё ограничивается саундом во время файтов. В первые пол часа есть атмосфера загадочности, но она резко улетучивается. Насчет головоломок. На моей памяти было что-то одно похожее на это, но ее решит даже детсадовец за 10 секунд. Внедрив кооператив в игру (который хоть и никогда не требовался франшизе), он мог бы поспособствовать в создании интересных моментов на включение мозга и взаимодействие двух игроков между собой, но и этот момент разрабы упустили по какой-то причине. 

⠀⠀⠀Кооператив. Самое сладкое. Из-за чего у меня зад полыхал на протяжении всех трех прохождений, в особенности на профессиональной сложности. Если вы будете играть с ботом-напарником – готовьте что-то от потенциального возгорания. Бот максимально тупой и неотзывчивый. Когда нужно совершить парное QTE, он шляется где-то и хрен пойми чем занимается. То лутается, то лезет на ражон и тратит хилки, моментами может вообще встрять в текстурах, что у меня было не раз, и приходилось перезапускать чекпоинт… Командовать им толком нельзя, команды “атака” и “прикрытие” отличается только дистанцией, на которой напарник держится от вас. В гуще перестрелок может лезть к вам под перекрестие, загораживая весь обзор. Менеджмент инвентаря ужасно костыльный, передавать и перемещать предметы сплошная боль. Что вообще можно говорить, если элементарно нельзя задать оружие, которое будет держать ваш напарник. Просто слов нет как ущербно бот реализован…

⠀⠀⠀Если кратно об игре, то это коридорный тир между катсценами без сопровождающего ОСТ, без сюжетных интриг и без грамотного управления. Платные ДЛС, которые длиной  на 30 минут каждый, играются куда интереснее оригинальной истории. Особенно Lost in Nightmares. Вайб первых резидентов прекрасен. По ощущениям разрабы пытались сфокусироваться на кооперативной составляющей, но этот момент по итогу не доработали и вдобавок ко всему заруинили всё остальное. Вы ничего не потеряете, если пройдете мимо этого игры. Интересные детали лора серии можно прочитать в интернете, а сам сюжет пятой части по сути никак не влияет на серию целиком, а просто закрывает рамки событий для пары-тройки персонажей.

The campaign takes around 7 hours for a first play through if you and your Player 2 are familiar with these kinds of games. Do [b]not[/b] play the campaign by yourself as the AI is brain dead. I understand not making it incredible to the point of playing the game for you, but it's bad enough that if it were another player behaving the same way, I'd have kicked them from lobby.

Tack on another few hours for the DLC chapters and Mercenaries and you've got yourself a decent game to play for a few afternoons with a friend. Any hours beyond that (mine included) are replaying the same content, grinding for unlockables, and just an absolute slog. I already 100% completed this game years ago on PlayStation so I already knew what to expect, boss strategies, treasure locations, etc. First time players may get a few extra hours of it.

[h2]The Good[/h2]
+ Most, but not all, quick time events were removed from the initial version. All cutscene QTE's (no more mashing A to outrun a monster, or pressing X to dodge at the correct time) and dodging the crocodiles on the raft are gone, but the scenes are still mandatory; you cannot skip them. Just sit through them, they'll be over soon enough. QTE's are still left in for combat, such as dodging an enemy leaping at you or Wesker's swings.
+ Stable 60 FPS, except during specific cut-scenes which is fine
+ Ultrawide supported, not stretched
+ Alt-tabs or runs in window flawlessly
+ Seamless switching between controller and mouse/keyboard controls
+ A surprisingly active community in 2023

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
- Friendly AI will walk into environmental hazards if you don't tell them to heel like a well-trained dog
- If you're stationary and the friendly AI misses a shot and the enemy doesn't move, they won't think to move where they are standing to get a better angle. I watched Sheva piss away an entire box of MG ammo just to see how long it would go on, until I eventually shot the guy.
- Completing the game once and Mercenaries are the most. Subsequent playthroughs with your upgraded equipment makes it too easy. If I reinstall it later to play with a friend, I'll likely deliberately not use my upgraded gear just to keep things fun.

This is my personal favorite Resident Evil of the series, now, is this one perfect? Far from it. Don't let my playtime deceive you, I've beaten this game dozens of times on multiple platforms. 360, Switch, Xbox One and now PS3. With 600-700 hours in this game casually throughout the years. I have 60 alone on the Switch version due to Mercenaries.

This isn't the best RE game, but god it's my favorite. It's core combat is a refined more focused classic RE4, which is one of the best Third Person shooters, and action games of all time. Although it's pacing, and some of the enemy encounters aren't as fined tuned (I really dislike the Cargo Ship section towards the end far more than any scenario in Re4).  Despite that, the core combat really carries this game, alongside Co-Op with unlockables, alternative difficulties, weapon upgrades, treasure collecting and the best of all, Mercenaries.

This game will have plenty of content to keep you busy if you want it to. It's easily the most replayble Resident Evil in my opinion next to Re4 (2005). It's not a horror game, it's far from it even compared to Re4 on the Gamecube. But that's not a bad thing for me. RE games want you to often replay them multiple times to get your values worth, see everything. Or just to extract what little they offer (RE3 2020)... But their gameplay, while good, isn't always as fun on repeat playthroughs. It's simply that they're built as more of survival horror games than action, even if they have quite a bit of action. That's not their fault and it's still fun. But RE4&5, due to their over the top polished action leads to just the most video gamey games you can play.

As a Resident Evil game in essence and style, this isn't my favorite nor the best. But as a video game, this is probably the peak of the series alongside RE4. They're just well made action games with great combat and content. I have many. many issues I can get into about sections of this game and it's design, but I'm not going to get into it here or this Review would be 5x longer.

Resident Evil 5 (2009) has similar combat mechanics, movement mechanics as in Resident Evil 4 (2005), which the same sound effects, and same type of enemies are in the 2009 game. Resident Evil 5 (2009) features the same aspects from Resident Evil 4 (2005) by having a abundance of enemies within a area, able to purchase and upgrade weapons but without a merchant, the 2009 game also features the trade mechanic so you're able to trade with whoever character you play as from item to item. There is a lot of types of bosses, and ranges of weapons and able to play Resident Evil 5 (2009) with someone to help you with these conflicts, since multiplayer is present in the 2009 game, revival and healing others is a option. The game also features a DLC, a expanded story of what happened to Jill Valentine's suspected death, along with Chris Redfield being by her side along with more unique enemies, and having Albert Wesker included, there is another DLC which is called Desperate Escape which features Jill Valtentine again but with Josh Stone, alias with Sheva Alomar, which both had to get a helicopter to escape the dock area later in the game after Chris Redfield reunites with Jill Valentine and stops her control from Albert Wesker. Speaking of Albert Wesker, there are many bosses in the game, which Wesker takes two boss fights which is mainly at the end of the game. The game features horror elements, combat, adventure, and multiplayer. Resident Evil 5 (2009) is not a bad game at all, I support the 2009 game as somewhat a good game to play with friends, and generally defeat enemies, bosses, and assist each other to beat the game on whatever difficulty you play on. Down below is the advantages and disadvantages.[h1] Advantages [/h1]Advantages that I include in Resident Evil 5 (2009) is that is multiplayer, has characters from original Resident Evil franchise games, and other new characters such has Sheva Alomar, as she is within the BSAA Africa Branch, a expansion in the story with the explanation of Chris's PTSD during the main game about Jill, which is the DLC. Another DLC that also expands the story about how Jill Valentine and Josh Stone got the helicopter when it comes to the final sequence of the game. However I have the game has several good aspects of survival as well as multiplayer being present.[h1] Disadvantages [/h1]Well there are some setbacks that comes to the Resident Evil 5 (2009) which I will include here, the AI for playing single player can be sometimes a stubborn, which AI can randomly walk into a enemy, or fails to reach for revival in time which can be annoying sometimes, another setback is Window's Live Games, which was removed recently, which I will not put a setback on Resident Evil 5 (2009) for this, but was previously a setback. Resident Evil 5 (2009) is a great multiplayer game, and I really do play this with friends as it can create a strong bond between you and your friend on several scenarios but I recommend this game by the rating down below.[h1] Resident Evil 5 (2009) [/h1][h1] 9/10 90% [/h1]",1679774043,1679774043,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all i would like to say that this was my first time playing RE 5 and i have done so with a friend the true way this game was meant to be played so for the rest of this review i will base my opinions on that aspect of the game not playing it solo.The map design was fairly boring i must admit i didn't necessarily mind the daytime but it felt repetitive especially in the temple part of the campaign where every area felt the same the gunplay was precise and satisfying and the game ran smoothly trout the entire playtrough minus the flash ammo grenades for the grenade launcher which if being spammed would drop the fps a little bit.Enemy selection is alright besides the bug mantis looking things they where super annoying and tanky for zero reason besides that other enemies where fine.The characters where great and the story itself kept us interested in finishing the game however the final boss battle with Wesker was just plain annoying it was too tedious going up and down to get rockets only for this mf to dodge it killed all enjoyment or love we had for the game overall not a bad game at all which was our initial expectation due to all the reviews and negativity we saw online being that it was not only my first time with this game but my friends first introduction to the series it was fun if you do decide to pick this game up or even play it for the first time defo get a friend i can't image the solo experience being fun ngl overall a 6/10 i wish the level design was not as repetitive and the boss battles where not super annoying.,1679451501,1679703473,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A unique combination of action, survival horror that mixes up the melee and gunplay in a way, none-other has. And they take it a step further, with the addition of coop play. (no offense RE4) Turning your efforts of team-play, into an almost 'beat-em-up' style of gameplay (if you wish)

What do I mean? pop an enemy in the leg or head and just follow the melee prompts. (QTE) 
Especially the larger executioner & chainsaw enemy variants, that's where the real teamwork fun is to be had.Or, just play the game as you normally would in a survival horror. (hit-n-run style)

However, much like its predecessor..RE4 (Damnit Ashley!!) there is definitely a love/hate learning curve to the game. QTE's and other events that will drive you up the wall in frustration. (Armored enemy events)

But overall, I would give this game a solid 8/10

It's fine in single player too if you learn how to manipulate and get the best effect out of the dopey AI. Your computer-controlled companion isn't nearly as stupid as some say if you know what it's expecting from you and how to equip it. I had a lot of fun experimenting with different weapons and different level strategies and some methods are definitely better than others. 

RE5 keeps a lot of the older hallmarks of the series and in hindsight is a perfectly good game that deserves better treatment than it got when new. The controls are a natural evolution of RE4, and feel pretty smooth while keeping the RE series' unique control scheme. My friend and I used to go through it maybe once a year for kicks and it was always a good time. The engine aged well and so have the visuals. Despite the popular brownish color tone of the era, the underlying texture, model and shader work is great and holds up to more modern titles. It takes to modern systems and resolutions well and still plays perfectly. It looks especially nice using 4x DSR to apply supersampling. This game was really well optimized on release and can basically run on a potato now. I would think an absolutely ideal Steamdeck title along with RE4. 

The PC version slowly got screwed over time. The PS4 and Xbox One got an updated version with better friendly AI and some other updates and PC got left in the dust. Also, after Games For Windows Live went defunct this game got harder to play properly. Supposedly Steam updated the multiplayer servers at some point but not the GFWL dependency, so the game still gave problems for years because of this. Only in 2023 did they finally release an update that fixed the game's basic functions. They also patched a few bugs and some other stuff, but the PC version still isn't up to par with the consoles. 

All that said, this game is a ton of fun in co-op and still plays very well in single player. Despite being way too linear, the gameplay is still good where it counts.

Resident Evil 5 was recently updated to finally remove Games for Windows Live, which eliminates most of the problems new players will have with first launches etc. The community fan patch is still very highly recommended, and you can find that in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1533171339]this guide[/url].

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Summary[/h1]

One of Capcom's bestselling games of all time and it still holds up, even now. This game is an absolute blast to play, especially if you can find a friend or a stranger to experience it with! Every chapter is pure fun as you immerse yourself in Chris ""the Boulder-punch"" Redfield's action-packed journey with a new partner - Sheva Alomar - as he attempts to survive and uncover the truth in the world's most recent turnup in global bioterrorism.

[hr][/hr]

Edit: Apparently a lot of people are seeing this review, so I guess I should put a little more effort into actually [i]reviewing[/i] the game itself, oops.

★★★★★

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Very well optimized
+ Plays great with controllers as well as keyboard/mouse
+ Engaging gameplay loop
+ Satisfying progression of power
+ Optional, excellent co-op
+ Still visually outstanding 11 years later
+ Great voice acting, character designs, soundwork, etc.
+ Unlockable + additional content, e.g. The Mercenaries game mode
+ Fairly active modding community

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The story starts off a bit weak (but ramps up as you progress)
- Chapter 1-1 is honestly the most difficult part of the game for new players and can be a wall that some can't make it over
- Some people may not like that this game uses QTEs during some cutscenes (but personally, I think they fit what Capcom was going for with this game)

[h1]Side Note[/h1]

I'd like to conclude with an extra bit here for new players reading this review who are thinking of trying this game for the first time. Resident Evil 5 has a strong emphasis on melee attacks but, regrettably, doesn't call much attention to this (aside from a tutorial document or two at the start of the game, which new players will often just skip anyways). I've seen firsthand how this can lead to new players having an incomplete and less fulfilling experience with the game - where crowd control is completely set aside for simple ""just point and shoot"" gameplay instead. As a solution to this problem, I wish that the characters alluded to this mechanic with just a few seconds of dialogue.. something along the lines of ""if you stun them, you might be able to get in close and get a punch in."" 

Just a couple examples: Shooting an enemy in the head will generally allow you to land a strong hit that knocks them down. Shooting an enemy in the legs to get them on their knees can let you run behind them and perform an extremely powerful melee attack. You get the idea. Don't let the size or strength of your enemy discourage you from experimenting!",1608852307,1679284465,True,187,2,0.925508081912994385,16,True,False,False

Amazing soundtrack, the characters are good, story's cool and not over complicated, ther are achievements and co-op, just what more to ask? Even after story mode, there are other modes such as the Mercenaries, and 2 cool DLCs, Desperate Escape being the obviously better one, not a huge fan of puzzles.

This game's hate is due to it being different from the other RE's, it's not ""horror oriented"", but I'm fine with this, in fact, it's my favorite Resident Evil game
People also complain about the A.I, yes it's kinda bad but it's not bad to the point where the game is unplayable. (Not including the professional difficulty)

It may be a ""bad resident evil game"", but it's a god damn great game on its own, I never really cared about RE's before 4 so honestly the change didn't really bother me, probably because I've started with RE5 and then RE6, but I still prefer RE4 over 6.",1557059635,1679199139,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

You play the role of Chris Redfield who is accompanied by his partner Sheva (either an AI or you can invite a friend to co-op) as they investigate disturbing biological incidents in Africa linked to the t-virus that plagued Raccoon City.

The mechanics are very similar to RE4 but action is far more prominent and that really adds to the fun. The writing and characters are really well executed and the locations are varied and interesting. Looks great even after 14 years.

You will also have to carefully manage your inventory which is staple of the series and there's plenty to unlock, buy and discover.

I played this years ago back on Xbox and I didn't care much for it then either, but I'm a big Resident Evil fan and wanted to see it through. Sheva's bow might be the only thing that made running that slog solo even remotely worth it. While we're talking positives, Mercenaries is...kind of fun? I guess? 4 had a far better Mercenaries game mode in my personal opinion, but on the flip side, this has Rebecca. The emblem scavenger hunt is fun in and of itself as well, and D.C. Douglas did an amazing job voicing Wesker. Wesker's writing may have been Godawful in this game, but D.C. Douglas alone massively improves it. Almost enough to make up for the horrendous writing! Almost.

To me, though, this still feels like the lowest point in the series, with easily the worst characterizations for Chris, Wesker, and Jill. It genuinely feels like they tried to take all the worst elements from 4 and make a new game based entirely on that, and honestly it's almost decent! It's a good game on its own, but it's a bad Resident Evil game. As a survival horror fan, and a fan of the classics in this franchise, I can't in good faith recommend this to anyone who's looking for good survival horror or even good writing. Especially as nothing in this game is really even remotely scary. On the flip side, if you're here for the comedy aspect (i.e. Wesker yelling about eggs while assaulting chickens in Mercenaries) and the absolutely absurd level of cheese in this game, then you're in the right place.

I want to like this game, I really do, but it's just not for me. Especially in single player. Seriously, playing through this solo is just painful and kinda boring.",1679002582,1679002582,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

The Good:
I am liking the saga of fighting back against the bio weapons of the world and it feels like a genuine threat to humanity. The daylight horror is a change and I don't have anything against it, I like the setting jumping over the place but not too much. Variety of enemies kept it fresh. If you liked RE4, you should like this one, literally an updated version of it. I actually enjoyed this more than RE4. I'm not a big fan of RE action titles, but I would pick this one over RE4, yeah, kill me for that. Gun play and game play were fun for me, horror sucked and was barely apart of the game which is a big thing for me. Liked some of the puzzles. No backtracking for this. I can see myself replaying this in the future with a friend possibly, the multiplayer in this game actually seems well integrated. If I wanted to play an action game, this would be a go to, it was simply fun. 

The Bad:
The boss fights seem to all be gimmick fights, no strategy, just wait a little bit and shoot a large damaging weapon or have a machine gun turret rapid fire. The bosses were fun visually but very little gameplay to it. I still enjoyed them though. Of course this had no classic RE horror to it that I love and therefore I dislike that. This is not much a survival horror game, more of a action survival game. At first I really disliked Wesker as a Edgy teen's wetdream of being badass in the early 2000s, but after the final boss with him, he grew on me. He showed a lot of hate towards Chris and that is what I enjoyed. I don't want to see his cringe ass again though. Maybe if they changed his apparel, I would like Wesker a lot more. I can only think of the Matrix looking at him.

The Ugly:
This only happened in the last couple chapters of the game but the AI for Sheva just wasn't making great choices and dying a lot. Can't dodge it seems like. Wesker is just too good I guess throwing piss missiles. This barely affected the game. She only died dumbly like 6 times and that was only in just one chapter near the end. Annoying at the time. But it's fine when that is the only time she is dumb. Otherwise her AI is very tolerable throughout the rest of the game. Just really annoyed me during that fight.

Conclusion:
I enjoyed this as an action game but not a horror game. I'll give it a 7.5/10 for an action game and a 4.5/10 for a RE game. I enjoyed this a lot more than I originally thought. I would rank this a lot higher if it had a better atmosphere and horror element to the game. Loved the soundtrack though. I honestly would play this over RE4, RE4 is only ranked as high as it is because of the influence it had on other games that I hold dear to my heart. RE5 is more fun in my opinion and I enjoyed it more. I still prefer my slow paced horror games but I had fun as an action game. This would be a fun game to people that may not even like horror.",1678848933,1678848933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not to mention it isn't the least bit scary unless maybe you're squeamish or you haven't been exposed to much scary stuff in your life. However, the gameplay of RE5 cannot be undersold. If you liked RE4, Revelations, or if you're fresh off the remakes, I think this is a good one for you. The gameplay is very similar to RE4, it has improved camera controls, a kickass combat system, and lovely gunplay! Seriously, there are loads of toys to use against foes, not to mention all of them can be upgraded for increased firepower, capacity, etc. The biggest issue people rightfully point out is the Partner ai. I highly recommend playing this game with a friend, even if they're not much of a gamer because the partner ai can sadly be difficult to handle. I'm not gonna rant on that too much, because I've personally found a lot of successful techniques with the ai partner (Sheva, but the same also applies to Chris when you play as her) that I would like to share:

1. When you start the game equip Sheva with a pistol and later shotgun.
2. Once you get 1 of 2 sniper weapons in the beginning chapters, swap out her shotgun with one of snipers. Her aiming is super accurate and will land headshots most of the time, but regardless it will do a lot of damage.
3. After a vehicle section you will unlock a stun rod, swap Sheva's pistol out for that, that way when she is in cover mode she will always have it out. This saves ammo as she ususally blows all of it, but the only ammo she will be using is sniper ammo now that the only other weapon she has to work with is a melee weapon. She will only use her sniper when set to attack mode in most cases.

4. Whenever you need her sniping skills to assist you, just summon her into attack mode and she will go nuts! 
5. As you upgrade your weapons, upgrade her sniper as well, that way she will be able to handle most enemies even as they get stronger when the game progresses.
6. Have patients with her and utilize her only when you feel it is necessary, sometimes trial and error is a necessary teacher when utilizing her.
7. Be sure to keep her out of harms way, especially when her health is low as it is very difficult to get to her and vice versa when their are enemies crowding around her.
8. Use encouraging words. When she gives you ammo, press B to thank her and when she saves your life press B as well. (Not actually necessary, just for fun.)

Things I wish I knew on my first playthrough...

1. Most weapons that are unlocked in the shop can also be found in the game's chapters if you look hard enough. There are a few exceptions... like the other two pistols, the stun rod, armor, and secret weapons that are only unlocked by fully upgrading the starter weapons.

2. Spent your money wisely... don't go in the shop and buy the first thing you see and don't upgrade a weapon you won't be using.

3. Look for riches! there are treasures hidden throughout the game that will increase your wealth, so have a keen eye!

4. Have fun!

Hope all of that information helps you!",1678765631,1678767006,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Perry, I do not consider myself a hardcore fan, but moreso as a casual fan of a universe/series that's cheesy and full of campy fun. So make of that what you will as you read my review. But, as someone who loves action/shooters this has got to be in my top 5 favorites of all time, and I'll explain why.

I've owned RE5 on my PS3, then my Xbox 360, and then my PC, and recently I've jumped into it again. Even for its age, the gameplay and level design hold up EXTREMELY well. Even for games that I thoroughly enjoy, I can have a hard time playing through the story missions and often find myself almost obligated to finish the game just so I can say that I did and move onto something else, but not RE5. I've beaten the story missions solo and coop literally countless times over the years, and it hardly feels tired or tedious to play through again and again.

Compared to modern titles and how bloated they've become with endless grinds, loot boxes, tacked-on RPG elements with RNG items, all the bugs and glitches, live service models etc. playing through old games like this are such refreshing experiences for how they provide complete and polished experiences that are actually worth your time and money. This game has everything you could want from a 3rd person shooter/action game:

- An exciting campaign that can be played solo or cooperatively.
- Levels that are designed in such a way to encourage replaying to achieve better rankings and acquiring loot to unlock more weapons.
- Versus mode for competitive online play.
- Bonus (DLC) levels with different characters and settings to expand the lore.
- Last, but certainly not least, my personal favorite game mode: MERCENARIES. This is a mix of time-trial, survival, and wave-based game modes that are fast-paced, intense, and fun as hell to play through as all the different characters who have unique load outs. It's an absolute blast to play and I wish every 3rd/1st person shooter had in some form.

Sure the story is standard RE nonsense, with campy/cringey dialogue and characters, but RE fans should be used to it. Even so, it's all in service for what I argue is one of THE best 3rd person shooter/action games ever made. PERIOD. I love RE4 for what it did for the genre, but RE5 refined and polished the gameplay to a mirrored shine, and to a point that I believe surpasses it's predecessor.

Bought it for my collection, I have 3 physical copies and then this one on steam, along with a digital copy on my switch.

After spending a decent amount of time on the game and completing the campaign with my partner, my mind has been changed about Resident Evil 5. The AI is still awful - keep that in mind. I can only recommend this game if you have another human to be your co-op partner.

With a friend or significant other or even a stranger, the game isn't that bad. A lot of it was actually really fun! There is a specific part at the end of the game to me that signals when the game actually becomes bad, but I won't spoil anything of course. I will say the boss fights aren't exactly what I'd call fun. The first two or three are, but the rest of the game...not so much. The game is full of a lot of b-movie action style moments, but it got a laugh out of me a few times. The lore is actually the thing I liked the most; the story of 5 is fantastic when integrating it into the Resident Evil timeline. The only thing I did not enjoy about the story was what they made a certain character into and how they, in my opinion, ruined her a bit...but that's for you to find out for yourself.

Hardcore Resident Evil fans! Take a look into this. Only if you have someone else to play with though - my best friend beat the game on his own, but said it was the least enjoyable thing he's done in a while. If you have someone to play with, go for it next time it's on sale! If not...maybe watch a plot recap.",1653247737,1678745844,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do.

Pros:
+fantastic and satisfying weapon upgrade system

+arcade shooting combined with collecting points and resources

+inventory management and sharing items with your partner

+big variety of weapons, enemies and bosses

+lots of bonus content and unlockables

+""Untold Stories Bundle"" is pretty good in term of content versus price DLC giving you two lenghty fun missions, Mercenaries Reunion gamemode, versus mode and two hands down the best costumes in the game

+The Mercenaries Reunion itself is definitely a highlight of whole DLC content allowing you to play on Mercenaries maps with new set of characters and their new fun in use equipment

+bosses have a great visual design...



Cons:
-...but many of them are just p*ss poor fights with way too many cutscenes and dull Quick Time Events, two of them are a just freaking dull turret sections

-the worst RE Final Boss fight in both story mode [spoiler] its just Wesker with ""drill arm"", no multiple transformations or anything ""cool"" about it (seriously, Resident Evil, I did expected way better end than this after RE 2, 3 and 4 final bosses. 

Its just a bit of walking, QTE's for 2 minutes and ""fight"" is over. Don't even bother shooting him, its a waste of bullets and time when doing QTE's will kill him faster and easier. 
Such a wasted potential.[/spoiler] 
and Lost in Nightmare DLC [spoiler] its just copy pasted Wesker fight from chapter 5 [/spoiler], both in term of design and gameplay thus far,

-Las Plagas in story mode are way too rare making you fight mostly human looking enemies with guns, Las Plagas cool, monsters cool, normal dudes with guns are not

-play this game in coop with a friend on Discord, otherwise you gonna have a really baaaaaad time due very, VERY terrible AI companion that is constantly wasting your health items, ammo, also that in-game chat quality is beyond terrible, 

-severe lack of good puzzles for a Resident Evil title



Overall I do recommend this game because its a great arcade, old school Third Person Shooter to coop with your friend. 

This world definitely need more fun arcade games such as this and Resident Evil 6.

I DO NOT recommend this game if you would had to play it solo or with random person on the internet via matchmaking.",1531813532,1678657522,True,3,0,0.549562692642211914,0,True,False,False

¨This was the second horror game I played as a child. It has some good-telling story about biovirus and his promoter Albert Wesker in Africa. You also meet with a woman, that you met in the other Resident Evils - Jill Valentine. Bosses here are decent, but could be better. Guns here are awesome, i cant lie.

This game is very recommended for speedrunners. If you are looking after some challenge, try this. If you are achievement speedrunner, if you´re SR for the shortest time, doesn´t matter. This game is for ALL SPEEDRUNNERS RECOMMENDED

Pros:
- Good graphics (For that age)
- Original places
- Main Characters are very interesting
- Very well made story DLCS
- Interesting collectible (BSAA trophy)
- Chris´s abs 

Cons:
- This game was on Windows LIVE (eww)
- AI partner is kinda retarded sometimes
- When playing on PC, it has pretty bad crosshair (Controller for better experience)

When I compare the mechanics of RE4 and RE5, I would prefer the former. 
While there are some differences in their features and functionalities, they both have their ups and downs. 

*RE4 has a lot of room to spare in its inventory while RE5 only has a 9-slot inventory. 
*RE4's inventory menu and map menu will temporarily pause the game while RE5 does not. 
*RE5 has default hotkeys from 1-9 that you can quickly use in your inventory which makes it more efficient. 
*RE5's map is only a minimap that can show a limited part of it which is useful but there's no map to fully show your current location and most of the maps that you are in, unlike RE4 where every entry to one destination has their own maps and can even be used to easily navigate. 
*RE4 movements are classic 3D style while RE5 is very clunky and usually hard to walk with your branded gaming mouse like you're using a generic one. It's better to use a gamepad for better gameplay. 

These are most of the things that I generally experienced while playing this game and while I have yet to finish RE5 due to a lot of things I've taken for granted from RE4, it's refreshing to see a woman character that will support you on your journey of this game. 

P.S. RE4 gameplay was mostly lonesome while RE5 from the start has already support for you.

It's clearly not the level design of stuff like 1, 2, 7, and 8, but also it didn't upset me that it was linear either. It's also a lot more actiony (obviously, if you don't know that, where have you been?) than a lot of the resident evils, but co op is always nice, there is a lot of camp, and the gameplay is satisfying enough to play through the game.

Typically you have enough resources to get through things and if you're good about it, you can store up some reserves for yourself, but still there are some parts that you might get stuck on depending on your difficulty and that can be annoying. Auto kill enemies that aren't built around stealthing around them are never good in any game.

This is an old game, but now it will run, Capcom finally decided to update the game, you don't need a DLL to run it anymore, they restored the SplitScreen so what, after 14 freaking years you can now play cooperative in the same PC with someone else as long as they have a controller.


This game is good, it aged well, better than RE6 however, there's some small things I wish they had done with the game with the last update, such as upgrading the buttons, adding an option to recognize DS4 controllers and DS5 controllers and changing the prompts anytime, and upgrading teh XBOX 360 prompts to XBOX One/Series prompts, since this game got re-releeases on PS4 and PS5 and Xone and Series. But it's capcom we're talking about, they won't do that.


RE4 already received an HD pack, and I do believe RE5 deserves the same love, the game is good looking but clearly we can see this is a 2009-2010 game, the textures doesn't hold up anymore. The good thing is that you will achieve 60fps easily in this.

The most difficult part to me to adapt with these old RE games from 4 and 5 are the Tank controls. In RE4 it was a bit easier because enemies would still fall back with a shotgun, but in this game, the enemies feels like they're stronger against shotguns, and they are smarter and more agressive than the Ganados from 4.

But in the end, from the old trilogy of Action games with very few and sparte jumpscares, this one is the one who aged the best, while RE4 OG is the one most loved by fans. 

They also added the best feature ever: The game now has an Assist mode for QTEs, that are activated to full auto from default.
If y ou want the original experience you can set that to Off, and if you want the assist version you can change that to the assist version, the OFF will be unforgiven like it always was: You didn't run fast enough pressing A? Bad for you. You pressed the wrong button? Your loss. You didn't see the QTE appearing at all? That's your problem. The Assist version  allows you to miss a button, it won't just assume you have pressed the wrong button and punish you, the game will still wait for you to input the right button or you die. But instead of just fucking you up for pressing B instead of A, it allows you to press A after you press B wrong.
The Auto is the best version: It allows you to WATCH the cutscenes without abruptly killing you because it was a QTE cutscene. That was a very annoying thing from 2004-2010 that thank god stoped after that. Now you can just watch it.

Not all QTEs were removed, but most of the annoying ones and cutscenes ones were.

What I find it strange here is that for some enemies or sequences, such as the crocodiles in the swamp raft, the QTE are automatic, which it wasn't needed, but for other enemies they still exist. such a certain bosses such as Oroboros. I believe they removed all insta-kill QTEs but let the non-insta kill ones. HOWEVER it
s iconsistent, for example: The chasing sequence with the car where you have to shot people on the bikes, they removed any QTEs you had to do on the curves, but in the Gigante battle, shortly after, you still have to Duck when he attacks you, for example.  But I can guarantee that any cutscene that is a insta-kill sentence on a QTE is removed on full auto. So yeah, it makes this game way more achievable for people who don't want to DESTROY their controllers.

In the end this is a good game, it could get a fan graphical patch since it's been aging a little bit to  a point you can see this is a PS3/Xbox360 game, and it's not hard to enhance it if Capcom wanted. But this is also a game  I woudln't mind having a Remake of it. Different from RE4, RE5 is a game they can change every single aspect of it, and I would love to have two different versions as long as they have the same time to play of course, I hate that new RE games such as RE8 are only 8 hours long. I love the 22-23 hours long RE games in the main campaign. Lemme be happy capcom! :D",1435091312,1678378965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game isn't bad, but in my quest to share older games with my better half, this was not a good experience for either of us. For me, it's obvious that the controls have aged rather poorly and both mouse/keyboard and controller felt floaty and inaccurate. For her, combat was tedious and frustrating. It was a step up from REV 2's ""player 2 doesn't have any weapons"" BS, but not by much. Ironically, what kept her invested was the story. She was aware of the game's lighter more action based tone going in, so she was open to and expecting some weirdness. But suffering through the gameplay to get to cutscenes isn't a great mindset to be in for any game, let alone RE5. So we ended up just watching the rest of the cutscenes on Youtube.
Fans of this series can definitely find enjoyment in replaying it (if they can tolerate the dated controls), but unfortunately I'm not one of them.

Resident Evil 5 has so many annoying and horrible design choices that make it a tedious annoyance to play. 
- There are numerous one-hit kill attacks from enemies that are not conveyed very well to the player.
- The inventory system is the worst inventory system of any of the non-tank controlling RE games.
- The AI ally is the worst AI ally in any RE game.
- The game is jank as hell. Various effects don't render at the same rate. The character models generally animate smoothly, but then the uroburos enemies have very jarring graphics because feels like they are locked at a lower framerate or something. They are a jittery mess.
- The game has some good ideas but just piss poor execution. For example, there is an elevator where you have to shoot people who are trying to stop the elevator you are on. That is a fine concept, but the elevator spins and you are intended to use the sniper rifle, but the elevator is spinning which is supposed to make it harder to aim, but the elevator is not spinning smoothly, it jitters. so as you are aiming your sniper your aim is jittering rather than smoothly moving, which makes it horrible to play.
- The enemies are bullet sponges. I literally used an ENTIRE INVENTORY of AK47 ammo on the final boss and he would not die (yes I was using the correct strategy). I did this 3 times and spent over 3 hours. Each time I ran out of ammo at which point I had no way to kill the boss and had to restart. Then I switched to shotgun and beat him first try. I don't understand. This must have been a glitch in the game that for some reason the AK47 can't kill the final boss?
- The puzzles are awful.
- The keyboard and mouse controls are terrible. The game was clearly designed for controller and they never fully flushed out how the mouse and keyboard controls should work. It kinda works, but there are just so many issues.

Special thanks to [i]RICK[/i] and [i]Anthony's[/i] ""Resident Evil 5 Quality of Life Fixes"" guide for helping me get this game running easily without Games For Windows Live and making this review even possible. I'll leave a link to the guide [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1533171339] here[/url]!

That being said, here's the review.

[u]Story + Characters (Possible Spoilers!)[/u]

[spoiler]Resident Evil 5 takes place four years after the events of Resident Evil 4. To make things short, the plot focuses on Chris Redfield (along with Sheva as a partner) arriving in Africa to investigate BOW-based illegal operations on behalf of the BSAA. This eventually develops into a revelation where Chris and Sheva have to stop a doomsday operation that is being led by none other than Albert Wesker.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]While most people have stated that the plot takes itself too seriously, it pretty much has to considering that RE5 is the climax between Chris' and Wesker's rivalry that goes back as far as RE1. There are less campy moments and the themes here are quite dark compared to other titles which is something that most fans weren't into at the time. There are practically no scary moments in this game, but I found the setting to be interesting since most viruses were derived from the Progenitor virus that originated from Africa and the story does give a lot focus on Umbrella's legacy which I felt RE4 detached itself from to be its own unique story.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]While most of the characters are okay for what they are, the two characters I have issues with are Sheva and Wesker. Sheva's backstory and motivations are quite believable, but the majority of her backstory is relegated to an essay-size file and is practically a background presence in most cutscenes. You could cut her out and little would change to the plot. Wesker is so cartoonishly evil and over the top in this game, it kind of comes off as bizarre if you compare this to his RE4 appearance, although it made sense to toss away Spencer and have Wesker become the main big baddie since we had to have a ""finale"" to the conflict between Chris and Wesker.[/spoiler]

[u]Gameplay[/u]

If you've seen other reviews compare this to RE4 a lot, that's because it really does play like RE4, but more smoothly. Basically, this is RE4's gameplay but slightly refined. Don't be mistaken though: this game is still [b]very fun[/b] despite its linearity. Although you still have tank controls, the game defaults to a different control system that allows you to strafe which is a ton better than the classic controls (recommended for new players).

With the continuation of the over-the-shoulder camera, RE5 adds new additions to interactions with enemies and more gimmicks. Some shots will stun enemies through head, arm, or leg shots which will open up enemies for melee prompts and even change depending on position (either from behind or in front of an enemy). Each melee attack can differ from where you shot a Majini and can even be chained with your partner if done correctly. 

There are even more enemies than before, but this game gives you a lot of ammunition in return while also balancing it out with the fact that your partner needs ammo too.

Bosses in RE5 are great on paper, but many of them have some gimmick to them that has you using an item or interaction to deal with them which tones down the difficulty of the fight considering the ""key"" to beating them is literally right next to them and is summed up as: luring them or someone being bait. Fighting a black tentacle monster that also has glowing orange weak spots? [i]Lead it to the furnace that's ahead.[/i] Fighting a giant bat with a tough shell? [i]Nearby barrels will have some mines that stun it so you can DPS its fleshy side.[/i] Going against a superhuman wearing a black trench coat for maximum douchebaggery? [i]There's a rocket launcher nearby that you can weaken him with.[/i]

RE5 sports a multitude of guns that have their own strengths over other guns in the respective set. Handguns, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, SMGs, Sniper Rifles, and more. A lot more work was put into making each gun equally useful throughout the game whereas in RE4, you usually switched them out for higher-tier guns as you progressed (early guns did have their own strengths too, but it was usually better to buy the next one in its type).

RE5 has a store system where you can buy certain types of ammo, buy/upgrade weapons, and other necessities. You can interact with the store any time outside of the main game, during restarts, or after completing a chapter. The Inventory system use a 9-slot system which every item in the game takes up one. Fine in solo since you can give items you can't grab to Sheva/Chris, but you'll typically see your inventory filled up on more than one occasion if you play Co-Op.

Although the issues with this game don't break it, it can be outright frustrating. 

[b]The AI Partner.[/b] While I feel like AI Sheva does well at engaging enemies with aimbot precision and using healing items when you're low, she is inconsistent at everything else. AI Sheva will mag-dump every enemy she comes across [i]regardless[/i] of the danger they actually pose (will still use a sniper rifle or magnum on weaker monsters), sometimes ignore you in tight situations, deny herself to using other weapons if you let her keep her peashooter pistol, stare at bosses, shoot at WESKER like a complete fool, and will require you to waste healing items on her after she puts herself in trouble. My advice? Give her a sniper rifle or automatic and put her on ""Cover"" mode. If you can, play with another player; your experience will be infinitely better.

If you didn't like enemies with ranged capabilities like crossbows or throwing weapons, you'll love the enemies with actual guns thrown at you. Personally, they are the worst enemies to deal with because your health whittles down so fast from bullets and there's often more than one. This issue is exacerbated in higher difficulties where a single burst can take all of your health. Beyond RE6, it's no wonder Capcom didn't do enemies with guns again.

[u]Graphics & Sound[/u]

Before the implementation of the RE engine in Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, I think Resident Evil 5 is the best looking action-era Resident Evil game. It's definitely a huge improvement over RE4 and looks even better than it's successor, Resident Evil 6. If you've got a good computer, you can run this at max graphics and make most scenes look quite stunning. The only issue is that the green filter feels awfully saturated in the early parts of the game and overpowers any other color in the game at times.

Sounds are distinct and on point. There are audio cues from enemies to warn you and guns sound appropriate according to their type. Soundtrack is decent, but I wouldn't say it's memorable like RE1's or RE4's. It's there and it matches with the setting at least.

[u]Conclusion[/u]

Overall, while RE5 has some rough edges, it's still an enjoyable Resident Evil action game among its trilogy and arguably among of the funnest in the series due to it's Co-Op option and refined gameplay qualities taken from the iconic Resident Evil 4. While it might not be an immediate buy for fans who want a survival horror experience similar to RE1 or RE7, I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a mix of action in their horror game.

didn't even finished it yet, will update this trash game review after

UPDATE:
Greetings!
I must say that i bought and played this game way after i actually bought it, so my review will be based on the most recent gameplay provided by Resident Evil 5.
Having more than 9.7 hours in this game i can safely say that this is perhaps one of the worst Resident Evil Games, the multitude of stupid bosses ; they way you can one shot bosses with an rpg ; being disconnect all the fucking time and losing achievements over that; fuck uruboros; provided by KONAMI is awful and the hardwork of some very not so talented  individual this is without a doubt a game to never buy even years after its release, you WILL regret buying it if you are a fan of RESIDENT EVIL and have the desire to dive deep inside depression then this is the best game out there. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it.

If you have a friend to grab for some co-op, it makes it much more enjoyable. The Untold Stories DLC is also very enjoyable, but very short. I know Ill come back to this game in the future, I always do.

It's co-op heaven. Resident Evil 5 was built from the ground up with co-op in mind. You can team up with a friend and take on the hordes of infected together, making for a more enjoyable and immersive experience.

The graphics are impressive. Resident Evil 5 is a beautiful game with stunning visuals and detailed character models. The environments are richly detailed, from the dusty streets of a small African town to the dark and creepy catacombs beneath a massive oil refinery.

The gameplay is fast and frantic. Resident Evil 5 is a game that will keep you on your toes. You'll need quick reflexes and a steady aim to take down the zombie horde, and the game's intense action sequences will have you sweating bullets.

It has a great story. Resident Evil 5 has a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It follows the adventures of Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar as they investigate a dangerous new virus that threatens to spread across the world.

The replay value is high. Once you've beaten the game, there are plenty of reasons to keep playing. You can try to beat your best time on each level, collect all of the hidden treasures, or tackle the game on a higher difficulty level.

So if you're in the mood for some zombie-slaying action with a buddy, look no further than Resident Evil 5. Just make sure you have plenty of ammo and a strong stomach for all the gruesome zombie deaths!",1676991381,1676991381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's because co-op with a competent partner reveals this game's potential, and can even make the main campaign a fun experience. Otherwise you're looking at a vapid 9-ish hour chore to post-game (which is the only portion that is enjoyable solo). Depending on how much you loved re4, chances are your contempt for the main campaign can only worsen.

As mentioned, post-campaign is where things truly takes off, as The Mercenaries and Mercs Reunion minigames take full advantage of re5's direction, which is SHOOT PUNCH COMBO KILL. Fun solo, even better co-op, and while there are still players out there in match making, they are few and far between.

---

Graphics || 7/10 - Dated by todays standards but since it's a generation removed from the previous entry in the series, it looks markedly better, ESP the PC version. Use a re-shade program for even better graphical fidelity.

Performance/Bugs || 9/10 - The game for the most part* runs flawless at maximum settings on modern hardware, as it's obviously dated on DX9. The engine caps out at 120FPS. You will never dip if you have the hardware to support it.

*There is one major soft-lock bug in the game on Chapter 6-1 that you will almost certainly encounter on the PC version of the game, for a workaround, please see the Youtube link forthcoming; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-D2mKrz0Uw&ab_channel=Carlos

Please note while this fix is still 100% valid (CAPCOM is never going to fix this bug) understand that it will take some trial and error to eventually get the event in question to occur so you can progress through the chapter.

Gameplay || 8/10 - The forced COOP in single player is a major pain-point in this game as the AI is atrocious and will find itself in hilariously stupid situations, waste ammo, and generally be borderline useless. There are some tricks to combat this to some extent, such as equip a stun-baton and use the companion as an armory for ammo/healing items. Obviously, the game is designed to be played with a friend/someone else, and ultimately it's where it really shines if you're able to do so. 9/10 in COOP. 8/10 in SP. The formula that RE4 established is expanded upon and refined in this title.

The removal of the attache-case sadly is obnoxious and you're constrained with limited resource slots for both characters. I don't know if this was a memory issue, or simply to keep the flow of gameplay moving so one player didn't have to deal with the other micro-managing their inventory like the previous game. More likely the latter then the former. Eventually you'll learn to accept it and move forward.

The gunplay in RE5 is MARKEDLY improved from RE4. ESP for mouse/keyboard users.

Controls || 7.5/10 - See above. Markedly improved controls for mouse/keyboard in this game over it's previous entry. Aiming feels precise and purposeful. Movement is also improved from the previous game by leaps and bounds. You can of course still opt for a controller if you choose to do so.

Story || 8/10 - The legacy of Chris Redfield and Wesker continues in this entry. It's solid. Wesker could very well be the best CAPCOM antagonist in the history of the company. I'd argue the story in this is better then RE4 for Wesker alone. Hes a much more compelling antagonist compared to Saddler.

Sound || 8/10 - Sound design in this game is on par with RE4, no better, no worse. It also has one of the best boss themes in the history of the franchise at the end of the game, and boss fights, for that matter.

Replay Value || Extremely High - The game-length for any one playthrough will take you multiple hours for your first casual playthrough. Couple this with multiple scoring modes (3 to start with), DLC, & MERCS and you have a game that you can play for countless hours. I'll be going back to play on professional eventually.

Worth every penny for the deluxe version of the game. ESP. on sale.

8/10

BRING ON REMAKE 4.

So getting RE 5 running in 2022 and forward is a bit complicated and is something Capcom should have fixed by now.
Here's what I did to make it work for me, in the order I made them in:
1. Installed BH5-Fixes
2. Installed LAA 4GB Patch
Before this point the game still didn't launch..
3. In NVIDIA Controlpanel I changed perform scaling from display to GPU in the adjust desktop size and position tab. (You probably want to change this back to GPU when you're done playing RE5.. IDK)

At this point the game booted fine :)

I also recommend installing Resident Evil 5 - Awakening - True Colour. The green tint that the vanilla game is plagued by has aged like milk.

- Voice acting is top notch
- Lots of post game content, including 2 story DLCs and Mercenaries mode.
- Plenty of unlockables, keeping you pushing for those S ranks
- The vast majority of cut scenes are rendered in-engine
- Coop play is seamless and makes playing with a friend an absolute blast

The Bad:
- Game leans more into action than horror/survival, when compared to previous RE games
- Some control quirks with the keyboard and mouse
- Games For Windows Live
- No way to remove the default colour filter

The Ugly:
- Versus mode is mostly dead, understandable for a game of this age

for those who havent played the game and have played its older series, it doesnt compare story wise, but upgrading the gun is what gets you through. finding treasure and money throughout the game is the best part to me quite honestly. gun upgrades in general just make the game so much more fun.

this goes for the crowd who've probably only played the newer series of resident evils as well. just take this one down the thousands of notches scary brings to the new ones.., because this game... isnt scary.

[i]Resident Evil[/i] is a third person shooter. The story takes place after the events of [i]Resident Evil 4[/i]. Chris Redfield will be sent to Kijuju in West Africa on a BSAA fact-finding mission. The objective will be to capture Irving, a guy who has dedicated himself to trafficking bio-organic weapons known as B.O.W. He'll have the help of Sheva Alomar, who is also part of the BSAA anti-terrorist group. Both main characters will realize that Tricell, whose bosses are Wesker and his helper Excella, is behind all this. Since the pharmaceutical company has made experiments with the aim of releasing a biological weapon worldwide, «Uroboros virus». An assumption by Wesker in which he will create a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva will stop the villain of the movie in order to put an end to his plans.

The Resident Evil games have that atmospheric and interactive movie vibe. However, this fifth game in a row is quite a departure from its predecessors. Terror turned into adventure and survival into action. Some Resident Evil 4 mechanics are present in this game. Although it's in this where we can feel constant and uninterrupted action. The construction of the narrative adds dynamism to the game. We have somewhat exaggerated characters, but always preserving the role between avenger and villain. We'll have friendly characters like Josh and Sheva; vengeful and angry characters like Chris; and an antagonist with a God complex. We will feel that we are submerged in a special operations. Taking us from the anti-bioterrorism plot to the drama between Jill, Wesker and Chris. 

That without forgetting the design of each scenario in which the characters develop and unfold. The maps present different places, from the villages to the industrial zones. It adds that exotic aspect, like seeing vegetation in some places like the swamp or the caves. We will play in environments with desert-like lighting, with a contrast in dark and abandoned places. It's always worth pointing out that the game looks like a movie. We will have movie clips wrapped up in intense combat, as well as revelations of what happened to our characters. Including the quick time events, the interactive cinema which sparks a vibrant adventure with a lot of verve. Like the rock scene, it was quite a show.

[b]Playability[/b] 8/10

The gameplay mechanics is focused on constant action. This is due to elements imported from its predecessor. We'll be playing with a player or the AI of a character that we did not choose. If it is the AI, it will help us at all times; but its intelligence is bad since in high difficulties, we will die frequently. However, what is added in this game is the mechanics of [i]partnership[/i], that is, cooperation. Instead of offering an atmosphere of fear, it presents a diversity of action tensions. The game consists of shooting. We'll get supplies in the wooden boxes, in some places and what the enemies drop. The number of spaces in our inventory is reduced, but in the item box we can organize all our objects. We can only use that item box after each chapter or when restarting a checkpoint. Something that is familiar is the sale of jewellery to get money to buy-upgrade weapons. Also enemies will drop money or jewels. 

By following the playable mechanics of its predecessor, the use of hits against enemies and generating a chain of combos have been incorporated and improved. Enemies now have more weak points to interact with, and even do duo-combos thanks to the partner assist. The partner will be crucial in the game. By adding the quick time events, the interactive kinematics, each character presses a certain action in a corresponding time, that is, action per turn. As well as the partner will help us to revive, interact with other objects and help to cross to the other side, such as the doors that depend on both to be entered. 


[b]Music and FX[/b] 8/10

There is not much to talk about the soundtrack. The entire game uses ambient music at certain times. Or in some moments the game uses sounds like in the main menu or when activating a horde. Each object and triggering has musical sound. Perhaps one of the best pieces we can hear is in the introduction of the game. This is a female choir, world music type, with tribal elements of African music. Or we can emphasize the example of ambient music that we listen in the save games. Many of the sounds and musical fragments performed in loop are between horror dark ambient and ritualistic dark ambient with which both offers a substance of the enigmatic and unknown. As well as some orchestral piece perceived when dealing with a boss. Our tour will be done in silence. We'll often be interrupted by those sounds and music, mainly in the moments of action. At that moment: energetic and explosive music is released, like action movies. But other times, if we pay attention, we'll listen creepy and sinister music surrounding us. Although that music is drowned out by the frenetic intensity of the game. It would have been a good idea to consider tribal rhythms from African music for the entire soundtrack.

[b]Duration[/b] 9/10

The game is integrated by 6 chapters. In turn, it is made up of parts of two or three. The story is linear and we can do some digging to find documents that tell the story; we will find jewellery, BSAA emblems and some hidden Easter eggs. The game can be played in its four difficulties. The two high difficulties are unlocked by playing the previous one. That way the game can last between 9 to 10 hours, or even more. It depends on the player, of course. By having that aspect of a movie, the desire to play it one more time always returns. It has that air of re-playability. We must include other overtime in the two DLC games. The first allows us to taste the survival atmosphere in the classic Resident Evil style. While the second complements the main story from the point of view of Jill and Josh. There are two other game modes, versus (a forgotten mode) and mercenaries’ mode (a classic among minigames). This last mode can also be played with another player, although it can also be played solo. This is a different version of Resident Evil, a game in the style of an action movie. A game recommended for who like action, shooting games and the execution of a chain of combos in a row.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Co-op mode
- Incredible graphics
- Replayable finished chapters
- Return of Chris Redfield in the first RE game
- Return of the best antagonist ""Albert Wesker""
- New character ""Sheva Alomar"" represent as new Chris partner

- Added new melee attacks
- New and upgradable weapons
- New and extreme challenges
- Bonus contents to buy costumes, filters and infinite ammo
- The mercenaries mode
- Easy to get used at the gameplay
- Modifiable PC Controls

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Stupid mindless AI (Sheva or Chris)
- Racist manner of white people killing black people in Africa
- Plots are full of cliché that sometimes doesn't make any sense
- Majini's nasty attacks are pretty much similar to RE4 ganados
- Enemies are filled with bullet-spongey which makes it hard to initiate melee attacks.
- Wesker's dodge from Agents at The Matrix movie style
- Small scene showing Sheva's ass and Jill's crotch
- Too many QTE's breaking the game replayability.

The story is not bad though RE6 is much better imo. But there's a some nice plot twist. The problem is with the programme itself.
To begin with, I struggle to open this game with a win 11 gaming laptop. After several tries I finally solved the problem by replacing some files provided by a youtube guy. No help from the official websites, updates wtever.
Now comes the combat part. I dunno who invented this ""hugely decrease mouse sensitivity while moving and aiming"", but it surely is stupid af. I picked ""assisted"" and I'm not ashamed of it, since I strongly feel that the challenging part doesn't come from the monsters but the control itself. 
But the critical point where I decided to give this a negative review comes at 5-2. Even on assisted mode at the first tries I emptied all my bullets, charged the flamethrower like 10 times and got no hope. I was like wtf and obviously googled. I got a surprised solution: if you set the forced FPS higher than 30fps (60fps or unlimited), the flamethrower damage would not be registered correctly. I put it to 30fps, experienced a laggy but far easier fight, finally beating the boss, and thus confirming the bug is indeed in the fps. Most blizzard shit I've heard. And with that struggle I'm putting a not recommended on this game, along with other smaller bugs.
Music and graphics are passable, not super good nor bad.

Unfortunately, this port is an absolute mess.

First of all, you need to download Games For Microsoft Live (GFWL), which Microsoft no longer supports. The redistributed installer that comes with the game is broken, forcing you to go through a third-party site just to get an out-dated piece of software running which is necessary to launch the game. You would think that either Capcom or Steam would find a way to port this game without using GFWL, but no. So right from the start, it's annoying.

Once you are able to get the game to launch, don't even bother using mouse and key controls. It just feels sloppy and uninviting.

This is simply one of those cash-grab ports for old games that has gotten little to no updates for modern operating systems. The fact that the user has to rely on third party websites to install out of date Microsoft software just to get the game to run is sad.

Not worth the money for the hoops you have to jump through just to launch it.",1673519339,1673519339,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a RE game this game falls flat harder than a toddler tossed from a 15th story apartment. There is absolutely no psych/atmospheric horror elements you'd associate with the franchise. There are some cheap jumpscare moments but even that is mild. 
The game plays more like a really terrible third person shooter.
Now it all flips if you've got a friend to play the game with you. Its still not a good game but you can atleast have a few laughs  if you play that way. So really thats the only scenario in which I can recommend this game, the scenario in which you can enjoy it because its so bad its good.

1. Right click the game in your Steam Library
2. Click Properties, Local Files, Browse.
3. click, Redist then gfwlivesetup.exe
This will run a setup but should fail, check the directory folder (redist) for two additional files.
You're looking for two more executables.
- gfwliveclient
- xbl(something)
The xbl-thing installs some small encoder file. The second will correctly install the client for Games for Windows Live.
4. After installing both the game should run. 

IF YOU CANNOT FIND the files after running the gfwlivesetup.exe: 
5. Press Windows+R for the Run command prompt. 
6. Type, ""%appdata% and click ok.
7. Navagate back one directory to the AppData folder, (if you are automatically moved into the Roaming directory)
8. Click, Local, Microsoft, GFWLive, Downloads. 
Here you should see 3-4 files. 
The xbl, the original setup, the client, and one more file. 
9. Just install the same files as in step 3. the xbl first then the client.
(The reason I don't remember the names is because once you install them they no longer show up for me.) 
10. After installing both the game should run. 

If you STILL cannot locate the files. Run the gfwlivesetup and keep the window open and check both directories. For some reason the other executables sometimes only show up when the setup is running.

The MERCENARIES mode is SUPERB!
Has great longevity. You can play for YEARS~!
If you learn how to play, then the Mercenaries mode becomes an ongoing challenge.

Whether or not to be ranking high on the leader boards, personal progression is rewarding in this game, because it is a challenge.

The time bonus mechanics of this classic MERCENARIES makes it much more fun than any of the newer mercenaries in recent RE games.

Features Albert Wesker the super villain who can dash at lightning speed and knee enemies!

Ultimate abilities make this character better than ANY other RE character!

Reunion mode of Mercenaries has heaps of characters too.

Bonus NO MERCY edition with 400 enemies in each map.



This game is a must have for all RE fans!

NOTE: If you have any problems starting the game, please install this patch.

It’s a mission-based co-op third person shooter, with a puzzle or two here and there. That may be all you need to know to determine whether it’s a good Resident Evil game. So with that in mind, here are my thoughts about whether it’s a good game in general:

Pros
+ Some boss fights are pretty fun
+ Lots of campiness (may be a con for some)

Cons
- Sometimes unclear mechanics (ex. There’s a boss with weak points that all look the same and only some of them actually damage the boss)
- Lots of wasted ammo on unkillable enemies or parts where you’re trying to figure out said mechanics
- All enemies are bullet sponges (headshots can actually make it worse!) and if you don’t know how to kill them with minimal bullets (the game doesn’t tell you) you won’t have too many bullets because your ammo persists through missions
- Boss fights feel way too long (in single player), but are generally not that difficult so it’s kind of annoying that they take so long
- Your co-op AI partner is an idiot- wasting ammo, not staying with you, etc. I found it least frustrating just using her as a mule

At the end of the day I would say this game tries to do a bunch of stuff that kinda fails in the execution. A remake might make a really solid game and improve some of those frustrations, but there’s just too much stuff to forgive to recommend as is.

Not as good as RE4 from a design standpoint, but it still has the same great gameplay loop from that game, which means there is plenty of fun to be had.

It should be noted however that Resident Evil 5 is fun, but it's not scary. Which is unfortunate as the Resident Evil series has always had a reputation for being scary. So just remember that this game has many fun moments despite not being scary like prior games in the series.

Resident Evil 5 is the fifth installment in the Resident Evil series, and it is a horror-themed action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom. The game was released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows.

The game follows Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar, two members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), as they investigate a terrorist threat in Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. The game features a third-person shooter-style gameplay, with the player controlling either Chris or Sheva as they battle against hordes of enemies. The game also features cooperative play, allowing two players to play the game together.

The game's story is set in the fictional African region of Kijuju, where a terrorist group is attempting to spread a new virus. Chris and Sheva must investigate the situation and put a stop to the terrorists' plans. Along the way, they must battle against hordes of enemies, including the infected Majini, as well as the powerful Uroboros creature.

The game features a variety of weapons, including handguns, shotguns, rifles, and explosives. The player can also use melee weapons, such as knives and axes, to take down enemies. The game also features a variety of puzzles, which the player must solve in order to progress through the game.

The graphics in Resident Evil 5 are impressive, with detailed environments and characters. The game also features a variety of special effects, such as explosions and fire. The sound effects are also well done, with a variety of sound effects for each weapon and enemy.

Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent game. The story is engaging, the gameplay is intense, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. The game also features cooperative play, allowing two players to play the game together. If you're a fan of the Resident Evil series, or if you're looking for an intense action-adventure game, then Resident Evil 5 is definitely worth checking out.",1670551717,1670551717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think this game would have been so much better if they had stuck to their guns and made it a single player game where you ONLY played as Chris.  We all know by now that Sheva was not planned.  If you play without a friend, you are dooming yourself to frustration.  The AI partner is THAT bad.

Even with a friend though, this game is poorly balanced, limp, and an embarrassment.  The weapons compared to RE4 should be criminal.  This game, at least before RE6 came out, was also peak Gen 7 gaming.  This means tons of QTEs and tons of cutscenes.  RE4 had QTEs as well, but it was novel and not as frequent as its later sequels would become.  Not to mention this game oversells the fact that CO-OP is a must.  It feels like such an over correction.  Hence what I said at the beginning of this review.  They should have ignored the knee-jerk reaction and designed the game as they originally intended.

Ever since removing games for windows live, it's a roll of the dice if the connection works.  Unfortunately Capcom never went back to properly fix this on steam.  Also the game sorely needs the SWEET FX mod and the FOV mod.  Otherwise, it's lacking in color and the FOV is just far too close.

I can't recommend it compared to other games in the series.  I can't recommend 6 either.",1670530690,1670530690,False,1,0,0.526046097278594971,0,True,False,False

21690,127948568,76561197993402335,0,33,5215,0,5215,1669709429,"Resident Evil 5 is a original entry in the Resident Evil series, attempting to blend the gameplay style of its popular predecessor, Resident Evil 4, with many other gameplay features redolent of action-shooter titles it shared its release period with. With this fusion, RE5 is a far more action oriented title, even as compared to RE4, which may not necessarily be the games benefit for returning fans, particularily those who enjoyed the slower, more strongly horror themed games in the series. That said, Resident Evil 5 is fun, and does carry with it a great deal of the B-Movie vibe and camp that have been present throughout the series.

Chris, 'Don't Drop the Weights', Redfield is our main action hero, returning from the first game. However, RE5's focus on cooperative gameplay means that we have a new partner, the charming and confident Sheva Alomar. Like many action games released in the same time period as RE5, particularily those on services like Xbox Live, the game features a 'parnters-shooter' dynamic, with the clear intention of having two players as a duo. While being able to play a Resident Evil game with a friend, a part from hot seat gaming, is fun and novel experience, it does circumvent the games ability to engender fear and loneliness, two major ambient themes which were present in the most previous titles. With this, RE5 has to effectively change its overall style, changing core elements of the game's overall structure and level design.

Chris and Sheva as members of a newly formed Anti Bio-terrorism force will be tracking down a black market arms dealer, Irving, while also uncovering a conspiracy decades in the making. Investigative players will be able to uncover secrets as to the origins of Umbrella, and its original purpose in West Africa, as well as what new shadowy forces covet there.

Returning players will find RE5's gameplay most similar to RE4, with a few noticable changes. Once again players have tanky controls, a red laser sight for targeting, and a third preson over the shoulder perspective. Whoever is playing Sheva may be a little disoriented, as which shoulder the player looks over changes between her and Chris, with Chris having the more familiar of the two. Unlike RE4, however, RE5's inventory is highly limited, instead of the Attache Case. This feels like a downgrade for me, but is necessary to facilitate several key aspects of the games action.

Chris and Sheva each have a 3x3 inventory. By assigning hot keys based on inventory position, players can quickly swap between weapons using the D-Pad. Players can also pass items between each other, creating an 18 slot inventory split between the two. For those playing on their own, this will likely result in Sheva carrying extra ammo, while you carry extra weapons.

Over the course of the game you'll collect a multitude of weapons, starting with pistols and followed by, machine guns, rifles, and magnums. There are also special weapons like the grendade launcher and RPG. One the issues with this inventory arrangement's size is that to have all these weapons you'll need to sacrifice slots, which leaves less room for ammo and healing items. However, the size of an item has no bearing on the number of slots used. For example, in RE4 a pistol may take up a 2x3 spot in the attache case while an ammo stack takes 2x1. In RE5 an RPG and a single egg are the same size. This quickly leads to either having no ammo, or having to throw out supplies.

Apart from these changes, the gunplay itself is the same as RE4, and so is very fun, very fluid, and very well done. Enemies are reactive, and you are rewarded for marksmanship. Combat is frequent, frantic, and full of enemies. Indeed, after the first zombie, a sort of call back to RE4, the very next fight and the final fight in the first mission are large hordes of enemies. Similar group ambushes are not infrequent. The number and size of many fights is noticably greater, almost certainly to improve the experience with a second player. With the AI, however, this is not quite so ideal a case.

The partner's AI is spotty. More than a few times Sheva locked sights on an enemies head with perfect accuracy. This was doubly impressive because I was inbetween her and the target at the time, though that did not stop her. This doesn't damage the player, but it does squander ammunition. Like wise, there are times where the players should split, with one baiting, while the other attacks a weak point. This bait and strike teamwork is surely a worthy experience that the AI, sadly, has trouble executing. That said, I still beat the game on Professional alone, so I wouldn't consider this to be a game ending fault.

Most enemies are fun to fight, and there are some interesting boss fights through out. However, some bosses I found somewhat lack luster in their design, particularily the 'Uroboros' type bosses, whose writhing tentacular design while conceptually interesting, did not resonate well with me. Other bosses have specific mechanics which need to be learned, some of which can be frustrating when first facing them. Still, there are some interesting designs through out the various BOW's you will fight.

We'll see several familiar faces besides Chris', while the new character's introduced have their own charms. Unfortunately, RE5's faster pace and leaves less time to develop these characters. This brevity also ties into another aspect of the game's design. Rather than a single continuous survival experience, each chapter and level can be selected and replayed from the start, with players recieving a ranking based on their time, deaths, kills, and accuracy, at the end. In between chapters, and whenever a player restarts they can access a RE1-3 item box, store, and upgrade menu. This is allowed even in the middle of a level. While convient, and a means to prevent soft locking a player mid game, it kills most any chance of a true survival horror experience.

This makes surviving a level incredibly easy. Part of RE's survival horror charm is not just challenging enemies and bosses, but circumventing them while using minimal supplies. Each one you used was one you would not have later, and bore real consequence. With RE5, you can replay the first 5 minutes of one of the early levels to get an RPG for free, and one-shot nearly every boss inbetween you and the end game, if you really want to. This open replay and management system re-contextualizes the main gameplay completely, changing the game from a hybrid survival-action game into a horror themed action game alone.

Levels themselves cover a number of interesting and locations. A derelict African towship, caught in the grips of a BOW outbreak disguised as an extremist movement, orchestrated by corporate interests. Swamp Lands and Subterrean African Ruins, whose displaced native populace are the victims of Umbrella. Laboratories and an Industrial Freighter make up the last areas, fitting in with the three part structure of most RE level progression. Filled with grime, metal, and some of the most large scale bosses the series has ever had. The settings for each mission are interesting, following RE4's notable departure from America to explore foreign terrain. Indeed, the entire game bears a strong message against the evils of greed and conquest by foreign powers, and the abuses they wreak indescriminately on native populaces.

By the end of my time with RE5, I had re-run the game enough times that I could zoom through levels, picking off enemies easily with super-upgraded weapons. It was all very fun, but not very challenging. As a returning fan of the series, I would say that is the main feeling I came away with for RE5. It marks the major departure from survival horror in the main series which would permeate into following titles, until the next major revamp with RE7. Fun, bright, brief, best with a friend, though not requiring one, RE5 is a fun is flawed addition to the RE series.",1670197404,1670197404,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Even on the lowest difficulty can at times provide a challenge.  Copious amounts of lore and another stellar story in the series.  QTE sequences come out of nowhere and can result in instant death if you're not paying attention.  Once again, great weaponry, upgrades and a good selection of load-outs.  I thought the A.I. was very good and provided a great coop experience to single player.

I had significant issues playing with a mouse.  I found that the game's engine, whether purposely or not, could not keep up with high speed turning.  I used a controller which the game originally intended being a console port.

Despite the latest version ported to steamworks I had trouble launching the game which for some reason tried to launch GFWL.  Even if you don't have this issue I would recommend this guide containing QOL fixes.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1533171339  The guide includes an FOV fix but the FOV is still awful and something you ultimately may not be able to tolerate.  The GFWL version is available from the game's beta tab.  You can find the password in the forums.  The older more functional FOV fixes will only work on that version.

Artificial turn speed is built into the game and it's slow.  Many of the set pieces and overall game-play require usage of the quick turn function down+A.

It's not clear for first time players,  put your weapons in inventory slots up, down, left and right.  They will then be accessible from the d-pad.  Another oddity is that in the Organize screen there is an inventory move function but no inventory move function appears while in game however you can drag items around with your mouse even if using a controller.

RE5 is all action, no horror. That might be disappointing to some people, and I understand, I prefer Survival Horror RE too, but RE5 does the action extremely well & it keeps you engaged all the way through. 

In the beginning of RE5, mainly Chapter 1, I was quite disappointed. The game was nearly a full copy & paste of RE4 in my eyes. The gameplay was exactly the same, the enemies were exactly the same just with some new designs, & the environment was a bit similar. I thought RE5 was just trying to repeat the success RE4 saw by just doing the exact same thing again. Even the Las Plagas returns in 5, I thought it was just gonna be 4 with Chris instead of Leon. Well, besides Chapter 1 and maybe a little of 2, I was wrong. The game stays the same as 4 mechanically, but that isn't a bad thing in my opinion. RE4 played really well so I don't see the issue in repeating it's mechanics. The farther you get into RE5, the more it grows it's own personality. It really starts to become it's own thing & separate itself from RE4, which is very nice. I am glad they didn't just repeat RE4 entirely just to repeat that success.

RE5 introduces Chris Redfield's new BSAA Partner, Sheva. Her character is really sweet & I really enjoyed her presence. She works like Ashley in RE4, except she can actually fight! Of course, since she's an agent of the BSAA, she is able to use weapons and fight for herself. She isn't defenseless like Ashley.
If you played Revelations, you know about Chris's partner in that game, Jessica. She was really annoying in my opinion, but Sheva is not. Sheva is sweet & is a nice presence.

Obviously, Chris Redfield is back in RE5. He is as awesome as ever in this game, it's definitely a great iteration of him. He's a complete badass & he also looks great. They did a great job with Chris in this game & it's a good continuation of his character.
His mission in this game is his own. He is assigned a task from the BSAA in the beginning, but it gets called off. Chris doesn't listen & continues with Sheva for his own motives. To figure out what is going on to the people in this community, how it relates to the ""Kennedy Report"" of Las Plagas and finally, to find an old friend who was presumed dead...

His final enemy is a familiar face who has some... interesting abilities. Surely not human.

RE5 might be a bit confusing without the knowledge of old RE game, RESIDENT EVIL: CODE VERONICA. I recommend at least watching a recap of that game as I did, as there is a big thing in this game that will definitely confuse you without the knowledge of RE:CV.

There is also another game that takes place in between RE4 & RE5. It stars Chris Redfield & Jill Valentine, and is a big adventure that happens pre-RE5. The game is RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS. RE5 does not really mention Revelations at all since Revelations was a game made after 5 to put some events before 5 happens. Even though RE5 does not mention Revelations at all, I recommend you play it before 5 as it builds on the world of RE & is another tragic event. Plus, it's more Chris Redfield & Jill Valentine, who wants to miss out on that?

Overall, RE5 might be a bit disappointing in the very beginning. It feels like a full repeat of RE4, but trust me, as you get farther, RE5 really comes into it's own & gains it's own personality. I really liked it. As I said, I don't know if that's an unpopular opinion but I don't care. It's fun, engaging, tells a good story, and is more Chris Redfield content. Yes, more Chris is a reason. Chris is great.

I recommend everyone play RE5, but definitely play RE4 beforehand, watch a recap on RE:CV (or just play if you really want) and possibly play Revelations beforehand, but Revelations isn't necessary, more of a bonus. CV & 4 are needed to understand.

RE4 & Village are currently tied for my favorite RE game, and RE5 is a little under that. The game is good, but not to the level of 4 & 8 in my opinion. I still really enjoyed it, and I hope you do too.

So the question now is was it worth it? Well, yes and no. I was nervous to touch any Resident Evil game considering that I knew nothing about the videogame series let alone the games that are over a decade old but I remember 5 from watching older YouTube videos as a child and figured I'd give it a try. 

I understand that this game is over a decade old but I immediately noticed problems before the game even started. Thanks to outdated dinosaur software known as ""Games for Windows LIVE"" I was forced to install it manually before the game could launch which ticked me off to say the least. Thankfully though, the game worked and my first playthrough was very fun. I enjoyed the gunplay and two-player co-op despite the wonky controls and I really liked the fact I was finally playing a Resident Evil title. However, there were times that excitement was overtaken with moments of frustration and annoyance at several moments in the game.

The bossfights were very fun and interesting in terms of creativity but they get old very quickly. What do I mean by this? Many simply consist of shooting the boss in the head until it dies and depending on the boss this can take a very long time. Further, some bosses require a specific strategy to kill them and if you are a first-time player you may not fully realize this because the game doesn't show you. There were many moments where I was wasting time shooting at the enemy boss until I eventually got close to them and THEN realized how to actually defeat them. This was most notable in the very final bossfight which was very unclear on where I was to go and how to proceed. My most frustrating, however, had to be the second Uroboros fight. The game clearly gives you a flamethrower with the intent of having you set the monster on fire but I ended up doing this so many times to no avail. During several bossfights, due to confusion, I was forced to google tutorials when I thought I was getting nowhere. Sometimes I was and sometimes I wasn't. I ended up only defeating the Uroboros by spending $10k on an RPG that took it out in one hit because I simply did not want to fight it anymore. 

Other issues I have with the game are it's bugs and glitches. Enemies at times get stuck behind walls or barriers and in some cases this halts progressing certain levels. The worst offender was in Chapter 6-1 where Sheva gets trapped under a cargo cage. An enemy is supposed to spawn that drops a keycard, but a common glitch here involves the enemy simply not dropping from the platform they are supposed to and just running around in circles where the shadow is clearly visible. After some time I was able to find a fix for it, which again required going OUTSIDE the videogame to do and shooting a button in the level multiple times but without doing this I wouldn't have been able to finish the level. Even restarting it didn't work. In another case an axe-wielding enemy would follow me only to get stuck with it's feet still moving so I would have to stop and go back towards it in order for it to keep moving towards me again. 

There were multiple times throughout my playthrough that I had to exit the game to figure out how to deal with a problem. For a very linear game that came out in 2009 that's about shooting zombies I did not think this was something I should've had to do and when I realized I had no choice I began to get frustrated. I understand looking up a tutorial to beat a specific boss in a game like Elden Ring or Dark Souls that depends more on strategy rather than game mechanics, but I don't understand being FORCED to look up a walkthrough video because the game chooses not to reveal the very way to defeat the boss (IE going up and pressing a key for instance). If you've played the game once before most of these issues are not really as big of a deal but if you're trying to play for the first time WITHOUT any outside influence it becomes very annoying, frustrating, and honestly ruins part of the experience. I wanted to completely stay within the world of the game in order to avoid potential spoilers.

It's plainly obvious that CAPCOM intended for this to be more of a CO-OP experience and not really a single-player one because if you are trying to play on your own entirely you will find that this is not really possible in the end. But there is a lot to enjoy once you look pass these frustrations. The story is somewhat interesting, the level design is great, bosses are fun to an extent, and there is an arcade-type atmosphere that exists within the game that I have an appreciation for and now I can look back at my childhood and realize that I did eventually play the game I saw in that video years later. It's a fun game with some frustrations.

I give this game a 3/5.",1663811251,1669253905,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

I like that here you can play with your friends, cool DLCs that allow you more to reveal the plot and most importantly - Albert Wesker.

This game wouldn't work for me (and probably won't work for whomever else either), though at least not until I tried following this Guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2356061236

In which furthermore I'll add, that while that Guide is a sure way to help you to get the game working, it's not quite guaranteed for it to stay working. Thus, the game worked for me the first day playing it (thanks to the guide)... which then the next day, the screen popped up like normal, like it were gonna load up and play; but then pops off to where you don't see it (although it would show being in the Tab below as still being active, and yet if you click on it or right click and then click open, it just keeps minimizing itself off screen)... However, what seems to work for me when having that issue (after initially getting it to work the first time by following that guide of course), is to [b] [u] uninstall game, reboot/restart Laptop (or Desktop, I guess that works the same for Desktop), followed by reinstalling game upon reboot. [/u] [/b]

[h1] Game Review [/h1]

With all that aside and as long as you're able to play it, the game itself in general is actually pretty good and does have some replay value imo.

Though to put in more Specifics of course, it kinda feels similar to Resident Evil 4, except instead of Resident Evil 5 having a Pilgrimage Village environmental setting such like RE4... RE5 takes place in Africa with an African Tribal Warrior type feel to it. though while still also having the same Parasitic theme.  [spoiler] ................................................................................
............... ......................................................................made you look lol .................... ............... ..................................................... ...................... ................. ................. .................. ....... ........ ..... ........................................................................................................................ [/spoiler] 

Furthermore, I know some people don't really like that about RE4 (the Parasitical theme, where people are taken over by some type of strange Parasite, instead of typically being effected by what fellow Resident Evil fans are familiarly known as the T-Virus or G-Virus, or Veronica Virus, etc), thus understandably being that ""it may feel like"" Resident Evil is sidetracking off course (going from a zombie apocalyptic theme, over into something that feels foreign compared to what fellow fans thought of Resident Evil to be).

But yet while RE4 didn't really seem to have so much of a clear direction on how the Parasitic theme went about happening, here in Resident 5 it depicts the situation a bit more clearer as to what's going on (with that said, I don't feel like Resident Evil is straying away from what it's considerably meant to be, whereas I feel that it is actually continuing to stay true to itself, in which all along has been Umbrella being up to no good and trying to create the ultimate Bio-weapon, and also something to do with trying to recreate evolution).

Nonetheless, Resident Evil 5 is fun and enjoyable enough to be worth it.",1667342840,1667757209,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

RE5 takes the action elements of RE4 and leans a bit more into them while not entirely forgetting that it needs to keep moments tense. The only tension however, comes from the chaotic combat scenarios that unfold, which are generally easier to master than 4 or earlier RE games. The invincibility frames of unarmed attacks can get pretty exploitable, and quickly becomes part of the endgame meta which sucks almost all the tension out some moments when you have Chris ""Fuck Boulders"" Redfield unleashing a full on combo on some bosses. Quick time events return from 4, some more punishing than others. With a coop partner you will both have to pay attention to the screen for any flashing indicators, with some segments of quick time events really outstaying their welcome. The campaign definitely has its own weak points too, and voice lines that can make RE1 classic sound like Shakespeare, but its still a fun experience especially with a coop partner. Mercenaries mode is also present in this RE game and honestly its my favorite version of it with just enough tools and mechanics to be formidable against massive numbers while still not being godlike (unless you picked Wesker for your mercenaries run, which is that case...yeah, your loadout is pretty godlike.)

This game was specifically the next step and evolution to the Resident Evil 4 formula.

Resident Evil 5 is the bigger, badder older brother to Resident Evil 4. I mean that in a good way. It revamped the melee combat system, allowing for more crowd control and ammo conversation opportunities.  The inventory management is dumbed down quite a bit (only 9 slots available for each player), but it allows for real-time quick reloads and item management in the middle of a fight. It adds constant tension like in the RE:Outbreak series. New weapons are spread out across the campaign and the change of scenery/level design is great to explore. Returning characters from previous games make an appearance and old grudges are front and center as the plot continues. There are quick-time event cut-scenes still, so don't get comfy when an action cut-scene rolls. Also, there is a co-op partner and new character introduced named Sheva. She can have pretty bad AI at times, and should be used as a extra inventory if playing solo. When the credits roll there is still more to do with a ton of unlockables (infinite ammo, new costumes, character models) and the endless replayability of the Mercenaries mode

Anyways, do yourself a favor,  get a buddy to do a campaign run with you. It is a guaranteed memorable experience. 10/10

I didn't feel RE5 stood true to its title as a survivor horror installment since guns are thrown at you liberally and there's a grenade going off nearly everywhere you go. Most stages felt as if I was just going between areas to mow down the next field of bad guys with a shotgun and no challenge like I was invincible, save for npcs that can one shot you like the Chainsaw Maijini and Reapers. It just didn't have any of the suspense of a Resident Evil game. The boss fights were so easy yet repetitive, they bored me to tears. Wesker was the only one I had any trouble on.

That being said, if you can get around the jank gameplay and melodramatic cutscenes, it's a great co-op experience to have if you don't take it too seriously. The game paced itself well enough in between side plots and characters that I didn't feel as if I waited too long for what we all played this game for, our boy Albert Wesker.

A sequel to one of my favourite games and with all new shiny ps3 graphics, I still remember the trailer which showed Chris in Africa long before the coop was added and it looked so sick. 

The orginal trailer was hype AF, and it's still on YouTube, I suggest you check it out if you haven't already to understand why a teenager may have thought it looked like the best game ever. But despite my hype I didn't pick it up until a few years later mostly due to the added coop, it really soured me on the game and I do think it's unnecessary but with years of hindsight I can now look back and say the game is decent enough fun but all semblance of this being a Resi game have been lost, this was the dawning of action-resi. 

Now resident evil has always been camp and cheesy and we did get wacky action long before RE5, Code veronica was filled with dumb shit that made it more like the matrix than resident evil. People do blame the change to action on RE4 which I can see the argument but RE4 is still dripping in atmosphere and at least pretends to be a horror game and also REmake 2 shows you can do a 3rd person over the shoulder camera without losing much of the horror. 

RE5 is just action. It's a coop zombie 3rd person shooter, one that is slightly stiff due to it still pretending it's anything like RE4, something they quickly removed in RE6. If you can accept this game is... 

A) nothing like the older resi and is action only 

B) a coop game with an Ai partner stuck with you constantly 

And 

C) really fucking dumb 

Then you might have a good time. 

Pros 

The story is so dumb and over the top that it's actually enjoyable, Wesker is absolutely god tier and is such a crazy villain, his lines are the best, he catches rockets out of mid air and he can dodge bullets. Wtf 

Gameplay is fun, there are so many guns and equipment, unlockables, bonus modes, dlc, difficulties etc I think the replay value is stronger than RE4 

Look ultimately this is a fan service game, you can play as hunky Chris Redfield punching monsters in the face like you wish you could in RE1, this is a guilty pleasure game that is it. It has no deep meaning or lasting effect, you play it with a mate for a laugh then dump it. 

Look normally I'd do cons but this game has seen it's share of negatively which is deserved to be honest, you have to tame your expectations and accept this game isn't 

- RE4 but better 
- a horror game 
- a game with an interesting story 
- a game with fun puzzles or inventory management 
- a game with super fluid controls (it feels it is made more clunky to justify being called resident evil)

Ele é um típico jogo divertido pra jogar com amigos, mas não tem como o levar a sério em momento nenhum.

A história nem é tão ruim, mas tem uns momentos que você olha e fica: ai, sério isso? 
Eu normalmente perdôo  jogos assim se o gameplay é divertido, mas nem isso posso dizer que é quando você joga sozinho. Chega a ser entediante e estressante ao mesmo tempo no modo mais difícil, depois de um tempo você joga mais para acabar do que outra coisa, e olha que o jogo é pequeno, mas parece tão mais longo...

Eu entendo que eles viram o sucesso que RE4 fez e tentaram recriar isso, mas exageraram na dose e acabou saindo o contrário. 

Eu não vou dar nota negativa porque pode ser sim divertido em coop e talvez para fans maiores de RE, mas foi complicado gostar desse.

Talvez jogando as DLCs melhore, eu espero pelo menos... (provavelmente vou dar um update na análise depois de jogar elas)

Look, Resident Evil 4 was always going to be a tough act to follow, but RE5 is so torn between sticking with series traditions and being a full-on action game that it fails to be both. Levels are a claustrophobic mess of corridors, enemies provide basically zero challenge, the inventory is a near-constant headache, and the story somehow wraps up a multi-game arc without anything really happening.

And the fact that it's just blatantly racist is the cherry on top. Seriously, this is a game released in 2009 that features a mud hut village full of crocodile-worshipping natives. Resident Evil 5 would still be a shit game without the Looney Tunes-era racism, but that's what it'll be remembered for.

Solid feedback on hitting enemies, although there is a floatiness to it. Also there is a slight awkwardness/sluggishness that playing 6 or remake 2 will make you very aware of.

The Story:
it is following the cheesy story from CV and 4, so it's not that great... but it's not 'completely' terrible either. The main villain really carries what story there is. Everything else is actually quite embarrassing to get through.

The Visuals:
Still looks good even by today's standards, but I wouldn't say it's stunning or anything. Not too much of a fun of jacked Chris, but it's not 

The Sound:
Most of the music is forgettable until the ending portion, the sfx are decent but some guns could sound better. Josh, Wesker and Chris have solid voices, but only Josh and Wesker seem to deliver their lines naturally. Everyone else sounds very forced which I suppose is more of an issue with the lines at certain times.

The Experience:
The game is a decent experience. You can certainly see how the influence of 4 will take this game and lead it down the path of being RE6. Oh and about the game being scary, it's not except for maybe a moment here and there, it really is just an action game. The nice thing is that if you play with an actual person the game is great... if not well then it's a tad frustrating. I considered not recommending this game, but it's merits outweigh it's faults so I will.  Has moderate replay. Most will usually put this down when you beat it once, some follow-up to get the BSAA emblems/ harder difficulties.

As a Singleplayer game however, it's unfortunately a ""Just play RE4"" out of 10. The AI isn't bad, quite the opposite it's pretty smart and they shred enemies (I think the AI might do more damage per shot than a Human Player but I have no evidence of this), but they lack spacial awareness and positioning and get easily sorrounded and killed on Veteran. It just doesn't offer the same experience as Co-Operating and strategizing with an actual human. The game had to cut a lot of corners of compared to RE4 to work as a co-op game, so sacrificing the Co-Op just turns the game into a worse RE4 with a Turret following you around (which is probably why the game was negatively received by a lot of RE fans.)

If you have someone to play this with, BIG recommend. You might not get the traditional resident Evil Experience, but more something akin to a Arcade Lightgun game. Not that that's a bad thing. Time Crisis slapped, and so does this game.

Literally. 

The combat is similar, but your moves are less effective, and sound effects are weak and unimpactful.

Similar story, but with zero charm and humor. 

You have a companion again, but Ashley was miles better and couldn't even hold a rifle. At least she stayed of the way and didn't get herself killed all the goddamn time. 

A similar upgrade system, but it's just a soulless menu compared to the iconic merchant. 

You even fight an el gigante, but it's a turret section instead of an exhilirating, ""real"" boss fight. A fucking turret section. 

....

Playing this game solo is infuriating. I would've played it coop, if Capcom didn't pull the galaxy brain move of removing local coop from this game on PC. And coop being, you know, the thing that makes the game any fucking fun at all.

Sure it's arguably the start of the downfall for the RE series, but I couldn't care less. 5 holds a special place in my heart because it's the one that got me into the series. I still enjoy it to this day. little ol' me didn't care about horrible dialog that's too funny to ignore, the amount of plot armor Chris has, or even the bad AI gave to you for your bot partner. I didn't care about that because I was too fascinated by the game world and wanted more of it after each chapter I had completed. Now that I have a PC capable of running this childhood game. I think it's safe to say my opinion hasn't changed one bit now that tank controls are somewhat removed. Yes, the movement controls feel far more comfortable now than they were 10 years ago, and the aim is 100 times better, but you can still feel that console tank stiffness on a keyboard and mouse. A minor issue, yet very annoying, I played this completely vanilla, so I'm sure there's a mod for this old-ass game to help with that. Other than that I enjoy it even after completing it and do plan on hopping on mercenaries now and then. Hope this game gets a remake this decade, but if not, then that's fine. 9.5/10 not blinded by the nostalgia ;)",1664474015,1664474015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It takes place in part of Africa, where you are sent in to deal with potential biological weapons that are being peddled by arms dealers, and you know what kind of ""biological weapons"" would be involved in a game like this. 

You then, with a partner (AI controlled or player controlled which is preferred), have to fight parasitically-controlled ""zombies"" and monsters throughout a bunch of stages in a third person perspective. You manage your inventory, find your path, and fight enemies while trying to not get killed in return.

The game is a lot of fun in co-op, and I wouldn't recommend playing it solo because the AI partner is less than great.

It has a great atmosphere and interesting (if unhinged) story. It isn't truly horrifying, which is to be expected when playing a co-op game, but can still be creepy at times and makes you feel like your survival is on the ropes.

There is a lot I could say about Resident Evil 5, and very little of it is positive. Very rarely have I had an experience so impressively miserable that it leaves me at a loss for words. Having very much enjoyed its predecessor, I embarked on this long and treacherous journey with optimism that was very quickly crushed soon after loading into the first chapter. I already have my own personal gripes regarding how far this game ventured from the horror genre and atmosphere, but for this review, I'll put that aside and view this simply as an action game. 

This game was a failure from conception. Be it either the egregiously racist themes and designs you can encounter almost every step of the way, the entire time it feels like you're dragging your feet through a caricaturist's wet dream. It is visually and mechanically unappealing, the gameplay is thoroughly unsatisfying, and the plot is milquetoast at best. The dialogue is boring and predictable, the characters feel one-dimensional, and the game itself feels like it was structured to make you, the player, feel cool, instead of rewarding you for actual effort contributed. Boss fights don't feel significant enough to be remembered, nor are they accompanied by any sense of lingering urgency, and it's oversaturated with cutscenes that consistently infringe on what little sense of immersion was provided. 

Still, sometimes you can find a dime in a pile of shit. 
[i] Here are some things I did like about Resident Evil 5. [/i]

— Mercenaries mode is fun. I enjoyed it in Resident Evil 4, and for the most part, I enjoy it here. 
— I enjoyed the segments with Wesker and Jill. 
— The massive crab fight was fun, unexpected, and almost silly enough to make me forget how unsatisfied I was with the rest of the game.
— I cared about the main characters and enjoyed the main antagonist, despite their overly cheesy and annoying dialogue. 

Though I did enjoy Chris, Sheva, Jill, and Wesker as characters, that alone was not nearly enough to make up for the hours wasted trudging through the sorry excuse for a campaign. I think the game would have been a better overall experience, had it been more self-aware of how ridiculous it was. Unfortunately, it is not. 

If you're looking for a mediocre, uncomfortably and excessively offensive experience to share with a friend, then this is absolutely the game for you. Otherwise, just play Resident Evil 4 again, and be glad that you saved yourself some money. I admit that I am curious as to how Capcom would remake this installment in the future, because I personally have a difficult time re-imagining this game in a way that doesn't make it tonally nightmarish. Try to make a game with [i] ""Tribal Natives"" [/i] today and see how well that goes for you.

TOP FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️Playing co-op (Yes, people still play this!)
⭐️Fighting the bosses.

THE UNIQUES:
💎Classic over the shoulder.
💎Great Quick time action.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Zombies.
💼Third-Person Shooter.
💼Co-op.

VERDICT:
CAPCOM have took a different direction in RE5 by heavily adding co-op which has it's pros and cons, the main pro is it's really fun playing with another player, this is also it's con since the AI is very poorly designed, I played 80% of this game in solo and found myself a little more frustrated without an online player. 

I'd say the best part to this game are the bosses, they're very well made with just enough to know what to do, the most standout boss has got to be UROBOROS (5-2), it's the only time I had to use the rocket launcher. It's practically the easy way out of any mission/boss.
Total Score = 74/100.

GAMEPLAY:
Resident Evil 5 is a third-person shooter, The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance agents Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. Chris learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, Albert Wesker, and his former partner, Jill Valentine.

The gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. It has also been considered the first game in the main series to depart from the survival horror genre. Motion capture was used for the cutscenes, and it was the first video game to use a virtual camera system.

Its sequel decided to take the most polarizing aspects of that game and dial them up to 11. The result is something far more akin to an arcade shooter than a survival horror game.

Before anything else, know this game will not boot up unless your computer has the Games for Windows Live plugin. I've never encountered anything like this on Steam, and it will literally halt your progress before you even get started.

'Resident Evil 5' has Chris Redfield back, chasing down the last remnants of Umbrella in a fictional African country. A lot of people found this game's racial depictions to be, let's say, ""problematic"" upon its original release. The title attempts to mitigate this by introducing a light-skinned African co-protagonist named Sheva. From the moment she wiggles her butt up to Chris's Humvee, she establishes herself as fine eye candy...with the personality of a plastic cup.

In the single-player campaign, you control Chris while the AI controls Sheva who, in addition to having zero chemistry with Chris, isn't very bright. You can only control if you want her to take a passive or aggressive posture. Outside of a few boss battles, the girl's more hindrance than help. In fact, the partner AI only gets dumber with increasing difficulty levels. It'll ignore your commands and even block your vision by standing DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU while you're trying to take a shot. Playing with another Human is not only highly recommended, it may actually be necessary.

'RE5' is broken up into chapters, which makes for an uneven pace. At the end of each section, you have an opportunity to purchase and upgrade weapons (the famous 'Resident Evil Merchant' is sorely missed). For some reason, your attache case only has slots for NINE items and can't be expanded. You can't even pause to access it. Inventory management in this game is just a pain. I can't tell you how many times I died while just trying to exchange items with my partner to make room. 

A lot of other elements of this game haven't aged well. The tank controls, the laughably bombastic writing and voiceacting. The graphics are gorgeous, but that's the only thing that's improved from 'Resident Evil 4.' If anything, 'RE5' feels like a downgrade. Most of this game consists of just blasting at things that pop out of the woodwork with little rhyme or reason. Am I playing a Light Gun game? Enemies also happen to take an insane amount of hits to put down, and the prompts to use melee or finishing moves never seem to appear when they should.

A word about the bosses in this game: Besides all looking like the same mangled mess of pus and tentacles, there is one boss about 3/4 of the way in that has a game-breaking glitch. Normally, you'd use a flamethrower on it until it exposes its weak spot and then shoot it, but there's a chance that it will never reveal its weak spot, making it unbeatable. I mean LITERALLY unbeatable, unless you either die or restart the encounter! How Capcom hasn't patched this by now, I'll never know.

After you beat the game, a few new chapters and game modes open up (including the return of Mercenaries), but none of them are very compelling. Just time-wasters for claiming more achievements. So, in conclusion, skip 'Resident Evil 5.' It is excess at its worst. Play another installment. Or better yet, wait for the remake of '4'.",1657038214,1660786417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, fuck quick time events. They sucked in re 4 and Capcom decided to add 2 additional keys that can show up for qtes as if it wasn't already awful. Most boss fights and 'cutscenes' rely on qtes with very little time to react so you just lose half your health bar or die instantly. What would be cool fights against giant enemies and wesker is now a tedious mess. Secondly, I have to say that this game feels more like an re 4 dlc than it's own separate game. The combat is incredibly similar (which I'm not saying is bad, I loved re4) and it barely innovates on re4's gameplay. Lastly, playing solo with Sheva's AI is awful. Inventory space is highly limited and Sheva loves to pick up all the incredibly useless stuff right when you need space. She also loves to bodyblock you to make running away from qte zones even more impossible. So many sections rely on a partner and it feels awful having to rely on such an inconsistent AI to progress.

After that, it really goes down in quality. I guess the devs played gears of war half way through development and thought ""yes"". Once enemies get guns, everything takes a turn for the worst. My friend and I also experienced quite a few technical issues towards the end of this game that severely hampered our experience. The worst of which involved a game crashing right after a boss fight. We hadn't reached the checkpoint after the boss fight and were forced to play through the boss again, only for my friend to have the same amount of ammo he had after we completed the boss. Aside from that, the story is completely nonsensical and the setting just isn't as strong as re4's imo. Most enemies aren't fun to fight, with enemies like the lickers being completely butchered in this game. 

When it comes to things I enjoyed, the first 4 chapters were pretty good. For the most part, the boss fights in this game are actually pretty well thought out. The weapon variety is also considerably better in this game, when compared to re4. As is the enemy variety (even though most of them are either reskins or aren't fun to fight).

-- Also its an old game lower this ridiculous price please --

Hated:
- Felt like the AI (The buddy system) somehow digressed since the last game, The AI feels much more of a burden than the last game which was a defenseless girl. Sheva depending on her mode can sometimes sit idly while she is surrounded by enemies, charge recklessly to loot and leave you and even (IGNORING) selectively pick up loot (By this i mean having free space and specific guns to use this ammo and decides to ignore it). 
She also tends to block your view while shooting and in a game like this with a limited camera when you have to stand still to shoot its a real problem. 

- The menu is also a huge problem having the same / similar gameplay as Resident Evil 4 and speeding up the phase AND at the same time having a real time menu made it a problem to reflexively utilize weapons which causes you failure even though it can be avoided (Is it supposed to be a trial and error game or survival).

Bottom line is felt like my deaths were un-earned and could have dealt with them without having to die. 
Playing it again from a checkpoint with different equipped items from your own inventory is not as fun as reflexively dealing with a situation you are prepared for.",1659839534,1659839659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The answer is: Do you have extra money to spend AND have a good friend you could play this with? Well, sure, go ahead. Do you have other games you wanna buy and/or you don't have much money and/or you will play alone? Don't do it.

Resident Evil 5 is a decent co-op game and a not so great singleplayer game. It's definitely one of the weakest of the franchise: Uninteresting characters, areas and bosses.

Let me talk about the singleplayer issue first. This game always has two characters, one of them being a bot. The bot is dumb as hell and actually consumes inventory items, meaning it'll be constantly asking for more and you'll have to give them, and it has zero sense of savings so it doesn't care and wastes ammo like hell.

I DID have fun with the game though, but that's because I played co-op with a close friend on voice call (and like that, any game can be fun)

Now, a few issues with the game design itself:

- You have the same tiny 9-slot inventory with no way of upgrading.
- Some bugs, such as a noticeable one in chapter 6-1 makes progress harder. I had to redo this chapter AT LEAST six times because one frigging zombie wouldn't jump down and we needed to reach him to get a keycard. And the times that he actually did jump down, it took him a long, long while. I actually can't see how NO ONE in Capcom noticed this extremely common glitch that makes the chapter slow as hell. In the end: Got the lowest rank on time, when we rushed through the whole rest of the chapter.
- A few enemies can be easily looped
- On the other side, a few enemies are cheap and easily instakill
- It's incredibly difficult to tell what you should do to bosses, and if what you're doing is working. There is no health bar or something like that, but while I agree putting a big HP bar would be stupid, there should be [b]some[/b] indication to know if it's working or if I'm doing something wrong. It's not fun to do the same thing for 15 minutes, then find out I did zero damage because I actually need to do something else. Then on the next boss I THINK I'm doing something wrong but I am actually doing the right thing, it's just that the game gives zero indication if it's working. That is because for some bosses you need to do enough damage to kill, some bosses require you to do an action a few times, some bosses require you to do an action and THEN do enough damage, and some bosses are time-based.
- Online connection is good but it's very strict. If the internet stops for a milisecond, the game closes, which sucks specially for people that doesn't have good internet. I had to re-do a few chapters because my internet fell for 1 second mid-way through the chapter. There are games older than this one that pause the game for half a minute or so to wait until it comes back, but no, this one just gives up immediately.
- I don't believe there's a single person on earth that got all emblems without a guide.
- Quick time events. They're stupid. Sometimes you gotta do a quick time event for the simplest things, and other times that would make sense for there to be a QTE, there is not. The timing of some are incredibly strict AND they use the worst combinations of buttons if you play on keyboard. They go from A+D to F+V. It's not comfortable, pratical or convenient to press F+V in a less-than-a-second window when your hands were on WASD.

And a few other minor things that build up to a bigger issue together.

This game is just unapologetically fucking shit. It doesn't even try to resemble an RE game. Instead, it opts to be some sort of idiotic action shooter whilst doing the worst job it could possibly manage to at that. The gameplay is extremely repetitive - random sections of you just running around a random area whilst shooting anything that moves, after which you get some sort of brain damaged feeling scripted sequence. No puzzles or anything like that, just mindless shooting. Every area basically looks and feels the same, and that feeling can best be described as having shit smeared on your face with a garden rake.

The story.... I'm not really sure there's a story, really. Or, well, there not being a story would be a massive improvement. The plot was written by a group of mentally deranged monkeys high on crack.

Bosses are random and they feel out of place, the boss fights consist of you doing the same sequence 5-6 times. The villains are just cartoonishly evil.

On the bright side, this time around, you have a companion running around and committing war crimes with you. She's a fucking moron, btw. That's always good.

Graphically, this game is trash. The audio was recorded using a tin can and a string instead of a microphone.

TL;DR game's a pile of donkey shit, just find a story summary of it and go play the next one. I heard that one's shit, too.

P.S. game's so shit it can't even track your playtime correctly. I've sunk too much time into this irredeemable shitshow.",1658407525,1658407585,False,4,1,0.509127259254455566,0,True,False,False

This is a very fun co-op game and an okay single player game. It's fun to coordinate and watch each other's backs. I have no complaints with the co-op.

The problem with single player is that the ai partner is worse at backing you up than a real person. The ai isn't great at going for headshots or conserving ammo. The ai is useful as a healer though. If you play single player, I recommend giving your partner most of the healing items.

The game controls a little stiff/clunky on keyboard and mouse. There is mouse acceleration that can't be disabled and your look sensitivity changes while you're moving. It may take some getting used to, but it isn't so bad once you adjust.

Initially, the game didn't launch for me due to issues with the game wanting to open Games for Windows Live, which is discontinued. This problem is common for Windows 10, so there are plenty of Steam community guides to get the game running. For me, I just had to paste a file in the game's directory so it would bypass Games for Windows Live. 

In closing, this game is worth picking up if it's on sale and/or you have a friend to play with. If you don't have a friend then just play 4 instead.",1658065429,1658065429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean, sure, you can always use it as a mule to carry your junk but... You'll be forced to slog through the enemies on your own with a donkey following you.

The game play feels like RE 4, although a bit smoother imo, shooting at weak points and melee-ing will conserve you ammo, you can also do combos with your partner with proper timing. 
The inventory system is VERY basic; you only get 9 inventory slots per character which forces you to focus on preparation between levels, and sharing loot between you and the 2nd player. Everything takes one slot. From a weapon, to an armour (later in the game). Some items stack to a point, like 50 handgun bullets or 5 grenades, but generally speaking you will find yourself keeping something open for a specific item in mind.
Story is meh. Lots of QTEs, which can be super annoying if you dislike them. 
If you want to upgrade all your weapons, you may need to grind quite a bit. 
The DLCs are a few extra missions that try to complete the missing story elements from within RE5, one within and one is a prequel. Both are good in their own right. One may give you flashbacks from RE1, though :D

TLDR: This is still a solid entry and it doesn't deserve all it's bad rep. Though if you're playing it for the horror factor... Hard pass. Same for if you're playing it alone.",1658019662,1658028048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything from the stupid Quick-Time Events (QTE's) to your partner's lousy AI (in single-player) makes getting through the game a chore. In addition, you will be forced to replay missions in order to get more ammo/money for weapon upgrades. Also, you'll have to install Games For Windows Live to get it to even run; alternately, there is a fan-made patch that can be installed that is supposed to allow you to run without GFWL, though I haven't tried it.

If you want to buy this game you must first buy the game.
If you want to run this game you must first download a patch that is external from Steam.
If you want to play this Local Co-op (and online) game in split screen...?

1. Download and install Nucleus Co-op (Essentially a launcher that creates multiple windows of a single game)
2. open and search for res 5, then download the ""game handler"" (res 5 you looked up) then connect it to the .exe for res 5.
3. Now you can see two windows and are able to change the style of the splits as well as assign each split it's controllers.
3a. If you don't have an xbox controller or something you have to install something to detect it as the faq and nothing else says anything about switch pro. 
This is where I stopped. It's been going on 2 days of trying to get this to work, not consistently but consistent enough that its just as long as seeing and downloading skyrim mods for your game but without any of the fun or excitement of getting to play it as I wanted. (Cause I've given up for now)
This put's me in a position where I'm either going to refund my entire purchase (I got the bundle, probably won't as I can still play online) OR what every company would want is for me to just buy another copy for who I was wanting to Local play with - Which isn't an option for people who wanted this game for Local and don't have a spare PC. 

TLDR. 
You need to download 3+ programs/redist/patch/betterjoy. With no straightforward video's to watch on installing other than low quality or aged tutorials on youtube with dead links or updated written tutorials that are a total slog to read and follow. Everything should be more straightforward, so hopefully this gave others looking for a Local Co-op game a heads up before buying.. I thought it'd be easier to set up but I got unlucky with my controller and time period. Maybe in a month someone will make a better tutorial eh? ;) (someone else not me bro.) 

Anyways very disappointed. Eventually this will probably work and be fun but it may sit here til the end of time or until I decide to play with the possible aging/leaving playerbase, or that friend I end up buying a copy for.
Cheers.

When downloading the game games for windows live will try to install but fail.
Due to that, the game either won't run or if it does, cutscenes will have huge sound/image issues.
In order to fix that, you have to type G4WLOriginalVersion as a beta code
because why would it be already on the beta menu ?
Doing that will prevent you from finishing the game while you use that version.
When launching, you'll notice that you have two options :
Make an xbox account. A f*** you to people who aren't interested/dislike that platform.
Keep in mind it already had a PS3 and PS4 release.
Beat the game in a go (which is not possible using the beta).

I'm not done...
Like i said, there were PS3 and PS4 releases but this version has no proper controller support aside from xbox.
Those prompts are too flashy/eye catching plus you'd have to relearn prompts and put up with it.
k&m seems to work though.

At least Resident Evil 3 Remake works properly yet still was a huge disgrace. Given that, this port is the worst game of the main series by far.

0/10 for the port
3/10 for PS3/PS4 versions.

I won't even cover gameplay and story from other versions as there could be other issues with this port.

As i said on my Resident Evil 3 Remake, i'm genuinely concerned about the future of this series... i'm one botched port or one really bad entry from outright dropping from that series.
AVOID IT AT ALL COST.

Edit : Someone pointed me to a fix.
Link to his review : https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198914006250/recommended/21690

Turns out the source of some of the issues was a missing .dll file
Still, that doesn't change the lack of proper controller support.

Want to play it ? Either get used to flashy xbox prompts and learn those or play using k&m.
Unless... you use a mod to get the right prompts.
I found the mod here :
https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/15699/resident-evil-playstation-button-fix
It worked for me.

A lot of work to get the game working like back on PS3... not sure if it's even worth it.
I'm just doing this for the achievements and some co-op (the only fun thing in this game to be honest) in order to keep going with further installments in the series available on steam.

Edit 2 :
The mod creates a bug preventing from getting an emblem.
In order to fix it you'll need to verify files integrity before starting chapter 3-1 and do it m&k because f***k players i guess.

I noticed that even keyboard support is half-a**ed. I guess it's another f*** you if you have an azerty keyboard.
I had to learn that the hard way by ""failing"" a button mash QTE so much by wrist f***ing hurts and then noticed it detects the wrong keyboard type. It's the same type of issue as the controller minus intrusive prompts.

What the f*** is that port aside a f*** you if you're not in a region using qwerty or an xbox player ?

Guess what... F*** you too Capcom !

Edit 3 :
Input lag in a QTE chapter 4-1

Edit 4 (final update) :
After finishing this port, I can confirm that this port was a complete disaster. Hold me to that, I am never touching that thing ever again. I'd eat cyanide over playing that waste of a port again. F*** off !",1657232355,1657502643,False,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

I was pretty bored with the generic action story in the first half, but the real meat and potatoes comes later and it is so worth it. Chris and Jill's story is a cheesy action fest. RE 1 was a pretty good cheesy horror fest so I don't mind one bit.

My biggest gripe with this game is Sheva. The character herself is fine and dandy, but the AI is so stupid it makes it a nightmare to play alongside her sometimes. I have NO CLUE why Capcom kept wanting to explore co-op singleplayer. The only game it ever worked for was RE 0, and even claiming that is stretching the definition of the word ""worked"". Ashley and Sheva may be great for the 10 percent of players who are masters of these games, but for anyone else? Taking care of them is a chore.

My second biggest gripe are the bossfights. Of course, like in any RE, they are awful, predictable, and plain unfun. It's kind of a given for RE titles that the bossfights are crappy and abundant. I stopped minding a while ago. So whatever.

My final thoughts on this game were very positive, though. This is a complete departure from classic Resident Evil, but it is a welcome one.

I played RE4 before this one for Sony PS2 (I'll do another review for this on PC later). I had played RE5 on PC (by the seven seas), and I remember being entertained by its camp and terrified by its strategically placed horror and found it not bad.

Then the Steam sale came this year and I decided to buy it for me and my nephew. It was a glorious camp horror co-op experience and a much better experience than playing alone.

One major caveat: the Steam version will require you to install some files from an unofficial ""patch"" that make it work on Windows 10/11 because it is a really old game. But the investment is worth it.

I guess), and I ended up using the lovely Sheva's box to store my grenades (and that's not a euphemism.)

The story is a continuation of the events that took place during Resident Evil 4, but features a different protagonist, and takes place at another location, namely in Africa; where there are sunny savannas, decrepit slums, worn out industrial regions, ancient tombs, and places inspired by early African culture. Rumour has it, that some of these areas became a testing ground for an organisation that intends on spreading a hazardous life-form among the indigenous populace.
The story follows Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar, who are assigned as partners, and are part of a heavily armed anti-terrorist unit, which is send in to overcome the threat. Soon after they meet up, all hell breaks loose.

Resident Evil 5 renders a realistic looking world, which is viewed from a viewpoint that is directed forwards, over the shoulder of the protagonist. The protagonist must travel along mostly linear paths which connect to more open areas, and use firearms on their adversaries to survive the horrors that manifest themselves. Moving both partners through each area progresses the story, and there are animated video sequences that play between certain areas.
The protagonist is generally accompanied by a partner. Both partners should stay close together, because they may help each other. Together they must combat the delirious ex-populace, while tougher, more abominable adversaries are introduced later.
A partner may be controlled by another person or automatically. An automatically controlled partner may give and collect supplies, and may request them as well, or can be equipped to deploy obtained firearms. An automatically controlled partner keeps in close proximity to the protagonist, but may also complete tasks independently, if commanded to do so.
Supplies and treasures are hidden in most areas, and may be sold for currency, which can be spend to upgrade weaponry, or to purchase additional equipment.

Visually, Resident Evil 5 seems to be more than the sum of it's parts. Characters and environments are depicted realistically, and animations convey a sense of realism as well. Sturdy looking weapons have a heavy impact on targets, and most targets react to where they are hit.
Between certain areas are automatically animated video sequences, which show attention to choreography. These sequences sometimes require interaction, and deliver action-packed scenes.
Controlling a protagonist is somewhat unwieldy, and unpredictable adversaries may often close in on the protagonist, and may be fought up close. There are multiple difficulty levels, and worlds can be revisited to collect extras, which in effect add to an arsenal of weapons.
There are also additional side-stories and play-modes.


This menacing image shows a group of adversaries, who are surrounding the protagonist, while his partner can be seen in the foreground:

The Story Line:
The story line of Resident Evil 5 starts with Chris being sent to Africa to investigate a Bio Weapon that makes people into aggressive monsters, Sheva is introduced and has partnered with Chris to investigate further on.
As the story progresses on the enemies evolve as you gather a stronger arsenal and becomes challenging to players that don't have very good experience with Resident Evil games.
As the story progresses on, Chris talks about his old partner Jill Valentine to Sheva and transitions to a flashback to him and his old partner fighting someone named Albert Wesker.
You soon then find out Umbrella are using the uroboros virus to spread around the world to create a whole new human race so you and Sheva attempt to the save the world by fighting Wesker, after learning about the injection pens can affect Wesker's state with overdosing but making him more stronger and aggressive leading to Chis and Sheva battling Wesker in a lava filled island.

Gameplay:
You first start playing the game and you start to explore the controls. If you're new to game series and decided to start off on Resident Evil 5, the difficulty of the controls may vary amongst others. The gameplay doesn't feel very smooth at first but as you gradually progress the game you become comfortable of the controls.

Features:
The game gives you things to work for. Scattered around the levels are blue BSAA emblems, which you can shoot to collect the emblem. Collecting emblems as you play will unlock character styles game filters. Unlimited ammo can also be unlocked once you complete the all the chapters (on any difficulty) and you will be able to use your point on the bonus features on the game's main menu when you select the play menu and will be able to buy unlimited ammo for a gun (you must fully upgrade you weapon of any choice) and you will be able to enable unlimited ammo mode on the special settings. The game also allows you to buy figurines to collect on the game so you can view them on the main menu.

Overall:
Despite the Games For Windows Live not being able to be installed from steam's installation, players are having to download an installer from other sources in order to play this.

I rate it a 7/10.

Now on to what makes the game so good. I love the part where i have to install a patch manually to play it that's great game design also the quick time events become in no way whats so ever repetitive and boring. The villains may i say are stupendous and the story is as well like why are we in Africa? no one knows but its another positive for capcom furthermore the final boss fight involves a 10 year jitter click quick-time event which causes no pain at all. and one more thing I also really enjoy fighting the bosses and enemies that have infinite health since this adds a layer of challenge to the combat. The treasure and inventory systems are also excellent in that you get absolutely no money for selling things and there is a small inventory yet no inventory management. Brilliant choice by capcom to make it so when you reload your gun you reload it out of cover so all the enemies can shoot you. I also love all of the context they give you for visiting new locations. I definitely understand why i went to a lake village, oil factory and ancient temple.

The story is a bag full of tropes and cliches making it incredibly predictable and mindnumbing. I enjoy campy things, however this is just not it. I simply don't enjoy the Chris and Sheva dynamic. There is very little to it and no charm, almost every other pairing of cast members is better in every other game. She simply can't live up to the vacant place left by Jill.  The only redeeming factor of the story is the fact Wesker is a part of it. Wesker being as charming and captivating as ever.
The gameplay simply doesn't support the amount of enemies it throws at you. being locked in place to shoot when you have a horde on you as well as enemies that either shred your health or can kill you in an instant. Certain boss fights struggle to indicate direction or whether what you are doing affects them at all. Sometimes bosses or events even bugged out and didn't complete their intended purpose making it either very difficult or impossible to progress.
Finally this game is best experienced in co-op. Play with a friend otherwise your life is now in the hands of AI that has absurdly janky pathfinding and in my experience barely attacked. A friend also helps as you can find more fun in it playing as a group but even so, there are plenty of other options to play for co-op fun with friends.

Co do samej gry, to odpaliłem ją bez żadnych oczekiwań. Mimo tego, zaskoczyła mnie prawie w każdym aspekcie. ""Prawie"", bo jedyne czego mi brakowało, to klimat horroru (choć przyznam, kopalnia była całkiem spoko!). Piątka jest nastawiona na akcję przez duże ""A"". Zamiast ostrożnie i powoli przemierzać ciemne zakamarki, jak to było w klasycznej części pierwszej, tu Chris Redfield zdecydowanie stawia na taktykę Johna Rambo. Szybko, głośno, z wybuchami i morzem ołowiu. Nie jest to wada. Ta gra po prostu ma taki klimat i może się to podobać lub nie.

Grafika daje radę, lokacje i przeciwnicy są naprawdę klimatyczni. Tu i ówdzie pojawi się jakiś absurd w stylu słonecznego, tudzież satelitarnego lasera, ale w sumie urozmaica to rozgrywkę. Cieszę się, że Capcom nie napchał tu tylu quick-time eventów, co w czwórce, a cieszyłbym się jeszcze bardziej, jakby nie trzeba było zbierać monetek i kamyczków. Zaraz na początku miałem duże obawy co do plączącego się pod nogami bota, ale okazało się, że AI sterujące Shevą nie jest najgorsze (a przynajmniej nie najgorsze, jakie widziałem). To dość ważne, bo dzielna Afrykanka towarzyszyła mi przez całą rozgrywkę. I cholera, nawet ją polubiłem. Nieźle waliła ze snajperki, bo ja na padzie totalnie nie umiałem tym celować.

Nawkurzałem się nieco przy finale, który po pierwsze - jest cholernie żmudny, a po drugie... Jest w nim taki gorący etap w którym musiałem zadać sobie retoryczne pytanie: 'SERIO?'

Fantastic co-op shooter that's still a blast to play with a friend.  Far more action-y than horror and holds up extremely well given its age.  Story is forgettable and the boss fights are mostly boring with a few being irritating from a mechanics angle.  But the remaining 90% of the game is chill.

I revisit it later and even though this game isn't fantastic, it can be a great fun experience if you're playing with a friend on coop. 

I would STRONGLY recommend playing coop with a friend. Your AI partner will hinder your experience. Your AI will sometimes waste ammo, steal resources. and be more of liability than an asset. This is one of the reasons I believe that Resident Evil 5 sits at a 6/10 and isn't as well praised compared to the other games. 

It has a bunch of unlockable content and replay value. It's a game that can give you a good experience. We encountered a few bugs and some really dumb moments, but we were having a fun time playing coop that we completely forgot about them. Its a bit goofy and not a horror game as advertised. 

Main story and Desperate Escape is good. Mercenaries is fine. Lost in Nightmares isn't great. 

Versus mode is utter crap. Back in the day, Capcom demanded $5 for you to play...and it was a massive joke back then and still is. So skip that.

It has more in common with a Call of Duty game than a Resident Evil game.

Resident Evil 5 plays almost identically to RE4 which is a very good thing. Mix that with excellent co-op gameplay and you have yourself a real winner. RE5 is heavy on the action side and a far cry from the franchise's horror roots, but it's an absolute blast to play and a gem of a game. The steam version is a bit finicky, and does not seem to launch without the use of a work-around. Fortunately, such a work-around does exist and it is a very easy fix.

for me, RE5 is the turning point where the franchise almost completely abandoned its survival-horror-roots and became a straightforward third-person-shooter. Also for me, as an fps-enthusiast who really loves games with a focus on action and gunplay, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. i knew the series since the very first game came out in 1996, but due to its focus on consoles, i never became a fan until RE4 (which was also the first RE game i played myself from start to finish). Coming straight from RE4, RE5 was kind of a logical evolution of the series for me, and at first glance there doesn’t seem to be a huge difference between them, apart from the better grafics in RE5 and its radically different setting and atmosphere. But when you look closer, you will notice more and more things that ultimately might lead you to the point where you would say that while massively innovating and modifying the classic survival horror gameplay RE 4 was the last somewhat ""true"" RE game (at least until the more recent releases), and on the contrary, RE5 became more of a well-made, if somewhat generic action-game that didn’t have much to do with the core ideas and concepts of the earlier games anymore. but don’t be too quick to dismiss RE 5 as a mistep in the context of the franchise!

in this game, after umbrella is practically extinguished, chris redfield goes of to the brightly lit slums of central africa to fight yet another threat involving viruses, bioweapons etc.
After meeting up with his local partner sheva (to get it out of the way: for the first time, an RE game can be played cooperatively with another player and yes, this is the final nail in the coffin for anything only slightly resembling horror in this game), he discovers that things are a lot more sinister than they seem in the beginning. 

to be fair: the game has some pretty creepy and slightly disturbing scenes especially at the start of the game and the slum setting with its desolate hovels and claustrophobic backalleys actually works in the game’s favor. Nevertheless, as soon as the shooting starts and all you see are endless waves of infected villagers charging at you in blind rage, the action becomes frenzy, but all sense of subtle tension and underlying horror is lost within the blink of an eye.
another factor, that undermines any kind of horror is, that in contrast to earlier games, there is no shortage of ressources whatsoever. sure, your inventory space is still limited, therefore you can only carry a certain amount of guns, ammunition and medical supplies. But usually the game suplies you with more than enough of all three of them. As a consequence planful consideration of your resources results more from your personal preferences which guns you want to use, not so much out of pure necessity for survival. As long as you don’t play on the highest difficulty and shoot blindly at the enemies in rapid-fire mode without carefully aiming at their heads to conserve ammo, or their limbs to slow them down, you should never experience any kind of shortage.

Notice that those are no legit points of criticism that make RE5 a bad action game. They just make it sort of a bad Resident Evil game, and only so if you want to restrict the whole series to pure, undiluted survival horror. As for my part, i more or less enjoyed EVERY Resident Evil game I played so far, wether it be the classics focused more on survival horror (and their recent remakes), or the more action-oriented titles like RE 5 and even RE 6. Some were better than others of course and one or two of the spin-offs may even be on the verge of being absolutely mediocre and unnecessary (*cough* operation racoon city *cough*), but i have yet to play a resident evil game that i could consider downright objectively bad. RE 5 at least is definitely far from it. It might be a bad survival horror game in a classical sense, but it is pretty obvious that it doesn’t even want to be one. it‘s more of a survival-action game, where you are constantly outnumbered and have to survive against masses of almost unstoppable enemies, only by means of skillful aiming, efficient use of your equipment and a strong sense of orientation and situational awareness. and it nails this style of gameplay almost flawlessly. 

RE fans can hate on this game all they want, but i didn’t enjoy it less than any other game in the series. Quite the contrary: I think that Resident Evil 5 did not only push the series into an interesting new direction and widened it‘s audience, but that this change in pace was absolutely necessary to prevent the subsequent Resident Evil games from becoming repetitive copies of the earlier games. It was this variety in gameplay established by RE 5 that kept the series alive and the RE community should thank it for that. RE 5 may not be underrated, but it is definitely underappreciated.

( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.
( ) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.
( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.
(X) 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.

I played the demo for this game on Switch a few years ago and i don't remember the AI being so bad.... maybe i played co-op.

♦[b]Storyline[/b]- 8/10. The main characters you play in the base game RE5 are Chris and Sheva
♦[b]Length to complete[/b]- Around 12 hours for a run-through of all chapters, 100+ hours and multiple run-throughs of the base game and DLC for 100% achievements 
♦[b]Gameplay[/b]- Fun, challenging, nice weapons and enemies, typical Resi Evil camera angles, Chris and Sheva are sexy af and fun to play as, and if playing with someone else, the game play is heavily co-op centred in the best way. The one thing to be aware of, is that if you are playing co-op, the person who joins will only get the chapter achievements if the whole chapter is completed in one go. Don't restart or close the game or only the host will get achievements. (Dying wont effect it).  Lots of fun and great replay-ability and still playing at 100 hours with my co-op partner!
♦[b]Visuals/FPS[/b]- Beautiful, and the game is easy on lower-end gaming pc's as I was able to get 100 fps. There's also a variable and fixed benchmark test in the main menu which is helpful. The cut scenes are really beautiful and you can get a lot of nice screenshots.
♦[b]Bugs[/b]- Very minor- other than the achievement one, if you want to leave a co-op game when in a lobby, you're stuck unless one of you closes the game manually by pressing X. 
♦[B]Steam Badge:[/b]The badges for this game are awesome. Different coloured hearts to represent the treasures you can find throughout the game. 
♦Reccomend Would highly recommend, especially for co-op players. Another amazing co-op instalment,  [b]Bravooo[/b] 💘
[b] And below is some info about the DLC[/b]
[b]♦DLC: Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape- Spoiler free ♦[/b]
Lost in Nightmare is a prequel, and Desperate Escape is a  showcase of how certain survivors escaped (no spoilers here). Both are approx 1 hour long, and you will have to have them to get 100% achievements and unlock Versus mode and the Merceneries+ mode, among many other weapons and cosmetics for the characters. The outfits for the DLC ([b]Shevas fairy tale and Tribal outfits are amazing in particular[/b] were really nice, the DLCs themselves were fun with somewhat repetitive areas to the actual RE5 game. Lost in Nightmare is my favourite, as you return to the iconic mansion and play beloved characters in both DLC chapters. 
♦Still grinding away on achievements (they are a MAJOR GRIND by the way, and having fun in the game at [b]99 hours[/b]♦
100% achievements at 130 hrs- though i messed around alot so can be done quicker. Only issue is you cant find vs players easily, but go to the discussions and you may find some there as I did.

That's where the nagging sense that the control system can't keep up with the action crystallizes, and that final sequence descends into frustration. Some of the boss fights are unnecessarily goofy as well. Other negatives would be Jill looking like Draco Malfoy. 

Can recommend, even for a solo player. Sheva AI is mostly fine if you equip her right, even useful at times. But she needs looking after during most of the mini-boss and boss sequences. For a 2009 game, I think the game looks tremendous. Controls are clunky but not a pain until the end. Pick up on a sale.

1 & 2 were great for the time, 3 was alright, everything in between 3 & 4 (so, despite what ought to be simple mathematical deduction, that's actually oodles of the filthy blighters) was stale crap, 4 was great but marked the death of Resi as a horror game

The end.

An even briefer history post Resi 5: they are all mediocre 3rd and 1st person shooters. The end.

With Resi 5 it is clearly working with the mantra ""bigger is better"", so just doubles down on the action and set-pieces of 4. It's not quite as good, since the clunk factor of outdated controls still persists and better handling was very much a thing when this was released, but it's miles better than the steaming pile of doo-doo that is 6.

Did you hate 4 for the game-play? Then you'll hate this. The end.

Are you looking for horror that is jump scares or persistent tension? You won't find it here. The end.

If you're still here I presume you want to know what Resi 5 offers...and lo! I, uh, will tell you just that very thing!

You shoot people in the face. Monsters sprout out of their face, and you shoot those too. Then more monsters sprout of the dead monster, and you stab those because you've run out of bullets shooting all the other sprouty things. Only, stabbing things is rubbish and you're better off giving them an axe kick to the face or a mighty uppercut instead. 

You punch a financially astute crow and it drops it's life-savings in the form of a bag of gold coins, that you can spend on weapons instead of putting that dead crows children through crow college.

Much enjoyable action ensues as you stab, shoot, punch and karate kick lots of African people infected by a bio-weapon. Now, despite the fact your character is white, and everyone you are shooting is black, it's totally not racist. Africa is believed to be one of the earliest places where life developed, and the games story has a plant that only grows there, which can be used to control the various viruses that have been created throughout the series. 

Having found the final part for the bioweapon in Africa they take it for a test run on the indigenous people, and so that's why everyone is black. There was that dodgy bit where you encounter tribes dressed in ancestral clothing, and they just leave a flimsy note that says ""everyone went doolally and dressed up in ancestral clothing for no reason whatsoever"" *other than a designer thought it would look cool* but beyond that the plot is incredibly well thought out and totally not open to misrepresentation. 

Though you might be literally xenophobic, as, at this point in the Resident Evil canon, the origin of all these biological weapons might as well be alien lifeforms from outer space.

The controls are a teeny bit poo due to still being unable to move and shoot, yet it's still fun to play thanks to the frantic numbers of enemies on-screen, gory gun-play, and some entertaining set-pieces.

You have an AI partner, or with some mild technical fiddling co-op play is still doable. Your AI partner isn't thick as pig-poop, so that's nice. They are still a bit dim from time to time, but they mean well, bless 'em.

Somewhat surprisingly the dialogue isn't awful, and compared to the plots of other Resi games, well...this is almost coherent and...okay..?? Which is high praise for this series.

What are the vanilla graphics like?.....*coughs....really, really, reaaaaaally needs reshade to sort them out....coughs* They look nice, if by nice you meant uglier than they actually are. As Capcom have gone out of their way to put a look to the visuals that makes them seem washed out and bland, with colours not really popping and everything looking grittier than you'd expect from a PC title running in high resolution. 

Texture detail is high, as are model details, but even with the graphics setting of film grain effect turned off they still seem flat and a bit grim. That users can mod the game to look nicer through post-processing (?) is not something Capcom can take credit for, and it feels like this is hamstrung visually as they go for a style that hasn't aged well. 

When you remove certain things, and enhance, or add, others, it can look better without the need for changing any assets. On the other hand...there are times when reshade makes it even uglier, mostly though this happens in cutscenes. Some are video and look pish no matter what you do, as any upscaling will only ""enhance"" the unsexy style Capcom chose to present them in, whereas some of them that are in-game assets end up looking garish or over-saturated. 

The Untold Stories DLC doesn't add much, other than around 5 hours of slight refinements to the formula of the main game, and both story dlc's are just fun and frothy padding. I guess the Mercenaries mode is perhaps the biggest draw for some, with it being a time trial where you earn time extensions from killing enemies, so has that pull for competitive sorts. If it sounds like something that won't hold your attention, as trying to complete it in quicker times is all there is to it, then I'd say the DLC isn't worth it.

The main game is slick and enjoyable, but is a popcorn block-buster re-tread of Resi 4, so while it will linger in the memory, by this point it's for slightly wrong reasons i.e it being ridiculous. There's no chance of subtlety by now, and any attempts at moving the game forward would never have worked while the controls are still so awkward. 

Because this is their Dead Space / Gears Of War, and well....as enjoyable as Resi 5 is, is not a patch on either of those with how it handles, and remains a slightly awkward diversion for the series to have gone. 

The spectacle is there, the bombast is there, it's just whiffy enough that you can't ignore the stink, and lacks either the substance, or freshness, of Resi 4. But now that they went even bigger with 5...Resi 6 just collapses into a steaming pile of sh*te, with worse controls, even more stodgy action, and plotting so dumb that this game looks like the work of literary geniuses.

Narratively these games have as much in common with a worthwhile plot as an aardvaark does to my toenail clippings, so play them all, or play one, or play none, I don't care. Things are always retrofitted anyway, or wishy-washy at best, so just enjoy the brilliantly daft 4, or the slightly vapid thrill-ride here, and spare yourself the awfulness of 6.",1650150699,1650150849,True,5,1,0.502112329006195068,0,True,False,False

------------------------------
Resident Evil 5 had some pretty big shoes to fill after the groundbreaking success of RE4. The game was a huge success upon its original release, becoming the bestselling game in the franchise and only being outdone in total sales by Monster Hunter World.

On a gameplay level, RE5's mechanics are very similar (but definitely not identical) to its predecessor. Melee is greatly improved, guns feel a bit more powerful, and the aiming is much more precise and controlled. The largest departure from 4 is of course the co-op partner system, which is constant throughout the entire game and with which you will need to juggle items and weapons between yourself and your AI partner.

While the AI partner will get you through the campaign, this game was meant to be played with two people. 
I played the game with my online settings on and almost always found another player.

The gameplay is solid and the story is serviceable, but one cannot ignore the radical shift from survival horror to pure action with horror elements. There are sections where it feels like you are playing a gallery shooter with a zombie DLC skin. The majority of the enemies will be Plagas-controlled soldiers with slight variations.

Boss fights are big spectacle moments in the game, and they are distinct enough to stand out from each other, but start to feel the same after a while.

In summary, this is a fun action-packed romp that is best played with a friend. The story is more distinct compared to 4, the gameplay is reworked and upgraded in some ways, and there is never a dull moment",1649605013,1649605013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And yet, I've played it for hundreds of hours. Yeah, I know what my Steam stats say, but I've bought this game right when it came out on PC in 2009 A.D. Spent I don't know how long in Mercenaries mode to get that sweet SS rank on both standard and No Mercy (BSAA Chris with standard handgun and shotgun - I'm never playing you again). Got it again to get the DLCs that the PC fanbase was begging for for years, to which Capcom had finally acquiesced in 2015 - SIX years after the original release which is both bad business on their part and bad PR move to dismiss the community that supported the game from its original release all those years ago. 
But, Capcom's business model is a  can of worms I'm not going to open today. More than necessary, that is. 
The game is fun.
And I don't even like it. Because almost everything about it is mediocre, and there are those times that it's either too stupid, too nonsensical or too boring to engage me.
And there's the SOLID gameplay.
There's the kick and gun method of engaging in combat and it's the most addicting thing ever. Like high school and college late nights when you just punch something and despite you wasting time doing Public Assembly with Sheva to get that 400 combo that you get interrupted at 230-something, you get the best time of your life. I sometimes just turn it on to roundhouse kick 70 Majini's with Jill and switch it off when the Executioner appears because shooting and kicking enemies is SOO SATISFYING.
And everything else about this game is sub-par.
Horror - nonexistent. I could stretch it to one-hit-kill Reapers that are just big cockroaches, chainsaw guys, Executioners when they swing an axe at you, but you see it's only because I'm scared of losing progress, and that's it. Lack of any inventive body-horror and build up taking 10 seconds kills any tension, on top of everything having this beige-pastel coloring that makes everything look plastic and very bright. Aside from one section in the mines everything is too perfectly visible and daytime/nighttime makes no difference to the gameplay and atmosphere. Also giving the player a partner that is both an additional firepower and pick-up/healer stripes the gameplay from the tension and challange, which the developers tried to recapture by... Giving you more enemies to fight. And then enemies with machineguns... At which point you can drop the pretense and directly describe the game as a cover-shooter. A RESIDENT EVIL game. Let's just say it's not what we're here for. Even in the moments with extremely dangerous lickers, which can effortlessly grab you and kill you (which actually happens in solo Mercenaries), you are equally effortlessy saved by your partner and you might not even know that there was an option to die there.
There's a lot of varied enemies, regular Majinis have different weapons depending on the locations from sickles and bottles to dynamite and... AK-47s. There are small annoying bat-like cratures, stronger dogs and more dangerous lickers to mini bosses each providing a nice shake-up to the already engaging combat.
The settings are creative, some even very original (tribal village for example), but again that watercolored enviroment just blends it all together. And it's such a shame, really. 
Music, orchestral, sometimes gives the rythm to the battle or dramatizes the cutscenes stays with you even after you finish your game session.
Plot is predictable, as in most of RE games. Characters are paper thin, which I don't really mind. It's not an issue with me, it's an RE game (?), so I'm neither surprised nor let down. If it's an issue with you, then take away a point from the final score.
The game is stable, animations are solid, story mode is LOOONG, there are additional modes and difficulties and a lot of unlockables and in-game secrets to find. The Mercenaries mode itself is a time-drainer for months or even years.
The AI partner is... Making the game too easy. I know some say the AI of Sheva is broken, but I've found her very responsive and she resuscitated me every time on time (some exceptions on the hardest difficulty, but it's a feature there) and she shot everyting accurately, so...? There were literally a couple of spots she could get stuck or didn't know how to avoid a hit, but even the chainsaw guy comically missed her 95% of the time. Maybe don't mess with cover/attack options and always give her handgun ammo so she won't use the magnum which is coincidentaly the only gun she has ammo for? I mean it can be an issue with the processor or RAM memory. I got a vague feeling of the sort that my ancient PC rendered her quite competent and my super new one makes her little bit dumber? Maybe.
The pacing is... I don't even know if this game has a pacing. It's just one battle after another, growing more and more bombastic. And cool boss battles. Usually out of nowhere. With overgrown animals or big blobs.
Cutscenes range from being so serious it's comical, through characters changing their minds out of nowhere, iconic boulder punching to really cool motion captured acrobatic melee fights. Some of the moves you can actually do in game (Skull Crusher).
Weapon upgrades are cool. Yet no merchant this time, it's just a... Screen.
Inventory is in real time, which is scary. Unless, you realize you can reload your weapons WHILE you perform melees, which makes long-a** reload time for magnum irrelevant. And you got hotkeys for your items...
It's all just a cliche action game.
But shoot and kick is SOO SATISFYING.
It's neither as challenging as RE1, multi-layered as RE3, nor as well directed as RE4. 
Just a brainless fun with nothing unique to offer but spectacular kicks.
7/10 - good game
PS Did anyone notice that when Sheva went to America to learn the language she did it so well she talks with British accent? It's the same in RE4 with Spaniards speaking like Mexicans.
PS2 You might have to need to mess with the Games for Windows Live to make it playable, but there are guides on the net on how to do it. It's not that hard make it run, actually.

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)

The game has amazing replay value. There are tons off little ""off the path"" secret items and collectibles. After every level you play, you have an ability to buy or upgrade your weapons and armor. This allows for a ton of progression that at the end leaves you feeling very powerful.

After you beat the campaign the game has you replay it, but with your upgraded weapons and gear. I can say after multiple play-throughs it never got old.

PRESENT review:  So my initial impressions were ""WOW this game does NOT look 13 years old.""

The overall presentation of the game, from the Main Screen, to the gameplay, is outstanding. Capcom did great work for this game.

- Using mouse and keyboard is a little wonky. It goes from me having to move my mouse across the pad to turn, to moving it an inch causes me to double 360 spin. I had to switch to controller, which made aiming feel clunky, just as it did back on the 360 haha.  I guess that is supposed to be the feel of the game, like the older resident evil games.

The story follows Chris and the lovely Sheva as they attempt to discover the secret of a biological terrorist threat. It’s linear with some twists embedded within; It is a very enjoyable journey.
Inventory system is simple, but I like how you can easily give/request items to your partner.
The areas you encounter in this game are beautiful. Taking place on the African savanna, there are plenty of delightful views to behold.
Additionally, I love all the unlockables you can earn in this game. They give more reasons to replay this already fun game. 
While it can be played in single player, it is definitely better with a friend. It’s also nice to see people online still playing such an old game. And it’s surely one of the best co-op game’s I’ve played.

I was confused on why my game refused to start considering that this service was discontinued years ago, until I went into the discussion boards and discovered I needed to first download an old [Games for Windows Live] installer/client from a peer-to-peer service, put it into the steam game files before the game agreed to run. 

This is a game that is over 13 years old at the time of posting this review, just remove the [Games for Windows Live] requirement already. 

The game itself:

Mouse+keyboard: Harder QTEs, slower turning speed, awkward inventory reloading but way easier aiming. Using a pistol and rifle feels very good in this game. Sometimes when you try to run but let go of the aim button too late, you might accidently do a manual reload instead which will cause you to get hit. 

Mouse+keyboard is perfect for a ""first weapon of each type"" only playthrough. As the starter pistol, the M92F holds 100 for capacity by the end with headshot bonuses, the starter shotgun, the Ithaca holds 25 shells with headshot bonuses, the starter machine gun, and starter sniper rifle also hold so many bullets that you do not need to worry about reloading at all in the middle of a fight. 

Xbox One controller: Easier QTEs, faster turning speed, can reload in the middle of picking things up, but aiming sucks. The machine gun and shotgun feels way better on controller than keyboard+mouse. I usually end up using the Ithaca until I get a M3 or Hydra shotgun and the AK machine gun when playing on controller. 

It feels much better and faster to hold the right camera stick either left or right and then quickly press aim twice to turn 90 degrees twice than to hold back and press run to do a 180 degree turn. You can't do that on keyboard and mouse. The inventory reload on keyboard and mouse requires you to drag the bullets towards the gun which feels very awkward to do fast, usually its only safe to do it when you are knocked down to the floor. But on controller, all you need to reload is 4 quick button presses.

2009 partner AI: If you ever get grabbed, your partner will not save you. You partner will not know how to conserve ammo by aiming at limbs then meleeing. If your partner finds a green herb, she will either: A use it immediately recovering only a little bit of life, or B combine it with another green herb instead of saving it for when you find a red herb. 

Only good thing about the partner AI: No QTE failing and 100% accuracy on all shots. Give her only a sniper rifle, This gurantees no wasted ammo as everything gets one shotted, and occassionally she will stun a subboss for you. 

One of the things I like about this game(non professional difficulty) is that it rewards skill and knowledge of the enemies, where if you lose, 90% of the time it is your fault and you could have played better.",1646875379,1646875379,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another aspect is the 9 achievements that are attached to an online verses mode that was likely not all that great to begin with, and to the point of non-existant this long after the game's release.

The game its self is awsome, although much more enjoyable in co-op as it was intended to be played. The customization of the game was very much like RE4, allowing the player the freedom to choose which guns they wanted to use. The inclusion of an inventory box also allowed you to store guns, ammo, and medical supplies to use later. The interactive cut sceens and button ques were less enjoyable, but did add some additional challenges in a similar manner to RE4. The unlockable features such as infinite ammo after beating the game was also extremely useful, as replaying on harder difficulties was already a great challenge and would have really been a chore had that feature not been there. My only complaint with the infinite ammo feature would be that it would have been nice to still have the gun's capacity limit and to reload like normal from an invisible ammo supply that didn't clutter up your inventory.

Overall the game played well with no issues or crashes; however, I really wish they would have removed all of the games for windows live crap and not removed the splitscreen co-op feature. So if you enjoy the Resident Evil series, then you will likely enjoy this one as well.",1645881903,1645881903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story revolves around Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar trying to prevent the use of Bio Weapons from terrorists while coming into contact with some familiar faces and finding out a much more larger scheme. The characters in this game are ok as there isn't really anything to say about them in terms of a great performance. In fact i think some of the characters in this game can feel a bit one sided or just thrown in for the sake of it. For example, Josh Stone isn't really developed into anything other than just simply an ally that has some connection to one of the main characters. Ricardo Irving also suffers from this as well as he is made out to be this crazy bad guy, but is given no development at all as to why he is this way. The story itself is a bit mixed while the main plot might be a bit typical, it does move the game along pretty well and throws in some twists and turns that turned out to be really enjoyable. 
The setting of Kijuju is really nice and offers an interesting change up from places like Raccoon City and the Spanish Village in 4 to something completely different like Africa. All of the areas in the game were great to traverse around such as the main town, open marsh and dark mines as each added to the overall feel of Africa to the point where it felt like the setting was its own character. Will definitely say that the areas have a lot more intrigue than some of the characters do!
Visually, for a game that was released in 2009, its pretty impressive and still holds up today. I really like the designs of the characters, especially Albert Wesker which his coat texture looking really good for a game of this age. The environments are impressive as well and the enemies look perfect for this type of game. For the most part this is a pretty good looking game. 
The sound and audio are also a mixed bag as the soundtrack is loaded with heavy and intense action pieces which i think in some parts the game could have benefited without it, but it is decent for the the tone that this game sets. The audio i think is good with all the guns, zombies and environments sounding the way the should be, however when it comes to cut scenes, the audio quality becomes worse. It might be because of the age of this game or for the other thing I'm going to mention before discussing gameplay. 
Before even getting into the game itself, i tried to start it and a little sign for ""games for windows"" popped up.  I (obviously) declined this being in use or even being offered to install and tried to start the game again which to my surprise wouldn't work. So i had to go out of my way to find a zip file and replace the contents of the RE5 file with the zip file. The zip file can be found at this link: http://www.mediafire.com/file/g23xwaval9esowo/BH5-Fixes.zip/file
It's just really frustrating having to go find a fix to a game that you haven't even started. However, this zip file apparently fixes a few bugs that may have been in the game so at least thats a plus with the fact that it can now run Resident Evil 5. 
In terms of gameplay, its a pretty solid third person shooter. The main thing you will be doing is shooting and killing zombies in all ways possible. For someone who had not experienced the action oriented games from the Resident Evil Series. the way the guns handle in this game is great. Speaking of guns, the game offers players with an array of weaponry to be able to take down the mutated undead. The inventory system and the herb system are as the same with any other RE game which i must say is just a perfect system that has been carried along the whole series. I like the way that when an enemy is staggered Chris can perform an attack that does both damage and knock back and is also pretty funny to watch happen. There are some quick time events in the game but it doesn't take away from the overall experience. The boss fights are enjoyable to try and defeat, but there can be ones that absorb so much of your ammo to the point where you have nothing to fight it with which can get pretty tedious. For the most part this isn't the main issue. The biggest issue that i have with this game is the companion character. If you want to play this game i would strongly recommend playing with another person as there is a strong emphasis on co-op and playing this on single player can be a bit frustrating with the AI that replaces what would have been the other player. Essentially, the companion character feels like extra weight on your shoulders due to it needing the same items as you, taking their time to interact with another object and the fact that they constantly die from anything that deal the slightest bit of damage. 
Overall, with all the negatives being laid out, i do believe that Resident Evil 5 is still a pretty fun game with some great combat and some really unintentional funny moments and I would recommend to those who are a fan of the series or just want an enjoyable third person shooter.",1645558942,1645558942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, before playing this game, I have played Resident Evil 1-4 (including code veronica) for the first time and in close intervals. 

This game emotionally and mentally upset me and at no point could I say I had fun with this game. Sheva's A.I. is absolutely terrible. She wastes ammo and health and sometimes doesn't attack at all, or even attacks the enemy when I don't want her to. Some of you might be saying ""Why didn't you just get someone to play with you?"" and my response would be; Why would a main-title Resident Evil game (a traditionally single-player game) expect me to play this game with another person. I can play solo, but as I just said, the A.I. is absolutely atrocious. That is what upsets me the most. Some other things I hate about this game is the gameplay mechanics, mainly that you only get 9 slots for your inventory, unlike RE4, which had the best storage system in the whole franchise. And yes, Resident Evil 1-C:V had around 12 slots, by the difference is that this is a compleatly different genre of game. RE 1-4 is a survival horror game, this is a CO-OP, TPS, action game. And to note: I am not resistant to change, I loved the change of gameplay that RE4 introduced, but the changes in theme and gameplay were not good. Finally, there's the story, which is fine. It takes itself too seriously but overall its not bad.

This is my opinion so please take this with a grain of salt. Heck, you might enjoy this game more than me. But please for the love of God (Or any other higher being you believe in), do NOT play this game solo.

Baffling design decisions - you can literally farm resources by redoing missions - checkpoints even, NO Save Room/area, manage your inventory ONLY before a mission or after reloading checkpoints?!
AI companions are hindrance because of no foresight from devs - they always want to stand to your right but since the camera is on the right shoulder perspective you keep aiming close to them which forces AI to back away or stand directly behind you. If they cant, they just stand there and arent even shooting. IF they get behind you, they simply unload rounds in your back until YOU move.

Unlike the classic Resident Evil games, this game is more focused on action and cooperation with either the AI partner or another player. Personally, I think that the modern RE games don't quite hold up to the classic ones, but that dosen't mean that this is a bad game. No, Resident Evil 5 is a great game. The gameplay is solid: It's a fairly slow paced shooter, with the from RE4 (or more like RE: Survivor) typical run, stand and shoot mechanic. There are tons of licensed guns in the game (I'm looking at you RE4 and 6) and they have great detail for a third person shooter. From a graphical standpoint, this game is still a sight for sore eyes. It got better graphics than RE6, which suffers from several low-res textures and low-poly mesh at many points. Movement is pretty basic in RE5, you can walk slowly, run and use a quick turn key. There's no jumping around, rolling or sprinting in this game, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. In RE6 these features seemed partially unnecessary and felt like they came straight out of a some Asian Kung Fu movie.
The melee system has been slightly expanded compared to it's predecessor, you can now execute different melee moves depending on the enemy's body part you hit and the resulting stun animation. Every character has his own unique melee moves. You can also chain combos with your partner, the last melee attack of the combo will result in a very powerful attack like Chris' Haymaker or Wesker's Ghost Butterfly. The co-op mechanics are decent, although I feel like the game would have benefited from being a single player experience like RE4. It just makes it much easier for the player to dive into the game's world if you are alone, without a partner spamming ""Hurry!"", ""C'mon!"", ""Hurry!"".  Nether the less, co-op is fun with another player, and I advice you to stay away from the AI partner, because it's HORRIBLE. The inventory system is now in realtime (again, you can blame co-op for that) and is much better than in RE6. RE6 took a huge step backwards and gave the player a somewhat confusing row-based inventory which dosen't show all items at the same time. Weapons don't need any inventory slots either in RE6, so you will run around with about 6 different guns, lowering the inventory management the series is known for even more. The cutscenes are probably the most action filled part of the game, while they are greatly executed, some just feel a bit over the top. It dosen't ruin the game or anything though. The story has it's weakpoints ([spoiler]Jill being mindcontrolled, Wesker's weakness being the serum, the final boss fight[/spoiler]), and makes me wonder why they haven't sticked to some of the earlier designs ([spoiler] Like Wesker having one of his eyes stabbed out by Jill, and later the other eye shot out by Sheva. It makes much more sense than some serum that was never mentioned before.[/spoiler]). It still is enough to keep you going, even though the plot twist in this game is a bit obvious and easy to figure out. Once you played through the main game, you'll unlock The Mercenaries mode, which is very similar to the one from RE4. Trying to get better scores can be addicting.

Overall this is a very good game, but it dosen't quite hold up to the name Resident Evil anymore, not even compared to RE4, which was much more survival horror-ish than this one.

tl;dr:
+ Good gameplay
+ Co-op is fun
+ Excellent graphics for a 2009 title
+ Nice variety of weapons and upgrades
+ Mercs is addicting

- More action focused than RE4
- Partner AI is horrible
- Story has some weaker points

With a interesting roller coster of a story to tell. Even, if you know the story . I'm sure the co-op side of things would make this game worth it for the random lols .

  Now, lets get into the flaws . The knifing is wonky which can randomly switch to the gun , looking at Sheva , bug out , or use the knife which it should be doing . If your gonna use the knife just hold the attack button . To avoid issues .  The partner ai is weird . The shelter command basicly tells the ai to stay beside you . While the go comman just tells Sheva to attack closer to the enemies . More than enough times with boss's this is something you should avoid . Unless, you grind, and leveled up your guns. Which, will make the base ai not the best .

  There are some what the f--k is a item at momments , and times when the ai fails to get important key items. Essentially, soft locking your game. Because, the ai forgot to get an item you need to progress . Which can be annoying .

While, re5 is not by any means a awful game alone. This game is ment to be a online co-op experience . Which, is another flaw. There is no local co-op . So you will need to buy this game twice . To enjoy this with a friend . 

  I would have to say the game is around, a 3.5 /5 in reguards to fun, quality , atmosphere , replayablility , challange, and other things that hurt this game from being as polished as RE4 in multiple of ways .

A very underwhelming, easy, short action game that brings shame to the legacy of RE.
I got into Resident Evil games properly in early 2020, finishing RE4. I then went on to finish Village on its release this year and then RE7. I finished RE2R a month ago. 
I am a ""fan"" of RE3 Nemesis because as a child it terrified me so much I didn't actually play a RE game fully through until I was almost 30.

[list]
    [*]The quick time events are awful. 
    [*]The constant action is over the top and goofy, so there is no seriousness.
    [*]The levels are very short and very, very easy. 
[/list]

I tried playing this on my own and it was so bland that I asked a friend to buy it and play with me. 
We had some fun and it was super chill, but the story was just bad.

Wesker is ridiculous, punching that boulder was such a farewell to survival horror and the only slightly tense moment was with the enemies with claws that lasted what, 30 seconds to a minute for the encounters.

All I can say is thankfully they are starting to have some actual atmosphere with RE2R, RE7-8 and I really look forward to RE9. They are going steady and they do not need to return to this over-the-top action format that crosses over into the absurd.

Couldn't get co-op running with a friend without outside installation of a random multiplayer patch.
Controls were very confusing and slow.
Zombies take whole magazines of ammo to kill rendering you empty of ammo for most of the game, and the game throws quite a lot of zombies at you at once. 
Character and facial animations were the most enjoyable parts of this game due to how funny they looked.
The story was way too boring, characters were boring, it felt more like a chore to get through the entire game.
The graphics and textures somehow went through a de-evolution compared to RE4, not to mention how many nausea inducing filters they put over every scene. 
There's this really strange part where you have to get through infected primitive African tribes and it just felt wrong, maybe it was just us. 

If there was anything good about this game, in co-op, you can press V nonstop to annoy the utter hell of your team mate as you scream for them to hurry up in game if they are taking they sweet time.

The AI sometimes takes the longest possible route to a point and expends ammo like it's nothing if you give her more than a sniper. Also the entire game is plagued with this ugly urine filter that so many games of its time seemed to be afflicted with.

[b]Also also, the game just straight up won't work when you buy it off of Steam.[/b] Capcom seriously needs to get their shit together with this one. We shouldn't have to set up GFWL or fan patches to get the game we just spent 20$ to work.

Have to buy the DLC separate which was not the case when this game released on console (IMO still not worth it). Had issues trying to run the game after initial install - had to install something to fix Windows Live. They brought back the partner inventory swapping mechanics from RE0 which is absolutely terrible. Very limited inventory space with no ability to increase it. You also couldn't swap guns between characters. Although the plot was interesting, I felt that everything could have led up better to RE5 (Progenitor Virus, T-Virus, T-Veronica Virus, G-Virus, Las Plagas) all just for another virus. In addition, the whole online 2nd person for campaign coop is a joke. Encountered a game ending bug where an enemy was misplaced that was supposed to drop a key item but wouldn't. Accidentally left the online setting when I went to play and when the person joined (who had 9000 golden eggs lol) I 100% lost my offline partner's inventory. Super frustrating. You cannot buy ammo but you can buy first aid sprays and guns (not necessary to buy gun though unlike in RE4). Game was very easy and mostly died at the QTE boss fights of the game. Save your money for RE4 or RE2 Remake. Ony  60% of players beat the very first episode (1-1) and 25% of players beat the game on Normal - pretty sad.

As someone who has played 5 Resident Evil games in a row, Resident Evil 5 was very different to the rest, and that's a good thing. I think some people are too harsh on this game since it doesn't use the RE formula of slow paced gameplay in a mansion or other location with puzzles. 

Resident Evil 5 is a fast paced action survival game. The horror elements are nowhere to be found, which I was a bit sad about, but damn is this game fun. At times this game feels like a kickass on rails shooter arcade game! 

The setting, while very different than most RE games, was really great IMO. The graphics are beautiful for how old this game is and the level design is smart and fits the game perfectly. 

The story does just about enough to still be a Resident Evil game, with reccuring characters on both sides and you're still fighting bioweapons, but it still feels fresh because of the setting. 

My only complaint about Resident Evil 5 is Shieva's AI. Not because its inventory management is bad or its dumb or anything, I actually think it's a pretty smart AI for how old this game is. My problem was that she would get stuck in certain locations and refuse to move. This resulted in me having to relaunch and lost progress on 3 seperate occasions. 

Give this game a shot if you've played the other Resident Evil games. This is NOT a good introducton into the series. Play the first few games before this, especially Resident Evil 4. RE4 and RE5 share a lot in common especially the sound effects lol. 

Get it if its on sale, absolutely. This is a blast. Don't take it too seriously.

This is an awful game. First of all, it doesn't work.
After you download an unofficial patch and get it to launch, you start wishing you didn't.

It has very low FOV, which I found nauseating, and no way of adjusting it.

The controls suck, you can't move the player without also moving the camera, when you move both at the same time it introduces some sort of input lag which is awful. Also, and most importantly, you can't aim/shoot while also moving.

The game has a lot of cutscenes which don't really add to the experience or story, so they are just annoying.

The melee combat is the worst I have ever experienced, the guns feel weak, the ragdoll physics are wack, and the gameplay is repetitive in the sense the enemies always spawn in the same place and such.

The Co-op element is just basically: To open this door, both players need to stand in front of it and press a button, otherwise it won't open. That's it.",1638169730,1638169867,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

If anyone was having the problem at game start up of ERR09: unsupported function here is the solution:

Capcom has an unusual screen resolution in it`s ini-file.
Solution:
edit file `config.ini` located in `c:*My Documents*CAPCOM*RESIDENT EVIL 5`
edit line `Resolution=792x572` to your monitor resolution. Save. Exit. Play Game!
The file exists. Search for CAPCOM on your HD. Don`t create a new one!

This is also the first franchise that you have to play with AI who has weapons and she needs your attention carefully to manage her ammo and health (yes, she is Sheva), unlike RE 4 which you just need to focus on Ashley's health since her doesn't carry any weapon. And also, you might be struggling by keeping Sheva alive like you play RE 4 at first time that we must concentrate on Ashley too. The different here, after complete the story, RE 4 gives you Knight Costume for Ashley which make her invincible, so you can play Professional Mode without worrying Ashley's health that make it easier. But RE 5 doesn't give you the same gift, Sheva will be your big problem when you play on Professional Mode, especially when you have arrived on Wesker's Mansion (on Chapter 5-3). On DLC Desperate Escape, the AI (whether Jill or Josh) also makes Professional Mode almost impossible to be cleared. I saw many players have similarity problem with me on forums, that also makes some players don't like to play with AI anymore on next Resident Evil series, and thank God Capcom granted our wish, even still on multiplayer mode, there's no need to worrying or maintaining ammo and health for your AI partner on Resident Evil 6 (of course if we play on offline mode).

Besides on every AI problems, Resident Evil 5 is still one of my favorite games. I love the controlling system improvements, finding all treasures, the plot of story,  and thankfully the inventory system has been normalized so you can store your weapons and ammo when you start a new game or new chapter (not like RE 4 that you have to throw your weapon or sell it to merchant before you can maintain your inventory for a new weapon). The DLCs are also good, the best DLC for me is Lost in Nightmares that you can see what really happened to Jill before she was brainwashed, and also the creepy Spencer Mansion is the best horror plot on this game. And only in Resident Evil 5 you will see the last story of Albert Wekser (but idk why I doubt if he's dead there).

Unlike RE 6, you can still find any players to play with you easier on online mode especially on mercenaries or versus mode.  Even the best mercenaries mechanic system is RE 6 imo, RE 5 still has a worth to play mercenaries mode especially you can play with 4 players and enhance the number of enemies maximum to 700 by using mod and trainer.

The sunny African setting is a cool change of pace for the franchise, and the over-the-top style works surprisingly well with a bleaker feel of modern war thrillers like [i]Black Hawk Down[/i]. The whole thing is topped off with important anti-colonial themes (somewhat reminiscent of RE4's critique of organized religion) and a welcome return of several characters from earlier games.

RE5 may not be quite as atmospheric, monumental, and ambitious as RE4, but it's really good at creating intense situations and makes excellent use of all kinds of hostile creatures. Some boss fights do feel a bit lackluster, but apart from that the level and enemy design consistently provides you with surprises, challenges, and genuine tension.

====
i love this game, when the game came out i bought it on PS3 and i started a CO-OP game with a random player from who knows where, and we finished the game together in 1 playthrough from start to finish.
so i will always love this game and that memory.
when the game came out i loved it but so many people didn't, at that time i didn't get it, but now i do.
the reason people did not like it was :
A : zombies shouldn't be able to get guns and AK, what is this call of duty >?!
B : low graphics (even for the time the game came out)
i understand these 2 reasons now, but i still love it, but i reduce my score from 8.5 to 8.1 now.
The game is more a co-op shoot to kill and a little less resident evil.
but i love it because you usually get a co-op game which is not good, or a good game that is not co-op.
so to be able to play a good game and it being well build around co-op is nice.
the game does not have many ties in story to previous games so you can play it a little out of order.
it could have been a little longer if you ask me. good weapons and good gameplay.
even if you did not play the game when it came out, i still recommend you to play it, it is fun.
=====
DO NOT BUY THE DLCS IT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.
i give this game : 8.1/10

RE5 makes a whole lot of weird design choices (especially for its boss fights). Plus, it’s a violent change in tone for the horror series. Yet all of its wonkiness still works in a uniquely good-bad package. The awkward tank controls are something you kinda learn to like over time. Strangely, the distribution of ammo and health was really well balanced. Between the two of us, we rarely had exactly zero resources to use. The horror isn't as intense and engaging as the constant scramble for ammo is. For as generic as the gunplay feels, each chapter had its fair share of cooperative opportunities and rewarding close calls.

The self-aware campiness of RE4 is no longer here amidst RE5’s litany of cliches, unrequested fanservice, and a complete lack of subtlety. The ridiculousness of the story is a treat that thrives in the context of a shared experience.  There's plenty of chances for you and your partner to react to the absurdity of set pieces and cutscenes. The pain of QTEs gains a refreshing layer of comedy when there’s somebody there to also complain about them.

If you've got an invested companion and there happens to be a Steam sale going on, I'd strongly recommend giving RE5 a go. Just know that RE5 requires an external patch to get up and running now.

the regular enemies are just unpredictable garbage. sometimes they die in 1 hit when i shoot them in the chest, sometimes, they take a point blank shotgun shell to the head. 

the gameplay is just bad, tank controls, cant move while aiming, cant move while reloading, inventory menu doesnt pause the screen. half the time when you break boxes or urns, you get gold instead of ammo or health. there were times where i had to go knife only cause i was so low on ammo. and you gotta share half of your supplies with sheva, so ultimatly i just decided to horde the ammo and let sheva be the healer.

i think the games takes on the more action/third person shooter aspect of resident evil, and this game could have been so good but they just fucked it up royally.

i cannot force myself to complete this game. i got this game in a bundle with RE4 and RE6 for 18 dollars. i absolutely loved RE4 and it was one of the best RE games i have played, and i hope that RE6 will be good as well.

Some people still say although it isn't a horror Resident Evil game, that it is still fun. For myself though, I did not have any fun at all. It is so linear, so lame, and so confused about what it wants to be, that it just becomes boring. The over the top action and one liners seriously become pure cringe at some times.

She deserves a game of her own, like MGS did to Raiden with MGR. Anyway... HER EYES T_T...

RE5 is a very good game, not as good as RE4 but very close to it. And considering RE4 is what Space Odyssey is to Sci-Fi films for action games, RE5's spot is pretty damn high up there compared to similar titles in its genre. And it achieves this by, well, continuing what RE4 instantiated in terms of game mechanics and pacing and basically perfecting the formula. However, it is not as well-paced as RE4 and the level design is lacking too, there is very little amount of sprawling, intricate level design in this game, it's much more staged, like small arenas with some keys to finds/doors to open around it. This is of course because of the co-op nature of the game, and many people say that playing through the campaign co-op is the best way to experience the game (they are probably right).

Many people also say that this game is less scary compared to RE4 but I disagree, since RE4 (or RE1-2-3) wasn't scary either, so there's no 'less' here. I mean, come on it's 2021, Resident Evil and the zombies could've been scary when it first came out but still? The only scary thing in the original trilogy should be the fear of not being able to save your game or something like that lol. But that's just my personal opinion and you are free to disagree, I wouldn't judge OWO

With that said, I was very glad about RE5's story being directly connected to important sh*t in Resident Evil lore and wasn't goofy as RE4's... Okay, it's still goofy as hell but at least the documents, environmental storytelling and some of the interactions between characters were solid.
The gameplay, like I mentioned it is mostly similar to RE4's, but more thrilling and engaging. Some of the combat encounters in this game are palm-sweatingly (is this a thing?) tense as f*ck, and I loved it. Bosses are okay too, they all have gruesome designs which is always a selling point for me when it comes to Resident Evil.

DLC's were very good too (especially Lost in Nightmares- which is simply excellent but short :c)

So, overall, this game is extremely good lmao what's not to love here, I don't really get it.

Nice Coop-Shooter, no Horror but with a nice dude you will have fun. Steam doesn’t recognize the xlive.dll Problem. Games for Windows Live is dead and not supported anymore. You have to load manually the xlive.dll.

This game has 4 different control settings and none of them let you move and shoot at the same time, which is odd considering every other cut scene/partner move shows you pulling off some Olympic gymnastic level moves. 

The AI ally is horrible and will often body block your shots, which in a resource limited game really impacts you.

You need to share resources and give half your ammo to your AI partner as though you had a co-op partner.

Enemies are also oddly athletic until the last 5 feet away from you, then they're hit with an invisible slowing wall and walk-crawl towards you, it's kinda laughable. 

The writing and voice acting is just godawful. 

The best part of this game really is the artwork, but when you factor in bad game play, bad voice acting, horrible dialogue, clunky controls and that you can't even play the game the moment it's downloaded without going to somewhat sketchy download sites to patch a file in, you're gonna wanna pass on this game, even if it is on sale.",1635832409,1635832409,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Hearing ""Chris, help!"" every 5 seconds made me wish you could just continue with Sheva dead. Having her stand out in the open as she gets shot at was horrible too. I hated to hear ""I'm out of ammo"" from her made me wish I could kill her myself. I did like the lore that was added to the series from this however. And seeing Wesker do matrix shit was pretty badass too even if he is the villain. I had to play this game after hearing Heisenberg from RE Village call Chris a ""boulder punching asshole"" which was hilarious. Did you know that the guy that voices Chris Redfield in this game also voiced Kyle Crane in Dying Light?! I though I recognized his voice from somewhere.

There's definitely a handful of scary moments that do call back to the experiences of Resident Evil 4, even with the more action-y parts.

👩‍🍳[b]Ingredients:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Resident Evil 4
    [*]The cheesiest plot imaginable
    [*]Inordinate amounts of action
    [*]Overly sexualised female characters
    [*]Punching boulders
    [*]A single rotten egg
[/list]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2612344260
👨‍🍳[b]Directions:[/b]
[olist]
    [*]Take Resident Evil 4 and strip it of all its horror elements – throw 'em in the trash where they belong. While doing that, make sure to also get rid of any puzzles, or make them so easy they will insult the player's intelligence. 

❗️[u]Remember[/u]: market research shows that our new target audience is a stupid wuss. They can't get too scared or think for too long.

    [*]While shearing RE4 of all that made it great, be careful to keep the sound design. Every button in the menus should sound exactly the same. It is a new dish, correct, but why not use last month's mouldy leftovers to cut the costs?
 
    [*]In a large bowl, mix all of the female characters until a completely uniform mixture is obtained: sexy, stupid shells of human beings. Add barely enough clothing, open cleavage, close-up shots of butts and breasts. Dress Excella, who's supposed to be a CEO of an international consortium, like a teenage girl who's just discovered her sexuality. Force Jill to wear a skin-tight BDSM outfit and call it a ""battlesuit"". 

❗️[u]Remember[/u]: research shows that a woman can only be powerful or influential as long as she's sexually attractive, otherwise it stops being fun🤤
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2608525523
    [*]Reflect on your poor life choices for 15 minutes. Avoid stabbing yourself in the neck.

 [*]Leon Kennedy, the protagonist of the previous iteration, was a classy, smart, suave and sophisticated sigma male, but also very strong and virtually unstoppable. Keep the unstoppable part, ditch everything else. Research shows that a stupid wuss finds it harder to relate to intelligent characters. Chris Redfield shall be as dumb as a box of rocks. 

    [*]Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add millions of guns and hundreds of upgrades to help people forget what Resident Evil was about. They are now horny and kill a new monster every 5 seconds without stopping, and this is exactly what they seem to enjoy the most (according to, you know... 👨‍🔬[i]research[/i]).

    [*]Spray interior of slow cooker with non-stick vegetable spray. Put a single rotten egg in the middle, cover and cook on medium. Turn around, gain as much speed as possible and smash head-first into a wall. When you come to your senses, the AI partner will be ready. Take it out of the slow cooker (ignore the ear-piercing screams) and throw it in boiling water. The wailing should cease.

    [*][u]Remember:[/u] a stupid wuss likes him some lore, but he is too dumb to actually read and understand it. Place loading screens in a skillet, season with the first page from the document called ""History of Resident Evil"". Make sure loading screens show [u]this[/u] exact page [u]every[/u] single time. 
[i]""Yay, lore!""[/i] screams the stupid wuss, and makes a funny sound. Aww... so endearing❤️ 

    [*]The last (and most important) step: add a special condiment developed in CAPCOM's secret laboratory called ""And They Will Still Like It for Some Reason""🤷‍♂️

QTE's are littered throughout the game, which is applicable for RE4 but they were way few and far between considering the cluster-fuck of them in this game. i think the best thing about this game is during the final Wesker bossfight, Wesker can bitch-slap Sheva into the lava.

UPDATE 10/5/2021 

This game is a guilty pleasure, and as much as I hate the last 2 chapters of the game. The fun of getting all the collectables and psuedo speedrunning the game is so cathartic. I've done at least 4 playthroughs with a friend and I can confidently say that each run was extremely fun. Both mercenaries modes are also extremely fun and feel the most polished the series has had. I feel I did not give this game a fair review upon my initial playthrough because both of us went into the game thinking we were going to hate it. Because we went into the game with this mindset it muddled our overall experience with it. Later playthoughs showed both of us that even though the game has flaws it is still an extremely fun game.",1604978733,1633480848,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Very action packed compared to the originals (0-3). This game becomes muscle memory when you get so familiar with the controls, levels and enemies. Does it have replay value? Absolutely. If you like the controls, weapons, and the story (if that is what you like, then it's what you like), then yes. You can play this over and over and get hooked and unlock everything if you are determined to do so. If you do not want to do that, then I recommend playing The Mercenaries Reunion. 

The Mercenaries Reunion is very arcade like. Start on a map, get time hour-glasses to extend time, do combos for a higher score, do melee to get bonus time. Pretty simple. Every map has different mini bosses and enemy types. Every character has a different load out. As a person who achieved an SS on every character, on every map... I will say that this game mode is highly addictive. It is hard solo, but it is even more fun with a friend. 

Bonus DLC: Lost in Nightmares & Desperate Escape. 

Lost in Nightmares is Resident Evil 5's attempt to go back to the horror roots. Not many enemies but you are limited to supplies, a test of separation from your partner, and QTEs. Story connects to the main story of the game. 

Desperate Escape is more action packed and feels like you're being rushed as you are making your way through the level. Limited supplies and many bosses. The telling of how Jill and Josh made their way to help Chris and Sheva. Definitely like this more than Lost in Nightmares. 

All in All, I would recommend this game. I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and this is more of an arcade entry in the franchise.",1633421836,1633422443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The seventh mainline adventure in the Resident Evil series. It's a pretty cool game where you play as Chris Redfield, who now has shoulders bigger than his head—as you punch solid boulders and shout words of encouragement to save the day. 

Player two also plays as some random woman who shifts between African and British accents faster than I can actually change weapons due to the somewhat awkward inventory system; the game has ditched its horror roots in favour of punching people in the fucking head and making said heads explode! Despite this, the game is still a lot of fun. 

Your main foes in this adventure are: Quasimodo, a Batorpion, an incredibly large man with a beard, an annoying woman named after Microsoft Excel and an incredibly British dude who think's he's a part of the matrix series of films. 

The game is somewhat short and is much better played with two players, as you can really just laugh together about all the absurd things going on. Overall though the game is a blast even if you can't move and shoot, pure high octane action at it's best!

[EDIT]: The game now offers the previously console exclusive DLC for even more co-op adventures. Included in this DLC are a couple of new costumes, an entire scenario that let's you pretend you're playing an old school Resident Evil horror game (but not really), and a scenario that's basically the finale of Saving Private Ryan but in video game form.

Additionally there is a PvP Multiplayer mode (which is as dead as the continent of Africa after Chris is done with it); finally there is also a new version of the classic Mercenaries mode, including everyone's favourite meme machine as a playable character—Barry ""motherfucking"" Burton! If you require a further reason to jump back into the world of RE5 then this DLC is it.",1307723476,1633307833,True,4,4,0.567822813987731934,3,True,False,False

I bought this game, alongside a few other classic Resident Evil's a little while ago to play co-op. A great decision. Ill go through as i always do, see if this sounds up your alley!

Game Mechanics -
If you've played a Resident Evil game (not including the most recent first person ones), then you understand the mechanics, or at least have a scope over how some things work. The game is clunky. Really clunky, but that's not something worth faulting it over. Its old, and for its time, was really something else. Its not at all bad if you can get past the few bad things, such as turning. Which is god awful. Sensitivity is terrible as well, but honestly, it made for more laughs than complaints. The game is a lot of fun in      co-op, but i'm sure you could get some enjoyment from single-player.

Crashes, Bugs, and Not Good things -
I usually have a pretty extensive group of things to say for this section, but honestly, even with how old it is, its really pretty on point. I don't believe i had a single crash out of the 10 hours of playtime, and i also cant say i had any game breaking bugs either. I know they happen, and that there are definitely bugs, but they are in no way catastrophic for the game, at least from my experience.

Co-op -
I'm a single-player guy. I enjoy playing single-player games, and i very VERY rarely will go for a game which support's co-op. This game was meant to be played in co-op. The game is like no other, especially for the time in the sense that you can leave the game midway with someone, reload, and then get back into the game very close to where you left off. The game has a lot of checkpoints for a game from the time period, and the co-op is really easy to setup. There is a slight learning curve if anything, but nothing too unlearn-able.

Overall - The game is great, its a classic, and imo, one of the best Resident Evil's you can buy for multiplayer. The game has a lot of laughs built in, and is sure to make for a fun time. Heavily recommend!

My personal favourite of the Resident Evil franchise and a huge mechanical improvement over RE4, though some prefer the more campy tone of that entry. The port is good and I had no problems at all playing it. I do recommend modding it to expand the FOV because the vanilla setting is way to close. You can almost taste the sweat on Chris' neck. The mod link is in my YouTube video.

RE5 completely changes everything that made the previous games successful and yet keeps enough so that it remains familiar. This game manages to bridge RE4 to the other RE games better than RE4 did as i personally didn't think the plot of RE4 felt like much of a continuation of the RE world apart from some references sprinkled in here and there.

RE5's plot is akin to action movies from the late 80s and early 90s with threats of a biohazard attack like raccoon city but this time global, it also does a good job at showing how the world was affected by the incident of raccoon city by having Chris and Sheva be part of the B.S.A.A an organisation specifically set up to counter anymore biohazard attacks, this means the plot can be more tightly tied into the overall story of resident evil and gives a reason as to why Chris was in Africa when the events of this game happens rather than have the president's daughter kidnapped and it just so happens America sends someone who has directly dealt with biohazards to rescue her when at the time none knew that she was held by a larger force.

this game also does a better job of showing the threats biohazards have on the world by setting it in Africa and leaning into the setting (at least in the first part) by making it a town with homes, shops, schools, ECT compared to a random village / forest, a castle and a island. this game felt like this event was more of an immediate threat to the world than the setting of a isolated area like in RE4.

The reason why I keep comparing RE5 specifically to RE4 is because this game strives to be a bigger version of that game and ultimately i prefer it but i know im not in the majority. There are some problems with this game such as Sheva's AI; it's not as bad as people say it is if you keep her topped up on ammo and healing items as she can actually be quite helpful, but she was also the main reason i had to keep restarting from a previous checkpoint.

Ultimately this game is worth checking out if you are curious and would be quite fun to play with a friend as this game has a lounge in cheek attitude but knows this and has fun with it.

Resident Evil 5 is a solid action game that has incredible replay value with its many weapons to try out, fun level design and the option to play coop.

Resident Evil 5 is by many considered to be inferior to Resident Evil 4, but I don't think this is necessarily true. While Resident Evil 4 may be a better single-player experience, but the ability to jump into any section of the game and the option of cooperative play in this game, offers a much more replayable gameplay experience. In addition, this game features what I believe is the best rendition of the beloved Mercenaries mode, providing even more replay value for when you need a break from story mode. 

The main gripe this port of the game has, is the fact that it still runs on the old Games for Windows Live system, which will, when you first install the game and try to launch it, cause you to to be unable to run it. Luckily, a simple Google search will give you plenty of tutorials that can help you fix this issue within a few minutes.

Overall, a 4.5/5 game.

Yes, that IS a shame. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game by any means; it looks superb and it plays great as well. It's just that there are (almost) no scary parts anymore. Blame the enemies, the co-op or even the sunlit enviroments, I don't know what it is. But it makes me kinda sad. I just hope RE6 will be about the horror again. Anyway, if you're looking for a solid third person shooter, or if you're just a big RE fan (not that big I guess, or you would've owned it already), grab this one.
