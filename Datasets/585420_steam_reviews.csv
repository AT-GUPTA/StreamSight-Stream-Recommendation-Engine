I go to unlv for 3d modeling and sculpting, so this game allows me to mess around & let my creativity loose. However the community & servers make the experience absolutely suck, to start theirs favoritism by the devs. Awhile back I made a build that was inspired by one I found in the workshop, mind you i know its annoying to copy builds and call it your own. I guess I made the mistake of not giving him credit which i forgot since I didn't put much thought to the description. When I made this i was inspired didn't want to just edit his build, I wanted to make my own from scratch & spent quite some time on it even had friends watching and they made their own versions. changed everything from logic blocks,dimensions, color, block complexity, only thing similar was the open cockpit and how the wings worked which I programmed. Came back to find it was shadow banned ""not showing on profile or search"" thought it was odd so I looked at the report on discord just to see the guy crying on how it looked the same but not really he was mainly upset that the cockpit and wings were too similar? mind you it wasn't something complex that no one could do... Since hes one of the devs favorites they chose to shadow ban my build... After this I just decided to take down all my builds and not post any new ones.
 I started this game on xbox, was very excited with the intention of endorsing it by making videos for youtube to get more eyes on the game. I moved to pc {steam] a few months back to record how I make most of my builds but because of how the community is that excitement died down. I have 1.6k hours on steam and about the same on xbox but since moving to steam I've had so many builds stolen where kids just stand under you while you build; just to take your builds when u get out of build mode, post it and call it theirs. Over time I saw the devs talk about this saying ""sharing is caring"" so never really got that upset. What's upsetting to me is that now they're shadow banning builds out of nowhere only because favorite individuals are reporting & to me that's not ok its clearly favoritism while the rest of us go through this often and just get ignored. If you want to solve the whole ""copying"" problem add a lock build mode system so no one can edit our builds.

Unless you like at least one of two things: 1) Complex/high part count builds and 2) part-on-part interactions. The complexity limit is very easy to hit being at 700, and complexity doesn't mean part count, it means how many different interactions have to be processed for a part. And the part-on-part interactions are terrible and glitchy. I come from Scrap Mechanic, where the whole thing is part-on-part interactions and massive builds, so coming to this where sliding two blocks against each other messes with physics I had a pretty negative view of the game, but after looking at it objectively I have decided to write this review, both as a comprehensive comparison of this vs. Scrap Mechanic and a warning to other people who may want something different.

1: Physics
Both games are centered around physics, yes, but different aspects of it. In SM it's mostly about the smaller-scale interactions, like two surfaces sliding against each other or parts pushing against each other. In TM, it's mostly part-environment interactions, such as lift, drag, and friction.

2: Building
The building style is vastly different between the two games. In SM it's mostly first-person with third-person mostly being for driving and looking around. You also place each individual piece with very few pre-built parts, like joints and servos. In TM, it's almost exclusively third-person, with first person barely being an option. You mostly use pre-built parts, like wheels and wings, and connections are done automatically in most cases.

3: Modding
Scrap Mechanic pretty much survives off of the modding community. There's so many mods that are almost essential to the point where it's impressive to see a complex build without mods. In TM modding is more manual and less encouraged, though not discouraged either, and it's rare to see anything using mods, though the game survives on it's own and doesn't really need it.

4: Developers
The developers for TM are heavily involved in the community and regularly interact with it. There's always news from them and they respond to questions pretty frequently. SM feels almost abandoned, with the last update being November 2023, and the last significant update in late May 2023. News also stopped entirely in June on all platforms. Everyone in SM is so used to this that we've pretty much given up hope of hearing from the devs altogether.

5: Worlds/Levels
In SM, the worlds/levels are procedurally generated by default, or maps can be custom-made. Things like railroad tracks or roads can also be added directly to the map so as to increase performance. In TM, there's the default levels, which are pretty extensive, or you can manually add custom ones.

6: Damage
Without mods there's no part damage from environments in SM, whereas that's one of the biggest aspects of TM.

Overall they are incredibly different games that work entirely different.

If you want to know that the devs exist get TM, if you want built-in modding get SM.",1708302534,1708302534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am an engineer with a grade school daughter and we love playing this together.  It is essentially what I wished Lego worlds was (also a great game for kids, but lacks complexity and the vehicles always felt like a sadly missed opportunity).  It is also a great step up from that for kids as it adds dynamics, controls, and design complexity without being aggressive or punishing.  I expect to buy the DLC as we finish levels and maybe make some custom maps.  I expect this to be our ""go to"" family game for the foreseeable future.

Pros:
-Mixed adult / kid coop friendly
-Nice visuals for a family friendly game
-Great depth of inventive, goofy, and awesome designs
-Flexible control options for complex actions

Cons:
-Likely boring for those not interested in building/physics
-Occasional physics glitches

Wishes and Possibilities:
As an engineer who loves controls, it would be an unparalleled game experience to be able to add sensors and programmable control schemes (PID, etc.) based on some simplified scripting (perhaps a DLC add-on?).  This would allow complex walking robots, self-leveling hover jets, etc.  It would also be marketable as a teaching tool, and far more fun than most.

I've owned this game for a good few years now, and I've been somewhat keeping track of new updates and what's added to the game. Sadly it seems like the devs only want to focus on expansions and dlc packs, they call it free updates but in reality it's just a ""Demo"" for what you can do in the expansions, while the base game suffers from a lack of real content. A new campaign level would solve that issue, it can just be a repeat of the one we have now, crashing on a planet, and starting from scratch again, they wouldn't even need to add new blocks to the game, just a new area to explore while you build up again.

The main thing you do in the game is BUILD, but the builder is a buggy mess, it works enough to work and that's it, it leaves so much to desire it's insane. The vehicle builder pretty much needs to be completely redone so building something simple doesn't take you 20 minutes of fighting with the game to put a single block where you want it.

It would also be great if the physics engine for this game was also updated. During my last play-through of this game it was extremely frustrating at times having to reset my vehicle over and over again because it kept breaking itself. I'd swap my vehicle and have to spend 5 minutes or longer waiting for the game to decide when it actually wanted to work and spawn my vehicle in correctly so it wouldn't break instantly for the 20th time in a row. 

If they just fixed the builder, the issues with the physics bugging out, and added a new campaign level, the game would be worth buying, but in it's current state unless you want to also spend over double the cost of the game to buy the expansions with it then it really isn't worth the price, even on sale for anything less than 75% off.",1706292630,1706292630,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some of the vehicle blueprints they give you in the free-roam junk scavenging gamemode control so poorly they give me little confidence that it's possible to make an equivalent that works well. There is fairly little control over the function of objects, and even just including gearboxes would do a LOT to improve the usability of vehicles.
Could be great but I have a feeling it suffers from the same issue most vehicle building games do, where most of their users are children who want to shoot at each other online so most of the development goes into catering to them rather than making something decent.
I was really hoping to have a decent vehicle building game with actual objectives to give me any reason to build specific kinds of vehicles, but this isn't really it.

This game is as bare bones as it gets. The campaign consists of picking up spheres and placing them in new locations over and over and over and that's it. They actually require you you to pay for more game via over priced DLC that should have just been included in the game as updates.  Just look at the bundles and DLC for this thing and you will see. Trashy, super trashy.

SECTION 2

karsestar  [developer] Posted: 2 Jan @ 9:54am
Hello Cohollow. When it comes to single-player campaigns ""Stranded"" is the only free one at the moment with the much bigger ""Airborne"" being a paid expansion.

The focus of Trailmakers is not being a single player campaign game however, but a sandbox building game and we believe (biased of course) that the game has a ton of free content in that regard. Sandbox maps and the vast majority of blocks are not behind a paywall as well as the Space Sector map - which is our biggest map to date and also free.

Just wanted to clear that up. üôå

SECTION 3

""When it comes to single-player campaigns ""Stranded"" is the only free one at the moment with the much bigger ""Airborne"" being a paid expansion.""  -  Yes the ""free"" (we'll come back to that word shortly) content is indeed much smaller than the paid expansion, to the point of the expansion having more actual game and requiring you to buy it if you want to have anything to do in the game at all.

""The focus of Trailmakers is not being a single player campaign game however, but a sandbox building game and we believe (biased of course) that the game has a ton of free content in that regard.""  -  I literally bought and paid for the game, that is not ""free."" How charitable of you to allowing me ""free"" access to the content of the game I spent money on. Yes the game is about the sandbox, of which there is very little without the DLC.

""Sandbox maps and the vast majority of blocks are not behind a paywall as well as the Space Sector map - which is our biggest map to date and also free.""  -  The games biggest and most useful sandboxes ARE behind paywalls. Ya I'm not going over what ""free"" means again. Your Space Sector map is indeed the biggest on account of it being SPACE. There is a huge empty space of nothing for you to pilot your spaceship through. This isn't big content, it's empty content. I explored all there was to see in less than 2 hours.

SECTION 4

I don't need to explain how ridiculous the claims of ""free"" content is do I? Again, I PAID FOR THE GAME. The games main menu will constantly give you pop ups on the main menu to entice you with the DLC. Every menu you open when constructing your creations has blocks that are locked to you unless you pay for DLC, but they make sure you can see what you're missing. The Stranded map is made purposely tiny and restrictive to ensure you will require the Airborn DLC and the High Seas maps in order to make good use of any kind of air or sea based creations. Even land base creations have little room to roam in the not at all ""free"" sandboxes provided with initial purchase. There is even a paid DLC called the Space Voyager Pack that you will want if you expect to get the most out of the base games ""free"" Space Sector map. Of the more than a dozen skins in the game, only 3 are made available for the initial price of the game with the remaining are split between 2 paid DLC that only consist of skins. Even your character has a whopping 2 outfits and the other SIXTEEN are locked behind and split between 3 different DLC. If you want to buy the entirety of the game it will cost $84.13 Canadian which roughly translates to $62.84 for the U.S. dollar. No, this game is not worth that price and it's shady way of attempting to slowly manipulate and suck the customer in to further spending just to have enough game to properly interact with is slimy.  Buying the game is just the entry fee (FEE not FREE). The DLC has an absolute mountain of paid DLC content compared to what you get for buying the game. You'd be crazy not to purchase some... Like the dev said ""The much bigger ""Airborne"" being a paid expansion.""

Outside of my gripes, the game itself is one of the best examples of games of this kind. The physics are fun, the creations are fun, and everything functions relatively well baring the odd bit of jank here and there. Nice aerodynamics go a long way. It has one of the simplest and most efficient building systems I've played with and still has a great deal of creative freedom despite keeping things simple and minimal. 

Only buy this game if you think it's worth the price of a AAA title or if you are ok with having access to only the tiniest and most boring sliver of this games content. If you wish to experience anything significant in terms of campaign, exploration, combat, progression or anything at all approaching actual gameplay, I highly recommend factoring the Airborne DLC into your purchase. Also note that I only detailed this games more egregious and predatory failings to keep things shorter. 

I would like to thank the developer for responding to my review and openly displaying their deceptive tactics and for giving me cause to give this game a much more thorough and comprehensive review. It's even free, aren't I nice?

""Just wanted to clear that up.""  -  I hope I managed to clear some things up for you too üòä",1704186120,1704897685,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

now though ive beaten the game in around 17~ hours (not 100% just getting the spaceship)

Really nice community and developers interact with the community and try to make the dlcs affordable for everyone. The dlcs also always include some free parts so even if you don't buy the dlc you still get new content.
The dlc items are very nice but not pay2win and more overpowered than the normal ones in any way. Just fun to mess around with or build more specific things.

I have all dlcs and have completed all campaigns/missions in the game, they are really well made although stranded in space and high seas can get a little repetitive

I like building my own vehicles and then doing battles with friends but most of my hours in the game definitely come from just messing around.

In summary I would really recommend the game, it's advanced and quite realistic compared to other games but has some arcade elements so it doesn't get to frustrating (especially for newer players) Developers interact with the community and respond to feedback.

Edit: With 1882 hours, I still highly recommend this game! I am really happy with the build UI. it is easy and efficient to quickly build a vehicle. the vehicle is suspended in a build box which allows you to freely rotate around(useful when making tweaks to the bottom of your creation) the parts are all neatly organized as well. and the best part you are not clicking through menus to get to the part you want, instead, the parts are conveniently located on the bottom of the screen where it is simply a matter of clicking and dragging the piece you need.

But what is nice about this game compared to the others i've played, is that the game outside of building is also ready to explore. you can drive through caves, plains and mountains. hover over lava pits, and fly though a volcano! or if you'd rather swim, the oceans are also full of life(depending on the map(Treasure island)) You can even go to space in the base game!

Plenty of options for vehicle customization, which can lead to lots of complex and interesting builds

Most of my criticisms will be aimed at the Stranded campaign mode, since that is where most of my time has currently been spent.
It kind of sucks.
Very empty map with vehicle parts spread out that you have to transport to various checkpoints to collect. 
The parts are fairly heavy and require you to engineer a solution to transporting them. Often times my solutions will mess with the collision and break certain parts, or mess with the balance and make transportation really slow and awkward.

The materials your vehicles are made out of, in my opinion, are way too fragile. Making mechanical arms for lifting parts out of the hinges can often break themselves if they reach certain angles, trying to bump parts like with the starter bumper cart is a very slow process, but is also annoying because of how often the bumper breaks off immediately.

You find a magnet that is essential for hauling the parts, but a lot of the parts are far too large for the magnet to pick up or manipulate, even if you have a really heavy vehicle with loads of engines on it. And even if you do get a bite, half the time something breaks immediately.

I know there are other campaings, and multiplayer, but meh. I liked banjo because I was adapting to interesting environments with challenges in them and progressing through a story. Multiplayer is cool, space travel is cool, but I wanted a mode where I could progress with parts and stuff, and the mode that they have is just a boring sandbox.

I'll try them, because I like the gameplay thus far, but this island campaign was really annoying.

In something like Banjo Kazooie, you had all this charm, great music, characters, and missions thrown at you while you were progressing. 
In this campaign, your just in a big sandbox with a bunch of heavy parts everywhere your vehicles will inevitably suck at at moving. At least in Banjo you could pick up various parts with your wrench and snap them into place on your vehicle, and you'd add various parts to make it not fall out. Maybe if there were a mechanic like this where you could manually interact with the parts it wouldn't be as bad. 

In Banjo, unlocking parts naturally matched a sort of progression that aligned with certain missions and environments. Here, parts are kind of spread out at random. Also, the majority of the parts suck. They're mostly wedges and stuff to shape your vehicle with.
So imagine building a sick submarine, and painstakingly making a design that doesn't sink or break to pick something up, then the only real reward is a servo motor, and the other parts are like wedges and ""power core"" upgrades which just let you place down more engines.

It'll leave you feeling like you wasted your time, with little reward involved.

Not to mention the amount of paid DLC that lock certain items behind a paywall.

I think the game is objectively a good game, especially since it feels a niche that a lot of games don't so I'll give it a recommendation, but these aspects I mentioned are worth noting",1703668685,1703668685,True,4,0,0.53375166654586792,0,True,False,False

After collecting parts with friends, we quickly got bored. The sandbox experience is simply not enough -- we are players that enjoy a structured challenge with specific goals.

More importantly, this game has the smell of one of those that never reaches a complete state, while nevertheless evolving slowly and perpetually (largely by free labor provided by modders). In my opinion, this development strategy isn't legitimate for a game you've released. The fact that it's common for sandbox games to limp along in this way doesn't make it acceptable to me. Forever Early Access isn't a state I'm willing to pay for, and if I'd known that's what I would get, I'd never have bought Trailmakers.

This system probably works well for people with LOTS of time to devote to a game as a hobby rather than as a library title, and an endless appetite for returning to the game they've played to find it transformed. I don't have either.

Update: It seems like my prediction has proven true so far. There are now spacecraft and more parts, but no incentive to return to the game as it will probably be substantially transformed yet again after a while.

The only thing that I have against the game isn't really against the game itself, but rather their discord server. I only recommend their discord server for getting help if you are having issues with the game. I was banned off of their discord because I did something that wasn't in the rules. I didn't break any other rules in the server before this and they didn't warn me or anything, just banned me. After I joined on my alt account to figure out what was going on, they said that it was because I didn't interact in the server much before, which to me sounds like even more of a stupid reason to get banned in the server.

I'll probably give it another shot soon. Needless to say I think this review is FAR outdated right now.

16 Hours in. Had the game for a bit more than a year now after I bought it with some spare change in 2018. To me, Trailmakers is entertaining but not fun. It's a game I get on when waiting for friends or something to pass time and I can't really say it holds my interest all too well. Gameplay revolves around building your own vehicles to traverse the landscape (obviously) or to solve puzzles / complete challenges. For instance the game's 'story' consists of going around and picking up scrap and power cores to rebuild your rocket and escape, which isn't all that bad for a game of this caliber but the map is BARREN so there's not really a visual aspect other than the grass which looks kinda pretty if your settings are right but other than that the visuals in Trailmakers aren't too spectacular.

I believe Trailmakers has potential. The physics need a bit of work because (from what I've seen) vehicles exceeding 20 blocks attempt to defy the laws of gravity and fly to space (though you'll never get there seeing as you'll spontaneously combust after 2 seconds) and in my opinion the game needs much, much more content for me to consider this a worthy $25 purchase without a sale.",1582753412,1702788079,False,24,7,0.533689498901367188,0,True,False,False

The game is /really good/ at being a land/water vehicle builder.  The game is shit at building aircraft, but that's the next 15-25 hours and most expansions.  

Why?
1) There's NO KEY REBINDING. To clarify: You /can/ rebind individual parts' functions like ""bend right"" or ""make the engine go/reverse"", but you /cannot/ rebind GAME functions -> You cannot rebind the Build Menu (B), the Switch Vehicle button (R), Exit Vehicle (F), or the Camera Mode (C). It's lousy when your vehicle needs six degrees of movement /and also/ need to toggle engines and the booster and the tractor beam.

2) The aerodynamic indicators (lift, draft, center of mass, etc) ONLY SHOW when the GAME thinks it's worth showing you; you cannot manually turn them on/off:  No, switching ""indicators"" on/off doesn't fix that, the game still decides what you see when it feels like it.  This means that you can't predict problems to fix ahead of time, so you get really far into the design before the game feels like showing you the fundamental problem with it that'll require you to rip the whole thing apart again to fix.

3) The helicopter propellers fritz out for no reason and explode.  It didn't seem to matter what I did - it just kept happening.

This game was /really good/ in the opening hours; in the first half of the map.  Then it became a steaming pile of crap real fast.",1702541389,1702595825,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I own most of it, but it kind of makes me angry that every time they add a new map and all the new parts that go with it i have to pay another 10 dollars for it.

Other than that its a good game i guess, played it a lot a year ago, stopped playing for a while, havent really gotten back into it since

Half of the game is the first 25 dollars, Other half of the game is like 30 dollars behind dlc

I predominantly played the story mode called 'stranded in space'. The premise is you have to find orbs and move them (using your Lego designed vehicle) to specific locations that will give you new blocks to use and allow you to progress further to get more blocks, until you can build your spaceship and leave the planet. 
This game was a ton of fun!! The progression and pacing of the game is great. I was using a 360 controller and it worked great for the vehicle building, which is a rather good and simple system to work with. 
It is awesome all the locations you can traverse, from normal ground, low traction ground, above water, under water, and in the air (gliding or flying). The flying vehicles can be difficult to design with balance so they have some premade basic flight vehicle blueprints.

This game leans massively into it's DLC which means you'll want to get the game on sale with DLC to enjoy it fully.

The game has a psuedo-aerodynamic physics system. It's a poor physics system for 2 reasons, firstly the game offers some utility settings such as ""powered steering"". This deliberately reduces the turning ability while travelling at high speed. If you are travelling at 100 kph and attempt to do a 90 degree turn, under real-world physics you'd be fighting against 100 kph worth of momentum/inertia, thus it will be hard to steer. Trailmakers uses a multiplier instead. [b]That's not a physics simulation[/b], and basically results in you fighting against the poor physics simulation at either end of the speedometer.

Secondly, the devs want you to buy the DLC which means the DLC parts are straight up superior to the base game parts. As an example, in the base game your best attempt at an aeroplane doesn't involve any of the rotational blocks for propellers and none of the wing parts have any flaps which makes them uni-directional. Even the dev's prefab blueprints for vehicles look and handle like utter garbage. The helicopter doesn't even use the helicopter blades! But those pipes, with the exact same weight value as the large lego-like bricks are invisible to the aerodynamics system. Once again the weight, momentum and inertia of your vehicle is pointless so long as you add those lovely DLC parts.

If you buy the DLC I'd recommend the airborne expansion and [b]never touch the base game campaign.[/b] In the time I played this game I obtained all the blocks in the base game and any DLC blocks that were included into the base campaign. I built a single vehicle capable of driving on the ground, taking to the skies, diving into the ocean and being able to return to the ground. It was ugly, clunky and most of the time I had powered steering disabled. It massively helped the steering issues but still felt like I was fighting against the physics. Then I jumped into the airborne campaign which has wings with built in flaps, new types of jet propulsion, an actual plot, NPCs, quests...

Bought it on Steam sale and didn't spend any more money on upgrades or bonus packs.  The campaign was fun and challenging enough.  Building vehicles is the core strength of the game.

- Vehicle building starts simple and gets progressively more complex
- Allows for creative problem solving
- Variety of geography requires different solutions (cars on land, boats and subs for water, planes and hovercraft for air, and rockets and ships for space)
- Graphics and physics engines are realistic and very responsive

You build using blocks like legos and gadgets like hinges, pistons, and servos. Logic gates are there but are a hard pass if you know how logic works and don't won't to relearn how the devs think they work. Logic needs a rework. Dare I say copy what other games have done like LittleBigPlanet 2 which in my opinion has a superior Logic system. The Devs left out a few key logic blocks like the NOT, NAND, XNOR, and NOR gates. You have to use the OR, XOR, and AND gates to fill in the blanks which is tedious and takes up block count and space on your builds. They also felt the need to leave out key blocks like a 1x1 cube. Their argument is they have a 1x1 pipe junction. Just make a 1x1 cube so we can have better LOOKING BUILDS! Trying to make builds that have a good looking form is hard with very little wedge selection and of course that forbidden 1x1 block. Building cars with suspension is something you really have to study and perfect. It's not as easy as throwing the actual suspension block on there and hitting some hills. The base springs and suspension pieces are terrible and your car will shatter on the slightest jump. You shouldn't need to engineer an entire chassis using servos and hinges to make viable suspension which in turn causes lag and the vehicle physics to slide across the ground when not driving. not to mention the off chance it explodes and send you to jesus but here we are. To build anything actually functional and fun for the most part takes time and maybe a few tricks here and there. Tricks and workarounds I wish we didn't have to take. This game could be so much more but it just isn't. With all that I'm still going to be playing the hell out of it because there isn't another one like it.",1700826541,1700826541,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The campaign is a bit slow but still fun - with 98 hours clocked, I'm still only 45% of the way toward fixing my ship. This is not the selling point of this game for me though.

The sandbox building and racing are really where I have found the most fun.  
I lose hours fine tuning my vehicles to improve on performance or beating my best times and climbing the leader board. 

The multiplayer works well.  It can get chaotic at times but it's loads of fun seeing what others create.

I rather enjoy the campaign mode that forces us to innovate in order to progress further. ie basic car -> powerful car -> jet-assisted car -> hover car -> Jet-assisted hover car, and so on. 

The selling point however was the inlusion of multiplayer. Sharing silly explodie gifs with your friends is one thing, but blowing up together...now that's the real deal. 

If, like me, Besiege carved out a special place for creative problem solving (+5 explosive chance) in your heart, I suspect Trailmakers will appease nicely. However, where TM decidedly takes the cake in streamlined building and intuitive creation it was certainly not meant to fulfill the same mahem and violence as Besiege. *nudge nudge* need more weapons :D for science!

**While we're on the subject of adding things--would sincerely insist upon a CG marker (centre of gravity). But hey, trial and error is fun too.

And, I haven't even gotten to the racing mode yet! brb

tl;dr more fun than digital legos, more practical than your high school physics class

**UPDATE**

-unlocked all 'chieves
-found the maximum possible ground speed in the sandbox (turns out the size of the sand box is the bottle neck :D)
-now we're going to space, fam.

Trailmakers has managed to push out another proper update, but manages to still block possible unlockables behind DLC. Unless you are prepared to spend... an EXTRA 60 BUCKS just for DLC, you are going to get:

Basic Editor, no unique blocks
No Decals or block skins to use, including glowing decals
No access to good alternative blocks like thrusters, cabins or the likes
No access to an actual good campaign that could have been added onto the main one
(No character skins)

Soooooo basically, this game with dlc costs just about 80‚Ç¨ all things considered. THAT IS NOT WORTH IT, IN ANY SCENARIO - this is an indie-like game, that could be , at most, valued to at best, only 50‚Ç¨. So unless they adjust these prices and finally admit theyre cash hungry , this price will keep rising. We need more functional elements, and less downloadable content. I used to beta test with the crew in this game, and they used to have a much different vision. All that's thrown out the window, and noone wants to bring it up.

Players can design their own vehicles using various parts and explore different environments. This gives players a lot of freedom and creativity. The game makes it possible to create complex and functional vehicles by combining simple parts, making gameplay very enjoyable. Each part serves a different purpose, allowing players to customize their vehicles in any way they want.

Visually, ""Trailmakers"" features a colorful and vibrant world. The game's graphics and environment design create an atmosphere that encourages exploration. Players face different challenges as they navigate the open-world environments, which adds to the excitement of the game.

However, the game does have some technical challenges. Especially when creating large and complex vehicles, there can be performance issues. This can negatively affect the gameplay experience for some players. Also, the repetition and similarity of some of the missions in the game can sometimes create a monotonous feeling. In other words, the game has some weaknesses in terms of variety.

The developers are constantly trying to update the game and value player feedback. This could bring improvements and fixes in future versions of the game.

All in all, ""Trailmakers"" is a fun game that stands out for its creativity-based gameplay and offers the opportunity to test your engineering skills.

I trudged through the tedious and aggravating 'stranded in space' campaign which consists of building barely viable vehicles to push around rocks to unlock new parts so you can build bigger and better but still barely viable vehicles to push more rocks for more parts. At the end you blast off into space. Woohoo.

I got this game for the building potential, and while there is a lot of potential there, I quickly became bored because there's nothing worthwhile to do with anything you build outside of the campaign (unless you're into racing), and the campaign was dull. On top of that the selection of blocks is very limited and there's no 1x1 blocks at all. Cosmetic blocks are locked behind coins that you are barely rewarded with for repeatedly performing tedious, boring tasks.

The physics are kind of aggravating, and the blueprints the devs added generally work terribly as well. You know there's a problem when the devs can't even build vehicles that work well. If you build a car with the center of gravity off to one side the car will literally spin in a circle at a standstill.

People have uploaded some amazing builds to the workshop, but there's nothing to do with any of them.. drive/fly around in creative mode for a few minutes, get bored, call it quits. To make matters worse, you're not going to be able to actually build most of those things unless you have ALL of the DLC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's 2023. The game has seen it's new space update. I tought I'd give it a try. I changed pc, so I had to install the game again. Suprise! No cloud saves. Saved blueprints go in the abyss if you don't upload them via the game's workshop. Lost priceless vehicules that I spent 10-20 hours in. I'm honestly unimpressed at this point. In a game where the goal is to make a vehicule, having no cloud saves grinds my gears and makes me sad. I would assume that a game like this would have cloud saves.


Original review:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A wonderfull game where you can let your imagination run wild with many vehicule parts to choose from. Game runs pretty smoothly on singleplayer. Multiplayer is quite alright. Sure, missions aren't the best thing in the game, but the gameplay is on point and the physics feel just right. Not too simulation like, to to arcade like. Simcade.

For me, this game is a gem.",1683134419,1699749677,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The vehicles feel amazing to control, even when you make something insane
Runs on a potato but still looks great.
The best builder interface I've ever used.
Perfect steam workshop integration, giving you access to heaps of player made blueprints.
Open mod support so no shortage of content. 
Really chill and great for making friends.
You can switch to another vehicle preset while moving like a mother-flipping TRANSFORMER
Want to build a viking long-boat with cannons that can FLY.. IN SPACE? SURE
AND you can squash animals for gold Carmageddon style.

Honestly, it's so fun it puts me in tears.

It has the simplicity, accessibility and polish of a Nintendo game.

There are a few flaws; Lack of interface customisation and multiplayer features... but the devs are very pro-active and closely connected to the community...Which is a nice feeling after getting completely SH*T on by Blizzard / Scam Citizen.

Cannot recommend this game enough. It's the best value game I've played in 30 years of nerding

So if you're just a casual player and don't care about any DLC, go ahead, you'll probably have fun.

The reason for the negative review, is the dev's continued ignoring of community issues and requests for now going on 4 years. The game is quite poorly optimised on top of that and gets low FPS dips, hitting 100% usage frequently even with a 30 series Nvidia card. 

[h1]Lack of Objectives[/h1]
The worst issue which consistently ruins any motivation to come back to this game: We still have no real use for our vehicles, except to ""collect"" spheres in campaign repeatedly [i](or drive over boxes in the new DLC)[/i]. There are no challenges like moving items or other vehicles around (cranes/trailers/aircraft etc, blowing things up, any other creative minigame you can think of... literally just collect things to get more parts to collect things, that's it. You can do ""race"" challenges too, but you just race yourself and the leaderboards are just full of people exploiting the physics to top it daily, easily. [i](Flip a hoverpad upside down)[/i].

[h1]Fragile Vehicles[/h1]
A personal nitpick issue of mine is the vehicle's strength/durability. They will literally collapse in to pieces as if it was an IRL lego truck you threw off a table - the slightest bump will destroy a tank/car/boat/sub/plane completely. This takes out much of the fun because whatever you do, you have to keep spamming the repair key to reset your vehicle just because your wheel grazed a tiny pebble on the road [i](literally, not exaggerating there)[/i].. This should at the very least be a slider for hosted matches because it sucks that your monster truck is destroyed by pebbles.

[b][i]Edit: This DOES now have a slider... but only if you host a sandbox game. In the campaigns which are the only content with an objective, you still have to deal with vehicles collapsing as soon as they touch anything.[/i][/b]

[h1]DLC Practices[/h1]
The Dev's don't seem to care about fixing issues, fulfilling requests literally made since the launch of the game, or optimising performance. They are however, pushing out DLC that no one asked for and which doesn't add anything except a map with no objectives, so no reason to build anything [i](The collectables on the map are in the base game except 2-3 new ones per DLC)[/i]. They also release tonnes of cosmetic ""camos"" for blocks which are the equivalent of a single flat texture copy-pasted over blocks, these are DLC as well.

[h1]Lack of Community Interaction?[/h1]
They do building contests to feign interaction with the community but that's about the extent of communication with them in my experience. This game may end up the same way as the likes of Nuts & Bolts which at least actually had reasons to build lots of different types of vehicles and I'd argue is superior, plus has a great soundtrack. This game by comparison is sadly just a cute little sandbox with little else memorable to it.

[b][i]Edit: They do have a public Trello where people can vote on features to be included, but these are not often user-submitted feature requests. Usually, they're what the Dev's add to it and were likely going to add down the road anyway. You effectively just vote on what you think should be completed first.[/i][/b]

[i]If anyone wonders about my hours played and yet still leaving a negative review, bear in mind I've replayed the campaigns 3 times each because of replaying them with friends, I highly doubt most people would find that entertaining on their own and if it wasn't for those friends I'd have left this game after the first completion roughly 10hrs in because there is nothing else to do with your vehicles.[/i]",1684508484,1699110436,False,4,0,0.487500011920928955,0,True,False,False

What do you think is the next like 3 isues i will be talking about? you guessed it potential (Note: i cant realy confirm it so its likley its not actualy in the game) redshell the lack of moderating and oh wait you could get your data leaked (Edit 2: i was reffering to a bug where you could edit the game's files and yes im pretty sure this could happen with enough time AND YES its a major bug), and fun fact this game is primarily played by children... oof. and il end the review off with that because i can already feel the hate comments, but you can post your opinion there i guess.

Edit: first of all this is as i said a biased review so you can get it if you wish, and second i had to change the rewiev a bit because i may have made some mistakes. and i also didint mention the framerate isues but thats it
the review still dosent change much

This game is wonderful, I own all DLCs and do not regret it, however I am leaving a negative review considering when I move on from this game, I'm not usually in a good mood.

TLDR;  Devs won't add blocks the community has been asking for (for years).  Complexity limit is fixed unless modded.  No control settings unless you change them for EVERY build you create.

This game is about building, yet the devs refuse to add basic blocks, for instance there is no 1x1x1 block.  SEVERAL blocks that should exist simply don't, there are slopes with matching corner pieces and slopes without matching corner pieces.  There is no consistency in the availability of blocks.  This fact has also become a meme of sorts as the devs have acted in the past as though they had intentions to change these things and yet never have.  The devs have even said that adding those parts would ""alter the game play experience"" and make building too easy, however I have to disagree with this.  If you have an idea in your head and the only reason you can't build it or have to find some work around is the lack of a block the devs have neglected to add to ""make the game harder"", it's hard to enjoy your ""game play experience"", and leads me to turn the game off.  I have hundreds of hours in this game when it very well could be thousands.  Limit blocks from certain game modes, yes, but don't neglect to add them into the game at all.  Lack of freedom is why I never stick around long.

Your build is limited to a certain complexity as if you're playing on console.  Every ones PC is different in some way, complexity should be available in the settings menu for single player and server menu for multiplayer.  A mod should not be required.  Every game I start I load up the mod (thus opting out of high scores and subsequently a large portion of the ""game play experience"") and set my complexity to 2000, I have never had a single issue and I have had to turn it up on occasion.  My ""game play experience"" is 30 to 60 seconds in a UI every time I load into a world.

Default controls can not be set.  If you place an engine, it will be mapped to W/S, place a thruster, maps to space.  This should be configurable in the settings.  It's a waste of build time when certain things you place ALWAYS get mapped to certain buttons and you ALWAYS have to change them because you can't change the defaults.  It's to the point I'd almost be happier if everything spawned in unmapped, at least then when I didn't want something mapped I could just not open it, rather than opening the settings and clearing the default mapping that would have been incorrect for me had I even wanted it mapped.

MY PERSONAL BLUNT OPINION: Seriously? I'm limited to certain blocks ""to make the game harder"" and the biggest challenge you can think of... IS PUSHING ROCKS AROUND!?... *sigh*... I want this to be one of my favorite games, and it easily could be, but the contradictory nature of the devs and their ""reasons"" for not listening to the community on mulitple occasions scares me away.  Not to mention the recent release of High Seas which feels more like a tech demo than proper DLC.  I love this game, but have little faith in the devs, and thus, the games future.",1649986241,1698994033,False,248,8,0.850597620010375977,21,True,False,False

You can play singelplayer or mulitplayer on a lot of different and beautiful designed maps.
You can also build everything you could imagine: Sky is the limit (for cars).
The achievements are mostly fun to play. For some you just need the internet.

There are some features missing like a searchbar for blocks or really advanced settings.

Played: March 2023

I have completed this game twice now.  And Trailmakers does have an actual ending to strive for by collecting the necessary parts to build an escape Spaceship rocket.  I love having an end game type scenario to shoot for in a game of this type!

Not knowing what to expect, I was pleased to play a game with no enemies in this vehicle builder game.  I had just previously played TerraTech that I liked a lot, but was ready for a similar game with no fighting.

You start out on a central island with very few parts to use to build a vehicle.  But the game gives you some basic vehicle templates to use, provided you have found the necessary parts to build it.  So the search for vehicle parts begins...

As you drive, boat (or later fly) around and find rocks which contain a single unique building part, you need to initially push them into the Recovery Drone's beam.  These recovery drones are stationary beam-up locations around the map to gain a building part from the rock-looking objects scattered throughout the map.  Interestingly, and differently from TerraTech, once you gain that part you can use as many of them as you want in your vehicle builds.  

The pieces snap together like Lego(TM) parts but have a strong number of configurations that can be tweaked.  For example, red lights can be placed on the back of a vehicle and configured to only light up when pressing reverse making them brake lights instead of always on.  You can tweak the speed of pivot parts that are attached to wheels if you find yourself turning to quickly and rolling your vehicle too easily.  Stability can also be accomplished by just making your vehicle wider.  Further configurations of control parts include a Toggle checkbox and Speed setting which you wouldn't want on your car's turning wheels, but would want on an attached Tractor Beam to hold up red collored explosive volatile rocks so they don't drag on the ground as you make your way to a Recovery Drone to turn it in.

Now, these rocks come in different sizes and shapes.  In fact, some are simply huge for anything other than a very large truck with weights in the front or back to counter the weight of a Tractor beam with a large rock attached.  Furthermore, some rocks are volatile meaning they will explode if you jostle them too much, and in turn, blowing up your vehicle.  If destroyed, or flipped upside down from carelessness, a simple button press will not only right your vehicle but fully rebuild it too.  It is very easy to just test things and see what happens, resetting your vehicle immediately if things go wrong.

As for the default vehicles, I disliked half of them.  The first one is fine but you should put some blocks on the front's sides to ""gather"" rocks more easily on the starter island.  The only other default vehicles I really liked were the ""Hovercraft"", ""Gimble Car"" and ""Monster Truck"".  The Monster Truck needs to be extended though in the back to have six total wheels and counter weights in the front to take the weight of the largest rocks in the back.  All the others needed small to large tweaks, especially ""The Sub"".  The in-games default submarine was a nighmare to control for me.  I ended up downloading a yellow submarine from the Steam Workshop, but still had to make it bigger for the large underwater rocks and changed the control scheme to match the button presses I wanted to use with the Xbox controller.

This is the first game that I've ever played where my use of gamepad vs keyboard/mouse was about 50%/50%.  The Gamepad was used to drive all vehicles, but the keyboard turned on/off control points and the mouse was used in build mode.

Great vehicle builder game with low stress.  I highly recommend it.",1698355179,1698355179,True,50,0,0.78488534688949585,0,True,False,False

One of those rare treasures for ALL the wrong reasons. Audio is poorly implemented.

The Sandbox mode is incredible giving you free reign on all the blocks (Minus a few minor ones from dlcs, given you don't own it) within 3 great maps. One is dedicated to racing of all types, the other is more of an exploratory island with flaming hoops and ramps all over. The last one has all sorts of goofy things to get into a few being a battlebot arena, a [strike] rocket leau- [/strike] soccer court, and a jousting platform.)

i dont...

and i also recommend this game if you like Planes,Helicopters,Ground vehicles and water vehicles

i can build only 2 of them

You really need patience to make your vehicles, and if you dont have patience then youl end up like me

and i recommend just to not make some stupidly overpowered Vehicles cuz then for the noobs like me its gonna be very unfair for a 10+ hour player to fight against a 1000+ hour player who ""Disguises"" himself as a noob but in reality it isnt

i dont recommend it cuz it just has too many collision issues (Tires go trough the ground), Aerodynamics not making sense, randomly getting sonic boom when crashing into a mountain, and vehicles being impossible to build without having atleast all of your braincells and 180 IQ

i dont recommend it simply becuz its just kinda overrated and theres too many issues AND DLCs that you gotta pay for to have fun and extra (better or worse) parts

if the DLCs were cheaper or free then i wouldnt complain that much cuz the airbourne Expansion teaches you how to build planes...i think...still good for youtubers bad for people who want to recreate those videos

just play scrap mechanic its easier and doesnt give you a headache like this game AND you can build on the ground and are not restricted to specific vehicles",1695228632,1695228632,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the thing i love the most besides just building is dogfighting as in fighting in the sky in jets and small propeller planes, you can make boats, cars, planes, etc.
racing with people on the game is pretty fun too.
in my honest opinion its a 8.5/10 it would be a 9.5/10 if there was more into the game like arena matches or more block variants to let you build more or maybe more mechanics like maybe at a particular height where the game has zero gravity so we can have more exploration.

Trailmakers is great for chilling with or without friends and it's building system has a large skill curve so beginners can have fun with experts. You can build about anything in any of the 3 default creative maps and challenge yourself in it's excellent campaign!

I will say that hopfully in future updates they will add a seed based world generation system because there are only 7 maps (With all map DLC's) and having 700+ hours on just 7 maps can get boring but you can throw in other games into the mix and it will extend your excitement over a larger time.

The issue is that they lock a ton of stuff behind DLCs, for new players who are just buying the game it can be pretty expensive to buy everything at once. While i understand the devs have to make money so they can continue developing it, its still frustrating that you have to spend another 25 dollars for the 2 DLCs that are NEEDED for a much better building experience. Then there's the Decals packs which aren't needed but are extremely handy and your gonna wanna buy them.

As you know this game is a multiplayer sandbox so you can join servers with other players. The community isn't too bad but it can be a little frustrating at times. In some servers some people will kick you just out of the blue or you kill em 1 time boom kick, sometimes don't even ask you to stop or try to reason. If your into pvp some people make these cheesy pvp machines that completely annihilate reasonable builds. Then there players that build lag machines and spam builds,  but on the other hand its fun to interact with the players in the servers who are decent players.

SO,  id say if your willing to fork off more than twice the games actual price to play id say go for it, its a great game. Even if you don't mind not having all the benefits the DLCs offer then its a good game and id say its worth the price But if you aren't i cant recommend this game to other people who have an issue with the things ive listed

You can build anything you want to build, and the feeling when you get it right is just golden. Planes, boats, cars, tanks, anything you set your mind to you can build. You can take jumps, have fun on multiple maps, drive race courses with friends, and oh so much more. Just a sandbox game to have fun, make friends, and build. If you're one of those people that want to get a sandbox game where your creations only stop at your creativity, but you think that it would be extremely hard to learn and build, then try this game. One thing I love about Trailmakers is that even now at some 1093 hours in the game, I still learn new things about it all the time. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone, and I do mean anyone. Anyone can learn the game and enjoy it. If you like vehicle combat, few games are better. If you enjoy first person shooter games, then build one in Trailmakers. If you enjoy games where there are gargantuan maps to explore, not to mention questing for objects all over some of those said maps. If you are a person who loves to fly a plane, and make realistic aircraft just as I do, then there is no game better.

But there is one huge caveat. Autoaim. Basically, there is a thing that aims your guns for you because a lot of players have a skill issue and begged the devs for easier dogfights. It makes dogfights unrealistic and not fun. For any players that like realistic aircraft with realistic dogfights, I gotta say I'm not fully sure I can suggest it. Now, people can turn autoaim off, but no one really does. Online server dogfights are simply not fun anymore, there's no real skill involved. The whole rest of this review was before autoaim, some 200 in game hours ago. At this point I don't really like the game a lot, since I like realistic dogfights in this game.

The game has a campaign mode which I thoroughly enjoyed and consider perfect for a sandbox styled game (unlike Scrap Mechanic survival) and with two excellent DLC campaigns available, this game is sure to keep you entertained for a while.

unlike many sandbox games, the modding community is not as large which may simply be because its not as necessary. That said, there are still many shared player builds available for download on the workshop.

Trailmakers is a wonder full game allowing all creativity possible (obviously not but very close to).The game has few bugs some are glitches but are wonderful (hinge glitches and pistons) that can help you add so much more to your builds creating extra space for looks and functions. There's  nothing you cant really do. There's logic for complex builds guns for cool vehicles. Planes and boats are also supported! Its generally a really good game!

Dlcs:

High Seas:
It was a bit of a let down but it was new and exiting good never the less but wind can be annoying could do with some tweaking on that like add a slider because its hard to make an aesthetically pleasing build that functions well in the high seas but you'll only find that issue sometimes and can be fixed with a gyroscope.
Good money grinder as well!  (:

Airborn:

Theres nothing better then this a beautiful map with a fun story with chirpos, fighting new AI, being shot down and feeling like your from top gun but with a twist its anything you like even cars on this map are great.Worth the price for sure nothing let me down in this dlc.

Free Maps That Need Work
The free maps need to be big and support boats cars plane etc because the normal maps aren't  very big and they only support good looking ground map (Airborn looks really cool in air vechiles and ground vechiles). The way to go about fixing this is with a universal map cool water features, cool land and a cool place to fly around also more underwater fish.

MOST IMPORTANT:

They need to add a customisable weather system so if i select snowy its snows and the ground is white stormy where there's big dark clouds rain and thunder fog slider where i can customise the fog same with waves and wind. If this was implemented im sure i would play this game for more then 100 hours please see this and take deep thoughts thank you flashbulb!

The perfect game to have fun with your younger sibling, nephew, little cousin or whatever‚Ä¶

[h1]Graphics:[/h1] 
Graphis are cool and fun; the vivid colors and lego-styled blocks make this look very familiar to any block-building afficionado.

[h1]Tutorial:[/h1] 
The tutorial is a must; the game is not that complex, but getting the hang of everything is certainly difficult without it. It‚Äôs a good-quality tutorial, too. 

[h1]Controls:[/h1] 
Main controls are as basic as it gets, but since a big part of the game is customization, vehicle controls can get as complex as you make them. You can set thrusters, hydraulics, etc., with the keybindings you prefer; you can even set more than one element attached to the same key and activate both at the same time, in a symmetrical or asymetrical manner.
As mentioned before, I suggest playing the tutorial and fooling around a bit in test mode.

[h1]Environment & Setting:[/h1] 
The environment is a big part of the game; overcome obstacles as you explore your surroundings and improve your vehicle. Floating islands, raging vulcans, deep sea scavenging... You will have to explore the various biomes and terrain types in order to fulfill your mission of getting back home.
The game either happens on a ""foreign planet"" that you will have to explore during camp or in different sanbox scenarios that allow fun and chaos to happen within the creative realm of block building, racing, and dangerous stunt competitions.

[h1]Music and sound design:[/h1] 
The sound design is good, and the music is decent, but nothing worth writing a whole paragraph about. The chill music is good for the building menu and such, and the sounds of explosion, throttle, thrusters, and engines are satisfying to hear and play with.

[h1]Variety of blocks and options:[/h1] 
The base game is already packed with stuff; more than 100 different block types will allow your imagination to flow and be cherished in a fun experience where only the sky is the limit‚Äîa sky you can conquer with your plane engines and wings, of course! You can combine them as you want. I love using jet engines on my motorcycle-styled vehicle; it makes perfect sense! /jk
In case the basic blocks are not enough, you can always expand your inventory with the game's DLCs. I haven‚Äôt tried them for now but might do so in the future.

[h1]Characters:[/h1] 
As far as I have reached in the game, there are no characters aside from you, the player, and your friends. You can customize the character a little bit, but nothing too special or extravagant. Very basic stuff; the characters are not the main focus of the game after all.

[h1]Gameplay and game mechanics:[/h1] 
Your little LegoTM person is stranded in deep space, and you will have to work to get back to your spaceship! Or you can spend your time improving your vehicle speed for racing maps, or even try the sandbox modes and fool around as you wish.
There are several game modes available in the game. Campaign, sandbox, and racing.
Campagin contains the basic ""Stranded in Space"" adventure.
Sandbox contains the ""Danger Zone"" , ""Treasure Island"" and ""Test Zone"". 
Racing contains ""Rally"" mode and ""Race Island"". 
There are more modes, like the ""Airborne Campaign"" and the ""Airborne Sandbox"" mode or the ""High Seas Sandbox"" mode, but you will have to pay for the DLCs to get them.
The ""Stranded in Space"" campaign is where you have to rebuild your vehicle to get back to the mother ship and is one of my favorites.
Within Sandbox, you‚Äôll find ""Danger Zone"" where you can perform dangerous stunts and truly test your vehicle behavior in crazy contraptions and dangerous terrains; ""Treasure Island"", where you will have to solve puzzles and seek the hidden treasures; and ""Test Zone"", where you can, well, test your vehicles and imagination.
Within Racing, you‚Äôll find ""Rally"" , where you can build your racer, win blocks and credits, and improve your vehicle to keep competing... Or Race Island, where you can do your best in Time Trials with your racer and such.
The building menu is intuitive, and once you build something you like and feel proud of, you can save it and rebuild it as many times as you like. Testing stuff with friends and giving each other ideas is part of the fun, but if you are not into that, you can even play some sort of ""combat mode"". A friend and I created a little base with man-controlled machine guns and missile launchers, and the other player had to fly around and try to bomb the F out of everything. Another thing we tried was making a mecha-sort of vehicle, and we failed while laughing our buttocks off several times.

[h1]Community and multiplayer.[/h1]
You can download and use other people's build and contribute your own to the game community. You can share and enjoy building with others online and have fun exploring other people's clever creations. Multiplayer is a big plus, but how the community is integrated is also quite clever and nice to have. You can join public servers or make your own with your friends.

[h1]The game‚Äôs biggest flaws:[/h1] 
The game seems to be a bit heavy and intense on hardware. My PC fans go crazy when playing the game. For reference, I use a Nvidia 1070 with a Ryzen 5 5600x and 16 GB of RAM.
It would be cool to be able to customize the appearance of the character just a bit more.
DLCs are not cheap, and they lock away a lot of content.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1] 
Incredible fun experience, and even more fun with friends. When I don‚Äôt feel like playing anything too complicated, I‚Äôll just jump in and have some chaotic fun. Your imagination drives what you‚Äôll achieve and many problems have a huge number of possible solutions. There are several game modes that will allow you to explore different ways of thinking while building stuff and make you come up with new uses for the same block. Another great thing about this game is that it appeals to people of every age. I‚Äôve played it with my wife and friends and will son play it with my young nephew.
This being said, if you like legos, building stuff, or vehicles, then buy the game and enjoy; in the meantime, I‚Äôll be building my own Gundam.",1689980995,1690117984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In Trailmakers you unlock car parts as you play that make it easier.

In Tactics you can spend thirty minutes customizing your team to beat the next battle easier to win.
In Trailmakers you can spend thirty minutes customizing your car to make the next part easier to obtain.

It's full freedom to build a vehicle for the task you want BUT it's not only a sandbox game. There is a great campaign mode which is an open world where you collect parts to be able to explore further and build better vehicles. And also a race mode with a lot of different tracks that will test your driving skills with a lot of different types of vehicles which you can also fine-tune to each track.

And that's exactly the kind of objective-based gameplay I needed to enjoy a game like this. There is also plenty of templates for both modes which makes it so you always have something to start from if you don't know how to get started with new types of builds. And then there is the other types of vehicles like planes, helicopters [spoiler]submarines,[/spoiler] and [spoiler]hovercars[/spoiler]!! This game had so much more to give than I expected and I love it. And also the building works well like how much more can you ask for??

I only have a few criticism and QoL requests:

- The first plane race is pretty much impossible with the template place. You need to add some vertical tailfins to it.
- I wish setting a new score in a race prompted you to upload the car to the workshop so players racing your ghost can compare their car to yours if they wish to.
- I wish I could see the race leaderboards from the menu. It's annoying to have to load a race map and check the tracks one by one to see which one i have the most room for improvement on.
- I'm sure other players have done something interesting with it but logic blocks are very very limited and they quickly take a lot of room making it hard to be very creative with them. It's a little unfortunate given how much freedom you feel like you have for all the other parts of the building process.

The second is that having a controller plugged in breaks the entire menu, and you can't disable them in the settings (there's volume control and not much else). The server browser does not have a region filter, or even an indicator for ping.

Even on the construction side of things, nothing works right. You'll be wrestling with the janky interface all the way. Basic principles of physics are thrown out of the window, and basic information is not available to you.

For instance: in a game with a lot of aerial and aquatic exploration in its ""campaign"" mode, there is no indicator whatsoever for Center of Mass, Center of Lift, Center of Buoyancy or Center of Thrust.

This is but one of the many oft-requested features that the developers, sequestered away in the community discord that you can only suggest feedback in after 1 month(!!!) of lurking, have outright stated will never be implemented (like displaying ping in the server browser! or filtering servers by region!). 

Instead, they're working on a [b]paid expansion[/b] for a barely functional and nearly content-free game.

It's a shame there aren't more options for this genre. Avoid this one if you can. Hope something better comes along, because after all this time, it's useless to think this one is getting any better. Let it die in peace.

UPDATE: THEY ADDED CENTER OF LIFT AND MASS AS PAID DLC, YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP, JESUS CHRIST",1634366544,1687428616,False,33,11,0.472902655601501465,0,True,False,False

I really hate the flying controls in the game too which meant I never bothered finishing stranded in space and never bothered starting the DLC, which is a shame, since I was so close to finishing the former, but flying is bad enough without using the tractor beam forget using it. There is a good chance I'm just not good enough at building machines, but truth is, I didn't really enjoy that element of the game - this is a far cry from (the far more recent and AAA) Tears of the Kingdom's snap things together and it just works kind of building (I know, unfair comparison perhaps, but I want to let people know what they're getting into) - it's a lot more technical, I think for the right kind of person - someone much more engineering-minded than me, it could be fun - but for me, who expected a mix of lighter crafting and more compelling adventure elements, it was pretty tedious.

The minute I did it, my pecker grew twice the size of my forearm. And as I was about to cum, I slipped on the poopie.

The parts being hidden around the map give a form of goal to the game to get you exploring. It was a little annoying at first, but then I looked back and realized it wouldn't have been the same experience if all the parts were given to me up front. Haven't tried the couple expansions yet. However, I will at some point when I circle back to this game.

I like the insta-fix button to instantly repair your current vehicle. While I do sometimes spend some time putting blocks together it didn't feel like a grind. You get to enjoy your creation after building it... and if you want to rebuild it, you can choose to.

The other thing nice about the insta-fix button is when a _friend_ thinks it's funny to fly into your machine while you're trying to shimmy to that next part needed for progress... Takes the sting out a little bit.",1684242005,1684242005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A vehicle you built for 30 minutes is only really useful for the ball you built it to get. After that, there is no more real use for that vehicle again.

The aerodynamics could use work, but it's always fun to have a slight problem you need to work around. The game only needs updates, and hard work responding to the community.

super slow start and grind
slow cars and slow walking speed
a third motor doesnt increase speed
stupid power core limit screws me over from having one motor to drive
and two boat engines to go in the water
VERY limited parts. epic fail
pushing them is a tedious chore
the green and red lines for tire turning shouldnt matter but it does, took me many attempts to figure out what was wrong with this stupid game and its the stupid lines. the game doesnt tell you anything like that
your cars break often and you wont be allowed to repair, parts dont despawn and when they do, you cant repair... wtf why? you can just spawn the whole car again but thats still dumb
the character creator sucks. every other costume and part costs gold or dlc
you can only change the neck and suit colors, which is tacky and stupid because the two styles wont mix
items all over the map and alot i couldnt even find
no mater what i fucking do, the car i make wont drive or steer
i tried changing the damn wheels and its hinge but that did nothing. trail makers is TRASH",1675742717,1683395185,False,1,1,0.464197665452957153,0,True,False,False

Why do developers keep getting away with updating games and never fixing the bugs they cause. This is not the first game Ive had this happen too. Getting annoyed with Steam too for never pushing developers to maintain quality. I'm on the same pc as before too.

I play with 2 -6 people and all of us experience these glitches and randomly exploding, and general lag, not all the time but its noticeable and I just wish the very obvious bugs could be sorted, I can run something like space engineers which I would argue is a far more demanding game, much better than this, which is very poor really.

not only does the logic in this game not make any sense. the latest ""airborne"" update is an ABSOLUTE lie, the infinite iq of flashbulb decided that elevators ARE NOT wings. NOT ONLY do tail fins do absolutely fuckall, the plane functions BETTER WITHOUT ONE. Secondly, a sideways wing is not a tail fin, no its a spoiler. i dont even think the developers have even heard of AERODYNAMICS! OH MY GOD IS THAT A NEW CONCEPT!? NO. IT ISNT. Your stall speed is in the hundreds of miles per hour and half of the items are held behind a paywall. the game thinks its okay to have the center of lift IN FRONT of the center of mass. which is basic knowledge from ksp. it wont work. BUT behind it  is way too bad because it will make you pitch down but MAYBE if they decided to code in some counteracting forces maybe the plane will fly stable, but that is too much effort for their lazy money focused minds.  this game does not deserve any dlc as it just hides the shabby code and logic of the items. 10 quid for NINE ITEMS thats 1.1 quid per item. it better incorporate some BETTER PHYSICS. what in their endless wisdom were they on when making the concept of this new dlc.

I won't pretend it doesn't have some bugs here and there, with too many moving parts causing your vehicle to burst apart (and mirror mode is... definitely still a beta feature), but I have no other substantial gripes about it. There are few other games that I can pull 5 people together for, and it has kept us entertained for entire days.

Beyond the complexity limitations, this game lets me do just about anything I can think of and tests both my creativity and problem solving in a way I wish other games would. I suppose it's not for everyone, and that's why there are pre-built crafts to choose from if you're still learning or just plain don't want to build (you really should, though).

Overall, Trailmakers is by far one of the best sandbox experiences I have in my 200+ games on Steam, and that's not an overstatement. I love this game.

It's quick to create something but takes a while to make something perfect. I've played Trailmakers for about 700 hours on my previous Steam profile. My previous account was sold together with my gaming laptop. Some creations take 6-12 hours to make as one can build something that's very complex, or you may decide on a shape of a creation but one that doesn't conform to physics and then it's a mission to get it to work properly. My Frankstein Asymmetrical Jet is an example of this.

There are an unlimited number of combinations one can use and it will be great when new parts are added with the upcoming DLC. Such a satisfying game. Those who become impatient with Trailmakers after purchasing it, should give it some time as there is so much enjoyment in seeing creations come to life.

My mind is very active so this game is ideal for my condition. Trailmakers is awesome.

Now, the game itself is a good idea. You go around the world, making vehicles, solving puzzles. But it's in the nuances of the game, and what the devs chose to do to it, that makes me upset.

First of all, it's really hard to make complicated things. There are only three logic gates, and they each take up a lot of space. 

Second of all, there is no 1x1x1 cube. I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you have a 1 block space and want to fill it, you have to do some weird stuff with the other blocks to fill it, and that can take away from your design. The smallest block is 2x1.

And lastly, for a paid game, there are way too many DLCs. The game itself is $25.00, but you are only getting about 1/2 of the game. There is an oceans DLC for another $20, and the game is constantly trying to get you to buy that DLC. ON TOP OF THAT, there are so many other DLCs for blocks in the game, and when you try to download things from the workshop in-game, it tries to get you to buy those DLCs. With the Air Combat DLC coming out soon, it just isn't worth it to get this game. $25.00 for the amount of content you get is insanely overpriced, and the game just isn't that good. Don't buy this game unless you are prepared to spend lots of money on it.

TL;DR: This game is way overpriced with too many DLCs, and it isn't even that good.

I would not recommend this game.",1681334458,1681334458,False,2,0,0.51804119348526001,0,True,False,False

building is easy and intuitive, so that it never gets frustrating, but has enough depth to make complex stuff. Vehicles can be dead simple or carefully balanced and can be outfitted with all sorts of gizmos & gimmicks.

Currently there is enough content in singleplayer to tie you over for a lot of hours - if you enjoy racing your creations, or exploring the Campaign- & Sandbox-Maps. The game is pretty loose on it's structure, like many sandbox builders. Expect to 'make your own fun' with the options given for most the maps and modes.

The multiplayer needs some serious convenience upgrades in the server browser, and better stability, but it's wicked fun to have close tied races on the offroad tracks or harrowing aerial fights above the plane-carrier.",1544981555,1681240394,True,4,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

I migrated here from the Scrap Mechanic community. Absolutely love the game. I came here because I love building aircraft (Something which Scrap Mechanic doesn't adequately support without mods) And found the perfect way to bring out my creativity. While I mainly build planes, helicopters, and the like, tanks, cars, boats, ships, really anything you can imagine, can be built. Trailmakers is by no means without its bugs and glitches but is surprisingly well rounded and the physics still surprise me to this day. I have somewhere around 2,800 hours in this game and there is no end in site for possible game play. I haven't even played the campaign yet! This game is very much alive and there is a constant stream of workshop content and an active multiplayer community which I have found to be mostly pleasant. Updates are good and fairly frequent from what I can tell. The multiplayer combat is (While a little wacky at times) surprisingly good and heaps of fun. I could spend all day dog fighting, and bombing, and avoiding AA guns, or maybe just chilling with some friends and building casually. The build system is well thought out and easy to use and get used too (Way easier than some games I've played) and gives you all the tools you need. There are plenty of parts and blocks and plenty of logic blocks. It can really support anything you want to do if you just spend enough time at it. A build can be as simple or complex as you like. There's nothing like the satisfaction you feel when you finally make a sonic boom, or make a plane that can cobra, or you find a new engineering principle to solve your problem.

[b]TLDR:[/b] I enjoyed the game, if I can make a mid rating I would have, unfortunately what makes this game bad is what limits its potential. It is still an enjoyable arcade creation/vehicle builder, but the hard parts limit, poor optimization and a few minor things is the reason this is a dislike. The game is still enjoyable and even satisfying to a point but the more I played the more glaring the bad stuff were, at least for me.

[h1]Cons: [/h1]
-A hard parts limit, I think its 600 ? not really a problem because there is a mod that can fix this and it's impossible to reach it if you just don't make any big creation. Though this problem will be apparent on the next con.

-Poor optimization, even before reaching 600 parts you can feel the lag, and I wasn't using any complicated equipment, just some pipes (for the body), 4 engines, 4 suspension, and the lag was just... bro why? Going fast you can have fps drops which is obviously bad for someone who likes going fast, where milliseconds decide if I die or just barely missing a rock/wall. For a game with graphics like this, it likes sending my GPU, a GTX 1650, to the moon and back i.e. fan go turbo mode (I know my GPU is not the best but come on it's not the worst).

-Clunky map physics. There are portions in all maps were ""something"" will destroy your vehicle. This is apparent to locations where there are changes in the ground/texture, especially the transition from asphalt to bridge. Going fast there will just destroy your entire creation. (a nitpick really)

-Simple destruction model. If you hit a wall or anything  at 100~ kph some of your vehicle should survive (especially the back part) but here your entire vehicle will just turn to ashes. not really a big problem there is a mod (strength mod i think?) that can make your parts beefier but it's not full proof, those parts can and will be destroyed anyway. (again a nitpick)

-No in depth editing/customization. I'm not talking about cosmetics, I mean the driving physics especially the wheels. You can't turn them off (e.g. you can't make RWD or FWD its only AWD baby) Not really a problem but having this would be nice. Ohh and the wheels just suck, not that their bad especially the normal ones (motorcycle wheel, spiked wheel), but you cant make them bigger or smaller. and the larger wheels (monster truck wheel and truck wheel?) are way too slow. Unless you dedicate 90% of the cars weight in engines you can barely hit 140kph. Which I do understand that irl larger wheels can't go fast but come one it's a game.

-Janky flying. I think this is not because of the physics, I think the physics are on point. The problem here is the control surfaces or rather how you can put control in them (hinges and the rotating rotor). This is hard to explain, but the flying physics is fine, there is just a junkiness in it that turns me off. Though this might be fixed in the upcoming DLC, and you don't need to buy the dlc to have the parts/fix so you'll be fine.

-Overall aesthetics, not really a problem. and its highly subjective. I like it actually but I also like some realistic looking parts. Even when those parts might exist due to how things connect it might be impossible to incorporate it to my design. I wish its possible to turn off some of the connecting parts. (but really just a nitpick)

-Not a true sandbox (at least for racing island) You can assume that the racing island is my favorite map but no, its my least favorite actually. Danger map(?) and treasure map was my favorite, why? because there are no starting lines, I hate the starting lines soo much, how it would initiate a race when you don't want to, and that I just want to go trough here fast man, but noooo go ahead put a giant f*cking wall where I want to go. Racing on this tracks are fine, except for some race tracks that lets you go to places where your vehicle will just break when going over certain areas, I'm looking at you Three bridges (the bump in between the first and second bridge, the second bridge, the turn right after the tunnel, the jump right before the third bridge, the third bridge entrance, and the third bridge exit, these portions right here are the bane of my existence), though I wish you can customize race tracks, especially the asphalt oval map I wish you can make 10 laps etc. and just not record it on the leader board or something. And the Rally mode (where you can do some racing missions) I wish we can go open world and explore there, but you can't you can only race some selected race tracks. 

-A not so in depth builder, It's not bad BUT it's missing a few things. For one a 1x1x1 block (the lego piece), I know you can fiddle around your creation so that you won't need a 1x1 block but I just want [b]it[/b] so i can put [b]it[/b] when I need [b]it[/b]. also I'm aware that a 6 sided pipe exist but its not aesthetically nice to look at. There is no custom pieces 7x5x2 idk what that would look like but it might solved lag.

-Can't cheat while other people are cheating, I don't mean it that way. What I mean here is that you can't make a times 5 power engine/jet engine, or a zero mass car. I know leaderboards exist so yeah you can't cheat but come one. There are people who reach 00:00:000 in the leader boards how are they still there without cheating? Again a nitpick, I don't really care about the leaderboards, but I would like to know what a zero mass car/lighter vehicle would feel like driving around XD or even have a x10 power engine XD.

-Car class won't matter anyway, why put car classes when there's only one leader board anyway? doesn't matter if your rocking a 1 core vehicle or a 666 core monster you'll be facing each other in the leaderboards. Again just a nitpick, I don't care about leader boards, but... why though? 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
-Game is simple and arcady, You don't need to create your engine, suspension unit, and you don't need to connect the fuel tanks to the engine with a fuel line. just drag and drop the necessary things and boom you have a vehicle.

-Aesthetics. (I know subjective) but it looks like a Lego and that is good enough for me.

-Basic computing stuffs, logic gates, speedometer, altimeter etc. you can create a complex machine with this.

-Physics are on point, I'm not saying realistic, but it feels right when you are going fast

-Downforce done right. I love the feel of the vehicle when you put enough (and even too much) downforce on your vehicle, it be well planted and you can corner like a beast. Main problem here is putting too much will fully compress your suspension so a no suspension vehicle can work, BUT you can't off road and asphalt is not cheap in this game, so finding a right mix as well as center of downforce is important if you're going of road and you MUST go off road, it's not a choice.

-Creativity, I've made an F1 car with an additional jet engine that only activates upon reaching a specific speed, and a working DRS that actually increases my top speed by 20kph ( it automatically activates as well) and I love how it basically turns the vehicle into a uncontrollable mess with the reduction in downforce BUT ANYTHING FOR MORE SPEED BABY!!!

-The game is very cheap and you don't need any of the DLCs, to enjoy the parts (aside from cosmetics dlc which you don't need) The high seas add a few hours of gameplay (though very tedious and boring) and the upcoming dlc actually has a story. Which I don't really care but it's good to have.

[h1]Conclusion: [/h1]
The game is a fun arcade sandbox, you can have fun with this and for it's price I say it's worth it. This game is not really for a gearhead like me. But the game has it's merits, It has a relaxing campaign while I only spent a few hours on the campaign it actually requires you to think. It has a nice atmosphere and building mechanic that is simple and it works.",1654492159,1679500312,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

From the very start, the game immerses you in a world of creativity and endless possibilities, allowing you to create anything you can imagine using an intuitive building system.

One of the things I loved about Trailmakers is how easy it is to get started. The game has a very user-friendly interface that makes building and designing vehicles a breeze, even for those who have no experience in this genre. Whether you want to build a car, a plane, or a helicopter, Trailmakers gives you all the tools you need to create your own unique vehicle from scratch.

But what really sets Trailmakers apart from other games is its emphasis on exploration and adventure. The game worlds are big, with a vast array of different environments to explore, from mountains and deserts to forests and oceans. And with a variety of challenges and objectives to complete, there's always something new and exciting to discover.

Trailmakers also offers a variety of gamemodes, from a survival-style exploration campaign, to simple sandbox and thrilling race chanllenges.

The game's graphics are also worth mentioning, as they are simply stunning. The artstyle is simply stunning, and the attention to detail is evident.

Overall, I highly recommend Trailmakers to anyone who loves sandbox games, creative building, and exploration. With its intuitive building system, gorgeous graphics, and endless possibilities, this game is sure to provide hours of fun and entertainment. So why not jump in and start building your dream vehicle today?",1678542959,1678542959,True,4,1,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

oh wait there Is a better comabt,and there are more mechanics like more ship and airplane parts ,finally a cool update... Nvm it¬¥s another 5 billion ‚Ç¨ dlc which should be a normal update.
after all the game costs almost 30 ‚Ç¨ but no who needs updates if you have greedy devs, right?

Im only recommending because i did get a decent amount of hours with doing just that, making some planes & heli's, but honestly everything else kinda sucks & most building games run circles around this one, see the below lists. I really tried to come up with more Pro's (because i certainly don't dislike the game) but idk, if i'm honest and compare this to other games in the genre then Trailmakers is mediocre at best.

Pro's:
- Flying stuffs (also submarine stuffs, but that's bscly the same thing)
- More wedges/sloped blocks compared to most grid-based building games

Con's:
- Cant build onto the world (massive oversight really cutting down on the amount of things to do)
- You are pretty limited by build complexity (yea okay you can get a mod, but then the game just struggles to stay alive)
- Destruction mostly just seems to be random (crash into a wall can be losing a single part or entire vehicle shattering)
- After 4 years of people complaining about it half the wheels still bug into the ground
- After 4 years of requests we still don't have a way to visualize center of mass/lift/thrust/drag/etc so you end up just guessing together your planes/heli's/boats/etc trough trail and error, which is honestly ridiculous when you consider that air & water 'physics' are this games biggest selling point.
- Development for the base game has apparently stopped?? new building parts are exclusive to paid DLC now, the developer didn't take the hint when last DLC like that got a poor review score i guess.

Thread carefully, buy this in a sale if you see something you like, have some fun, then go back/move on to a better building game.",1677968975,1677968975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

game-play is good
game is stable (things don't blow up just because they can)
its a building game with plentiful connection/snap points

cons
each update (""expansion"") has its own price-tag so anytime something new comes out you want send more money.

summery
the game is good i don't deny that but it does all the same things other games do that don't ask for more money for each update (expansion).
if the company decides you know what sales on the older expansions (such as ""high seas"" for example) have slowed so lets remove their prices to encourage sales for the new expansions and base game i'd say yes i recommend the game then. however right now to do the same thing you've seen others do that might of gotten you interested in the game to begin with, may or may not even be in the game when you buy the base game and if its not... well good luck picking the right price tag for the one thing you wanted to do after you already paid for the game.",1677029273,1677029273,False,5,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

The straw that broke the camel's back was when I went to revisit the game today and tried to assign ""F"" to control one of my blocks and was told that that key couldn't be assigned.

Newer review: [strike]I made time to go back and try Trailmakers again.  I'm enjoying the campaign mode a lot, but don't know how much I'll get out of the other modes.

In any case, my original review was no longer accurate, and I can now recommend this game.  My biggest complaint now is the lack of keybinding.[/strike]

Original review: [strike]TL;DR: I'd wait until the devs get a few more patches in.

Multiple crashes on startup killed not only the game, but my actual Steam client. Disabling the Steam overlay allowed the game to continue past the crash point, but I'm not sure that I want to try to continue playing a game that has that kind of bad interaction with Steam itself.

I looked into contacting the developers for help and they seemed like they would have been responsive, but their discord channel has a mandatory wait time before you post and I'm not feeling very patient with a game this hostile to the platform it lives on.

My hope is to possibly try it again after a few updates to see if things have improved, but I don't want it sitting in my library between now and then.  Refund requested.[/strike]",1524628584,1676583315,False,0,0,0.467289716005325317,0,True,False,False

[h1] What is the game's idea? [/h1]

The game gives you the opportunity to build your own vehicle, putting on the tweaks you want, the features you wish and the design you are dreaming about.
it will make your dream vehicle come true!

[h1] What game modes does the game offer?[/h1]

The game offers you a campaign mode but i didn't try it yet ( i will update when i do) and a sandbox (creative mode)

For the multiplayer, you can basically do everything you do in single player but with a friend
Help them building their own car, race with them , play story , and have fun.

[h1] Do I need to buy the DLCs to enjoy the game? [/h1]

No, you don't have to!
The game offers you most of the parts you would use to build the car (almost all of them)
it won't destroy your experience if you didn't buy the DLC that unlocks the rest!

Also , there are some DLCs for more customization (Buy them if you just want to look more fancy)

[h1] Ugh the game is so hard to understand! [/h1]

Welp, always check the guides in steam and the tutorial videos. it would help you understand physics and make you build your vehicle better!

It's good for cars, planes, boats all that stuff, but the block building system makes it rather unfeasible to make replicas of real life vehicles.

However for anyone hoping to make big or advanced projects in this game, i strongly advise against it. It can get pretty laggy or glitchy with high amounts of blocks and the physics aren't really that great for anything complex. The logic is rather simplified, it's binary and there's a rather limited amount of components to use.

Water physics are okay, just like any other building game, place a pontoon and bam your creation magically floats on the water. The aerodynamics don't make sense most of the time, but what can you do about it, they exist and are a thing.
 
The worlds are quite small for such a game (if you don't count the almost endless water surrounding them), there are only 2 of them (not counting the campaign and racing maps).

There are a lot of graphic settings in-game, but there are practically no general/standard settings, you can't even change the language, framerate, controls, nothing...

And the devs are in my opinion the worst out of any sandbox game, instead of making normal content updates for what i consider an unfinished game, they make mediocre dlcs with content that should be in the base game. 

The community or as i call it ""blind fanbase"" is pretty rough too, they support all their controversial decisions and will cancel you if you disagree, it's almost like twitter.",1563695950,1676041575,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I payed something like ¬£2 for this game on sale. It is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my life, (and I've played a lot of games). 

If you want a brief description of this. It is a  physics based puzzle-solving game where you must create and operate the right vehicle in order to progress. 

If you have played Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, Trailmakers basically follows the same exact formula. If you liked N&B, you will like this. To compare this game to BK:N&B, Trailmakers places much more emphasis on the gameplay and the variety of vehicles, as well as the mechanics. Whereas N&B has more personality with characters and comedy aspects. Trailmakers is essentially a serious/complex version of BK:N&B. But to those who have played one and not the other. Both are worth trying out. 

One complaint I do have is how hard and frustrating it can be to get to grips with the flying portions of the game. creating a flying vehicle that functions how you expect it to is quite difficult. It is something that may grate on you over time, as to fly properly, you require pieces of machinery that are not easy to obtain. I would suggest watching a guide on how to do this decently with minimal parts of machinery (instead of annoying yourself with trial and error like I did). 

Overall, this is a great game. Easily one of my favourite games ever, due to its variety and the way it has held my interest far longer than most games I have played lately. It's not an easy game, so if you're up for a challenge, this will provide one.",1675888781,1675894768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Fantastic building system, IMO. Either that, or I've gotten (it's a word, I checked) so used to it that playing other, similar games don't feel right at times lol. 

Huge maps to roam and create freely in. 5, if I'm not mistaken. 

2 Campaign maps, tailored to teach you the basic of building and the basics of racing inside Trailmakers. Stranded in Space - adapt your creation to collect all the parts and get off the rock you crashed on. Rally - Race on various courses, increasing in difficulty, also adapting your vehicle to beat time challenges. - Both huge and open. 

A newly released map called High Seas. (DLC, but worth.) Add all of the goodness of a sandbox and now add realistic wind physics to already realistic water physics, and voila. There's a lot of fun to be had there, especially with a bunch of parts being added, too. The sails being a prime example. 

2 actual sandbox maps: Treasure Island - for doing treasure hunts and whatnot. Danger zone - Has all sorts of contraptions and prebuilt structures to do various amounts of destruction and even has CARBALL. (Rocket League, here's looking at you) Pretty sure the workshop has faithful recreations of actual cars and arenas from Rocket League, as well. Which brings me to another pro.

The mods! This speaks for itself. go check the workshop. lol

And now for the

Cons:

The building system is limited to x,y,z vertices. But, aren't most games of a similar vein? Not that big of a deal, imo.

On rare occasions, there are some weird glitches that can happen. Your tire clipping an invisible piece of the ground, sending your creation flying off into the sunset or just obliterated into actual smithereens. Haha, smithereens. What a word. Anyway..

Speaking of glitches, there are a few that are actually helpful and used a lot in the community. See Youtubers and such for that. 

Lastly for cons, while there are a good number of parts, a builder junkie like myself could always use more. Specifically a few that, imo, should already be in game. different sizes, etc, as well. Annnd, more paint options. lol Love me some aesthetics. 

Thanks for coming to my TE- ah, whatever. 

It's a good game, you should get it. Try it on game pass first, if that's a thing for you. Cheers.",1675157246,1675157246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was recommended this game by someone who knew I was working on a vehicle building game myself, so this is mainly my interpretation of the design choices as I see them fitting into the vehicle builder genre.
First of all, all the vehicles you can come up with in this game feel excellent, its very hard to make a vehicle that doesn't feel good, with the exception of helicopters, but that's something of an unsolved problem genre-wide. The vehicle building UX is also great, though some desirable hotkeys are missing, it lends itself very well to either mouse or keyboard control. It seems like it would work perfectly with a controller too.
The open world singleplayer where you collect blueprints is a great idea; it does a good job of tempting you to try things that maybe you aren't supposed to be able to yet. For example I got one of the scraps with a fixed wing vehicle that looks like it was definitely intended to be helicopter-only. I also had a great time picking up Volatile scraps from my plane and flying them through recovery drones without landing. My only complaints about this mode is the ""barriers"" (eg between land, sea, sub, and air vehicles being accessible), while present, don't have much gameplay lead-in. I found the tractor beam much later than I believe I was supposed to. I also spent a ton of time wondering when I'd finally get an air propulsion part when I already had tons of wings. I guess you could say the sequencing is prone to players getting ""lost"". I think this could be addressed with an Outer Wilds style ""clues"" system, which could also prevent players from feeling like they are finding a ton of scraps they don't care about, by giving them the option to hunt down the ones they want first.",1674928226,1674928226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aight, re-re-review time...

Trailmakers despite it's apparent simplicity is the best construction game I know in terms of visuals (Believe me, I have been looking for a while), though most of these visuals are achieved with a glitch that lets you overlap several blocks. This glitch unfortunately has it's limits and often breaks since it's unintended, meaning usually several hours are spent fighting with the game engine to finally achieve a desirable result.
The last statement is not only applicable to said glitch though, it is applicable to many situations. No creation with more than 10 mechanical blocks is finished without having to fight against the game engine.

The simplicity of the building while useful for a starting player, is a double edged knife for veteran players. The locked grid makes building easy, but it badly limits what shapes you can create. Since there are only so many sizes of blocks most of the time to create a specific shape it's almost required for players to use the above mentioned glitch to create these shapes. The problem is that mechanical blocks which are necessary to do it cost 5 complexity, compared to normal blocks only consuming 1 per piece. That combined with the fact you can only have 700 complexity worth of parts in one creation means you are forced into a choice of ""should I make this shape accurate or should I make it janky and blocky to save on complexity to finish the rest of the creation"". 
The main reason this limit exists is because of the weak hardware that console users are running, not that the game engine can't handle far more complexity. While this is completely understandable, the critical lack of block shapes is not excusable. It's not rare to see weird gaps or bumps in creations, especially in corners. For large creations details have to be sacrificed for the creation to even be able to exist. This often causes large creations to look extremely bland.
Other things of note are the two boring and repetitive campaigns (Mostly redeemed in 1.6), extremely small maps, as well as the lack of proper coloring options, there only being ~12 colors available.

There is also a big problem in communication between the developers. While they do listen to the community and take their concerns and ideas into mind, they often add whatever they feel is needed in the game, not what the game actually needs.
A majority of the playerbase complains of the same few issues, yet the development is focused on new content instead of fixing what is critically broken.
We are at the point where most of the active community isn't even bothered to ask for these problems to be fixed, and instead they are passive-aggressively joked about.

A lot of the new features added to the game are also super half-baked on release, often missing features one would expect should be there.
Examples are:
- Mirror mode | Still unfinished ""beta"" feature after 3 updates. Only functions if both sides of the creation are symmetrical, only works in one axis, doesn't even work properly sometimes.
- Grip block | Grip value is not adjustable, easily breaks on impact meaning almost useless in walker feet.
- Decals | You can't resize height and width individually, all decals are digital instead of vectors (meaning you can see the pixels on decals if they are large enough), you cannot change the texture on decals like you can on blocks, there is a limit of 1 decal per block and there is no option to clone a decal onto two sides of a block, meaning you can't apply decals to both sides of a 1 block wide tailfin.
- Lights | You cannot change the color of lights. The game can display different colored lights, but you cannot change it.
- Noteblocks (sound blocks) | Only a few sounds are available, there is no controller for noteblocks, each note needs to be timed and pitched individually, meaning music is extremely difficult to make.
- Logic | Signal falloff, different gate types, remote detection, player tracking, conical raycasts, mouse position tracker (left/right click added in 1.6 as inputs), rotation sensor, etc. etc. (This could go on for a WHILE)
- Magnet (now ""tractorbeam"") | After 1.4 rework magnet engines, railguns, and maglev trains all broke. Magnet turned from short range, short radius, powerful grabbing device into medium range, super wide radius, unstable grabbing device.
- Blocks | Tons of block shapes you would expect are missing, meaning there are tons of inter-connectivity and smoothness issues.
- Sails | Sails simply do not function like sails, they act like gigantic wing panels.
- Spoiler/Wings | The spoiler block is both lighter and provides more lift than the dedicated wing block? + Big wing provides LESS lift than two small wings that take up the same area.
- Mechanical blocks | When given a signal that is less than 100%, some mechanical blocks adjust the maximum angle, while others adjust their current movement speed. You cannot choose between which, or do both at the same time.
- Ski | Ski only works if perfectly level with ground
- Drag | Some blocks do not have drag, while others do. There is no consistency.
- Wheels | Tire pressure is not adjustable, meaning most wheels sink into the ground when just a small amount of weight is applied. Wheels being offset with the ground on their spinning axis causes shadow forces that move the creation around. In other words, creations with tilted wheels move forwards/backwards uncontrollably at all times.

That's not to mention the overpriced DLCs that the developers have been forced to push out, since not enough people are buying the game due to the bad reputation it gets for the gigantic amount of frustrating bugs, some of which still exist despite them being known for years.
The worst one by far is the hat DLC, adding about 6 totally random looking hats and costing a whopping 4‚Ç¨ which is the same amount as the skin packs and decal packs which actually add something worth the price to the game.
Then there is the High seas DLC... 10‚Ç¨ for a map that is 80% ocean (oceans already exist on all sandbox maps) with the only special thing about it being waves and weather effects + wind. These are only available on the DLC map, and not on any others. Horrible choice.
These should be optional features that can be enabled on any map as long as you own the DLC.
The new parts included in the DLC alone are not worth the 10‚Ç¨ price tag. The map does not make up for the rest of the price.


All in all, I am happy with the game, though I am very worried for it's future. If these years old bugs that are constantly making people angry at the game aren't fixed, it will not have a long lifespan left. If you buy the game now, just be aware that it may only have a few more years before it kicks the bucket. 
Oh and expect to spend more money on future DLCs just to be able to access most of the new content KEKL",1526042774,1674835576,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

lemme explain, the building, the main thing of this game is unreliable, either your build will not work cuz yes, the blocks are kinda limiting and the thing that annoys me the most is, every time this game updates the physics change and cuz of that 70% of vehicles i build will not work after the next update cuz of the physics change. so why build when soon enough it won't even work. but other than that (and the fact this game is not well optimized) id say it's ok.",1674012156,1674013149,False,2,0,0.518771052360534668,0,True,False,False

NO GYROSCOPIC STABILIZER!? What did space and atmospheric stabilization all of a sudden become magic? You can't fly any rocket with any precision WITHOUT IT! Let alone a helicopter, making twin rotor design is stupid since it can't be done IRL without it! RESEARCH WERNHER VON BRAUN for pity sake!

WITHOUT the ability to bind to custom keys OR THE MOUSE, WHY!  This game has been out for years and no one wants to use a mouse!?

THIS IS A PC GAME NOT A CONSOLE PLATFORM! Customization is the main reason why games sell and play better on the PC.

This is the perfect example of a console port game to PC (and not done well), because this game is so made for a controller ONLY! You can tell by the fact that there is ONLY four slots to quick change to different vehicles.

Edit: 
I got this game with my friend with the intention of beating the campaign with him, and had been really looking forward to it as I had just finished playing a multiplayer scrap mechanic run and really enjoyed it. 

 had known about this game for a long time and really liked it conceptually, so when I finally got my hands on it I was really disappointed. From an outside perspective watching videos and seeing the building I thought it looked really nice and satisfying, but the camera was very frustrating to operate and I was really let down. Then once I hopped in a game with my friend I was very disappointed with the generic ""I crashed my ship now I need a new one to escape!"" story that I had seen with so many other games, including scrap mechanic. Then when I finally built a car and was driving around I was really disappointed to see the only objective be to grab and push boxes to a spot on the map.

I wanted to like this game, and was exited to play, but it wasn't fun and I ended up refunding it.",1662423211,1673124553,False,17,1,0.555892884731292725,2,True,False,False

The campaign has you crash landed in some unknown planet. Your mission is to collect as many parts, as best you can, to build a spaceship and secure a ride back home. For the most part, the physics in the game provide a smooth experience when building, testing, or just cruising around the maps. A couple bugs I have ran into in the campaign alone are, one a bug where if you travel too fast across certain sections of land, your vehicle will spontaneously combust, and two, if you have two or more suspension coils next to each other, they have a tendency to create a bunch of energy and jolt your vehicle in any and all directions. The second bug is easily avoidable, so not a big deal. Certainly doesn't take away from the fun, as you can rebuild your models, and respawn with little to no penalties (in survival your objective will reset if you die). There are plenty of other perks to the game as well, but why would you spend all your time reading this when you could experience it in-game!?",1670922935,1670922935,True,2,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

If you don't pick up whatever item you're trying to grab PERFECTLY CENTER, a huge plume of smoke starts emitting and creates a massive thrust on the vehicle. This makes picking up items in High Seas via helicopter unfathomably frustrating. You've just spent five minutes fighting hurricane force winds to line up the shot, you get a slightly imperfect capture and suddenly you are rolling or spinning out of control. From a physics sim POV, this is a pretty game-ending glitch for me.

I've dumped countless hours in this game, usually I have nothing but positive things to say about it, but this glitch, along with many other small ones really make it feel cheap compared to other physics sims. The High Seas expansion was the best thing to happen to this game but the devs need to do some major house-keeping fixing bugs, or its all for nothing. 

For instance, when making chains of mechanical components, errors tend to compound until they exeed the limits of the components and cause breaks or unwanted behavior. If you make a literal chain of trailer hinges and pipes for example, after about 10 links, the physics engine starts to choke and the components begin to vibrate and sometimes disassemble.  Same with multiple combining hinges to servos, things start breaking for no reason.

Overall a good game that keeps bringing me back, but I've reached the point where I am trying to beat the physics engine, and not the obstacles of the game itself.",1668626701,1668626701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: basically unplayable anymore because how literally ever car flips instantly cant build anything cool because it always flips, it also really annoys me how unrealistic alot of stuff is. I know its an arcady game but I hate how its impossible to reach realistic top speeds for the kind of power and weight is like a quarter of what it realisticly would be. 

Alot of glitchy type stuff is really annoying like your car exploding for pretty much no reason when hitting a bump at anywhere above 100 kph

Edit: It has some good elements of course though I have 160 hours after all. It's fun but all the little things started adding up and bugging me after all that time.

positive points =
-the number of vehicles possible to make (planes, submarine, boat, car, exetera helicopter)
- the graphics
-game modes like rally stranded in space
negative point =
-lack of blocks as we would like more blocks like more engines a 1*1 block more wings more powerful reactors
- be able to make helicopters more easily
- more game modes I said earlier that I liked them but I would like a fighting game mode or more game mode because it ends quickly

A motorcylce design I attempted had a similar issue where it would flip forward as soon as you applied power, as if the torque on the front wheel was causing the entire vehicle to lever over the front, and putting extra weight on the back had no effect.

The depth in the build screen is frustrating. When you take a piece off of one of your vehicles when looking at it from the front or back, it will suddenly end up on the other side of the vehicle. Lining up pieces is just frustrating. Depth perception within the build screen is all messed up, it is like building with one eye open. It is difficult to line up pieces with the popup menus, I accidentally push menu buttons constantly while building. You can guide pieces with WASD, but it is difficult because the direction the pieces move is based on where your camera is pointing in the build screen. The camera controls in this game are odd. While driving, flying, etc., if you want a free floating camera you need to hold down the right mouse button... It would be better in my opinion if you could just completely control the direction of the camera with the mouse. Otherwise, it is a following camera that is stuck to the rear of your vehicle. The camera moves with you, but it is sluggish at best. You can not control the brightness in this game and you can not map your mouse and keyboard controls for this game. Building in direct ""sunlight"" is impossible. You can not see where to line up your pieces. I have had to adjust the color of my pieces so I am able to see what I am doing. The same goes for building in the dark, too dark to see. I have had several bugs as well with the explosive power cores not resetting after an attempt to gather them. The explosive power cores will float in mid air, and behave just like the NPC flying mob that drops coins when you approach them with your vehicle. You then will have to chase the power core until it drops out of the sky. A very annoying bug. Flying in this game is a hassle, either with a plane or a helicopter, the physics are weird. I am not even going to get into that... If these problems were to be addressed I would highly enjoy this game.

Let's start with:

1. Bugs/glitches

This is a physics game, so it is expected to have bugs, but it's not the bugs that are the problem, it's the developers not caring about those bugs, sure they made a reddit post asking for bugs, yet they fixed only a few but they claim the game is finished(?) while it has even a high amount of bugs for a physics game, they fixed a few bugs, but with new updates they're adding more bugs than they fix, so lets get to the next part:

2. Extremely low quality dlc's (half-assed dlc's/updates just for quick bucks)

I'm fine with the game having dlc's, even 6 dlc's, but the quality of those dlc's, or even quantity of stuff you get is the issue, with the new update (decals) it comes with 2 dlc's, they're cheap, but having to pay for over half of the update which you get only a few free things is outrageous, if it continues like this, then the people who don't buy dlc's are gonna have very little new content from updates, and let's talk about the high seas dlc, some may like it while some don't, it's subjective but I don't like it, I feel like the devs half-assed the dlc, you start like a sandbox with all the parts already, and same as stranded in space you just go collecting different shaped things (rocks?) to the salvage things, they did a weird thing between sandbox and campaign, I don't like it, both parts were poorly executed.

3. Devs barely listen to the community

So many good suggestions go to the reddit and trello, yet almost nothing good the community wants is actually implemented, more offensive armament for more fun in multiplayer? nope. laser pointers? nah. custom spawn points? never. building together? not happening. better shield mechanics? also no. propellers powered by engines? you know it, hell no.

Now that's a lot of cons, but nonetheless with all the bugs, half-assed updates/dlc's, devs almost ignoring the community suggestions, terribly executed ideas, i still can't help but to play this game, it is playable and i love the creativity you can do here, it's still VERY fun, If you love creativity/building games, BUY IT, you won't regret it, I played it for so much and it is the best game I've played, next to Warthunder that is, but i recommend it.


If some of these issues were fixed, i could (and would) put in 3,000 hours to this game.


TLDR:  half-assed updates/dlc's, developers don't listen to community, terribly executed ideas, but still immensely fun nonetheless, you can do so much here, if you like building, BUY IT, you won't regret buying it.

Only thing missing i feel is mod support for custom maps as the one's in game are a little small, even the longest tracks can be ironed out to under 40 seconds. 
Me and my friends would love long distance endurance races.

While later would like to change my review a bit.

Still recommend this game but it seems the dev team are focusing on cosmetics for the game rather than playable content, maps or new parts. They did just have one big update last year but since then they've added paint and decals of all things. Not sure what the rest of the community are asking for but to me that seems like a waste of time. 

What me and my friends would like is larger race tracks since all the available ones in the base game are like 30-50 seconds per lap once you figure out how to build good cars. So some much larger more challenging tracks would be amazing.",1611726270,1662802031,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And the gameplay loop (for career), is going from place a to place b, and pushing heavy rocks so you can build a better bulldozer, for many hours. It gets immensely boring and repetitive.

If you look in the MSN store for the rating of this game you will find that it was not playable for months for many players. 
For Game Pass players and those who bought it there.

So they took Microsoft's money and no matter if Microsoft is to blame/partly to blame, there was no way for a solution/warning to the players.

The campaign is ""here's a world full of stuff, find stuff to make stuff to get access to more stuff"" and doesn't really care if you make a lopsided janky doodadmobile to wiggle a part out of place so you can get better access to it with something that works better, or slapping a stick on the end of a plane so you can whack a scrap part off a tower of rocks as you zip by. No rules or anything, so it's just a matter of aimlessly wandering from part to part until you've found everything and you get to watch a low-res cutscene.
Basically the goal here is getting parts to get more parts so you can get more parts until you have them all.
Also, a lot of the parts aren't particularly useful, like racing tires when there's no roads, most of the engines when you can get the best one pretty easily, guns when there's no enemies, plane parts when helicopters are needed 100x more for carrying cargo, etc.

The sandbox modes are all summarized as ""here, you have everything, go diddle around the map until you get bored, and a lot of ""make your own fun"" stuff like an arena that you and another player could maybe fight in, or a big slapping piston thing that smashes your vehicle because ???, or little challenges you can do to earn coins used to buy cosmetic stuff.

The other modes are race modes, where you're locked down to a limited number of parts and have to do little races using what little you've got, or you can spend those cosmetic coins to unlock some of the parts back for aerodynamics or whatever, but honestly you're just racing to earn parts you probably already got in the campaign so you can do better races and unlock of your parts again, but the racing mode is held back a bit by how janky the physics are in the game, and especially by the lack of a center of mass visibility toggle.

Overall, I guess the best I can say is that the game's a cool sandbox, but that's really all it is, IMO. Wouldn't recommend it at full price, and probably wouldn't recommend buying any of the DLC (the High Seas DLC is just another sandbox, but with more water and wind physics, and some ship parts you probably wont use outside the mode.)",1662765350,1662765350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you get to a point were you¬¥re building serious stuff the lack of optimisation, glitches and janky buiding and physics just sucks all the fun out. It feels halfassed. In a good physics sandbox every new part feels like a real present and you can¬¥t wait to try what you can do with it, in this game it just feels like you¬¥re fighting the physics to get it to work halfway decent. It gets very old after a few hours when literally everything new you build that isn¬¥t a basic car or boat is a wonky mess to use. The build menu, which is pretty important in a game like this, is a PITA with inconsistent snap, glitchy mirror mode and bugged error markers.

What seals the deal for me is that instead of some optimisation, quality of life improvements and a bit of love for the game, we get stale microtransactions that should have been unlockables.

[b] TL;DR [/b] - Great game, bad ""Decals"" update.

I purchased this game for my son, and he's loved it, playing nearly every day.
The game allows for many hours of tinkering and exploring.
The Lost In Space chapter of the game is particularly good and makes you stretch your imagination.
[b] Here's the warning: [/b]
Trailmakers released a ""Decals Update,"" which was great for about 10 minutes.
As soon as my son found the locked decals (a DLC we would have to purchase), he immediately wanted to buy it.
If my son didn't love this game so much, I would be uninstalling the game.

There is quit a lot shapes, vehicles, and mechanisms you can make with just blocks (objects inside a six sided cube/rectangle, size dependent)! You can must of your fantastical designs. For all that, the meta for fast cars, boats, and aircraft is well established (it dose variate between the three).    

The power system (showing how much power a propulsion-tech/motor has) is odd and not fallowed though for all systems, but it would be hard to implement a accurate system in for such a creative game.

Now in to the negatives. Trailmakers is a fun game to even when avoiding the, moderately excepted exploits/glitches. The game braking/stopping glitches can seen when stressing the systems, other wise the game runs fine.

There are two main glitches, the inverted hover-pad simulated ground proximity engine (known as the ufo engine or hover-pad glitch) and the detachable aerodynamics/drag (known as the 0-drag glitch).

Some failing's of the game are the spoiler's (rear wing), aerodynamic display (at the low-drag/slippery end), number accuracy (decimal places), and the two cosmetic blocks that fall out of the fair range.
The in-game rear-wing (spoiler) gains it's activeness from the open space (the eight 1x1x1-cubes) above it's surface, not the front or rear section. 
The aerodynamic display is based off the color and speed of on coming arrows, at low drag (green in color) the arrows are moving at speed with only slight variation. 
The accuracy is only up to one decimal place (10th's), advanced settings for this would be nice. 
The 1x2-Chrome-bumper and 1x2- chrome-bumper-detail have three plains of contact with at least one point, this with no drag allows increased size without the penalty of drag.",1660909589,1660909589,True,18,3,0.645652949810028076,7,True,False,False

--( MECHANICS )--
In general, it's incredibly put together while also not being too complex. It easily appeals to players both looking for a simple experience to drive around cars and pilot planes, along with people looking for a way to express their creativity through the amazing building mechanics the game has to offer.

--( GENERAL QUALITY )--
The quality is definitely a point worth making. The game is really high quality for the price tag, with really accurate physics (bugs do still happen on occasion) along with good quality graphics that make it both a good game to play and a good game to enjoy the occasionally breathtaking views (although I rarely do that).

--( ENTERTAINMENT )--
The game is generally fun in most cases. Honestly, whether you want to build, drive, or just chill out with friends the game has these capabilities easily accessed. The tutorial effectively and quickly teaches base mechanics, the workshop allows people to gather both inspiration and fun vehicles to drive and test out, the campaign allows a way to challenge players to think like an engineer and solve problems to get the next piece of the spaceship or a new item to use for transport, and the ability to host servers and configure the settings to your liking makes it easy to set up a way to play with friends and other players alike.

--( CONCLUSION )--
In all ways, this game is built incredibly well and made with multiple kinds of players in mind - whether it be competitive players racing to get the best score on Race island, creative players working to build amazing creations to share with the world, players looking to get inspiration and entertainment from other's creativity, players looking for every Easter egg and looking to complete every achievement for a 100% completion of the game, and more put in this incredibly amazing game that appeals to more than just players with an engineering mindset.",1660765008,1660765008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game for creating and engineering unique creations that can perform nearly any task! PvP with stuff you build is awesome, such as a demolition derby, a dogfight, or a tank battle! Highly recommended if you like physics sandboxes and building games.

There a tons of glitches in this game, BUT they make it far more fun to play. Many of them can be utilized to make OP weapons or super fast vehicles. Still love the game after over 1300 hours :)

Update: The game is still great. However, I do wish the devs would listen a bit more to tester and community feedback. I assume that they probably cater to console since it is their largest source of players. It would also be nice to get some new blocks a bit more often, but I guess the main focus of development right now is quality-of-life and aesthetics. Still, highly recommend the game.

The building process is easy to learn and the amount of freedom with keybinds makes creations very fun to drive. The game also has a great style and mechs look great. The physics is great in this game and makes it so satisfying transitioning from land to sea to the air. By far my favorite thing about this game is being able to live your best Transformer life. Switching between vehicles looks so great and feels so sick. If you're a creative and love sharing/interacting with a community then you'll have a great time with this game.

Now to get into my gripes with the game. I loved the building in the game but it felt a little aimless. For me I am not that big on building things just to show others. There is a 'story' mode that gives you objectives to achieve but the challenges weren't all that hard. You can pretty much collect every scrap ball if you make a drone. There are some small physics issues that I have found but those are not game ending. 

Overall the game has a great look and feel but I kind of wish there was more to do in it.",1658967231,1658967231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Singleplayer story is okay.
3. Crashes very often even years after release (1-3 times a day).
4. Performance on multiplayer is bad (Very much laggs, low FPS and more).
5. You disconnect for no reason from servers all the time (2-9 times a day).
6. Physics are bad programmed, buggy and not very realistic.
7. WAY TO LESS blocks for building so you cant be that creative at all.
8. Some bugs are known since years and they dont get fixed. Instead they release new 
    blocks which are 99% useless and you have to pay for it. If you want more realistic water 
    physics you have to pay because they made new water physics 
    but only for one exclusive map and all other maps with water still have the old physics. And 
    the new physics only has waves nothing more is new on the new water.

9. Idk why but i love this game even if it makes me hate it.

And im sorry, your not gonna stick around and play this game for long if your not doing multiplayer as thats where the fun is, mostly.

And might i add, i always check for file integrity, i dont run mods that can crash the game, most if not all my creations are fairly basic. my specs are well above the mark for playing this game.

My only complaint that I can think of as of writing this is the they don't have a 1x1x1 block, that's really my only building complaint. The big reason why I give this game a negative review is that using your creation is a pain in the a**. If you want to make anything that shoots and is on a turret the controls are a nightmare. The Dev's never added a mouse control to the game so you'll have to get by with mapping the turret controls to weird places like... Left and right would be mapped to Q and E then up and down would be mapped to X and C or something along those lines, truly a pain in the a**. Another small thing that the Dev's could add is that the creation will move to the direction where the mouse it pointed. That's really the only reason why I do not recommend this game to be honest, all the other issues are not really that bad.",1653598289,1653598289,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
