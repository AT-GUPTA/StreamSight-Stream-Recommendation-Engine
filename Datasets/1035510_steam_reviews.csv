It's cool though, tower defence games are usually single player anyways. The carnival map though makes no sense to be dlc when it doesnt add anything but a single map, no guns or anything special, might as well bundle it with a increased xp modifier or something.
Played it some more hours, mainly in single player cause Carnival is such a good map but its dlc so nobody ever plays it online. Anyways not talking about the dlc here, the game itself is functional for a basic defence game. It's fun but all I am saying here is that we need some options for the modes besides difficulty. Such as +25% earned money or less explosive damage cause y'know, any bomber will smack your walls to the point the cheaper walls are better. Or the spitters do 1 attack and your sentry is dead.

A solid entry into the top-down, tower defense, zombie shooter genre. It's at a decent price-point, but it is map-lite so a sale price (usually around 35% off) may be preferable. 

The graphics are good, the controls pretty simple, and the upgrades to both base and character (of which there are several classes to choose from) keep it interesting and to be able to mold your characters and base to your preferred play style. I also appreciate that solo play is off-line; always appreciated!

I don't have too much to say about this in the negative sense other than the map-lite content. They're small-ish, and there aren't that many, so replay value declines as the maps become routine.

Graphics are sharp and feel modern. Sounds are perfect with authentic weapon sound-effects, while bullets pierce anything they hit in a very realistic manner. And no stupid zombies constant 'vomiting' noises, like too many other zombie games!
The game here is not about running all over the place like a chicken-with-no-head while trying to shoot as many undead as you can. But rather to entrench yourself in the right spot and build you (very) temporary 'fortress' while trying to survive to as many waves as you can. 
In that sense, it really has a Tower Defense feel, and that's probably why I enjoy it so much!
The weapons and build items selection is generous and varied enough. Upgrades work as planned AND [spoiler] you even have boring music in the shopping mall elevator [/spoiler] lol!

A nice handful of interesting maps and a decent choice of options when it comes to building bases, with a nice selection of guns which can all be upgraded across multiple tiers. There's a large variety of enemies, basically similar to what you'd find in L4D and keeps you busy/moving as you improve after each defeat, coming to terms with your own strategies across the maps. Personally found the mall map on the second floor in the corner interesting, utilising the space, corners and corridors.

Although the game is a bit unbalanced, there's a boss every 10 rounds or so, and usually multiply, so by 30, you're facing 3 big bosses of which one splits into more and more when it gets downed, and the other just rinses through base builds so your defences become obsolete. By round 30, our weapons were maxed and there wasn't much else to improve, so your capability of continuing the game stagnates with the almost ridiculous overpowered enemies/bosses. Also small things like, you can buy an ammo box for 500 but sell it before it gets depleted for like 325?

5. Towers useless vs bosses at wave 40
6. No use for skill points after you cap
7. No way to upgrade traps.

Examples would be the ability to start at certain waves with a budget. More boss variety is going to be critical. (Side note- bosses need better balance. Souplex is absurd, especially in phases with 3 or more bosses.) Give the players 1-2 abilities as well. Think a potion slot (HP, Movement speed, invuln, damage increase) and a thrown item. Thrown item would be grenades, flares, molotovs, whatever. Lastly, the opening curve needs some work. I will say the first hour or two of the game felt very punishing, because you have to grind your class trait right away, and classes change dramatically once they get their key traits. I would say open with the unique trait unlocked and fill out the trees as your progression. Lastly, PLEASE give the ability to build mid-wave. Would go a very long way in the way an overall wave feels from start to finish.

Overall though, I'm really enjoying the game and looking forward to them iterating on the experience.

- Leveling and skill tree upgrades should start at zero each game and occur after every wave

- There should be active skills, especially some to combat the bosses other than ""30% extra damage to bosses.""

- Add building upgrade research during a match, e.g. rate of fire, damage, range, special ability, etc. for all buildings of that type.  This is to help them be less obsolete after level 40.
- Co-op is more punishing than helpful, because you have to split a fixed budget with them.  For every person that joins your group, the amount of money and experience from each kill should increase a certain %, i.e. two people increases everything 25%, three people 60%, and four people 100%.

A couple cons tho, bullet phasing seems to be an issue, tho it has been addressed and noted for fixing in patch notes, 
Lord Supex (lord Suplex) can split between your walls and force you into a one sided fight. His smaller forms are impossible to run away from, even worse if you to run and gun. His hitboxes are crazy being able to hit in a diagonal attack half the bridge away it feels. His attacks knock you up/back but when there are multiple smalls of him they can perma CC you, which can instantly end a game at round 10. 

round 40 seems to be the wave to beat. Nearly 100 hours into the game now and 40 is my highest round on a map that isn't the mall (because you can manipulate zombie aggro pathing to form major kill zones. Almost to the point of never needing to fire a shot.) Weapons fall off super fast, fully upgraded auto shotgun falls off around wave 30 and deals minimal dmg to bosses, and thats every weapon, especially Sentry turrets and teslas...what good are max lvl Engineer turrets if they fall off way too early? 

The Heavy seems to be the worst class, almost as if it was rushed because they needed a 4th for diversity. Medic and Specialist share several skills the heavy has and the Beserk ability is borderline useless unless you activate it simply from letting acid spitters shoot at you. In a dire situation, you die before you get more than 10 shots off while below 20hp, especially on Hard/Expert when a suicide bomber zombie can completely destroy your fresh armor in one explosion. Medic has the advantage of gaining extra income from allies killing zombies and invulnerability for any ally at low hp, specialist gets massive boosts to special weapon dmg and increased money income, and the engineer gets a 20% discount on defenses and repairs also a drone that follows you that only does damage in the first couple waves. 

NEED MORE BASE DEFENSES, the laser fence was fun before the rollback and very very broken, but as mentioned earlier teslas and sentries fall off super fast, even with the 50% increased dmg from the engineer. so something that doesnt fall off super fast that also doesn't cost $50K. Bloaters and Suicide bombers deal extreme dmg to buildings almost to the point of one shotting the sandbags that have the most hp among base defenses. 
Something like a gun tower that doesnt need to be reset every couple minutes like sentries do. 

Other than that I highly recommend this game, and have bought this game for 3 people so we can play. It's fun, It has become my boredom just passing the time game. Super excited to see it as it developes.

  - you get money by killing zombies and surviving waves
  - in between waves you purchase structures (such walls or defensive towers) and guns/gun upgrades

It's not a groundbreaking game concept, but this game implements it well. 

This game has one big drawback though.  The multiplayer is broken. Often times a multiplayer game will sorta freeze. You can run around, you can shoot things. But nothing dies and the sprites get stuck in endless move animations (without going anywhere). At this point, you cannot progress and the game is pretty much over.

Graphics:
They're alright. Its nothing to give an award for, but it isn't ugly.

Story:
A few lines of text.

Gameplay:
Really fun. I played with 2 of my friends and we had a blast for about 3 hours.
Really, You should get this game. Its amazing for the price right now.

Audience:
If you're above 9 years old, you'll be more than fine.

Spec Requirements:
I have an i7 intel core and a 660TI and can run it on ""Ultra"" graphics and 60 frames.
If you have a broken floor tile you can run  this game.

Negatives:
- AI can be really stupid sometimes.

 You'll be based up (No doors so you cant leave your walls,) and there will be one more zombie left. Sadly, hes across the map, one of the slow ones, and hitting a wall you forgot to sell from the ruins of your old base.

- I've seen this in other reviews, the hit-boxes in this game are very strange. Sometimes they just phase through the zombies.

- You can essentially become immortal on the mall map.

Final notes:
- This game is 4 dollars. (As of writing) Regardless of bugs, you will almost 100% get your money's worth out of this game.

Graphics are acceptable, though map details are often lacking (the mall in particular).  Documentation is limited, but the majority of buildings/powers have sufficient mouse-overs to make the game enjoyable without any meaningful experience.

Hit boxes/accuracy are highly questionable -- both for dealing damage to enemies and for enemies striking your character.

Character movement is viable, but seems somewhat ""clunky"" -- specifically when sprinting in a forward facing direction there seems to be some delay in the change to your speed.

Online play seems to be limited to friends, where in public (non-passworded games) seem to result in hosts automatically kicking anyone who joins (if one wanted a private game why not use the password feature??). As such, the quality of the community remains questionable as of this review.

With that said I've found that trying to build a base, and building in general really, is not nearly as effective as kiting.

I can see why they've done things this way but in my opinion it could use a bit of tweaking, especially when playing solo.

Suggestions
Turrets/Traps need not disappear or break, Costly to replace.

Damn this game got potential to become an epic zombie shooter.
Boss at wave 10 (maybe every 10 waves?), because man....on wave 10 i got a boss. and he was huge, fat and scary.
nice variaty of zombie types, i saw around 8 or 9 difrent so far (incl boss)

cons:
You get your health refreshed after each wave, but not your ammo.(would love an ammo refresh too)
Level is to dark. (only 1 level atm)
Aiming is a bit off sometimes, as if you shoot through them.
Not my music style, i dont like metal lol 

Conclusion
It's just ‚Ç¨3 atm, i think you should get it now. 
However it is just 1 stage, so it can get's bored fast. 
I love that there are bosses in the game ( i hope it's not the same boss every 10 waves)
No big complains here, i think it's a good game.
