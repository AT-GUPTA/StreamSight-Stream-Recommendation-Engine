This is no longer the case.

Depth has been added to all aspects of the game to the extent that there are now multiple paths to victory. You can ""work"" various systems to obtain advantages that will be more or less particular to your circumstances, but all of which you will need to pay at least some attention to lest an opponent blindside you.

Which is nice, especially when you're the one who does the blindsiding of an opponent

I also appreciate that, unlike many RTS games where you essentially spam armies at an enemy, you can win by engaging in little combat but score political victories instead.

I also appreciate that the military side of the game forces you to consider terrain, and the way in which territory is captured and controlled forces you to consider choke points, how to cut an enemy off from resources, and where to set up defensive bastions to prevent the enemy from breaking into your soft economic base and killing your dudes.

It is well worth playing and is a different and interesting take on the RTS genre that keeps revealing more depth as you play.

However this game is trying way to damn hard to be too many things at once. At first it plays like a 4X but also wanting the fast pace action of a RTS, and it fails on both. 

While the game is refreshing in this attempt, by failing at both it delivers a lack luster experience. A 4X game gets the appeal that you handle a empire easily between turns. It is through it's turn based aspect that makes those grand strategy games stand out, it gives you time to handle and plan whatever you want. 

However when you force RTS into the mix, especially when combat is very weak in this game, the end result is just boring. I played only 2 hours and I was bored most of the time. What I wanted from this was a traditional 4X game like Civilization or Endless Space.

Basicly it is an advanced version of Northgard with a fairly deep political and economic layer.

Too shallow for my taste. 

I suppose I had hoped for more political intrigue and more RPG-immersion. Somehow I am missing the tension and dialectics between the familiar and the alien of the books. And the soundtrack of the movie would have been perfect for this game.

Don't get me wrong, they do get a lot of stuff right. It's pretty and if the strategy part had been one leg, immersion and intrigue being they others this game would have made it.

It lacks the pace of a RTS and the complexity of a proper 4X. If you like a cross of the two genres that is fairly true to the lore and setup of the book/movie you will enjoy what this has to offer. Certainly don't purchase this with the expectation that there is be a strong competitive online scene or a great narrative driven story. Neither exist. 

That said, the game is fun, learning how the different factions play is interesting and fun. The replay-ability is minimal and the conquest mode can feel a bit like the conquest mode of Star Wars Battlefront, It adds a fair amount of change to the game-play and is enjoyable to conquer the other factions, section by section.

If you like Dune and a lite 4X style game with a lot style and minimal replayability buy this. But I don't recommend it at the full price.

In early access I quite enjoyed it for a bit, even got 100% achievements for it (although there were not many back then). But the game got developed into this weird hybrid, they added some systems, and developed some more, but with no campgain, the game just falls flat to competition.
The rts 4x mix is a good idea, but it's also extremly difficult, and to be done well it requires great scale in my opinion. 
RTS elements here are rather minimal, it comes down to being minimal 4x, but with no turns so everything is rather slow, You can pause or set the game speed up to 2x but it is still super slow for an RTS. 
Micro in fights is non existent, either non required or stupidly easy against AI. 
In terms of 4x it has some nice ideas (stock market for CHOAM and spice management) but all the systems and options of replayability that 4X games excel at, are not present here.
3 modes of play and they are all the same tbh.Tthe promised ""campaign"" conquest mode is a bit of a joke. I get that they might not have wanted to make a story for the game, but the system is an underdeveloped Dawn of War conquest campgain from Dark Crusade. 
Age of Wonders Planetfall, stellaris, Endless Space and many other 4x space games overshadow this one greatly with complexity and replay value.

Each faction has its on flavour of play style and you really need to play to that factions strengths otherwise you will struggle to compete with another faction who will do it better.

Combat is somewhat basic but there is so much more going on all the time that I haven't felt put off by this factor in playing the game, politics, espionage, resource/land control  and to top it all off there's a shares market!

Alot of 4x games feel at times too big for me, i can only spin so many plates and control so much before the things start to slip under the radar. Dune maps are big enough to hold my attention but not too big to wield well.

There is a steep learning curve initially, wrestling your understanding to how the factions work to their strengths will take a hot minute. However once you understand 1 factions area of expertise you will quickly know what areas the others will occupy.

I recommend playing the conquest game mode, this game mode is engaging and even though you have to play each mission from scratch there are persistent bonuses from previously hard won missions and the objectives keep changing forcing you to learn/play slightly differently. (For example i had managed to go through the campaign without having to worry too much about the espionage tree but then I was given an assassination mission)

In short I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into designing this smaller scale 4x game and I look forward to seeing what the company does next. 

(P.S. please please please try and make a Babylon 5 4x game like this!!)

The AI cheats. It's insane how quick the AI can expand within the first 15 minutes and have more resources. It's horribly unbalanced and the AI always seems to team up on you which is also annoying. 

The political system is a bit random. It's hard to properly play the political game when the AI is just random gonna choose on things. I also find it hard that the Bene Gesserit barely play a role. House Escaz is such a strange choice and I would replace them with the Bene Gesserit as a playable faction.

This was pretty basic and mind numbing and punishing the first month, but its solid now.  It's much more forgiving and easier to learn now, but with plenty of details to master.  I would call it polished up and finished for release.  Of course the resources still need to be balanced, and if you're caught edge lording then some of the council resolutions or even storms could throw your economy out of whack for a month, but there's no more unrecoverable death spiral.  The punishing spice tax can be customized.  The Houses are a little more differentiated.  Some resources were made strategic, some outputs and costs were changed.  Some ridiculous exploits were removed.  The tech tree changed, the main base buildings changed, the units were all tweaked to make the Houses armies a little different.  Hegemony stages and growth were moderated.  Authority cost to annex was fixed and moderated.  Conquest mode was pretty good, a few hero units and bonus powers were added.  It's still hard to gain a victory in multiplayer because losing players quit instead of waiting for you to win, so I guess you have to sucker someone in to a surprise win in multiplayer, because it doesn't count if they quit or disconnect (that achievement is locked now and its the only one I don't have).  The houses feel more unique than they did.  The Fremen worm riding is still pretty handicapped compared to everyone else's airlift shuttles.  The Barracks is useful to customize your armies for different purposes and can be done on the fly for gold.

Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the Dune: Spice Wars universe is always one step beyond logic. The hunter does not seek dead game.

It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to play Dune: Spice Wars to be difficult. Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure.

If you rely only on your eyes in Dune: Spice Wars, your other senses weaken.

It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in Dune: Spice Wars.

Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them through Dune: Spice Wars. The price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our edge. The Proximity of a Desirable Thing Tempts One to Overindulgence. On That Path Lies Danger.

Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what's incomplete in Dune: Spice Wars and saying: 'Now, it's complete because it's ended here.

Highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new in Dune: Spice Wars.

Do you wrestle with dreams?
Do you contend with shadows?

It's both a challenging, stimulating experience and a pleasure to get to grips with; the interface is designed to enable the player to make best use of an initially bewildering array of tools which becomes easier to use with practice.  The AI players can be configured to present formidable opposition, or a relatively smooth ride if you're looking to gain understanding of how to play.

To succeed in the game, you'll need to balance both military, economic and political factors whilst being quick to adjust to sudden developments, taking advantage of opportunities and cutting losses where necessary.

It's a game which rewards perseverance, long-term planning and short-term flexibility, adapting to the situation as it develops.  And, of course, the development team have done a superb job of depicting Dune faithfully, with the attractively rendered but not over-elaborate graphical style, accurate characterisations of the various factions and characters, plus the interplay between many elements featured in both Frank Herbert's original novels and the current cinema adaptations.  The pulsating, evocative synth soundtrack is both atmospheric and exotic, with a pleasingly retro-futuristic ambience.

If you've played the Dune Imperium (or, for that matter Twilight Imperium) boardgame, the mechanics of the intelligence sphere and political machinations are both similar in inspiration but subtly different enough to greatly compliment the other functional aspects of gameplay.

Overall, I can't praise the game enough - it's a beautiful combination of tactical RTS and grand strategy.  Those looking for a more narrative-driven, RPG adventure exploration of Dune will doubtless miss those elements (which characterised the Mindscape/Cryo original game, before Westwood's Dune II established the subsequent association with RTS) but that's a project which will likely be developed at some point in the future; as it stands, this is a splendid title with which to bring this venerable IP back into the gaming spotlight.",1703544576,1703678954,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
1605220,154517728,76561198100140983,40,6,607,0,599,1706770756,"Having invested just under 10 hours into Dune: The Spice Wars, I can confidently express that the game is exceptionally raw. Throughout my 9-hour playtime, I failed to achieve success either economically or through any other means, even while playing on the lowest difficulty level. The computer’s behavior is perplexing, and the game exhibits occasional glitches, including erratic behavior from harvesters and inexplicable resource collection issues. In essence, the game feels underdeveloped and could be described as a civilization-building experience set in the Dune universe that falls short. I hope the developers address these issues, but as it stands, the product is unplayable in its current state.
Additionally, the introduction of an unclear fourth faction raises questions, as there is no mention of such a race in the original Dune lore spanning the first three books. From an RTS perspective, the available units are insufficient. The tech tree, especially in terms of mechanization, appears comically limited, with the ability to order only one flying unit that lacks clarity regarding its damage output and role. The mechanization line seems underdeveloped. Training in the game is poorly executed, as the tutorial material provided is nowhere near sufficient for what you actually need to know to play comfortably. The tutorial should be at least 2-3 times more extensive given the complexity of the game. Without prior RTS experience, navigating this game becomes a formidable challenge.
Furthermore, crucial aspects of the Dune lore are overlooked, such as the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and their influence on rulers in Dune’s political hierarchy. The absence of units representing the Spacing Guild is a notable omission, given its significant role in the first three books. Units like the Tleilaxu, representing the political importance of the Spacing Guild, are missing. The lack of representation for the Trade Federation is also a poor implementation. Even the planet Dune itself, while understandably barren, could have incorporated elements from the third book, like the mysterious creatures that were meant to kill the children of Dune. The iconic sandworms, central to the concept of the Fremen and their relationship with water, are poorly realized. The Fremen implementation, including the Sardaukar, feels absent, and it seems like the lore was distorted. It appears as if the developer skimmed through the first 15 pages of the book, thinking they grasped the essence, and created a superficial game that falls short. Having read the books, I must say, it’s not worth purchasing.

However I feel the mix of militiary, economy, diplomacy, and espionage aspects of the game overcame it and I ended up completing 3 out of 4 campaigns, iwth only ecaz left in progress.  Note I have not really played the skirmish or online modes so dont have a opinion on those modes.

So why is it a maybe with the thumbs down?  Well the game went through a major overhaul of its mechanics as it went from early access to 1.0, I accepted this as early access is not the gold product, however from 1.0 forwards I expected (as I do from all games I play) for the single player experience to remain consistent from that point forward, bug fixes are ok, exploit fixes are ok, enhancements are ok.  However personally I think overhauling the game again after its gone gold isnt acceptable practice unless a option is in the game to continue progress on the old mechanics.  As the last two community patches have been rolled out, they will impact any conquest in progress, so you play the game, save, go to bed.  Next day download the updates, reload save, now you playing a different game.  So sadly My review is now what it is.  As this game feels like a beta, there is no now confidence in the developer that the game is on a stable platform moving forward, how do I know as a player they wont overhaul everything again in future?

If they fix the issue at hand, such as adding a legacy conquest option to continue a conquest on 1.0.3 gameplay, then I will change my review, but until then it is what it is and I feel those with the same principles as me need to be forewarned.",1703251659,1703251659,False,6,3,0.481882214546203613,0,True,False,False

For an RTS this game is very basic and lacks options. Each faction only has a handful of units. The research trees are extremely small and largely uninteresting. It feels like the differences in factions are negligible. 

Combat is not interesting to watch, which is obviously really weird for an RTS. I think it's because 1. The animations are pretty boring, 2. The units don't engage individuals within the units, like in Dawn of War. It's just the entire unit swinging in formation while the other unit stands there concretely and does the same. And 3., the units can clip through other units, so it's very clustery sometimes.

Overall, the the game is unique (sorta) in that it has multiple victory conditions. Within the first 5 hours of gameplay, I found it a bit confusing how to reach those different victory conditions.

The game plays like an RTS but with a bit of a stellaris infusion.

The combat is mediocre, and its hard to know what units counter which units. There are a lot of stats to read and mostly I was too lazy to figure it all out. The rock paper scissors of unit interaction is not obvious. I also find it a bit annoying that everything has a pretty oppressive upkeep cost; I find it bogs down gameplay a bit.

The other thing that irked me was the Landsraad; this 'council' that happened every so often and you had to vote on certain things. I had no idea how to use it and the prompts that spammed my screen every 3-5 minutes and paused gameplay became frankly annoying.

If you can get past those limitations, and you're willing to spend some time studying the game, you may find it rewarding, but it does not strike me as a game that you can jump into and play right away. I'd probably need to watch a youtube video to orient myself on some of the core functionality to get the most out of my gameplay experience.

Have never played a game that captures the 'chess like feel' of the aspects of Dune the books.
From engaging in assassinations between great houses, or vying over position and charters in the Landstraad, or being sneaky with your spies and pushy with your military in more traditional domination approaches, the game is quite rewarding and has a high level of rewarding granularity.
Everything you can choose feels meaningful, and each faction has their own unique strategies and approaches to the game.
The variety that the various advisors bring, and the various methods you have open to you for developing and customizing your faction per gameplay provides ample room to play around and explore as well as enough structure that you don't feel completely lost.
Games are long enough to enjoy but not too long you can't finish in one sitting.

Biggest downside for me was lack of clarity in tool tips and having a hard time finding some status data, such as my relationship, with other factions until I realized the GUI uses symbols without tool tips explaining what the symbols mean. Hopefully that gets fixed in a future update.

I enjoy this game, both Single Player and Multiplayer.

10/10 as TBS Grand Strategy goes, definitely captures the books, the original games charm, and brings it all together with an increasingly masterful execution.

Some consider this game an RTS, but it is in the same way that Europa Universalis 4 is an RTS - it isn't.  You don't affect the speed of the game in RTS to make adjustments to your units and you will certainly abuse the pause button in singleplayer if only to hit that ""Recall"" button on your harvester before a Sandworm gobbles it up.  

This game is more akin to grand strategies like EU4 but with individual units instead of armies (like in Company of Heroes or Iron Harvest).  I like to say it feels like Humankind/EU4/Endless Space/Stellaris/CompanyOfHeroes somehow took a component from each of themselves and put it in this game.

Each of the 4 factions have unique abilities and unique units. I have yet to play anything but Atreides so forgive my lack of depth, but I feel that they're pretty well balanced.  Units all have specific roles and abilities that you can also buy add-ons to improve their abilities for a cost (like less armor for more damage, damage reduction for less armor, more attack for more upkeep, etc.).  And since you're limited to a # of slots for each unit type + a decent selection of potential upgrades, you can really tailor them to your needs.  Units are controlled RTS-style and combat is pretty simple in the sense that you right-click and units attack, although you'll quickly learn the need to have a good income to be able to fly your troops around to avoid hotspots.  And that unit management is pretty important as ""Manpower"" is a resource for building units, assigning crews to harvesters, as well as regenerating unit health.

Map gameplay is more akin to Company of Heroes/Eu4.  There can be about 3-dozen or so regions (at least in the 'campaign mode' maps I'm playing in) in a 4-faction FFA.  Each region can have a village and a resource, 2 quirks that give a little bonus for certain buildings, and potentially a ""special region"" attribute that gives that region a unique bonus.  Some buildings can only be built after you get certain resources; some buildings can only be built in regions with a specific resource.  Max # of buildings (at least for Atreides) is 5 buildings a region.  And there are lot of buildings to choose from.  However, you can't just ""conquer"" a region.  You have to spend ""Authority"", a resource you gain over time.  Regions become more expensive depending on a number of factors (distance from capital, if there's a sietch, # you already own, etc.)  You can pillage or even liberate regions from other factions (no cost), so it's not like you can't affect other factions.  It's an interesting mechanic that I certainly enjoy.

There is an economic system setup around Spice, although in some game modes where Spice is disabled, it is replaced with another resource.  A portion of your resource generation is traded for gold, while the rest you must hoard for taxes (in the case of spice production).  You can adjust this as necessary and so far, I haven't had an issue managing it.  It's a mechanic to fuel growth and expansion and eventually, conflict, as the ""spice tax"" increases after each tax.  The resources you must manage are Gold(Upkeep for everything/Use to purchase ""Stocks"", a mechanic I can't quite explain well here), Plastcrete (used for buildings), Manpower (Units/Harvesters), Fuel Cells (Mechanical units/Unique buildings), Water (Building Upkeep/Range units can travel outside of your territory before they start dying), Authority (Region Annexation), Landsraad Standing (Political standing overall), Guild Favor (Spaceships).

Which leads us to the political system.  Every so often, a council is held and you spend Votes & Influence.  All factions get 100 votes and whatever Influence you have, you spend 10 votes/influence at a time on 3 different propositions.  You can split your votes however you like and they can provide bonuses, elect factions to certain council positions, or give debuffs to factions.  Propositions that you vote for and succeed increase your Landsraad standing.  Which gives you bonsues.

There's an espionage mechanic where you can utilize agents to spy on other factions, increase your production of specific resources, setup ""missions"" which are abilities that you can apply to regions on the map, or if you get your information level high enough in a faction, attempt an assassination that would take out the faction. This takes time and money and at some point will get detected.  This will determine whether it is worth continuing the plot or not as the longer you attempt to complete it, the easier its for the targeted faction to mitigate progress to 0%.  Assassin units can help, though.

All in all, I'm enjoying the game a lot.  I recommend playing the tutorial, and I certainly recommend playing on Easy to get a better understanding of all the game has to offer.",1702999577,1702999577,True,3,0,0.526584088802337646,0,True,False,False

You have to jump in and guess at what the heck is going on. This is actually WORSE than Civ 6 for it's introduction to the game; Civ 6's tutorial hand-holds you through a point-and-click scenario that covers the barest of the barebones of the game (doesn't even cover city management)... meanwhile [i]THIS GAME[/i] DOESN'T EVEN HAVE [i]THAT[/i] MUCH! They literally just call the first [b]normal game[/b] you start a ""Tutorial"" and don't actually tell you jack sh!t about what you need to do or how to do it (not even a simple tour of the UI or the controls). 

Bad tutorials drive away new players, and with dwindling interest as time goes on (happens for all games, no matter what, and happens faster with more complex games) you need new players to [u]WANT[/u] to stay if you want the game to have any longevity. New players don't want to play a game they can't figure out, there's other options for them out there and they'll take those instead of this (and for any gatekeeping elitist types who think ""we don't need or want them"", go shove your head in the sand; you're shortsighted idiocy is more useful as food for the sandworms). 
I will clarify that [u]becoming [i]better[/i] at the game[/u] is one thing (learning alternate strategies, build orders, what to prioritise, refining and polishing your skills, etc.), but [b]LEARNING TO PLAY IN THE FIRST PLACE[/b] shouldn't be stressful, frustrating, or confusing; it should be straightforward, engaging and informative and should leave the player with enough of a foundation of knowledge that they can play on their own... And you should be able to do it [b]without[/b] having to leave the confines of the game (so being forced to turn to the community or having to read a player manual are also bad tutorials). 
There is a ""Tutorial tips"" toggle in the settings (it's ON by default). But that isn't a tutorial, and it's not even a very good system; they're not very noticeable, not informative, and don't happen very often at all during a game. So that's moot.

What makes this even worse is that Shiro Games' previous title, ""Northguard"", [b]does actually have a proper tutorial system[/b] (I've played it). So I know that [i]they know better[/i] than this, and that [i]they can do better[/i] than this.

I love Dune, and I'm sure that I'll [i]eventually[/i] get a ton of enjoyment out of this game (it really is an ingenious mix of two of my favourite gametypes), but on principal I REFUSE to give this a positive vote until they address this complete lack of a proper tutorial.",1702686038,1702686823,False,7,3,0.519337356090545654,0,True,False,False

Pros?
the game round prep is very nice with the Main Faction/House  selection + 2 officers/advisors (some you might remember for the movie) This helps define your play-style with those passive perks towards offense or defense styles. this scratches that RTS itch in a fresh game. Love the troops, ground/air mix is sweet. The worms keep your resource harvesting always a thing you have to keep an eye on. Is it worth being greedy to get the spice or play it safe and keep your crew protected?

Cons?
mostly visual minor stuffs lol. I do wish certain villages/cities were more defined with more buildings though, would love to see a population growth similar to Civ-style games. Wish they added more units per group, would love to see bigger battles with troop numbers. But that might just be my own biased opinion lol.

I normally don’t rate Early access games, but this one deserves to be rated accordingly.

 For being early access is still complex, and fun. This game is challenging which I welcome, I am tired of numbed down games like Warhammer 3. This game You could be winning then suddenly you could lose when you were not paying attention some faction activated one of 5 victory conditions.

 You army maybe battling a inferior foe but then a Sandword eats half of your army and then your enemy pushed through and wins, or your city maybe saved when invading army gets eaten by a sandworm. This very realistic but random events keep the game interesting now with each update the game keeps getting more and more interesting the Air and Sand update was the most impressive so far it added 2 Air unit for each faction each has It unique bonuses that reflect the faction.

 Only complain was I would like Tutorial that explain thoroughly because one of the things that put me off at first was that I was confused on what to do. Since there are many resources, one has to keep watch of, Water, Population, Gold, Spice, Battery, Intel, Influence, Plascrete etc once I got them down the game was easy for me.

 I like how they are with each update diversifying each faction, while they play similarly, they have different tech, unit bonuses etc. the last update added and NPC faction that keeps you on your toes, the Renegades. They invade randomly and attack in force, keeping things interesting.

The reason why I recommend this game the most is that the developed Northgard, and that game has only gotten better with time, they keep releasing content for their games even after years. I know this game will keep on getting better with time.

My imagination was sparked with wonderful and kind of mystic sci-fi world building. This game does the series justice much more than I expected. I found Northgaard (from the same studio) a bit frustrating and tedious so I thought it might be like that, but once I got past the learning curve of Dune Spice Wars, it turned out to be a very refined and intricate game with all the mechanics and considerations of the Dune Universe that I’d always wanted. It was complicated at first and I disliked it for that reason, but after I learned the game, I saw the beauty in it. It is much different than the early 2000's Dune RTS game, so don't expect that.
The factions all have unique abilities and units, so it doesn’t feel so redundant and stale like Sid Meier’s Civilization where most of the units fail to be distinguishable, unique to each civilization, or lack believable charm to me. The aesthetics of this game really gives me hope for the Dune adaptations in general (now I wish there was a Soulsborne Dune). I wish this game had been around back when I was reading the Frank Herbert novels, but I am happy that it exists now. I’d much rather spend hours playing this than civilization 6. The AI in this game might be more difficult than Civilization though. One things I wish there was more of in Dune Spice Wars would be some nice lore of digital illustrations or cinematics when you build a unique structure or unlock a new knowledge point. Paradox games does that a bit better than Shiro. It absolutely would be better if they included a story mode too. It loses some points for not being quite complete, though they’ve added a few things since early access. Admittedly, it loses more points for having a few very goofy looking character faction leaders (like House of Ecaz). There’s still room for improvement. Hopefully the developers will continue adding things. 

Note: To be far, there are also things that are far too vaguely explained by the game, such as Assassinations. I didn't realize for the longest time, that you need to sacrifice the actual unit assassin into a city that you've infiltrated to reset the percentage to assassination completion after your assassination attempt has been discovered.

Early game and learning is quite fun.

Con's
After you get through the early game everything slows down and I'm a guy who loves games like civ on marathon.  The problem here is everything is slow, and repetitive and tedious for no reason.

Too many currencies are needed for building and upkeep.  It is really punishing for any sort of expansionist ideal.  Also the currencies are so inter-connected that your always struggling to keep them going.

Only 5 unit types really.  No armour, no flying machines.  Scouts that are useless once the map is explored.  And good luck trying to get any number of units because that ain't happening, which means that if you do expand, you're constantly moving units, very slowly, back and forth to defend from the indigenous raids or attacks.  Well defended towns aren't worth attacking because as soon as you do, reinforcements come and another faction is attacking you across the map and you have no units to fight them.  So you build defence buildings.  But then you have too much upkeep and no resource attainment to keep it all going.

Its just repetitive, boring/not fun and my god worms aren't even a worry.

It will take alot to make this game good, overhaul it.

Edit:  I have put way more time into this game from my original review and to be honest, it's not gotten better.  Sure things have changed but this is just not a good game.  I don't know what genre they are trying to go for.  

- rts?  no city building really.  Sure there are things you build but all in all buildings arent used for anything but resource gen which makes it so 1 sided and boring.  Unit battling is more akin to live action 4x fights than anything lose to an rts.  In an rts building placement, troop positioning and movement are major, major things.  In this game, not even close to ""the devs don't know what these things are i think.""  

- 4x?  Resource management is just dumb.  Manpower is now a non factor not that far into the game it seems.  I'm afraid in saying this they will just put some more restrictive modifier on the resource so that you have to use more of your ""city"" (loose term) City building and customisation just doesn't exist.   You're main city has some variation with you being able to get most of the buildings anyways and really you only choose between a couple of different, and very negligible buffs.  I civ 6 mod that is only a skin of dune for a faction in that game is better than this whole game in any 4x category. 

- strategy?  I guess except what strategy is required when you expand to 3 territories and then you can't do nothing for 10 mins at a time because of the resource required to gain cities.  Can you imagine if the movie was like this game.  
""The emporer wants you to run arrakis because everyone is just making a mess of it.""
""Sure but can you call us in a week?  We'll have enough authority by then to do it.""  (authority is your expansion currency fyi)

The game is just a slow slog of shit mechanics that is piggy backing off of a beloved title to make money.  If they allowed returns in steam over the 2 hour mark for long games like this, you would see a massive drop in revenue and they might have to fix the game.  Unfortunately by the time 2 hours goes by you don't even know what the fuck to do still (tutorial is garbage) to even know if you will like the game or not.

I have high expectations from every work associated with the name, and I either like them or shelve them as, in true Scotsman(!) fashion, ""not really Dune"". That holds for all the mini series, and the later games which are at best low budget, or more fairly, awful. I am an avid board gamer, and enjoy both major Dune board games as well, which is relevant, because this game feels more like a board game rather than an RTS.

That said, this thing doesn't feel like Dune either. Every single aspect of the game, from research and infrastructure building, to diplomacy and politics, to combat (oh God, the combat) is mind numbingly dull and boring. Combat in Gladius, a _turn based_ (and poor in itself) game feels more fast paced and tense than what this game has. AI is incredibly dumb, offers no challenge, and doesn't seem to respond to what is going on - it just 'does its thing' in its imaginary sandbox. And I feel no inclination to waste my time playing this in multiplayer. The said board games would scratch every itch this ever could far better.

And this is not an 'early access' gripe either - the flaws are in systems and design goals. The game is, except for some hiccups after loading a game, optimized enough. The look and feel is clean, if drab. The one thing the game succeeds in is being slow paced enough to drag on a verdict until after the Steam refund period is over; so this one will stay in my collection; tagged garbage.

Post-release update:

Turns out the devs did nothing to improve the gameplay. On the contrary, they doubled down on the tedium, and threw some controversy in to use as ammo in their perf reviews (that'll be soon and harsh I reckon).

As things stand, I'm glad to see that this abomination is dead on arrival; with the release barely pushing peak player numbers to 1.5k for a few days, before it settled back down around 500. To put things in context, the better implementation of Shiro's own formula, Northgard, is doing fine with 5 times the player numbers, even without being propped up by a huge IP (even if name only) like Dune.

The two main issues I have are a lack of replay-value and a lack of impact-possibilities on other parties. Also: Why are there 6 factions but even on the large map you can play with a maximum of 4?

The replay-value lacks because the game will always follow the same pattern and timeframe. A game will not last longer than 90 or 120min (often even shorter) because at that point somebody will win from natural growth.

The command limit and excessive penalty for going above it makes it basically impossible to build a huge army, and since militias are more or less a joke, that also means that defending against two attacks at the same time is more or less not doable. Not to mention that attacks seems to happen at pre-set waves, so AI attacks are almost always coming at the same time renegades are attacking.
Besides straigth up attacking, the only ways to influence another player are assassination (hard to achieve, hard to defend against) and councils. Yet those council results are mainly temporary and therefore mainly a nuisance at worst, and while the standing has some impact on the votes of the smaller houses, the whole thing has very little impact on the game overall. (Except the Governship, which is more or less instant win.) There is no complexity, no instigation or trade blockades.

The AI difficulty does not really seem to have any impact on the AI behavior, except that attacks by the AI become stronger and more frequent (and AI military rebuilding speed becomes questionably fast.)

What's most annoying to me is that the choice of faction and advisors has little to no impact on the game at all. Some of their abilities are sure strong, but most are literally pointless.

So, while it looks like a cool concept in a beautiful setting at first, it soon feels just stale. It feels like the hype of the movie was used to dish out a cash grab, one that looks enticing but was never really finished.",1701691288,1701691288,False,1,0,0.479865789413452148,0,True,False,False

Military mechanics don't work very well with you have large armies fighting each other, units often just path finding to get around each other to be able to be in range to shoot the enemy. Perhaps they should just allow stacking units.

Tutorials are seriously lacking, don't explain enough, and super boring with text pop-ups. Can they not pay voice actors and put an animation character. There doesn't appear to be a single player campaign, I suppose that's fine but I was hoping for Dune II or Dune 2000 nostalgia.

The flying airship that can carry your troops is way too slow.

Often my villages get attacked and I don't realise since there is no mini-map.

Militia in a village are not assisted by troops, the troops have to die first before the militia come out and defend. So leaving a single troop at a village doesn't do anything, you are forced to bundle-up your shoulders to be any use.

Air-to-air combat is non-existent and an after thought. 

So much missed potential.

As a 4X player and a rather fanatical Dune fan (approximately half of my clothing is Dune related ... ), I was excited when this game was announced, but my expectations were certainly tempered. However, what I eventually found was a very good game that certainly fills a unique void. It is everything a 4X fan wants with a sprinkling of RTS elements that seem just enough to provide engaging game play. Most importantly to me, I really feel that the development team captures the Dune feel albeit with some canonical issues.

Indeed, the entire premise of this game makes absolutely no sense, especially in light of the various factions included in the game (House Corrino especially). However, I am entirely willing to overlook this in the pursuit of good game play. Because, honestly, a game that is entirely consistent with Dune canon would probably be boring. I feel that this game appropriately captures the Dune universe, all while ensuring game play is enjoyable and addictive (as all good 4X's are)

There are negatives, of course. The game feels incomplete. The Bene Gesserit (arguable the main characters of Frank's saga) seem like a mere afterthought in this game. Additionally, there are several factions that are missing from the game (Ix and Bene Tleilax in particular). However, I did appreciate the development team including some lesser known houses - I'm speaking of Ecaz of course. I'm hopeful we will see an expansion or some solid DLC in the future because certainly the game, as it currently stands, represents a great foundation. 

The game is great and perhaps capable of becoming exceptional. With some love it could become a true great among the genre.

1. Factions are way more asymmetric than what they look like in videos.

This is because they mostly reuse the same icons for units and buildings from different factions, so they visually feel like they are probably the same generic units that every faction has, but it's not.

For instance, House Harkonnen has infantries that shred armor, but Fremen doesn't have that, despite having the very same icon.

Another example, despite that they all harvest spices, Harkonnen harvesters generate noise that can attract sandworms and should be paired with an ornithopter for protection, while Fremen harvest teams generate no noise thus they don't attract sandworms, so Fremen can scout with spared ornithopters and gain information about the map way earlier.

There are also lots of differences that I'm not going to mention here.
The takeaway is: factions are surprisingly asymmetric, despite the looking. Factions do not just have minor bonuses here and there; they do play very differently.


2. Tech tree options and building slots are not enormous, but they are very impactful.

There are games that have ridiculous amount of buildings that lots of them literally do the same thing, so for example if you try to build a economic city, you build economic buildings ABCDE... and continue on forever, which involves no thinking and strategies beyond the very initial decision.

In this game, you only have a few slots to develop your city, and then be done with it. No need to come back later to further add buildings that essentially do the same thing.
It can be viewed as condensing the whole long building process into only a few but impactful decisions, which is a VERY GOOD design.


3. Match lengths are long enough to be deep, short enough to be completed (especially for multiplayer). Map sizes are large enough to have the feel of 4X, and small enough that it doesn't turn into a management hell.

Compared to other 4X games where one literally has no interaction with other players at all for the first few hours, you will encounter other players fairly early because the map is small enough, and you will observe and react to other players, which is again VERY GOOD from a strategy game perspective; the main difference between a strategy game and a simulation game is that, players don't really react to one another much in the latter genre.

But in the meantime, the map is also large enough that exploring and deciding which regions to occupy is important, because you never have the resources to occupy them all, and it's large enough so that you won't instant die to a whatever rush just because you scouted that a split second too late.


4. Combat is less about micromanagement

Units in AoE4 look like they don't have special abilities and cannot be micro'ed crazy like Startcraft 2, but not only there are special abilities in AoE4 but also micro is very important actually when armies clash. The outcome is still very dependent on micro.

In Dune: Spice Wars, I haven't seen any unit with active special abilities, and micro is probably nothing more than retreating / pursuing / focus firing, which thanks to the number of squads you can realistically have, is nowhere near the level of even AoE4.


Conclusion
Dune: Spice Wars captures very well some good elements of 4X games and RTS games while stripping out unnecessary boring click-fest mechanics, keeping it concise, fast-paced (compared to 4X, not SC2), deep enough, diverse enough and fun.

I would recommend Dune: Spice Wars to players that:
1. enjoy RTS games but dislike that fast and precise unit micro-management is very impactful on the outcome
2. enjoy rich and diverse decision makings and victory conditions in 4X games but think some of them out there are too cumbersome / too long, or way too massive that it takes forever to properly manage

Really this game is so great that it deserves more players, and it is the only 4X multiplayer game that can be completed within sane time.

It is both real-time strategy and turn-based at the same time to due to both manual pausing and some auto-pausing. As of this review, the game features 6 factions to choose from which are easily quite different from each. Each faction also allows players to choose 2 councilors at the start (out of 4) that each offer distinct bonuses that will easily change things up quite a bit.

As with most games, there are certainly a few quality of life changes that can be made to this game. The one that is most desired by myself would be to auto-pause the game and let me know that a given political voting cycle is about to end without me noticing or casting votes. This also happens to be the best time to save so an auto-save here would be a great touch. As it is, one just has to save manually at certain points in order to avoid missing a few critical moments due to being quite involved with so many other things like dealing with several situations over a large map.

I think the largest drawback of this game for many will be that several types of games will take an inordinate amount of time to complete with some taking a few days even. There are a variety of settings like map size, sandstorm frequency, sand worm frequency, raiding frequency, spice tax, victory conditions and overall AI difficulty that can be set so that a single skirmish can become very long and tedious. As the game progresses, your territory will expand, and you will eventually have a lot of moving parts that will probably require significant pausing and decision making and thus probably some back-tracking of saves. On average, most games will probably require a few hours, so depending on one's preference of how much time they wish to invest per mission/skirmish, then this might make all the difference if this game is for you or not.

For those who wonder what this game might be like if you speed it up and don't pause ever and don't pay attention to all the auto-alerts, it will probably be somewhat unfortunate (or worse) but quite possibly hilarious!",1701178180,1701178180,True,4,2,0.517392158508300781,0,True,False,False

This game captures the intrigue and conflict of the Duniverse very well. The art style, an interesting mix between the recent movie and influence from the book, is very well realized. 

Each of the main factions truly feel different. Going from being able to strong arm the Landsraad and dominate the battlefield with Sardaukar as the Corinos to ride sandworms and harvest spice in unusual ways as the Fremen is great fun. While the games can be rather short, they're still very enjoyable and I've never really felt like there's nothing to do. 

That being said, the game can be difficult. Some factions are much better realized for certain victory styles than others, and trying to compete with, for example, the Atreides in diplomacy is a huge uphill battle. Find an area to focus on, and gear your economy towards it is my advice.

So I started playing this game with a certain bias to Want to like it despite the fact that I do not favor the Stellaris style engine for games. As a game, some will find it fun to play while others will be sorely confused on how to play it. I appreciate the complexity of being able to win by combat, politics, subterfuge, or economics alone. However, the complexity makes it severely unbalanced and slow. So lets talk positives first. If you are an economic city builder or political game specialist this will be right up your alley for game management and fun. Now lets talk about game play negatives, unfortunately there is a lot. The complexity and depth of management involved make this game very difficult to learn for the first several times to go through. Graphics are cartoon-like/childish. Battles are rudimentary, to be polite. If you are looking for complex battle or strategy and tactics to match the rest of the game, you will not find it. Where most strategy battle games rely on a more sophisticated form of chess, this is more like kindergarten checkers. When combined with the rest of the depth of economic and political gaining, it makes battle damn near pointless and obsolete. You can have 90% domination of the battlefield but still loose the match. This is severely unbalanced for a strategy game. The timing of events vs management necessary means you will be pausing the game every 30 seconds to spend several minutes to adjust civil/construction/political/financial choices. I feel like I need to have a special kind of attention deficit disorder to play correctly. Play for 60 seconds, Pause, play for 30 seconds, PAUSE, Play, Pause, Play again. In my opinion the developers could have saved a tremendous amount of trouble for player progression and smooth game-play if they had chosen to make it turn based instead. This would allow for more engaging battles to happen as their own event when they occur. Multi-player is extremely slow and not worth taking the hours required to play.  As a game product, this game is clean as a whistle. I have yet to encounter any kind of glitches what so ever. The Dev team is active and always working on patches, but, the foundational premise they are working on/for is perverse for balance of a battle incorporated game.

Real good RTS game with focus on FFA mode. 

Dune Spice Wars is a slow paced RTS. Unlike classic RTS your main goal is not to annihilate the enemy. With focus on a ""real"" FFA game mode (""Free for all"": no allied victory) you achieve victory by being opportunistic. Of course, you can still wipe the enemy base from the map. But you can also just eliminate the enemy leader, win by owning most spice shares, win by being elected the leader or by gathering the most hegemony points. 

In this regard, Dune feels far more like a real time Civilization than a Command & Conquer or Starcraft. Combat is very simplified. You rather have to prepare your assault correctly instead of pulling off some 300 apm micro skill set. 

Team games are possible, but I would say, they are not the core of the game.

I see that the mixed reviews come from old school gamers, who expected more or less a sequel to the venerated Dune 2 from 1994.

At first glance, ""Dune - Spice Wars"" appears as a beacon of innovation in the storied ""Dune"" series, boasting modern mechanics and a fresh take on the classic universe. However, a deeper analysis, as highlighted in the original article, reveals a tapestry of concerns that merit a philosophical and critical examination.

""A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct."" 
- Princess Irulan

[b]Resource Management: A Shallow Mirage?[/b]
The essence of ""Dune"" has always been its intricate resource management, particularly the struggle for Spice. However, ""Dune - Spice Wars"" seems to have diluted this complexity, reducing it to a more superficial level. The strategic depth that once defined the series appears to be lost in a sea of oversimplification. This shift not only undermines the game's challenge but also detracts from the rich lore of the ""Dune"" universe.

[b]Political Intrigue: Lost in Translation[/b
""Dune"" is renowned for its political intrigue, a dance of power and deception. Yet, in ""Dune - Spice Wars,"" this element feels underdeveloped. The political machinations and alliances that should add layers of depth to the gameplay are instead rendered as mere afterthoughts, failing to capture the essence of Herbert's universe.

[b]Aesthetic and Atmosphere: A Double-Edged Sword[/b
While the game's visuals are undeniably stunning, they also bring to light a philosophical dilemma. The beauty of the graphics, in some ways, masks the underlying issues in gameplay and narrative depth. It's a classic case of style over substance, where the aesthetic appeal distracts from the core elements that make ""Dune"" unique.

[b]The Legacy of ""Dune"": A Missed Opportunity[/b
From a broader perspective, ""Dune - Spice Wars"" represents a missed opportunity to truly expand on the legacy of the series. Instead of building upon the rich foundation laid by its predecessors, it opts for a safer, more mainstream approach. This not only disappoints long-time fans but also dilutes the philosophical and strategic richness that is synonymous with ""Dune.""

To conclude the matter, while ""Dune - Spice Wars"" brings certain technical advancements to the table, it falls short in capturing the true spirit of the ""Dune"" saga. The game's shift towards oversimplification and its lack of depth in key areas are significant drawbacks, overshadowing its visual achievements. It stands as a reminder that in the pursuit of modernization, games must not lose sight of their roots and the intricate elements that define their essence.",1701019112,1701019112,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It is such a deeply thematic theme, with so many elements of the lore and the feel of the political machinations and grandiose plans... but in an organic way through the gameplay - it is not about reading long texts or watching cutscenes, it is not about scripted missions that follow the story to the letter (at the cost of your agency). It is the interaction between the mechanics, the way the game plays out and what choices you are given and make, that bring out the theme and setting of Dune. The strategic campaign even more so.

So far what's included;
Single Player Skirmish with 5 victory conditions Hegemony, Domination, Political, Assassination and Economic (you can toggle them on or off apart from Domination)
6 Factions (Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino, Fremen, Ecaz, and the Smugglers of Tuek's Seitch)
Plays like Northgard and Endless Space/Legend combined

Quick Update:
Multiplayer has landed, and it is excellent, after 4 multiplayer games with 4 players. The game is excellent and tense. Expanding and the opening moves feel very akin to Northgard's early game but the combat is decisive and you still need to plan your attacks, covering your flanks and having a plan B. It's so refreshing having this tension in a strategy game.

This game has become a staple like Northgard and we regularly play.

The gameplay feels smooth and fitting for a game set in the Dune universe. It's nothing like the fast clicker tank spam games from the 90's, those were great but this is a welcome and much needed step in the right direction. Games will take time to complete. My first game on the default settings took about 3 hours to complete and suss out all the mechanics.

While each faction has a tendency, there are subcommanders/councillors who can adjust or slightly twist your tools to make the factions play differently. I hope they expand the offering with more to choose from as this would add a lot of cool twists to player's strategies.

The game offers a variety of win conditions to pursue, The pace is methodical, moving units and committing to attacks will leave you open to counter attacks by locals, rogue sietches and your rivals. 
Eliminating a rival via assassination is an involved affair, expensive and lengthy. You need to prepare with the right agents and resources. It fits well with the novels. 
With all the different win conditions going simultaneously it's vital to keep a finger on the pulse of the game, as someone who has a fairly smooth game can win by Hegemony or CHOAM while the others are duking it out.

There's various territories and resources for you to explore. Some tiles are special and denoted with a star banner, they offer either a unique building or a huge boost to a certain production or resource as well as pushing you closer to a Hegemony victory (Think Fame victories from Northgard) 
You'll be expected to build up a functioning infrastructure, all while handling the harsh environment with plenty of upkeeps like water, managing a spice tax paid by the houses to the emperor which also turns into currency while you produce the Spice by CHOAM. You'll manage gathered Intel for espionage and Authority will allow you to claim more territory with different factors like presence, technology and distance dictating the price. Rogue seitches, locals, storms and sandworms will work to topple your sandcastle. If you've played Northgard a lot of these systems will feel familiar.

There's also a variety of units to use. Every faction has their Scout unit (Ornithopter) and their 5 standard units (Melee troops, Ranged troops, Siege troops, Drone/Support, Faction Specific Elite Troops) as well as bonus units from technology (like mercenaries) or the political voting system all players take part of (Landsraad Guards)

Units also have veterancy which makes them more powerful (except certain units like the Landsraad Guards)

There is a unit supply system which ensures you need to be careful with how and where you move your units, Some territories like the Deep Deserts will deplete unit supplies quickly which will result in the unit losing health rapidly until they can refill at a village or with an espionage supply drop.

Manoeuvring your armies strategically feels very reminiscent of the Avalon Hills boardgame take on Dune. You really do need to sit and think about how you're going to tackle your win conditions, your rivals and keep your territory under your control. The planet itself is hostile with worms, locals and rogue sietches, not to mention your rivals undermining your territories. 

My only complaints; 

The UI needs some work, it's functional once you've sussed it out but there is a lot to be desired in the layout and clicking around for things that aren't there is quite common, for example voting has several stages, the proposal of what you vote on, which only certain people with titles can reroll, then the voting which isn't initally clear if you need to submit your vote or let the timer lapse. and then the results and how they apply. 

Also there is a bar under the resources where alerts and events pop up, however strangely, on the left of the screen are timed missions which pop up rarely/infrequently and are super easy to miss, with some dire consequences (like villages rebelling, or receiving unique units)

A few lessons from Amplitude in how they organise and layout their UI would be a good step. 

The Drone units, while cool, should be replaced with something more in line with the fiction, AI in the Dune universe is shunned. Support units could be replaced with Ornithopters that fill that role, think stealth transports/medical/fire support/etc to fill those gaps. 


In conclusion; 

If Northgard's early access journey is anything to go by. Dune: Spice Wars is going to have an excellent development with plenty of additions. The gameplay fits the universe well, is fun and strategically engaging and it combines all the aspects you'd expect for a game taking place on a planet as harsh as Arrakis.

Landsraad politics, CHOAM investments, Bene Gesserit spies, sword fights in the sand, riding sandworms on the hajr, Spacing Guild services, this game truly makes you feel like a leader in the era of the Imperial Faufreluches. Spice Wars was marketed as an RTS, likely to capitalise on the fanbase of Dune II, but it is definitely a very different beast. This isn’t a fast action packed RTS, it’s a slow, thinky grand strategy in the style of a paradox game. It’s also got nothing to do with the David Lynch film that the Westwood games were based on, you’ll never see them add Ordos, tanks, or sonic weapons, as these things were not in the books. If that’s what you’re here for, the marketing lied to you. Fans of the novels or of paradox games should have been the target audience. 

In fact, the economy of this game reminds me a lot of Stellaris: the careful management of resource chains to avoid going into deficits. Combat is kinda like if Civilisation were real-time. Players can vote on laws kinda like in Stellaris Federations. Spice Wars is simpler than a lot of the games it takes clear inspiration from, but still has the kind of depth fans of the genre appreciate. Factions are deliciously asymmetric, such that playing as the Fremen for instance feels as different to playing as the Harkonnens as it should. Their economy, means of transportation, and military strategies are totally different. Each faction has their own unique mechanics and differing tech trees.

There are some issues with balance; Atreides at the moment seems a fair bit stronger than other factions. Fremen is a little weak. Also on the negative, combat strategy is a little shallow. Paul Atreides is also not in the game, it’s odd to not have the protagonist present. I would have thought a councillor with some kind of prescience related ability would have represented him well. But oh well. 

On the whole, this is a great game for people who want a 4X grand strategy that’s lighter and shorter than games like Stellaris. Particularly if you enjoy the economic side of those games, Spice Wars nails it. It’s also a game for fans of the novels, as you’ll not find a better representation of the Arrakis Affair in video games.",1651275560,1700946587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.Pace:
The game doesn't have the fast-paced nature of typical real-time strategy games. Instead, it emphasizes early planning and adjustments. The overall speed control of the game is well-balanced, reducing the urgency of micro-management.

2.Economic System:
In the economic system, there is a taxation system, a part of the Dune novel's setting, cleverly combined with the special resource, Spice. You can collect Spice, choose to stockpile it, or sell it based on market fluctuations. Additionally, there are operating expenses, tied to water resources. Operating expenses include buildings, units, and garrisoned city structures in occupation plans. Water resources determine your supply, equivalent to the outer health points of your units. Beyond your territory, supply is first consumed, and then health points decrease. This setup, reminiscent of previous nation-building games, goes further in Dune, serving as a factor that can be controlled, utilized, or used to restrict development, impacting combat effectiveness.

3.Random Events:
Sandworms appear without warning, adding a realistic touch to the game. Detection relies on observing the vibrations in the sand. However, the Spice harvester provides a solution by allowing the addition of a detector for automatic detection. Despite incurring some operating costs, this option provides peace of mind and is reasonable.

4。Political Aspects:
I'm still in the early stages of exploring the political dimension. There is a council where you need to vote, exert influence, guide decisions, and influence resolutions beneficial to you. Resolutions essentially act as buffs, adding an interesting element. Influence is also a quantifiable resource, and I haven't yet delved into the specifics of how it operates.

完成基础教程后玩了第一局，总结一下

1.节奏
这个游戏速度不像一般即时战略这么节奏快，但是需要的是提前布局和调整。整个游戏的速度调控很好，设计上减低了微操的紧急性 。

2.经济系统
第一是有税收的，这个是沙丘小说的设定，和香料这个特殊资源结合的很好，你可以收集香料选择做库存或者根据事实变动的交易价格出售，定期需要用香料来付联盟税。有运营开支，和水资源的设定，这个和一般人口设定有点像，但是又有不同，运营开支是包括建筑物和单位，和占领规划的城内建筑守军。水资源决定了你的补给，补给相当于你的单位的外层生命值，在你的领土外会先消耗补给然后就减少生命值，这个设定其实之前国家崛起也有，但沙丘更进一步，把他作为一个可以控利用或者约束发展，影响战斗力的因素了。

3.随机事件
沙虫会出没，这个不会报警，很真实 ，需要通过观察沙子震动。但香料采集器又提供了可以加一个探测器去自动探测，付出一点运营成本可以安心 ，也比较合理。 

4.政治
我还刚开始玩，有一个议会你需要去投票，施加影响力，引导决策和对你有利的决议，决议其实就是一些buff，这个还挺有意思，影响力也是一个量化的资源，具体怎么运行的还没了解。",1700923715,1700923715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The diverse nature of factions, each boasting unique mechanics, contributes significantly to the game's depth. Admittedly, this diversity might deter some as it straddles different genres, but I urge those intrigued by the Dune universe to give it a chance. While the game's pacing might elongate at times, its essence triggers a delightful nostalgia reminiscent of classic real-time strategy games.

+Nice looking clear graphics
+The different factions have a clear identity and feel different to play
+Good difficulty scaling (haven't tried over hard tho)
+Fun to play with friends


-Needs more tutorials, especially for the campaign mode and spy operations
-Units sometimes wander off on their own, would be nice to have
 a hold position default toggle for units because it can be annoying 
to micro units when there's a worm nearby or impossible if u have

 A range of military units which can all be upgraded. The need to keep them in supply and use them wisely because sheer numbers may not be what tips a battle. Then you have the espionage which is a whole other game. Using agents to hinder the enemy in battle or politics. Assist your units in battle or help an ally.

Unlike most RTS games you can choose between several different paths to victory such as military might, interstellar politics, and assasinations. Not only do you have to beat your opponents, but you also need to survive a blazing hot desert with angry local tribes and massive sandworms. The latter are big as freight trains and are ready to eat anyone and anything that unwittingly strolls around in the desert.

I played Dune 2 from Westwood Studios back in 1992, and I must say it was really awesome to see the Dune lore and universe come alive again with Dune Spice Wars. In summary I did struggle a bit with Dune Spice Wars, especially in the beginning as it has a steep learning curve. However, after some time I got hooked by the depth and complexity, and the differences of the factions. I do miss having Atreides as *blue* color and having Ordos in stead of smugglers, and Sardukar instead of Landsraat forces, but that is a minor thing. 

What is already great:
+ Great atmosphere, stays quite true to the Dune lore
+ Once you understand the mechanics, how things work with each faction and how you can win, it's an awesome strategy game experience.
+ There are several ways to win (war, spy assasination, becoming a majority stock owner or assuming leadership positions in the interplanetary council)
+ Kudos for trying out a combination of RTS and turn based strategy. It works quite well (I must admit i hit the pause button sometimes) 
+ Nice graphics
+ Very nice starting point to be expanded upon later
+ Multiplayer also works great

Improvement ideas:
- How about an optional minimap top right or left? I know I can zoom out and scroll, but it's just not as quick to get an overview.
- More tutorials: I found the learning curve to be very steep and not user friendly enough for casual gamers like me. For example more than 7 resources in parallel (spice, solaris/gold, intel, plascrete, influence, authority, unit control ++), several different win conditions, a massive map, taxes that increase over time, stock trading, spycrafting, RTS-like wars and unexplained dangers. It could need a slower paced tutorial.
- Storymode: It could have been that you added more and more units, buildings and tech tree capabilities as you progress through the story. It could make it easier to learn and more exciting to gradually feel stronger. Would have been awesome to follow some of the characters through a story. 
- In-game help: Just a place to look up how all the things and mechanics work.
- Unit control: In Dune Spice Wars, most units consist of small groups of say 4 units. It does make them harder to micro and they have sometimes problems when you want to stack them closely together on a rock surface as a hungry sandworm nearby is on a feeding frenzy. It could have been a ""stop"" button. Would perhaps be easier if each unit only took up one space.
- Construction: It could have been closer to Dune 2 with base building, walls, different types of turrets and a tech tree that is slightly easier to follow. However, it does work, it's just a bit hard to maintain control of where the different buildings are.
- Sandworm: It suddenly comes out of nowhere and eats half of your army, which might be true to the lore. Still, it would be good if there where more early signs before you get eaten. 
- Zoom: Zooming in changes the angle of our viewpoint which IMHO makes it harder to micro the units. Again, probably better to copy something like Starcraft 2. 
- Taxes: Perhaps explain why we have to deliver the taxes. It could also have been easier, like accumulate N thousand units of spice within one single deadline and not increasing every month.
- Vehicles: Dune 2 had a variety of vehicles, tanks and rocket launchers, but I guess that can all be added later. Of course you shouldn't think too hard about the incredibly stupid idea of having melee guys going up against an armored tank with a knife. So since melee fighting is a thing, there could perhaps be melee type vehichles, range type vehichles, support vehicles, and transport vehichles that could help soldiers cross deep deserts safely.
- Additional local fauna or animals that can be a danger, or you can tame and have transport your troops or fight for you.
- Possibility to hunt down smaller sandworms, find eggs and breed some worms that are loyal to whatever faction that has the eggs (or something else).",1700279731,1700883896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll be blunt: Armanda Ecaz of House Ecaz looks awful; a redesign to match the themes of her leader peers is necessary. Her giant gilded pauldrons and Frankenstein's Bride hair don't belong in this game. Her character design is so bad I can't in good faith recommend a game that includes her current form in it. To be clear: I don't care that she's a woman or black. I want her to look thematically appropriate for the game and she does not.

1.0 has brought a massive change to the tech trees for all factions; techs have been balanced, moved around the tree and additional faction-specific techs have been added. This was nice to see. Prior to 1.0 the factions did not feel unique enough, but now I feel that issue has been addressed.

Manpower and water now work differently than in early access, with water upkeep being removed from units and added to village buildings. Units have an upfront manpower cost, but no manpower upkeep. When units regenerate health you incur a manpower penalty for a period of time. I feel this makes water more valuable and manpower more dynamic. Manpower specifically requires a little more micromanagement than I would like, but it's not game breaking.

I was surprised by the number of typos still present in the English version of the game on release. Again, not a game breaking issue, but weird to see in a full 1.0 release ready state.",1651023134,1700881747,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It borrows from classic RTS games, boardgames, card games and then adds some of its own to create a unique experience.

You can choose between a full campaign or a shorter match. The full campign is essentially your chance to play out the battle for Arrakis as one of 5 major sides of the conflict. If you are familiar with the Dune universe you will recognize the factions, leaders and advisors you can select. In my opinion they fit very well with their descriptions in the books and offer a great variety of playstyles. Very far from Dune 2, where your options were essentially just 3 paint colors for your units, here each faction is genuinely unique. Switching from Atreidies to Harkonnen to Smugglers to Fremen to Corrino feels almost like playing a different game each time. For example Fremen have very limited access to Landsraad voting which is a major element of major houses gameplay.

You get a learn-as-you-go tutorial that explains the basics - indeed crucial to grasp the multitude of mechanics the game offers. I consider myself a veteran of RTS games and still wothout the tutorial I would have been hard pressed to figure out many things on my own.

Map is semi-randomly generated area around the Arrakis' pole and issplit into sectors in a boardgame style. Each sector has a village, own resources and a set of bonuses. There are landmarks known from the books like Mount Idaho or the Barrier Wall, offering unique bonuses. You will feel the urge to take as many as you can, but it gets ever more expensive and ever more difficult to keep control of more territories as you face raids, enemy spies and attacks. It takes a lot of consideration to decide which secor to take, how to develop it, and when to defend or give up land.

Economy is quite complex, there are several resources, ranging from world defining spice, through cold hard cash - the Solari - to some quite abstract ones like intelligence and influence. You will be forced to balance them or face consequences. Without solari you cannot develop your economy and military. Without water and authority you cannot expand. Without influence you cannot sway landsraad votes. Without manpower you cannot recruit units.

Combat is relatively simple with each faction having just a few unit types to train, split into melee, ranged and support. Also there are special units you can obtain through events or landsraad resolutions. In most cases whoever has stronger units in the fight wins, but there are some caveats. Strategic deployment is crucial - deciding how (if at all) to split your limited forces and where to send them. Major houses can build airfield to move forces quickly, while the Fremen can summon and ride sandworms for the same purpose.

This review is already longer than anyone in their right mind would read, so I will just skip getting into more details.

This plethora of features is very neatly packaged with cartoonish graphics and fitting musical score. AI is decent enough to put up a fight but I would suggest playing multiplayer instead, a human adversary will surely provide a better challenge.

You spend most of your time watching things happen; waiting for your troops to move around, waiting for resources, waiting for your probe to slowly explore, waiting for something to happen, waiting for some explanation as to how the games mechanics work. The game doesn't tell you much beyond an almost sarcastically simple tutorial that goes over how to move the camera in great detail but completely neglects to mention win conditions, or espionage, or factions, or command points or seemingly 90% of the games mechanics. Instead you need to figure it out slowly through trial and error which would be fine if it didn't feel so repetitive.

Repetition is standard for grand strategy games but where Dune fails is by making all the maps feel exactly the same. My favourite map is the one where you start next to a spice field with boring desert tiles in a roughly six tile radius before hitting the AI. Special tiles are little more than boring percent modifiers, tiles themselves are just plots of land to build the exact same buildings as every other tile and everything is way too spaced out. After a few tiles you have to build airfields to ship your troops around and with the constant raider attacks (barbarians essentially) plus dumb AI endlessly skirmishing you spend most of your time in the mid to late game playing air taxi driver for troops.

There are also way too many systems going on but none actually feel fleshed out. You can win in five ways; domination (kill everyone), assassination (kill enemy leaders through espionage), economic (buy 50% shares), diplomacy (stay council leader for a month) and hegemony which relies on hegemony points that you get for doing stuff - no tutorials on any of this of course. I've played for almost twelve hours at this point and I still have no idea how assassination victories actually work. I don't know how hegemony victories work beyond getting tiles seems to give me points. Domination victories seem to be almost comically difficult to pull off so I've not even bothered. Meanwhile economic and diplomacy victories are super easy to pull.

The other big problem is that each faction seems designed for certain victory conditions and the disparity in difficulty between each victory condition (economic = face rollingly easy whereas military = tediously difficult) means that you need to more or less know how you're going to win from the start. This, when combined with each faction being designed for certain victory conditions, means that trying out other factions feels unrewarding because if you don't like fighting then there's no point playing a faction designed around fighting. Consequently you wind up playing the same one or two factions over and over on the same map over and over to do the same victory condition over and over.

The standard game mode is one player and three AI but there's only six factions so every map feels like the last. To use a comparison; imagine playing Civ with only Rome, Greece, China, Persia, Spain and Britain available. Now combine that with each civ being designed to do one victory condition above all others so if you meet Rome you know your ides are getting marched with an early praetorian rush or if you meet Persia you know they'll be going economic etc. Throw all that together with a single boring desert map that always feels exactly the same, unexplained systems, frustratingly slow progression and a needlessly confusing tech tree and you've got an idea of how Dune plays. Oh, and no wiki of course so either smash your head against a wall trying to figure it out or google it.

If you have enough time to waste then it might be worth a look but for a game with no campaign, pathetically brief tutorials, one boring map, no wiki, dozens of unexplained systems and a general pacing somewhere between Travian and Clash of Clans it really doesn't seem worth it. There are better RTS games out there and better 4X games. This game feels like an own brand coke trying to compete with the big boys by slapping a Star Wars promo label on the front to get sales by association.",1700738629,1700738629,False,1,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

Looking at the global success the Dune franchise enjoys today, with renewed mainstream interest sparked by Denis Villeneuve’s gorgeous adaptation, it’s hard to imagine Frank Herbert’s manuscript being turned down by publishers some twenty times before Chilton finally decided to publish the novel in 1965. There’s just something very ambitious and encyclopedic about the scope and concepts of the book that probably sounded a bit risky to conventional publishing houses - and frankly, you’ll probably understand their apprehension looking at the masters who swung and missed (David Lynch) or didn’t even get a chance to swing and kept their Dune vision in the pipe dream drawer (Alejandro Jodorowski).

         Enter Shiro Games - the studio behind Northgard, a game I enjoyed to the tune of about 50 hours in - with what seems to be the most natural genre for Herbert’s eclectic opus: a real-time 4X game that uses the fundamentals of their previous title, redesigned to fit the sci-fi aesthetics and faction lore of Dune. Once again, we have a tile-based map we need to colonize, with the added caveat that, much like in the source material, everything revolves around the spice melange. We need to pay an imperial tax, colonize villages and exploit the different resources (Plascrete, Solari, Manpower, Fuel Cells, Water and Authority) in order to build a fragile economy and win by achieving one of the three conditions available (Conquest, Hegemony or Dune Governorship). To that end, your agents can launch operations varying from supply drops (unit regeneration) to the fatal, multi-phased assassinations that will eliminate a faction’s leader in one fell swoop. You can even ally yourself with the neutral Sietches on your map if you decide to share your precious water, and there’s always an undercurrent of danger in the map’s random events (storms, sandworms reacting to strong vibrations or raids sent out to snuff the light from your emerging settlements). Add to that the Landsraad: a periodic set of decrees you can vote on depending on your standing and influence, affecting various aspects of the game for a limited time. How all of these things interact and how to optimize your build orders and decision-making skills is something you’ll develop over multiple games, much like in any other 4X. It’s a balancing act, understanding how your faction works: the Fremen, for instance, are arguably the strongest military around. Their dreaded Fedaykins bully any other military unit, you are a lot more resilient to adverse conditions such as deep desert and with the right developments you can just carve a bloody path on the map to your enemy’s home base. However, your mobility is seriously crippled, since the Fremens can’t build airports and drop their units on the map. There are ups and downs to playing every faction, and there’s an added element of diversity in the bonuses you get from the councilors you pick (you get a total of four out of which you can choose two every match).

The slightly cartoonish stylization works pretty well with the visual grammar established first by Northgard and now further explored in Dune: Spice Wars. It’s a world of symbols, for sure - your armies are tiny and expensive, your building slots are limited, everything is slow and simultaneous and even though separately these elements seem small, at times you get overwhelmed by so many things happening at once. It all gets easier once you become accustomed to the multi-layered puzzlebox you have to solve, but by the time you have mastered the gameplay won’t even see the cuteness of everything anymore. It’s just really, really well designed for the quintessential feudal real estate space opera it represents.

How difficult the game becomes is left to you, with four levels of AI ranging from easy to insane. As expected (from any 4X game, really), the AI cheats to absurd amounts, being always granted more resources than you. To compensate, you can always abuse any of the game’s mechanical vulnerabilities: the computer enemy’s non-existent micromanagement skills, spammable operations with no diminishing returns and, in what seems to be an homage to the Civilization series of unfortunate game design choices, trading useless resources to the AI for exorbitant prices. The more you learn to play the game, the more predictable and easily outsmarted the enemy becomes, and I’m betting most of the player base is looking forward to the game’s multiplayer potential.


 
In terms of lore, this is the closest a game has gotten to the books, as in - it’s competently inserting characters, events and technologies to account for various mechanics and concepts in a coherent manner. Since we don’t have a campaign yet, I can’t speak for the storytelling aspect, but the foundation is there and considering how rich the source material is in epic arcs and narrative delights, there’s a lot of potential. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2809299739

In its current (Early Access) state, Dune: Spice wars only delivers a skirmish component, (with a campaign and multiplayer mode set to arrive within the next year). I can’t honestly recommend it to someone who isn’t a big fan of either Dune or Northgard for its current $30 price tag, but if you’re on the fence and you’re just looking for reassurance, know this: Spice Wars has a healthy foundation and is lacking in neither polish nor functionality, just content. When and how well it will deliver on its promise is entirely up to its developer. If the current build is any indication, there’s plenty to be excited about.

Im crazy about Dune, like my father was. Have read all the books, watched all the series, movies, own and like the board game, have the baron harkonnen figure on my computer desk and was over excited for this game when it was announced.

Now after the official release, feel like its a missed opportunity. Tech tree is thin, units are basic, customization is weak, conquest mode is boring and nowhere near as fun as a fully fleshed campaign for each faction would be.

Really thought this game would be more like Stellaris, deep, complex, versatile, modable with a twist on Dune history, lore etc. Dune universe is so deep, Ixian tech, Tleilaxu ghola and genetic engeneering, Ginaz Swordmasters, Mentat, Bene Gesserit etc , etc, etc.

All we have of Dune is the surface and its not always shiny, we have Armanda  Ecaz (WTF)....next DLC will probably include Paula, Wladimira, Edrica, Thufira.....welcome to Shiro's Dune!!

Right now, the game is bland and repetitive, was hoping way more out of this game, will still play as im a sucker for everthing thats Dune, but this game is not half of what it should be or could have been

I know its still possible for this game to evolve but the foundation seems so basic, guess i'll have to hope and wait for another Dune game to come out.

Best RTS I've played in quite a while.

This is not a continuation of Westwood's classic Dune/C&C series; it's more a sequel to the 1992 game ""Dune."" I don't have the energy to write a full review just now, but I'll give it a quick look.

If you remember Rise of Nations, this feels a bit like that. Instead of something like C&C or StarCraft, where you play through missions, each taking place on their own map, Spice Wars gives you an entire hemisphere of Arrakis all at once. The planet is broken up into ""regions,"" which are essentially like spaces on a Risk board. The difference is these Regions are actually comprised of space-time, and your units need to actually walk across them. When you take control of a territory's ""Village,"" the territory becomes yours, you can add buildings to it, and your units no longer lose water while spending time there.

It's WAY more complicated than that (it's a game based on the Dune franchise, so of course there are spies and politics and smugglers and sandworms), but that's the basic gameplay. Build buildings; train units; conquer territories; control the Spice. It's kinda like playing Civ in realtime; There's that much depth to this game.

A true masterpiece. Can't wait to see how it evolves as 1.0 approaches.

EDIT: Adding House Corrino to the game was a great idea, and brilliantly-done. I hope the dev introduces similar unique mechanics to the other factions to make playing as different factions feel more distinct.

The air units are an interesting idea, but in my opinion don't seem to add much to the game. To be fair: I'm not very good at this game, so it's entirely likely I'm completely missing the point.

UPDATE (21 November 2023):
Another new faction added (I forget its name), and again: really well-done. I still wish they would give the original four factions a viability pass, but every major feature update for this game so far has been fantastic. The addition of the new game mode is also pure love. While the game still doesn't play much like the old Westwood games (a little, but not much), this new mode hearkens back to that series, in the best way possible, without feeling like they're pandering or grave-robbing.

If you like the old Dune games, I think you'll like Spice Wars. If you like the Dune IP in general, I think you'll at least appreciate what they've done with this game, even if you don't enjoy playing it. If you're a Summer Child, and have only seen the recent Dune movie (and you love it), I think you are the target audience for this game, and I think you'll love it.

For those of who have lived our entire lives with the Saga of Dune, the idea of Atreides and Harkonnen fighting a war on Arrakis itself is utter nonsense, and absolutely did not ever happen. It CAN'T have happened, because such a war doesn't fit the canon of what actually happens in the books.

And that's why the Dune computer games have always been fantastic. They already can't exist, so they can do whatever they want, story-wise. In the Dune universe, the idea of two (or three, or five) great houses fighting a hot war for Arrakis, on the planet itself, could totally happen. ""Historically-speaking,"" it never did, but if Paul Atreides (and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, and Miles Teg, and Nayla, and Duncan Idaho, and all the other key players in the story of the original five-book ""trilogy"") had never been born, it absolutely could have. That impossible, yet utterly-probable war is what the Dune games have always been about. The only one that wasn't was the ""original"" Dune, released in 1992, and I wager most people who celebrate Dune 2 as the original real-time strategy computer game have never even played it. Spice Wars is a direct sequel to that game, but removes the 1992 game's adherence to the story of the Dune novels, so that we can play a fun game about a war that could happen in the Dune universe, but not in the Dune story.

This writing now comes to an abrupt end, because I've said all I want to say, and am not sure how to tie it up in a bow. I'll sincerely try to wrap it up properly when I'm less drunk. If anyone cares, this is a real moment in my life as a writer (never before has inebriation been a valid excuse or not properly finishing something, neither have I ever let myself off the hook by saying something like ""I'll finish this later, I promise"").

One last thing before I go: I wish I could nominate Dune: Spice Wars for something more than ""outstanding visual style"" this year. I genuinely don't feel this game's visual style is ""outstanding."" It's cool. It's good. It's nice. It's interesting. But it's only noteworthy, not ""outstanding."" It doesn't ""stand out"" among the sea of other games released this year.

Having said that, I haven't played anything this year that stands out *more* than Dune: Spice Wars. So while I don't think it has an outstanding visual style, given what I've seen this year, it is the game that most-deserves that award. Moreover: this hasn't been a year for outstanding visual style, but this is the game that has a visual style that is closer to ""standing out"" than anything else I've played this year.",1651804779,1700622900,True,1,0,0.507575750350952148,0,True,False,True

It's frustrating controlling units in groups larger than 3. It's frustrating needing to hold their hands in combat. It's frustrating managing the authority resource to take territory. It's frustrating trying to preform espionage. It's frustrating that feeling that even once you capture territory that some rebellion or renegades are just going to appear so you have more fires to put out. 

I want to make clear that most of my experience has been in single player. I have played some multiplayer with strangers and friends and most matches feel dependent upon who picked Fremen or Corrino and knows their faction best. 

This was a game that was designed first with multiplayer in mind, which is why the campaign that exists now feels as tacked on as it does. It feels bizarre to me to try to push this as a multiplayer first game, given that 
1. Competing with popular competitive RTS games that exist today is a non-starter and 
2. If you're at all familiar with other Dune RTS titles you're likely expecting mission based campaigns with multiplayer being the afterthought.

Having played this long I feel that most of the changes I see, be they to resource values, structure or unit costs, unit regeneration systems, tacked on unit bonuses, purchasing limitations, the inflated authority costs to later territories, the limit to authority that can be banked, even the concept of buildings having armor all feels like it's meant to slow down the player.

As an example, if you choose to build into researching as much tech as possible early the inflated costs of tech will punish you by making researching anything more expensive to the degree that trying to hasten it is futile. And easily half of the systems of the game feel this way.

The factions are unique. The ways that they're meant to play and be strong are interesting. But every innovative idea feels like it's attempting to dissuade the player from doing what feels enjoyable. Sure you could try to land grab and build your strong foundation to start an offensive. But there's no reason to when you'll be punished - not by competing factions, but by roadblocking resource limits and costs, and it's more effective to wait for a hegemony victory for nearly all of the factions.

Honestly, those people are trolls. 
The game is far better than it's ever been and while yeah bringing a unusual faction like House Ecaz can feel, you know, unusual because of what they were up to at the time of the setting that the game is set in versus later on, I honestly do not care.
House Ecaz, the other Houses, the Smugglers, the Fremen, everyone and whoever else the devs will bring into this game is a lot of fun to play and each and every one of them requires their own separate play-style to really excel at and therefore get a lot of fun from!
Go play with Corrino's legions of 40k Space Marine inspiration, House Harkonnen's dirty, nasty grimy influence over all the little people, the classic House Atreides with their Golden Retriever-like vibes in politics, and whoever the frick else sounds like a lot of fun to play as! They all are fun and people who say otherwise are grumbling over details so minuscule that it would make a Longbeard blush over how petty they're being and Longbeards declare grudges at mountain ranges for be accident prone!

Look, do as you like. It's your money and this, just like any other game, isn't for everyone on the planet but if you see someone playing with their friends online in this game on Youtube or one of your friends plays it and it looks like fun, then get yourself this game/some friends and try it! I can promise that if you enjoy RTS/political intrigue/4x style game play/ resource building games, then this will be a good game for you try! Maybe it's not the best game on the market but what game actually is the best game on the market? Personally, I want to see what these devs come up with because i think that they will make this into quite the title for the RTS genre if given the time and money! I'll be supporting them with my wallet, and if any of this sounds like fun to you, i hope that you will too. :)

Not an interesting game, Shiro tried a 4X/RTS hybrid but ends up with a game that does neither one very well. This is a good example as to why small-time developers should stick to one path instead of spreading themselves thin and never reaching the finish line; an incredibly disappointing effort.

[h3]No Story to Guide You [/h3]
There is no formal campaign mode, Shiro is providing a false narrative that it was never planned; do not believe this. This was a promised feature during Early Access that they just could not complete.

Instead we get Conquest Mode, which is just repeating skirmish maps with minimal progression and minor variations to the existing victory conditions. In comparison to RTS games of old, there is nothing to differentiate this from simply playing random matches against bots. If you're interested in single player content, this won't hold your interest for very long.

[h3]Lacking Competitive Depth[/h3]
Multiplayer is also lackluster, as the competitive depth is severely lacking and the same strategies play out every game. This isn't like a deep 4X where you can find multiple [b] viable [/b] paths to victory, nor is it like a good RTS where different build orders/strategies can overcome an opponent. It literally boils down to ""who can execute the same strategy more effectively"", regardless of which faction or group of advisors you've chosen. There is no variation, and nothing present encourages players to try mixing things up.

[h3]Not the World You Know[/h3]
And as a Dune IP, it completely misses the mark; I never felt like this was a world that I've seen in either the original works or more modern interpretations. Even worse, Shiro Games actively made Arrakis even tamer than what we see in even the latest Dune movie. Terrain barely matters, shields and ballistics are commonplace, the wind as a mechanic has been nerfed to the point of irrelevance, Spice is an endless well instead of scattered across the land as Spice Blows (making exploration even less important), etcetera.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
If you're a fan of 4X games, find something else. If you're a fan of RTS games, find something else. And if you're a Dune fan, stay far away; there are much better alternatives for immersing yourself in the iconic universe than whatever this game is aiming to be.",1690226278,1699447954,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Shiro Games and published by Funcom released on steam and only available on PC at time of release. You take control of one of 6 possible factions in a variety of game modes as you attempt to take control of the planet Arrakis. As always the first question we as is if Dune: Spice Wars is worth the 35$ asking price. I am happy to say the answer to that question is yes for me. 
   Shiro Games maker of Northgard, Wartales and Evoland showing off they can make a 4X/RTS hybrid game. With great music, good control, interesting tech trees with each faction having unique techs, and great graphics that run smoothly. Spice Wars allows you to find a faction you enjoy and play to your hearts content. With three different game modes (Duel, Battle, and Conquest) there are a number of ways to play. Controls are responsive and allow for smooth control when needed. The RTS element is more tactical then click fest and means you can use actual tactics to turn the tide of battle. In addition with world effects such as sand storms and yes the giant sand worms affecting the RTS side it means not only do you have to worry about your enemies but the world Arrakis having an effect on your game as well. 
  The three modes offered are Duel mode which is just a 1v1 vs AI, Battle which is a FFA vs AI, and Conquest is a risk style semi story driven mode that sees you attempting to take of territories and take over Arrakis. While the Duel and Battle modes allow you to use any of the 6 factions, Conquest limits you to only 4. In addition while the Conquest mode is enjoyable with some unique ideas. All the factions have the same goals. This can be a bit jarring when both the Atreides and Harkonnen want to make friends with the Fremen, even though traditionally, the Harkonnen want to kill all the Fremen. 
  Luckily each faction gets unique bonuses and unique techs in the tech trees. This means there is enough replay ability to easily get 60+ hours out of the game. The only other downside is that there is no cinematics outside of the intro one to the game. While not a game breaker, it is like I said disappointing. 
  All in all I found the game easily worth the 35$ asking price, and would highly recommend you give the game a try if you’re a fan of 4X, RTS, or just the Dune universe in general.

1. I bought this game thinking hey it's Dune so it will be like Dune 2000, or Emperor battle for Dune. just a 4x game.
2. I bought and played the game and played and played.
3. I noticed that the game is cluttered pretty bad when you get to mid game. Notices of numerous events just swamp you constantly, as the game progresses this gets worse to the point you will miss big events while trying to tackle other events.
4. I went to discord only to discover its a well oiled machine with no interest in anything except saying the game is good. They put up voting for Features and Bug handling. (Not open to suggestion just a vote on a list of things they came up with same with the bugs) All complaints were immediately countered with the player doesn't know how to play 4x games. This was pushed pretty Hard... I had a Particular complaint that one of the house Corrino Advisors was nearly useless late game.

The Conquest mode gives us an endlessly replayable campaign game that lets the player tell the story of *their* Dune, letting us assume the roles of Duke Leto, Baron Harkonnen, the Padishah Emperor, and all of the various advisors, leaders, and warriors of the Great Houses.  

Lastly, the sounds and visuals of the game truly bring home the feeling that we are on Arrakis, the sand whispering in the wind, the roiling clouds of a savage sandstorm, and music that places you in the heart of Arrakeen or Sietch Tabr.

That being said, it does have some flaws - a lack of cutscenes after each conquest map during the (what passes for) campaign would have done wonders for immersion. Like the old Emperor Battle for Dune or Dune 2000.
Also the Influence resource for some weird reason is the ONLY resource which isn't visible in the top resource bar - it's hidden to the right.
The only way to see your CHOAM share percentage is if you open the share trading screen - why couldn't this be always visible?
Agents are very poorly explained in-game.
The spy missions and the Intel resource aren't really explained - you basically spend Intel to buy debuffs, which you can apply to enemy territories.
When there are a bunch of units around a village, you can't really click on the village's flag, because it ends up below the unit flags.
Pathfinding of units is a bit janky, which can cause some problems when they're running low on supplies.
The supplies bar below the unit's health bar is TINY. It could have been a bit thicker so it's easier to see - my eyesight ain't what it used to be (yeah, age is a b*tch).
You can set a harvester to auto-retreat when there is a worm, but you can't set it to auto-resume when the worm leaves? Why?

But all of these are basically just QOL issues which should be trivial to fix in either an update or some mod - they are annoying, but not gamebreaking.
The game itself is very easy, and tbh I'm fine with it.
On a technical level it works flawlessly.
I personally like the art style - it's similar to Civ6 - a bit cartoony, but not really.

The game gets many things right, I like the game mechanics, the pace, the graphics and sounds are great and in terms of lore, this game incorporates so much more of the books than any other Dune game (though it does have to adapt here and there to make it fit the game.)

The game mechanics can be a bit overwhelming at first and it might not be immediately clear what the effects of your decisions and choices are and where lie your inefficiencies. These things aren't always quite straight forward and took me a while to get the right grip.

Unfortunately there isn't a true campaign, which I would have loved to see, though the different play modes are good.

The visual representation of the game is fenomenal. They made a map of almost only sand, but you will never get bored of it. The soundtracks, and the voicelines are also great.
Each faction is unique, with different specific abilities, so they play very differently. The abilities are authentic, e.g. you can ride worms to travel with the fremen, or oppress your villages for more production as the harkonnen. The smugglers are building up an underground network, and the atreides are peaceful and strong in the landsraad. You also have to really use these faction abilities, and play very different with each faction, otherwise you wont succeed.

The game is best if played against players in multiplayer. The faction strength is kind of balanced, there are factions, who are a bit slower to get rolling with, and there are some, who are better early, this creates a nice dynamic to the game.

The Conquest mode is entertaining, each mission is a unique scenario with specific rules, and goals. As you progress through your campaign, you unlock faction specific abilities and bonuses which are elevating your gameplay in the next missions.
The AI in singleplayer could be better, but its not that bad.

The devs are constantly updating the game in every front: gameplay, quality of life. They listen to the community, and not afraid to do more radical changes if it is necessary.

Few points which can be worked upon:
1. The game is good but lacks the feel of original dune games, original dune games had better combat. But i like the focus on economy in this game which is a + for players like me who prefer enjoying economy over rushing.
2. The graphics are really awesome compared to previous dune games. But i felt the building sizes are very small even to identify what is exactly build. The building all look almost alike after built untill we zoom like more then 100% over them, it would be great is this can be worked on.
3. Units can be improved a bit as well, with add more range of units and vehicles.
4. The politics system is bit confusing for new players and feels as if its just like an addon feature.(i mostly tend to ignore the voting system all together or simply add votes to random stuff which i feel is good). Descriptions can be improved.

The game is relatively easy to pick up but with enough depth in some of the mechanics to add some nuance. The factions all seem different enough to make for different play styles that can lead to some interesting aspects of play.

This game could be fantastic but there are definitely a few shortcomings at present. This is not surprising since the game is early in its development life-cycle, and could easily be addressed by implementing some changes and fixes.

An option for a larger, and slightly more varied maps would hugely help with replayability, as would additional factions, or at least the option for more players/different game modes other than just the 1v1 and 4 player map. More than one player could easily play as the same faction in some circumstances. I think it could also create for more advanced tactics and dynamics if there was a market for all resources other than just spice/solari, as this would create more of a purpose for plascrete etc. in the late game where it's somewhat redundant.

There is also a slightly game breaking bug that's still not been addressed, whereby AI factions will accept a minimal amount of solari or plascrete for an unlimited amount of favour, as long as favour shows for them as a low priority resource. Some of the victory conditions also need to be reworked (assassination victory is best avoided at the moment). Lastly, the AI in general could use a tweak, as even with hardest AI and game elements all set to hardest, it's quite easy to win most of the time, especially in the dual mode, which takes some challenge and enjoyment from the game (the hardest part usually being the constant raids from rebels).

Overall, a fantastic game with huge scope for further growth, improvement and replayability, I do hope content will be added to the base game though rather than the constant DLC form that Northgard took.",1698398567,1698398567,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I do enjoy that there are multiple facets to win in these games that all feel viable, rather than just simple conquest, it adds a degree of variety that I personally enjoyed, whether it be manipulating the Landsraad, or Buying out all of CHOAM, or focusing to assassinate and horde Intel.

First off I love the Dune-verse, Frank Herbert did an awesome job writing a fantastic story and lore.

Pros
+ Atmosphere - the devs did a good job creating a dune-atmosphere, you can feel it just by looking at the menu screen and listening to the background music. Simply golden.
+ The music score is awesome, it absolutely fits, seriously that composer is effing awesome..
+ Engine seems good, It is kind of smooth as it works pretty well on my old PC on high, but I can say you'd need a mid-to high spec PC for perfect fluid gameplay.
+ Graphics are ok, the devs use a certain art style and it works, zoom in and it is pretty simple but still nice and works to give enough atmosphere and distinction to what the entities on what they are in-game. Intro and main menu art is fantastic, love watching that background every time I boot up, gives an instant ""Dune-feel"" mixed w the music. There are some graphical artifacts like zooming out the map you can see something in the middle in the background for example.
 
+/- Certain complexity but still not fully utilized or balanced enough.
+/- Factions too focused in a way - yes they all can succeed in getting different victories but if you want to focus on getting certain victories then it is easier playing them as they're supposed to be played as, using their strongest traits: 
Harkonnen->assassination; Atreides->Political; Fremen->Domination; Smugglers->Eco; Corrino->Hegemony. 
I'm partly okay with it, but at the same time it doesn't feel fully utilized either and it is a little boring as you understand how to counter them in unless RNG gives you a middle finger at the start. The flexibility isn't really there, yes you can get a good RNG and throw all your armies at the enemy and get domination with Atreides but they play better defensively and politically, for example.
+/- AI is predictable but aggressive AF on higher levels and will stab you when you sleep with borrowed krys-knives.

- Extremely slow, I don't mind long games but a match can take way too much time to win and you'll notice the slow down mid-game and you'll sit there watching the sands, sending ornithopters around scanning newly spawned caches because that's all you can do when you're at that point until you can achieve the desired victory.
- Plascrete is underused and overflowing mid-late, no need for that agent with plascrete bonus, I kick him/her everytime.
- Assassinations are totally RNG and only Harkonnen have an edge in it as it is their faction's advantage. Just purge cells as soon as you can and place a few counter-intelligence agents and you can keep waiting for victory while looking at the sand dunes.
- Map RNG is a mixed bag, many restarts will be required. You can get a good RNG giving you lands that will give you a great boon early on, or sucky lands that will require you to explore further out to get a region with resources you need.
- Events are too few and rare, often only the same ones pop up and especially under certain conditions like getting spammed with the event to get a free Bene Gesserit agent when I steam rolled Shaddam with my Fremen... lol.
- Landsraad is forgettable, every faction with the mechanic will get to 500 in the end unless you play 1v1 using Harkonnen as your faction then you can sink your opponent to zero in Landsraad standing and hamper the opponent making them implode and getting harassed by Landsraad guards and win by doing nothing, as long as you have enough influence to manipulate the voting session that is.
- Corrino is a bit too narrow and only one victory is viable for the faction in general (hegemony) if RNG is good enough. Political too unless you have Atreides in your game.
[b]Updated:[/b]
- Where are the Ixians in this game/iteration of Dune?
- The campaign is out and the verdict is... it is meh, kind of boring. 
It will give some (read lots of hours needed to succeed) entertainment first time but after that 
you quickly realize it is a chore to go through, it gives nothing in return apart from some stupid achievements, 
great, more arbitrary useless dopamine BS (scrap achievements entirely pls). 
No cutscenes, no NG+ boons, no sort of progression, nothing but a pat on the back. 
That's ok though sometimes it isn't needed but I felt satiated after winning the campaign mode as Atreides and then uninstalled the game as I felt I got to experience all the update had to offer and realized that's all it is really, nothing interesting more than a mode for prolonged gameplay of the same repetitive stuff. The campaign feels lackluster, streamlined and less than before, the heroes doesn't feel like heroes; they are reskinned elite units that die super-quick, because if you play like me you amass units quickly if needed and make sure to level them by raiding and attacking everything and always move them in a big fat blob (be wary of walking on the sand). The research tree is even lighter/streamlined now, it feels so bare and boring that I felt that I wasted hours of my life even more than usual. I don't expect fancy high-octane stuff as this isn't the idea here, it is strategy, making a smart move, thinking ahead and so on, 
but this was like playing a super-slow boardgame by yourself with minimal fluff and stuff to do, if you play it you'll know what I mean.

I don't know what else to say, if you play it you'd know what I'm talking about in general. It will give you some entertainment sure, 
but in the end you feel that you could've skipped it and just played a round in the skirmish mode. 
Verdict: downgraded, barebones, streamlined, it is designed to be slow - simply boring. Music's still awesome tho.

[b]Summary:[/b]
Mixed, ~B+ the positives are the great music score, seriously that composer is f*cking awesome.
The atmosphere is top-notch, just golden. The gameplay itself... eh. RTS are a rare breed these days
and I do want to like it even more but sadly the game isn't really there, it is a great attempt but don't expect
it to be a C&C clone, it isn't meant to either but the direction of the game, it isn't fully there imho. 
Also, it is so slow, so sloooooooooow that I get anxiety after a while, feeling I'm missing out on life by playing it.
Also, Ordos is a made-up faction created by Westwood Studios, it isn't canon and an IP, so don't expect it in this or any other future Dune-game (also I didn't care that much about that faction).

I gotta stop here before it becomes a full-fledged short-story at this point. There seems to be passion behind the development and I appreciate it, and I do love the game despite feeling every session becomes a time-sink. I just hope it won't become a game that will have 20 DLC:s... but it is enjoyable as it is atm albeit a bit unbalanced and underutilized potential. 

I dunno, buy on sale if you're unsure but still wanna try. If you're a massive Dune-fanboi then sure go for it, 
it will give you hours of play-time while enjoying the atmosphere of Dune but I strongly recommend to only spend on it when on sale, for your anxiety's sake.

Dune: Spice Wars has six factions, eleven resources, four win conditions and a great community. My favorite faction is Smugglers. They are the best in pillaging neutral and enemy villages for solari, main money resource in Dune. Furthermore they can place underworld cities in every enemy village like Skaven in Warhammer 2 Total War.  Their army rooster is focused on stealth units, slow and ranged. Other factions are great assassination and other scheming (House Harkonnen), manipulating votes in such a way it harms others or benefit themselves (House Atreides), generating such a wealth they can buy all the CHOAM shares and protect themselves with superior mechanical units such as artillery drones and tanky air (House Corrino, or so called Emperor), expanding so fast with militairy might to protect their homelands (Fremen) and finally the new House Ecaz introduce a weird, beautiful mix of glass canon and tanky units combined with unique buildings. 

Next to solari, your economy has to balance other 10 resources. Plascrete is used for constructing buildings in your villages.  In order to recruit faction unique non-mechanical units (melee, ranged, specials, elite) you need manpower and recruit mechanical units (such as drones and air) you need fuel. Without enough spare water your units die in the desert by draining their supplies. Authority is needed to annex villages. In order to get more votes, better spice price, discount on CHOAM shares, you need a high Landsraad standing. Guid favor is a resource you need to recruit a light air unit or one flagship. To support your army or economy you can cast operations in a specific region with your spare Intel resource. And finally each influence counts as one vote in the monthly election for a three new policies. In short, the players that love Civilization, Crusader Kings or other 4X games, will also like balancing between eleven resources to do best economically, militarily and politically. 

Next to killing your enemies (domination victory), you can also win in three other ways. When you produce a lot of solari / money, you can gain a majority of the CHOAM shares and win. If you spent your influence wisely during voting, you can become governor of Dune and win. A hegomony win you will achieve when you cover up most of the map but that can only happen when you also take enemy villages. In high level player lobbies I try to focus on two victory conditions are the same time: (A) Domination + Hegomoney: If I want to play aggresive, I can either kill the enemy or take their land. (B) CHOAM + Governor: When I want to play more political / defensive, i focus on improving my landsraad standing (good reputation) which will help me greatly when i want to buy shares or get more votes. During an Free for All multiplayer game it is real fun that not every player tries to achieve the same win condition. The best, most tense moments are when a player need to defend themselves when he or she is close to a victory, against three other players. 

Finally I want to talk about the community of Dune: Spice wars on discord. Almost every night (EU and US time) we play a a couple of games together which new players can join, watch and ask questions. Furthermore we discuss rules, theory crafting in the other channels where i notice that the average Dune player is often an experienced strategy gamer. Dune: Spice Wars is not an easy strategy game to master. I recommend it to experienced players that have experience in Starcraft II, Total war series, Civilization and other RTS / 4X games. If you have any questions and/or comments in relation to this review, you can always contact me on discord (pmsag) or send a message on the official discord of Dune: Spice Wars (which i am active member). 

Disclaimer: Besides factions, resources, win conditions, there are many more mechanics i left unnamed such as pillaging, sietch alliances, hegomony bonusses, and faction specific tech. There is much to explore on Dune!",1697098335,1697098495,True,3,0,0.497187048196792603,0,True,False,False

The lore and characters from Frank Herbert's Dune and its sequel novels help shape the core mechanics of the gameplay loop, however the simple presentation and limited strategic depth clash with Dune's notoriety for intrigue and... epic-ness. 

+ Good performance
+ Varied factions with unique campaigns/strategies
+ 3 single player game modes of increasing length and complexity to suit your time constraints
+ Many paths to victory. Political, Economic, Military, Covert, Domination

- Currently the game strikes me as unbalanced mechanically. I'm still working through the variations, but overall each game seems to flow in much the same way. Spice is appropriately all-important. 
- Music and sound design are not valued enough. The soundscape of the game is very routine.
- No oomph. You know? No jazz hands. No pat on the back. You press play, you play the game. At a certain point one of your faction's variables will hit max and then a victory screen shows up. You are given a chance to review some spreadsheets. Play again? 

--- The art style, music, UI, depth of mechanics, scale of presentation, and overall vibe do not match my vision of Dune and its universe. Dune is renowned for its opaque, introverted, bizarre world of interstellar politics, planetary warfare, ecological strategy, and millennia spanning plots. Sometimes people are turned into worms. This game does not have any of that. You fight over part of one planet, for a few months, and then you probably win, because the AI doesn't value CHOAM shares enough and everyone sane knows CHOAM directorships are the true measure of wealth in the Imperium.

The game mechanics themselves seem well thought out individually, but their interaction is purely text-oriented and lacks coherence in terms of gameplay. The factions also differ far too little from each other, except textually. In terms of gameplay, you don't feel any difference. All the existing complexity should have been introduced by means of a campaign, but in such a way that you recognise which play styles (i.e. different according to faction and strategic orientation) would be feasible, so that you are gradually introduced to the complex game mechanics.

The systems are mostly pretty simple, but there's just the right amount of complexity to keep things interesting, and the way all the victory types play off each other is very nice. The visuals are also a huge pro, although the fidelity is meh the visual design is gorgeous and the desert map looks absolutely stunning. Likewise, the units have unique designs and the music is pretty good too.

The AI leaves a lot to be desired - their economic control and the way they pursue victory is actually pretty decent, but their unit control is atrocious. It's so bad that even an army that outnumbers me 3-4 times is never a real threat, as I know they'll spend 90% of their time running around not attacking anything. The AI needs some serious fine-tuning, and the combat in general is a bit lame, with a lot of blobbing. 

The real-time aspect works pretty well - excepting combat - and makes the game stand out.

As a casual RTS enjoyer but not a very good multiplayer RTS gamer, i tend to play either with friends or with AI only therefore this review however long or short it may be will not be good review material for the most hardcore of y’all gamers.

The setting :
the game is gorgeous, the art style is very nice to look out and most of the designs really do respects Herbert’s vision

The gameplay :
it was a struggle to get a stable economy working on all sides the first time as there is a lot and i mean A LOT to do and to monitor. 
BUT it’s been so well thought that in the end i don’t even see my blinded starting game as a death sentence for example you can actually pause the game (which i didn’t see in that many RTS, granted i play way more of C&C Generals than anything else in this genre), that is making reading the ton of informations really easier and relieve a lot of stress learning the in and outs of the game.
There indeed are many things to take into accounts but they don’t all come into play immediately, in fact most of them are locked behind a certain period of time (ex: 24 days later), so you can learn it at your own pace.
The combat isn’t the greatest but at the same time i don’t see what more could really be done, as this game is a mix of so many genres at the same time.
The controls aren’t all over the place and accessibility seemed to be a priority during development, which will really wear down on the RTS heavy community but appeals a lot more to some others like me.

a bit more good :
the score is great, the ambiant sounds are perfect and the actual fighting sounds are very immersive as well.
the conquest mode is a AWESOME mix of grand strategy game and rts which will entertain you for hours i guarantee y’all

It’s a solid game with a relatively small price for the work the devs accomplished, and even a casual rts enjoyer like myself will absolutely play a lot of Dune Spice Wars, as it is one of these rare games that aren’t the best in their category, but are part of this small folder of games you actually want to master and enjoy every lil bit of.

It probably took longer than anticipated, but the game is out of EA, and its more glorious than ever. Capture, Collect, Sell, Bribe, Conquer and maybe Scam or two. final ranking 8/10

Even tho its Early Access, its actually quite fine. Sure there are loads of OP stuff that needs balancing, stuff that needs adding, problems to be solved but the game itself is quite fun. Note that its not an RTS like the Westwood Dune was, this one is 4X, so expect slow gameplay, economy management and not a lot of combat at start. The espionage is well made, you can even win by assasinating your opponents. You got politics in treaties with other Houses (tho you technically start ""at war"" with each other at start), and Galactic Community-like Landsraad which every few days spills some resolutions to vote on that either affect whole game (reduced military costs or more money from spice) or one player in general (reducing effect of agents or influence gain). Units are few but all have their uses, every House gets around 6 of them but all are usable, so no unit is just utter garbage. Overall 7/10, and since its still EA the rating is bound to go up.

Edit 28.9.2022: Since the Corrino update a 5th faction has been added (tho you can still only play with 4 at once) and the differences between factions have been increased. For example, Fremen now dont build refineries in villages, they instead just recruit a unit that they then send to a field and call it a day, House Corrino can get 6 building in a village (instead of normal 5) and so on. Also, another wincon has been added (getting enough CHOAM NFT's).

For my part, I think it's absurd that Dune: Spice Wars has a ""Mixed"" rating as of the time of my review. Now, I am not a fan of traditional RTSes, and I would not want to play this game multiplayer. But if you're a single-player strategy game fan who usually prefers turn-based games or grand strategy titles like those made by Paradox, I think you'll find Dune: Spice Wars to be a lot of fun. The ability to pause means the twitchy, click-fest nature of RTS games isn't an issue, so you can play at a relatively slow pace and make tactical decisions without first having to develop the kind of muscle memory you'd need to be even half decent at games like Starcraft. So, again, this is an RTS for folks who like TBS and grand strategy.

Part of what makes Dune: Spice Wars work - and part of why I think a purely narrative-driven campaign would be weird - is that this is a game of several interwoven systems. It reminds me of a Euro board game, with a great many resources to keep track of, strategic decisions to make, and paths to victory. It is not a game of tactics. Yes, you probably want to make sure your armies focus fire individual opposing units, and you can do some small micro with damaged units (moving them out of attack range), but this isn't Age of Empires. Rather, the focus of the game is on more strategic things like building a better economy than your opponent, having better information and mobility, and determining how your current situation meshes with your faction's particular strengths and weaknesses.

Of course, like any system-driven game, Dune: Spice Wars does not have a ton of content. Maps ARE procedurally generated, so no two battles (or stages of a conquest) are the exact same, but Dune isn't exactly the most geographically varied setting in SciFi to begin with. Factions are definitely very different from each other both to play as and to play against, so that provides a good deal of variety. But if what you're looking for is a deep story with a ton to discover and explore, this game ain't it. There's no pretension at being a strategy game + RPG like a Crusader Kings or Age of Wonders. There's not really even emergent narrative as you might find in Europa Universalis or Stellaris. Nope, this is a strategy game, a game of mechanics and systems.

I've been playing conquest mode and am enjoying it quite a bit in part because it mixes up your objectives from map to map. And I think it highlights one of Dune: Spice Wars's greatest strengths. It FEELS like a grand strategy game, but any given map only takes an hour or two to finish (maybe a tad more if you pause a lot, or possibly less if you're an expert and don't pause much). I have found that conquest mode in particular helps me scratch my grand strategy itch while still respecting my time and fitting into a couple hour gaming session after work in the evening, something I struggle with when playing many Paradox games, as it can take an hour for me just to get my bearings if I haven't played in a couple days, so I tend to play only when I have a large chunk of time to devote to a campaign.

So, in summary, if you're a strategy board game fan, an EU4 fan, or a non-traditional RTS (think Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom) fan, Dune: Spice Wars is for you. It's an RTS in which the ""S"" is the star, rather than the ""RT"".",1695874535,1695874535,True,346,1,0.933584451675415039,10,True,False,False

I've never watched Dune, I bought this game because I love Northgard and my friends wanted to try this out. I now want to watch Dune simply because I don't really understand anything that is going on story wise and that is a huge part of getting into strategy games for me.

It has a somewhat steep learning curve because of this, especially if you haven't played Shiro Games' previous title Northgard, from which this game system is derived.

The music and graphics are great.  The airfield mechanic is a fun twist on the RTS formula.  The units are appropriate to the Dune setting, i.e. mostly soldiers fighting with swords.  The varied scenarios within Conquest mode nicely mix up the goals and tactics.  The Landsraad implementation is phenomenal; I love the way the voting ties into all the other systems.

I think the thing this game does best is mix a whole bunch of different elements from the Dune books and games into a layered experience that feels very Dune.  Wheels within wheels for sure.

Right now its like a poopier Northgard with dune skins (but not really) and stirred up mechanics but games seem like they could potentially last 6 hours (still not that long for a 4x game)

The factions seem poorly balanced but are all unique and force you to play to their strengths or the game gets significantly harder so much so that if you play as anything but military as harkonen you are probably going to lose, if you try to go military as smugglers you are going to struggle for no reason. short tech tree, not that many units, not that many buildings. Game forces you to take the entire economic tree in development first or suffer no matter what race you play (if spice is on map). Game is 80% luck based, as atreides i had a terrible time because i couldnt make money = no research no army no influence etc, as fremen i had 10k 1 hour into the game with 3000 plascrete and +30 knowledge generation all because i started on +90 income from gold spawns and took research that upped my gold gen by +20 per unique region which i started with 4 vs 1 in the other game.

 Tutorial gives you a general idea about stuff but doesnt give you useful examples of how to use certain objects or doesnt cover anything about the subject at all (top left stockpile bar I'm looking at you).

You get to control maybe 15-20 units total by the end of the game which is pretty shitty for the amount of map there is, its balanced by the fact that you can teleport your units around for money and building slots (or a timer for fremen)

The diplomacy flat out sucks, might be better with real human but for the ai you cant please them they will always backstab and research agreements/ normal trade doesnt seem to increase relations.

After you get 15 villages almost impossible to expand, game caps at 500 authority. Fremen and smugglers get way too much authority. at the same time i had 16 villages enemy has 3, 4 and 6 (atreidies, smugglers, harkonnen) 

Fremen have exploitable loop for free cash. (keep weak enemy alive/neutral town and keep liberating for 1k solari each) Atreides 10k hegemony skill ridiculously strong meanwhile smugglers is a damned joke. Harkonnen units and agent skill so ridiculously strong you might as well war everyone right from the start and snake towards them.

The factions are fascinating in how they interplay. Its not a baby whine'rs game nor an RTS players game. The subtleties show when master plays against master.

As a final note, this game is likely more appealing if you're looking for a 4X. The RTS elements feel like they're in service to the 4X, keeping gameplay quicker and smoother than a traditional turn-based 4X without requiring the high APM of an actual RTS (pausing is also a provided option).

[h1] Win Condition [/h1]

This game give you a illusion of different win conditions, never saw a political win on Multiplayer (only playing MP +100 hours), Choam win was only possible when smugglers could abuse it, right now it's very hard, only hegemony win or domination.
Assassinate a player right now is only possible once in a game, with a really weird mechanic.

[h1] Battle [/h1]

Battle POV: 10 units vs 10 units, 1 unit in each faction is low hp, you send to base, 9 vs 9, 1 unit in each faction is low hp, you send to base, 8 vs 8, 1 unit in each faction is low hp, you send to base, 7 vs 7,...
1 vs 1, 1 unit in each faction is low hp, you send to base, wait 3 min to all get regenerated, and start this endless cycle again, really interesting fight mechanics

I think not only we can see the problem with the fights, army vs army, you like send your army to attack and your enemy send his to deffend, but when one of your battalion is low hp you just cilck on it and send it back to your base / village to regenerate, really strage way to fight, but its not feel like in startcraft 2, maybe because the art is more than a unit, but in my opinion your army need to be in stance of fight and cannot run away.
Battle mode need to be reworked from the scratch.

[h1] Balance [/h1]

devs shoudnt focus on adding new content but rather balancing the existed one, when you add to mutch functionallity you will need to balance each function with each other, and right now the game seems completelly unbalance, stop adding and start working on current content

[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]

Multiplayer right now it's just lobbies, like old early 20's, no rank (not even show other players played history or something like that). Make a simple rank sistem and a quick game search button with the default map/gameplay setting in the lobby.
Add anonymous mod to old players don't know your strategy just by looking to your nickname.

[h1] Devs [/h1]

A great game bringing back a refreshing change to the RTS scene while being immensely true to the story that Frank Herbert told in the books. I can't state enough how much fun I have trying to figure out the ""puzzle"" of solving certain faction's build paths for randomized maps. I highly highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys RTS resource management games.

Review:

A wonderful and refreshing game based on the Northgard predecessor recipe. If you enjoy a complex RTS with various resource management that is faster pace than Sid's Civilization I feel you will really enjoy this game. This version of Dune is a lot less about making a ball of units to smash your opponent's base like Westwood Studio's Emperor: Battle for Dune and far more on assessing what you as the pilot of the game need to do to capitalize a win. The strategies can be vastly different depending on the map seed as well as the faction you are playing. Each faction has a unique twist that is very fitting for the current movie series while also paying homage to the books. 

If you like Northgard I feel you will enjoy how much more indepth this game is in comparison. If you like how relentless Northgard can be by it's adaptive events that punish you then that is where this game deviates from Northgard. Both games utilize a smaller tactical force while having to manage your people as well as your hold on various regions for particular resources. Additionally Northgard can at times feel like a stalemate because of the hold that the AI has on particular resources and hidden bonuses. In Dune this is not an issue at this current state of the game. I have never felt the game has unjustly punished me and the objectives that pop up are optional.

If you don't like complex or how much micromanaging is required in the current trend of RTS games then you will not enjoy this game. Starcraft 2 will be more up your alley for a traditional troop ball smash your enemies bases and destroy their factories before they can rebuild style of game.

The story/campaign of this game thus far is very similair to Westwood's Studios conquest mode just like in Northgard. Albeit without the cheesy videos that Westwood was known for. Conquest mode requires you to take control of regions of Arrakis with specific limitations for each region/mission. You can choose a few different battles each turn of the conquest and react accordingly to what regions the AI takes. Do you continue to take over new regions or do you defend against the AI attempting to claim a region you control?

I am so happy Shiro Games has created what I could argue is a wonderful spiritual successor to Emperor: Battle for Dune. If you haven't played an RTS before this game will be quite a challenging learning curve but if you have played the recent version of the Dune boardgame and enjoy the complex paths to winning the board game you will understand when I state how indepth this game can become. I truly hope you will give this gem a try. I know you won't be disappointed!

this is a 4X game with some RTS elements but the main focus is on the 4X part.

IMO this is a good game, i bought into it first early access and played it every since. with each update something new or some mechanic changed enough to warrant a few new rounds.

for me the pros are:
- fairly chill game to play not very stressful experience most of the time

- graphics and sound are great, i love the chill music and the stylized graphics

- the asymetry of the factions and their different play-styles. some focus on politics others on expansion/money others on military conquest. most factions can do all those things but achieve them in different ways.

- on the surface the game seems quite simple. however there a lot of different mechanics layered into each other that allow different play-styles and options.

- a lot of options for your game, victory conditions, enemy difficulty, ""world difficulty (worms, storms, raiders etc.), map size ...



the cons:
- while the complexity of the systems is a positive, some are not very well explained. while there are tooltips that help and the tutorial teaches the basics well enough, there is a lot of trial by fire and learning by doing but not in a good way.

- while there is a conquest campaign which is to me very fun in its mechanics, there is a lack of story. besides what you know from the movie/books/etc. in lore there aint much of story that helps transport your though the campaign.  faction descriptions, their goals and vibes are well established and lore snippets on units research descriptions round fill out some more lore. the is no overarching story with cutscenes or anything like that. you get good mechanics and lore but not much of a story (yet?).


personally i only played single player yet and you can ge a lot of hours out of this, 6 factions, different game modes. a mechanically interesting campaign.  
as an early access player it was interesting seeing this game develope over time,the core mechanics are teh same but they added new factions, new mechanics and layers over time that fleshed out the game quite nicely.

I have some minor complaints and of course faction balancing is always going to be an issue at the higher levels, but I feel that all of the factions work and are viable for the majority of players, so no issue there. If you're interested in the idea of a civilization style game in real time with some light RTS elements, this is definitely it.

Now I'd like to address two of the major criticisms that you will see in reviews and why I think neither of them are worth paying much heed to.

The first is the ""lack of a campaign"". When the game was in early access the developers promised a ""campaign"" before launch, and as far as I am concerned, they delivered. In my eyes, a campaign is nothing more than a series of interconnected missions that are played out to accomplish a larger overall campaign goal. The issue for other players is the assumption that the word ""campaign"" means there needs to be an overall narrative with characters and cutscenes. I've already been through this debate many times, but to sum up my feelings, while I acknowledge that many RTS games feature a campaign that has these sort of narrative elements, I do not believe it has ever been a requirement. I also have played many RTS games in the past that feature what I would call campaign modes that do not really have much of a plot or narrative going on at all (Dark Crusade is probably the closest comparison in this case). I can understand why some people feel let down, but I have to say that the devs delivered on what they promised, and I think anyone saying otherwise is creating broken promises out of thin air.

The second major issue people have with the game is the inclusion of the new faction in the 1.0 release, House Ecaz. House Ecaz is a faction that only has their name briefly mentioned in the first book, and to my knowledge (not a hardcore Dune fan) is not expanded upon with characters and background until Brian Herbert's novels.

For those unaware, the first six Dune novels were all written by Frank Herbert and are, to most, considered the ""canon"" version of the Dune Universe. After Frank's death, his son Brian began writing novels in the universe starting in 99 and has written 20 or so. Most people tend to believe that, not only are these not good books, they are not canon either. The original backlash upon the announcement of Ecaz being added to the game was that they were including a faction that ""didn't exist"" and was thus recognizing Brian's works as canon. This is a reasonable enough complaint, but I feel Shiro wisely took a faction name and created their own background for it in an attempt to make a new playable faction that was interesting and wouldn't interfere too much with the pre-established universe.

However, this became worse once the actual leader and councilors for the faction were announced. To sum it up, they used the same names of the characters from Brian's novels, but changed the characters. Archduke Armand is now Armanda, being the major change. They also may have changed the described skin tone, I'm really not sure. This change is now being touted by many thinly-veiled bigots as yet another example of ""wokeness"" in video games, and frankly is a load of crap. They wanted more women in the game because it was kind of a boys club, go figure, get over it, who cares. I think if you made it this far into my review you already know whether or not this is something you care about, but to be clear, I think it is hilarious reading steam reviews and seeing people simultaneously complaining that a ""non-canon"" faction was added to the game but also that these characters were changed from their ""well established"" character descriptions. You can't have it both ways, fellas.

I think if you're a fan of strategy games, you'll enjoy this. If you're a fan of Dune, I think it might be the best Dune game to date. You'll notice some minor issues with performance and faction balancing at the high level, but I think at the end of the day it's something most players will be able to enjoy.

To me, that marked the point when Northgard abandoned all pretense of seriousness and just became a weird, but mechanically fascinating kid’s cartoon.
House Ecaz is like that. Making pretty sculptures on a death world means, that any gravitas the game inherited from Frank Herbert instantly evaporates. Why do they do it? Because it synergizes with village traits. If a village has ""Plunderers"" +3 Solari for every military building, a military Masterpiece gives +6 since it counts double. Masterpieces can also be upkeep-free placeholders to unlock “one of each type” bonuses or the Mason Guild's +15 for fully built village bonus. Their Sanctuaries add +1 to village based bonuses, so it’s  mechanically interesting, but “lore” wise inane.

It's not your typical RTS and offers players many different ways to win. Most of the complaints I've seen were from players with the wrong expectations.

Just like the books\movies there are political moves, counter moves, strategic military moves, economy moves and more. There's so much to digest I just love it.

Sure, they spent some more time on it, but they didn't really add anything entertaining.

That game play is atrocious.

All in all the game progresses slowly, but requires a ridiculous amount of micro for stupid shit at the same time. Fortunately you can end your game pretty quickly by setting Spice ratio to 100% no matter who you are.

Dune Spice Wars delivers a visually stunning experience that immerses players in the vast, unforgiving sands of Arrakis. Having been with the game since early access, I can confidently say that it has come a long way, showcasing impressive graphics that truly bring the world of Dune to life.

The game offers a rich and engaging RTS experience that caters to fans of the genre. However, it's important to note that some factions currently have an edge over others, warranting a need for balancing adjustments. Despite this, Dune Spice Wars provides a well-rounded gameplay experience that justifies its price point.

One of the standout aspects of the game is its ability to scratch that real-time strategy itch that many players have been longing for. The learning curve for multiplayer matches is admittedly steep, as each faction boasts distinct playstyles and strategies. This can make it challenging for newcomers to find their footing, but it also adds depth and variety to the gameplay.

One noticeable issue lies in the range of the Corrino tanks, which can feel somewhat overpowered. Addressing this concern, along with other potential ""cheesy"" playstyles, should be a priority for the developers moving forward. Balancing tweaks will undoubtedly contribute to a more enjoyable and competitive experience for all players.

In conclusion, Dune Spice Wars is a promising addition to the RTS genre, offering a visually stunning and engaging gameplay experience. While it may have its share of faction imbalances and gameplay quirks, the potential for greatness is evident. With continued support and thoughtful updates, this game could easily become a staple for fans of real-time strategy.

Look at my time played!) and I don't know if I ever will, because there are major issues with the interface and the core gameplay loop that have been reported over and over with no comment from the devs. They keep planning broader and broader things, new features and tacked-on concepts, but they don't even mention the core issues that keep the game from being good. 

In theory, it's a 4X RTS - think Civilization, but real-time - but in practice it feels like 7 or 8 different game systems that only sort-of interact, and none of the actual underlying mechanisms are explained well. 

- Individual unit AI sucks. When your units get attacked, they'll chase their attacker forever until given a different order; games like Starcraft have a maximum leash distance before units return to their starting position, but Dune: Spice Wars doesn't. Inevitably, this means they get baited into a pile of enemies, or even simply die from running out of supplies. They eventually added a ""Hold Position"" command... after 7 months of Early Access. 

- No word on Attack Move, Patrol, or any of the other commands you'd expect in a game like this. Right-click a position to move, right-click a target to attack, press C to hold position. (Note: this isn't ""hold position and attack anyone in range."" This is ""stand perfectly still even if you get shot at."")

- If you click an enemy and see that their stats are weirdly high, there's no way of seeing how those stats are calculated. There are buff/debuff markers, but you WILL see stats bounce up and down without any of those buffs/debuffs appearing or disappearing. Sometimes you'll end up in situations where (for example) you play Fremen, get a bunch of speed upgrades, and then an enemy melee unit will outrun your ranged infantry and kill them. Are melee units faster than ranged units in combat? Maybe! The game will never tell you, though.

- Likewise, units can push each other around. In theory, tanky melee units are there to protect weaker damage-dealers; in practice, the enemy will usually push right past your front line. But when you try the same trick with the AI, it doesn't work for some reason? Maybe there's some trick to it. A trick that the game doesn't explain.

And that doesn't even get into espionage (there's counterspying to keep enemies from deploying operations against you, but how does it work? the game won't say) and the Lansraad (you can vote for temporary gamewide buffs/debuffs, but there are ""minor houses"" that vote just like you and they tend to have clear preferences, yet the game won't tell you how to influence them) and the CHOAM market (you can buy and sell shares, having lots of shares gives you bonuses and eventual victory, but there is literally no interaction with other players here, if you're close to losing you have to just kill the other guy).

A 4X game lives or dies by its ability to let you make decisions based on the information you have. An RTS lives or dies by its interface, whether a player can stop fighting the controls long enough to fight the other players. Dune: Spice Wars fails at both, and no matter how many units, factions, systems, or game modes they add, it [i]will not be a good game[/i] until the core systems see the baseline level of polish that they should have gotten in Early Access.

If they fix it, I'll change my review, because the potential is there for an awesome game. But I've seen no acknowledgement that the devs even realize there's a problem.",1694979274,1694979274,False,20,0,0.597338080406188965,1,True,False,False

In addition along the same theme, they could do with making a fraction sheet, Twilight Imperium style, with a list of starting buildings or unique mechanics and changes such as mentioning that the Fremen for example get one less building slot per village, or that they can't build the water extractor, making controlling the pole a hegemony and positioning choice, not a water economics one.

Dune already has a story being adapted to the big screen. This is a 4x strategy game set in the Dune universe. If you're wanting a Dune purist game adaptation, then this isn't for you either. The devs have taken creative licenses like most game devs do. Most of the negative reviews boil down to these 2 things. 

For beginners, Dune is a pretty complex game. There's a lot of variables to manage early on and a ton of nuance built within the game. It's going to take a bit of time to get a handle on the game mechanics. The good news is this gives the game a ton of depth as each match evolve differently based on how the map is generated and what the factions and counselors are. 

This is absolutely a game that's best played with friends. It reminds me of playing Sins of Solar Empire back in college, but except we're fighting on Arrakis. A lot of them forgot that this game was still early access because of how well polished it was. It's also nice that each match tends to last around 2hrs which makes it great for folks who can't dedicate a ton of time to gaming.

If you're looking for a really in-depth and nuanced game but don't have the time to sink into Paradox games, then this is for you. If you like RTS games like AOE but want something a bit more strategic, this is also for you. If you're looking for a fun game set in the Dune universe where you can betray your friends in unique and infuriating ways (friendly fire nuke???), then this is for you. 

Overall, I give this game a solid 10/10. Happy spice harvesting.",1694868640,1694868640,True,4,0,0.526853799819946289,0,True,False,False

Then silly me decided to try it again before they decided to release out of EA and into Ver 1.0 and I have to say even after playing the other 1hr disappointed me even further, no actual campaign, just a conqurst type thing which apparently is a so called ""Campaign"".

I wanted to support the dev bringing a world I love into the gaming space in a way that wasn't available before. They have since broken the promises made in their dev diaries and road map and as such I will be requesting a refund as this isn't the game I paid for. If you like what this title is offering, please go ahead and buy it, but this title is significantly different that what was promised.

Edit:
In response to the Dev who responded to my Review: This Review has been left in a direct response to the fact that the promised campaign mode as not been added in a sufficient way. I am going to quote another comment I made to the developer on someone else's review:

""The fact is that if it was a campaign, it would be called a Campaign, Not ""Conquest"". Previous Titles you have made such as Northgard (I game which I love) contains a story campaign and has another added in DLC. Those campaigns have replay-ability with the scoring and ranking system you had attached to it with the Stars system. You can pretend that ""Conquest"" mode full fills the promises made in your road map, but have a clear example created by your own company for what to compare this product to.""

I am also going to quote their own news and development posts that have been release through steam in regards to the broken promise: 
1.The campaign will not be present in the initial launch build but like multiplayer, is planned to come to the game at some point during the Early Access period.
2.We’re not there yet, and we don’t know what form it would take, but a campaign would probably have a different story or form so that there’s something new to discover for all players.

I would like to point out that it was also ways called ""Campaign"" and as such brings certain connotations which are story driven and linear narrative like all other games that boast a campaign such as their own game Northgard or AOE2 and countless other examples.

Second Edit: Again in response to the dev, I understand that this is your job as a community manager, but consistently twisting words and definitions around, changing the goalposts and generally weaselling your way out of the promises that have been made is not the way to fix these issues, Doubling down on this type of behaviours is just solidifying what me and others are saying about this game and your company. The true solution to this problem is either a proper apology to the people who bought this game or the release a ""Story Mode"" that was promised.",1694749017,1694838639,False,40,1,0.622762858867645264,0,True,False,False

This is the last game I will ever get in early access. I can't refund it because I tested it. Wee.

They added 1 tutorial for 1.0 on water use. This game doesn't want you to play it. Then for some reason there are more tutorial block that look like they should be filled but they aren't. If these are locked behind the other tutorials completing the water one didn't change it. This is awful game design.

Very little in the way of a tutorial. They added a new mode, no tutorial. It doesn't even clearly explain what the point of the conquest mode is. I played some weird map with no spice on it. Still a bunch of buildings and technologies I can research to effect spice production.

The tutorials cover the basics, camera movement, picking up spice. Then they forgot that the game has a politics mode, spies, and a stock market.

Basically, they explain 1/10th of what you need to play the game.

Here's how good game play works. You have a goal as a player, get to site A. Then to get to site A, the player needs to use a game mechanic. If that's make a team with a stitch bam, they now know the mechanics of make an ally of neutral units. 

Goal, complication, mechanic, solution, training, sense of fulfillment. Satisfied gamer. Good luck with your development. Maybe hire some play testers who don't play real time strategy games and who don't have blinders on for Dune fandom.

This isn't a game for 'people' to play, this a testing model for the game developers and your friends to keep playing Dune. If you want other people to play Dune, you have to show them how to play.

Literally, this whole game can hinge on one vote there is nothing to let a player understand that except, failure. Seeing as my one match took me, 1.5 hours today, that's a nonsense method. I'll just go google 'how do I play Dune Spice Wars.' Wait, even better, why don't you, the developers do this.

The combination of classic RTS mechanics with 4X makes for a really fun experience that I come back to time and time again. The gameplay is fleshed out and quite enjoyable. While I think there might have been some confusing language from the developer about the campaign, I doubt that it was on purpose as Shiro games is one of the best and most consistent developers I have ever come across so it is a shame to have such a great game get so many negative reviews. 

While I hope that they do eventually add a story campaign in the vein of Northgard, I am currently quite satisfied with how things are going and expect it to only get better from here. I can however, certainly understand the frustration of many players as a campaign is not a conquest mode, and I know that Shiro games knows the difference due to northgard, which contains both, though perhaps there was some internal communication issues, I dont know. I suspect that they simply considered the conquest to be a storyless campaign. I am normally as critical of broken promises as the next person, but Shiro games has a long history of supporting and fixing and adding content to their games so I will trust them to work with the players to fix any major issues and give them the benefit of the doubt.  I do feel that Dune spice wars would be able to have a fun campaign, but I also suspect that many people would complain if it wasnt 100% canon compliant. Either way, I would appreciate a campaign, but I do feel like the sheer level of negative reviews is an overreaction. But even without it, I am quite satisfied with the game in its current form and am excited to see how it will evolve. The game for me evokes the grand scale of Dune as well as its vibes, for lack of a better word, which makes it one of my favorite games, as Dune is one of my favourite universes. 

Shiro Games, if you are reading this, I hope that you know that many people, including myself, love Dune Spice Wars, and I sincerely hope that you continue to develop it and help it grow. I have been a big fan of northgard for a long time and having you develop it has been a joy to experience. I truly think that Dune Spice Wars deserves the same treatment.

It's currently getting review bombed, mostly because of, well, honestly, whiny man children who couldn't handle some gender/race swaps that have no effect on gameplay (The game had a much better rating just before House Ecaz was revealed) and some (or same) people who couldn't handle this not being a direct continuation of the old Dune RTS despite never claiming to be that game. They're also really pissed that House Ordos is not in the game for some reason.

Then we have a pretty loud group that complains that conquest is not a ""campaign"" or a ""story mode"". I'm honestly pretty happy that we don't have some outdated version of a campaign. Conquest is something that you can play with 4 factions at the moment and every conquest you play will have different random bonuses and randomly generated maps and missions (to some degree).

I looked at the full release today and i was shocked. I rly cant understand why i dropped THAT much.

Still there are not a lot downtimes its playabel in a reasonable time and a lot of love gone into realising a dune setting.

-I rly love the atmosphere and the very different playstiyles. 

-Also graphic looks good, sound is rly good.


SO LETS TALK ABOUT THE BAD AND THE HATE
 - no Story campagne: Its true no story as of 1.0 but there rly wasnt one planed like a ture story. It would be cool, but it isnt there. I can understand a litle frustration, but not this much, not for a game that plays this good on that many lvl. And Conquest is cool.

- its not old dune. Ok not for you, sad but ok, but you could see that fact BEFORE you buy. So no reason even getting new dune game if you want old

- its difficult. Many people will hate and whine this because it has a steep learning curve. Its not for everyone


IN MY OPINION THIS DESERVES STILL THE 80%.
- and knowing the devs that still supports Northguard till this day, they will work on this one and make it even better. A lot better then it already is. And i think chances are high that someday we will get a real story.

For me, personally, I think the game launched in a fantastic 1.0 state!

I wouldn't have wanted a narrative driven campaign, I find them far less replayable instead of the Dawn of War type campaigns which is what we got. I think the meta progression in it is really cool and offers lot's of ways to play each faction.

Lot's of people were also complaining about how simple the strategies are, which I also disagree. At the higher difficulties, the game is challenging and you really do need to tie multiple systems together while keeping them in balance in order to succeed.

My first RTS was Dune 2000, Emperor Battle for Dune was INCREDIBLE, so I'm very much here for and understand the want for a more traditional RTS, but I love Dune SW for what it is. I find it to be part relaxing, part nail biting with beautiful art and style, great feeling UI and gameplay with tons of variety.

It's an easy recommend for me if you like 4X games like Stellaris or RTS' on the other side of the spectrum from Starcraft 2 (which I also love, Diamond Terran.)

This game is EASILY worth the $35 asking price, it would even be a worthwhile game at $50. The mixed is I think purely the outrage gamers looking for something to be outraged about. Screw those people, this game is GREAT.

My ONLY complaint is some HDR/color/display issues which don't really detract from the experience, they just look ""off"" at first",1694804189,1694804249,True,2,1,0.484068632125854492,0,True,False,False

A warm deep roast of classic 4X mechanics is distilled down to a slow, sip-able, RTS classic. Dune: Spice Wars isn't exactly breaking the mold with wild new mechanics, but Shiro Games charms the player with deft mastery of the fundamentals. Exploration, Resource Management, Diplomacy, Domination, and Espionage, provide the core game play loop. 

The interplay between Espionage and combat provides a swift jolt of espresso to the formula. Intelligence  operations are crucial and can radically alter the battlefield on a dime, snatching a critical stalemate from the precipice of annihilation, or transforming a landslide victory into a devastating defeat. 

All of this is wrapped in a delightful art style. Easily Spice Wars strongest point, Shiro Games drips an elegant layer of cream over Arrakis, immersing the player in stunning vistas, a clean UI, and fabulous character design. Soft ethereal music completes the experience, disconnecting your sense of linear time, and sucking up your afternoons like a white girl in a coffee shop. 

Ultimately, Shiro Games enchants the player with tales of planetary domination, sabotage, and treachery, packaged neatly into a beautiful world.",1694798426,1694798426,True,0,1,0.463364005088806152,0,True,False,False

Some people seem to be really upset about the campaign mode. I didn't follow along with the EA campaign despite buying the game in EA, so maybe the criticism is fair. Even so, the game I bought during early access, only partially complete, was already well worth the cost.

The basics of Dune: Spice Wars will be clear to anyone with strategy / 4x experience. What I love about Dune, however, is that matches last a couple of hours. It's an accessible game that still feels deep, and fits (better) into my adult lifestyle than ""grander"" strategy games that take 30+ hours to complete. The systems feel interconnected, so that careful play creates synergies between your research, your buildings, your spy network. This allows you to growth a thriving economy, or buff your soldiers, etc.

I think they also did an amazing job of capturing the politics and espionage of the Dune universe in gameplay mechanics that feel like they matter. That said I do think espionage is a little uneven. It unlocks a bunch of powerful low level tools to influence battles or how you capture cities, but the more powerful options like actually assassinating an opposing leader feel kind of impossible to pull off.

Lastly, despite the toon-ish art style, they capture the vibe of the book and the feeling of the movie quite well.

Fighting other factions is the most fun part of the game, but you definitely don't get the feeling of being in a war, because in order to do anything with the sector you attacked you need authority, which you are always waiting around for.

There's something about this game that really does it for me. There's a magic to it that I find difficult to express.

I'm a long time (OG) Dune fan, and general RTS and 4X appreciator. The game has elements of each, and manages to exceed the sum of its parts. [b]It's a chill solo/co-op RTS with role-playing elements set on Arrakis[/b] that feels somewhere between Age of Empires 2 and Settlers of Catan. The design and atmosphere really transport you to Dune, and within the complex ecosystem of resources and factions there are many interesting playstyles to explore.


[h3]How does it play?[/h3]

[b]If you like to macro, it's great! But if you like to micro, it's not that great.[/b]

While there are a few speed options up to 2x as well as spacebar to pause, I like to play matches ~2 hours at 1x speed without pausing unless I need it. In terms of APM it's a slow start (if it's too slow I bump it to 1.2x, much faster and I feel the need to start pausing when things happen), but most of my energy at that point is planning my burgeoning empire while Dune's riches unfurl before me. The diversity of resources and randomness in tile generation and reward forethought, a fluid puzzle I find pleasantly engaging. It's a nice change of pace from an RTS that demands your constant micromanagement, but being realtime still provides a sense of urgency and suspense as the map unfolds. For better or worse controlling units is not a huge focus of the game, with micro being somewhat unimportant and the focus being simply on having enough of your units in the right place at the right time. Scouting is mostly automated, and units don't have strong counters to one another. It takes a while to get anywhere (without paying for an airlift!) and traversing the desert is supply- and time-consuming, and sometimes incredibly dangerous (nom nom nom)! These limitations can be frustrating, but do make the strategy a little... grander.

Around the time you've established a few bases, the focus expands from your local surrounds to the map at large. There are spice fields to control, tiles with special bonuses, strategic defense locations, adjacency bonuses to consider, and neighbours to contend with. There are enough resource types (spice, influence, intel, solari, guild favours, authority, water, manpower, plasteel, and more) that you cannot hope to maximise everything. Instead it's a careful balance of your economy while dancing around your enemies, in the Landsraad, the stock market, and/or the battlefield. This is where the game really sets itself apart from anything I've played before, and where it makes meaningful use of its Dune adaptation.


[h3]How does it [i]role[/i]-play?[/h3]

[b]For a game of numbers, it's surprisingly so often not about the numbers![/b]

Once you're familiar the very basics of having enough plascrete, water, and authority to effectively macro, the game really opens up.

If I wanted to play an optimal strategy, I wouldn't know where to begin. But I don't care about that because this time I'm an eeeevil Harkonnen and there are so many flavourful decisions you can make throughout the course of a match, it makes me feel I'm playing to my mood rather than treading a pre-defined path (ask Muad'Dib what he thinks of that!). All in all it's a delightful change from build orders and optimisations. 

When I'm asked to choose sides in a Landsraad vote there's no decision paralysis because Atreides is on the map and it feels great to stifle their growth along my merry way, rewarding my investments into Landsraad influence. I could be a shameless Emperor's pet right up until the moment of my sudden but inevitable betrayal (so long Corrino and thanks for all the Solari). Fremen? Sometimes it's bribes for desert power, and sometimes it's pillaging the villages (when my soldiers have spare time away from oppressing my own of course!).

Assassination, open warfare, covert (or not) ops, and fluid diplomacy means there are ample opportunities for sneaky backstabs or even worse... [i]collaboration[/i].

[h3]Closing thoughts[/h3]

The learning curve is fairly steep due to just how many resources types there are, but the ability to intuit your way through the match makes up for it. For the most part, they just make sense to me now. You need spice to pay the tax, influence to play politics, manpower & money to support an army, and guild favours to ship in exotic weaponry... but you can't have them all. Now that I'm fluent in the ebb and flow of a match, it's quite simply a joy to play.

After year and half in early access Dune Spice wars now ready to shine in full glory. Stepping aside from all things that was in Early Access for good. 
Now Arrakis is ready to welcome competitors in new glory. There now 6 playable houses and each have distinct approach to gameplay and really feel canonically right and fit Duneverse. Anyone can find a suitable playstyle either in deciving espionage, or in open military tactics. Each house have strong and weak feats and points in two fields of arrakian warfare. Also politics - aside from leading troops and managing settelment player also is activley paticipating in Lanssaard Voting each of voting could be a wall or pushing point in Desert world. A suddenly appeared ""debuff"" for military forces or apperance of elite lansard troops can be a stomping point for player and opponent alike..

[h1]""The Desert Will surprise you[/h1]

Graphics is very well made. An arrakian storms, sands and palette is something memorable - you woun't mistake Great Plane with Idaho's Peak or Green Lands with deadly Deep Desert. Graphics is beautiful, settelments like small dioramas reveal in your house colors during conquests and feel like alive. Troops are marching and fighting and their animations are belivable. 
By gameplay means warfare is your ""typical 4x"" - you point where, place how you feel right your soldiers and see how they do rest of work. You also can micromanage some of their tactics or help your troops or harm your enemies with Special Operations that act like sort of ""tactical spells"" . Warfare maybe look simple but have needed depthness. Rooster of units is decent yet by my taste not enough. Yet it very true to Duneverse feel and canons. 
Music and sound work is amazing - tunes and voices feel like they fit and sound belivable in many situations - from battlecry to a mezmerazing music of Arrakis. Great soundwork blend into great graphics. 

[h1]""Arrakis will be mine!""[/h1]
In conclusion Dune - Spice Wars is a child of love. A nice cinnamon spiced morsel for startegy and Duneverse fans alike. So if you hungry for some battle and miss Dune-feel - give ""Dune -Spice Wars"" a try. I missed and passed a lot in my review - spice harvesting, economical play, settelments and special operations but its a bidding for a player. Game worth it time and money and i really enjoyed it for my playhours and will play more. 

[h3]LONG LIVE FIGHTERS![/h3]

PROS - Graphics. music, gameplay, storywise and canonwise things blend into this game

CONS - i want more. For my taste it's still have gaps that can be filled with content but that is just my IMO.

- Campaign(conquest) is mediocre, but single player gameplay is great either way so doesn't really matter. 
- Some actions in the game sometimes feels impossible to do / achieve or have underwhelming results. I'm 99% certain this is a skill issue though

If you're looking for a more casual RTS, that is also a lot more slow paced, it might be for you. But if you're on the more involved side of strategy gaming, then the game will lose its luster very quickly.

The devs have to be commended for trying, and in a lot of ways suceeding, in somehow putting this much of Dune into a video game. In exchange however, the individual mechanics are all shallow. There is not enough building variety to make the economy interesting, for example. The fact that a lot of buildings can only be built in special locations, and all villages have traits that basically tell you what should go into them, removes most of the decision making, with the possible exception of picking the order in which you capture your first couple villages.

Other mechanics don't fair much better. Military basically starts and ends at military strength, meaning bigger numbers win. The ease of access to fast travel means guerilla warfare does not exist. You either have more stuff than the opponent or you don't. The Landsraad is basically just buffs or debuffs to arbitrary game aspects, and 90% of the time there is one resolution that is obviously more relevant than the rest, you vote on it, and you're done. It works somewhat okay in Multiplayer, since some of the penalties can be very harsh and the ""poker"" aspect of it can actually be relevant.

Agents are effectively just a talent points that the enemy can kidnap, and the games intrigues have nothing to do with politics. There is little to no wrestling for favour with factions or any other political maneuvering.

The most dissapointing of all is probably is the actual Planet of Arrakis. There is a valiant attempt at recreating a feeling of being in an incredibly hostile environment, but the mechanics are again nowhere near interesting enough to prop the atmosphere up. Sandworms are borderline irrelevant if you're not asleep at your desk, the worst they do is impose a temporary harvest penalty for a few seconds before the wormsign vanishes and you get back to business as usual. The deserts are easily circumvented and supply doesn't come into effect often enough to be interesting or challenging either. Ironically, Northgard managed the ""Play with the hand you're dealt"" thing way better than the game that should arguably be tailor-made for it. The Sardaukar probably say it best. ""Arrakis ain't so bad.""

Now to be fair, Northgard went through a titanic amount of work even after it's release (And arguably only really ""grew the beard"" a while into being out), so we might be looking at a similar development here in 1-2 years.

As for what the game is, you pick one of 6 factions in either a 1v1 mode, a 4 player map that can either be FFH or teams, and a conquest mode which is Shiro campaign mode. Then you start out with a base and then expand your borders to nearby villages you want to get control of using authority and like other 4x games you have other resources you will want to increase such as water (food upkeep for buildings), energy (upkeep for many things), Plascrete (used for buildings) etc. There are several victory conditions in this game too which is expected for a 4x game.

The factions themselves play differently from each other and they really spice (see what I did there) up the game with which one you pick.

Because of this I highly recommend waiting a bit before buying the game, it takes a long time to actually understand the unexplained mechanics of the game, and thus it's really hard for new players to enjoy it, given you really need to lose a lot of rounds before you can even scratch the surface of it.

Conquest is still a pretty meh gamemode, It has almost no important difference from the Battle For Arrakis mode, aside from having different maps. There's hardly any differences in gameplay, if you want to play it it's there, but BFR is definitely the best way to play the game in my opinion.

For the lore it handles Frank Herbert's world pretty well, about as well as you could when making a 4x grand strategy in a world that relies on survival. It brings some under-explored characters, and tid bits from the book as well, and integrates them as gameplay mechanics, and surprisingly makes them work. As a big fan of the books, there's some things I would have preferred they did, such as actually making use of the Bene Gesserit as the universal manipulative force that they could be. Instead the political aspect is really dumbed down to basically just saving your votes and applying faction bonuses to make policies go into effect that may affect you or your adversaries.

As an overall game right now, it's a 7/10, I bought it during a sale in early access, and back then it was worth the price, but for 35 USD I would wait for a sale at its current state.

And even if it was, it's a shame that the most noticeable review is someone whining about not having a campaign.

***

Great game, more complicated than Northgard, it's 'predecessor.' 

I don't know, feels harder, bit frustrating when I left a territory unclaimed to 'harvest' it with raids only to have the Imperial faction drop a base in the middle of my territory that has 15K health. I don't mind that they have that ability, but I do mind that they have 15K health. That's a metric ass ton of health.

And I guess I'm just not building enough military units, anyway - I think the Harknonnen are supposed to be in the red financially and make up for it with intel/raids/etc.

Went for a financial victory but pfffft. I guess I just didn't figure out how that works. I mean, I'm supposed to buy CHOAM shares but I'm not Warren Buffet so whatever.

Wanted to go for a hegemony victory but I guess they changed the rules for how that works? I don't know, I played this when it first released on early access and I could get a hegemony victory pretty quickly. Now, the AI is always ahead. *shrugs*

So anyway, yeah, great game, but I often feel overwhelmed. Northgard was like this, too, at first, but I was able to quickly pick it up. This, this not so much.

1.) a massive, huge, colossal army is ….    An army of about 8 to 10 units. 

2.) no matter how awesome you play you can never control the entire map due to the mind mindbogglingly stupid influence system.

3.) the political system is hot garbage and a waste of attention.

4.) the big spacing guild units are worthless save one and it’s only good as a troop transport to allow for being able to assault a distant enemy base without having to set up hop skip and jump bases along the way to avoid supply issues.

5.) units are bland and flavorless from harvesters to combat units and do nothing to enhance the theme, story, setting, or fun nor make use of the rich world the game is based on.

6.) the fremen faction does nothing to expand the cool factor of desert warriors. The most they do different is ride sand worms, and only very rarely as the ability takes forfrikkingever to recharge.

7.) where the hell are the Bene Gesserits? Oh they’re a spy trait. Way to waste another facet of the property. 

8.) atomics follow the greatest strategy game cliche. If you ever use one it had better win the game because otherwise everyone hates you and the AI will have them destroy you for using them. They literally cost you the game.

Seriously, why slap dune on your game and then do Jack squat to take advantage of how many books, movies ( both big screen and tv), and games came before? The wasted opportunity is absolutely shameful.

I'm not reviewing the lore, the visuals, or the audio.  I'm only reviewing the actual gameplay.  And, frankly, it's very stale.  Everything is very straightforward, and there's little strategy.  It plays more like a micromanaging simulator than an actual 4X/RTS.  

It's much, MUCH too slow for any meaningful RTS gameplay.  Units are very slow to move around the map.  There is a quicker mechanic to accomplish this via ""airlifting"" but the restrictions on when and where you can use this make it difficult.  

There is too little strategy for it to be a 4x.  Everything is too obvious in what your best move is.  ""This territory gives a bonus to Plasteel production.  I wonder what I should build there...""  ""This province has very high wind speed.  I should build a wind trap there!""  These are just a few examples of the ""decision-making"" process in this game.

The diplomacy is very shallow and, just about, entirely irrelevant.  You can ally with ""sietches"" but they don't really give you that many great benefits.  Regardless, the game is usually decided before any late-game diplomacy is involved, so it's all irrelevant.  I honestly wonder why it's even in the game unless it's a placeholder to improve this area of the game in the future.

Ultimately, it just doesn't feel like a good strategy title.  I'll admit that it is fun in its own way, but it did not really meet any of my expectations of the genre.",1694658165,1694658165,False,38,0,0.667968034744262695,0,True,False,True

This game is not Dune 2000 AND THAT'S OKAY. This is not a twitchy micro heavy game AND THAT’S OKAY. Instead, this is a hybrid of Northgard and Stellaris that makes perfect sense for those who read the Dune books. AND THAT'S OKAY. Also, Keynes is a woman AND THAT'S OKAY. Now that all the Dune 2000 and canon gatekeepers have cleared out the review can begin.  OKAY! 

Dune Spice Wars is by Shiro Games, and it is really obvious. DSW can be interpreted as a spiritual successor to Northgard with some Stellaris thrown in. Like Northgard, it is a cartoony, economy-heavy 4X RTS with fluctuating resource demands and simplistic combat that does not require a lot of micro. If you read Dune, this makes perfect sense. It is reminiscent of euro style board games (but with far more combat.) Like Stellaris there is a heavy diplomatic element in which there are regular elections, quantified political power and the ability to create or cancel laws to benefit you or harm other players. Again, this compliments Dune really well.

Resources drive everything in Dune: Spice Wars. Spice is everything. Spice is the game’s true “time limit.” Players must deliver ever-increasing amounts of spice to the Emperor or Spacing Guild depending on your faction or suffer severe penalties. And along the path in pursuit of spice, players must balance Plascrete to build more buildings, water to support more troops and villages, Solari for buildings and troops, Fuel Cells for Ornithopter scouts, Missile Batteries and Spice Refineries, Authority for claiming new territory and bonding with local Fremen tribes, Influence for elections, and more. The penalties for not delivering enough Spice are severe.

Players control the amount of Spice stockpiled for meeting their monthly requirements versus selling to CHOAM (Space Amazon) for a profit. The exchange rate fluctuates every thirty dates. Is the exchange rate good? Cut it close and make as much profit as you can. Is the exchange rate bad? Hunker down, reduce spending, and stockpile as much as you can for a better rate later.

You may think you have a perfect financial plan for your spice, but Shai-Hulud doesn’t care about it. On occasion, the sandworms will attack most factions’ Carryalls, hindering Spice production unless the Carryalls evacuate in time (straight out of the first book.) Keeping an Ornithopter attached to a Carryall as a spotter dramatically improves your ability to anticipate sandworm attacks. That doesn’t even account for other players deliberately attacking your Spice provinces with the hopes of disrupting your economy (like Northgard.)

Like Stellaris, there are elections at regular intervals, in which players can spend votes based on their standing with the Landsraad Council. Initially, this is fixed and biased towards the factions’ relationship with the rest of the universe in the Dune setting. The Emperor and supposedly goody-two-shoes House Atreides naturally have high Influence and will win the initial elections easily. The Dune native factions (the Fremen and the Smugglers) have no influence and are forced to bide their time. All factions can use buildings that generate additional Influence, and therefore, more voting power.

And like Northgard, there are no correct answers to winning. Players can win via wiping out the other factions, scoring enough Hegemony (points,) having enough political power, or an Economic victory. In a 2022 update, the Economic victory was heavily revised, requiring that players buy shares in CHOAM to the point that they own over half of it.

The tension between all this economic plate-spinning combined with competing with other factions creates a unique experience, that when combined with online play, creates an intense experience that can be performed in 3 hours or less. Faster than a 4X, and more accessible than a twitchy old school RTS, Dune Spice Wars carves out a niche like Northgard before it.",1651260194,1694560097,True,1,0,0.446839034557342529,0,True,False,True

I would consider it a reasonably entertaining 4X/RTS hybrid with some variation across the asymmetric factions, but it boils down fundamentally to a 30-90 minute skirmish game.  The Conquest mode is just a loose framework around it and doesn't really bring much more to the fun, other than to randomise the win conditions a bit.

As a standalone generic game it is a pretty good effort and I would just about recommend it to fans of the RTS style skirmish genre but there are already a lot of very good titles in the field so competition is steep.

However, its claiming to be a Dune game and as such I cannot recommend it based on its blatant disregard of many elements of the base lore of Herbert's majestic and intricately constructed universe.  It's no secret that it plays very heavily into the changes from the recent and upcoming films, which isn't that surprising, but that's no excuse in my mind.

Some of the dev interactions are also pretty caustic and have soured much of the initial open dialogue that we had in early EA.

I should start by saying I have never consumed any media related to Dune prior to this game. The closest I've come is knowing that when Bootsy Collins sings ""walk without rhythm, and you won't attract the worm"" in ""Weapon of Choice"", he's quoting Kyle MacLachlan in the Lynch film. I only preface the review with this because I feel like a lot of people come to this game as people who love the Dune world and want some sort of amazing new story set in that world in the vein of a Starcraft campaign, but, sadly (for them), I don't think that was ever the goal of this game. 
Dune: Spice Wars is one of the best Strategy games I've played in a while; it's a faster 4X game and a slower RTS game merged into something very unique. I have a few dozen hours in Civ 6 and probably a couple hundred hours across SC2, AoE, and some smaller RTS games, but, sadly (for me), I'm not very good at either genre. I love the planning that goes into the 4X format, but there is often so much of it that as we reach hour 3 of our game of Civ, only to find ourselves maybe halfway through- I feel exhausted, my attention span is spent, and I become the drunk uncle at the family game night that keeps holding up the game because they keep getting distracted. 
RTS games add the needed time crunch that keeps me engaged, how quickly I make and execute decisions directly impacts my chances at winning a game- and indeed, many times when I beat a friend in an RTS, it was simply because I had a higher APM in that match and a better build order; but this is where the time crunch becomes a double edged sword. RTS games kind of feel like fighting games in that way, where it's a sort of more complex rock-paper-scissors and if you see your opponent play paper and you can hit them with scissors enough times before they can play rock, it's just over. It requires a lot of knowledge of matchups, counters, etc. and generally requires a fair bit of labbing to get the muscle memory in place so you can hit the apm threshold needed to beat a given opponent. What I'm trying to say is that, sadly (for all of us), a lot of times in RTS and fighting games, strategy only really comes online when players are about equal in every other area.
Those are my gripes with two of my most beloved genres, some will naturally disagree, but that's not important, because it's time to get to how this game tackles those issues. The 4X one is solved by merit of being real time, the game is naturally more engaging when I don't have to wait through CPU/other players' turns. Unfortunately, I haven't had the option of playing the game in multiplayer, so I'm not sure how it translates, but the ability to pause the game in single player allows you to have the turn based feel when you need to slow down and actually make decisions. The RTS issue is solved similarly, by the merit of being 4X.
In most RTS games you can only win in one of two ways: micro victory (wiping out the other player with your army) and macro victory (Wonder victory in AoE comes to mind, you outproduce your opponent to take the win)-- unless you're playing StarCraft, then there's only one way to win (concession). Obviously either victory is going to require both good micro and good macro, but if you are better at one than the other you can lean into that to win. These options still exist in Spice Wars, but you effectively have 3 different macro victories available that all require different styles of planning and specialization to achieve. It feels like units also move and are made slower than they would in most RTS games, which is alleviated by the ability to switch between game speeds at will, but I imagine in a multiplayer game this gives you just enough time to work on macro and make serious decisions before micro demands all of your attention again. The elements from each make up for what the other lacks and produces a beautiful strategy game.

Enough comparison, I'm just gonna gush about some other things it does that I love and some complaints if they pop up and wrap this damn thing up.

The differences between each faction didn't seem clear when I first started the game but I now see it's pretty robust. There's a cool little thing that I only realized when I was about to google which techs worked well with each faction, which is that the first four are color coded to the part of the tech tree that they benefit most from; Harkonen is red like the military tech, Fremens are orange like the economy tech, et al. This may have been super obvious to some people but I thought it was just a nice bit of game design when I ran into it.
The tech tree is also very nice, I've seen some complaints that it's not very deep, which I might agree with, but it's also not very clear what the optimal path is. The way costs go up semi-exponentially as you unlock other techs means you need to have some idea of what will be optimal in the early game, mid game, and late game; it forces you to ask what you need and how soon, or if you want to invest in knowledge production to speed it up.

Don't come here looking for a single player story mode campaign. There isn't one despite perhaps everyone expecting one, as well as other features which were hinted at being availiable at launch. 

Being a fan of this game has been a weird ride. The game has spent so long in early access, and the news about updates have been very sparce, and kinda confusing.. I actually forgot it was an early access game. In 2022 one update (that I was particularly excited about checking out with friends) dropped a month after the announcement said it would, they stopped holding their breath and moved onto different games waiting for it. Heroes of Dune update was intended for 1.0, but now instead we get Ecaz the filler house. 

Despite that, it's still probably the best and truest representation of Dune you could fit into a 4X strategy game. Shiro have done an amazing job encoding so much lore and politics into a game while still keeping it well paced and exciting.

If you love Dune, you won't find a game which makes you feel more like the head of a great house or it's mentats. There's dozens of ways to defeat other houses, disrupt their supply chain, cause political conflicts, launch spy operations..

There is no single player campaign, but I think it would have elevated the game to 10/10 if there was.
(It's not too late to add one Shiro!!)

Playing in skirmishes is fine but the difficulty curve is very steep, and I imagine once a person got to a point of learning all of the AI's tendencies and consistently winning the game would lose a lot of appeal and replayability very quickly. Where's the ramp? 

It's one of the most complicated strategy games I've ever played, and last minute they took away any hope of you having anything less than an infuriating time trying to learn all of the things which can go wrong

It's disheartening to see a minority opinion being promoted and indoctrinated as the sole and correct truth in society, leading to a potential descent into totalitarianism, as history has shown in places like Germany.

Gameplay is fine, I think having four factions is the perfect number for a game of this scale and pace and I would rather see each faction get a bit more flavour than an entirely new faction. Atreides and Harkonnen are done well enough and only really need a little 'spice' here and there. Smugglers are okay but I think they could do with more choice in the direction they go, their identity is a bit bland they'd feel better with a 'dilemna' of choosing Minor House status vs 'Going Native'. The Fremen are completely mishandled, the Landsraad having any influence over Fremen affairs makes no sense and honestly they should have their own unique Sietch-diplomacy instead of any Landsraad interaction at all.

Combat is pretty basic but the units each have a distinct role and perform a lot better when used accordingly, unfortunately the AI is pretty bad at this so combat becomes simple AND easy pretty quickly. I do applaud the fact the AI pretends like it doesn't have true sight and it does this really well, I managed plenty of ambushes and feints using the Fremen and that was enjoyable enough.

Economy is really interesting early on and it genuinely feels like a struggle to survive, then you hit a threshold and you've maxed out on everything whilst the AI fumble around in the sand, spamming rebellion espionage actions in the same village over and over until it becomes very predictable. I do wish the map was bigger and that the desert itself was a ""fifth faction"" in it's hostility. Honestly the worms are entirely forgettable and barely affect gameplay aside from clicking a button when it tells you too. There's no roaming worms, no regions of high-worm activity, no worms going Shiatan on a village, really lacklustre.

Diplomacy and Esponiage has a good bedrock but the AI doesn't really seem to use it too well, they will happily sell you their precious spice stocks until they haven't enough to pay their tithes and they don't use the espionage system cleverly at all, they use peace treaty okay but that's about it, needs a lot of work there I think.

Finally my subjective opinion is that it's a crying shame they took inspiration from the latest Dune movie, it's all too clean and spiffing sci-fi and I wish they would have the beautiful desert hellscape as gritty and dark as it was in the books, or at least have done something new with it instead of copying the movie to such a degree. The artstyle is done well, I just don't personally think it fits the foot, pretty minor whinge.


---------------------
Quick Update

Developers seem to be doing their own strange thing with the newly announced House Ecaz, obviously no one can speak for the gameplay but the general concept seems really poorly thought out and sticks out like sorer thumb than nuclear warfare (That exists too now, it just makes the Laandsrad a little upset that's all haha)

Tried out the new campaign mode and it's pretty uninspired, a nice concept but it feels empty and more like a string of skirmishes.

All in all I feel as if my initial suspicion of this game being a cash-in on an IP that's gained recent mainstream appeal is correct. It feels extremely influenced by the new movie's art direction and really fails to feel 'Dune-like' in any meaningful way.

It's an okay game but if you're the type of person to get annoyed at unfaithful adaptions you will probably spend more time being annoyed by decisions than making what few the game allows you.

This game is a fantastic little Real Time 4X title with relatively simple (for the 4X genre) but still fun gameplay and strategy and a fantastic visual style.

If I have one complaint it's that while small land grabs are incredibly valuable, attacking the other 3 factions as a means to eliminate them often feels irrelevant if not outright detrimental even for more aggressive factions like the Harkonnens. It's much easier to eliminate someone through assassination or simply overpower them economically and politically than it is to kill them militarily, and these options give you the same or better rewards, with assassination eliminating them at a much lower cost and economic and political power having an impact on nearly every aspect of the game while leading directly to 2 of the 4 victory types.

Dune: Spice Wars brings to life the treacherous world of Arrakis and the factions who vie for control of its precious resources. Shiro Games gives us political intrigue, assassination plots, outright warfare, and economic hardship in a single, cohesive package. Truly, this game fulfills the fantasy of leading your people to victory or ruin in pursuit of absolute dominion.

The premier game mode of Dune: Spice Wars is ""Battle for Arrakis"", in which up to four players claim territory and duke it out to gain control of Arrakis, and with it the Spice Melange. Fortunately, each play experience has the potential for unique moments of triumph and weakness. Beyond simple military struggles and land grabs, Shiro has incorporated a robust research system that caters to numerous other play styles, while including faction-specific developments to enhance the already satisfying research paths available. This is but the tip of the iceberg for faction identity.

Each faction in Dune: Spice Wars features military units whose abilities are tailored to the faction's strengths and identity. These often pair well with the factions' individually available spy operations, and serve to enhance the significance of choosing a faction. The most transparent faction features are those that unlock as you gain greater dominion over Arrakis. These features often encourage players to go down a particular play path, so experimentation is required to discover which faction suits the user best. Smugglers rarely aim to control the most land, for instance, but instead use their resources to install underworld headquarters' on enemy territory. Atreides will often use their influence rather than manpower to expand and manipulate politics in their favor. Faction identity and play style is further refined through the choice of two councilors from a pool of four unique to each faction, diversifying play even when a player chooses the same faction multiple games in a row.

Player choice is at the core of the Dune: Spice Wars experience. Which village will you annex first, one that increases Plascrete production or one that provides a bonus to military experience? How much of your spice production will you exchange for Solari (currency). Do you want to invest in the Choam Market to slow your opponent's economic victory? Is a treaty worth giving your opponent breathing room? Do you utilize atomic weapons in your conquest and risk attack from the Landsraad Guard? Choices are presented at every junction and it's up to the player to navigate the sea of possibility and chart a path to victory.

Many will come to this game for the flavor of Dune, and they will find it a bountiful harvest. Your first priority is the spice, which you must use to periodically pay a tax (or bribe) to ensure you will not experience economic sanctions or be attacked. Sandworms will be attracted to your spice harvesting operations (and the movements of troops over land), so you must be ever vigilant lest you lose that which you struggle most for. Sandstorms will also periodically sweep the land, disrupting spice gathering operations, damaging buildings, and killing stranded mechanical and military units alike. The aforementioned councilors are named characters you will recognize from the Dune franchise. Politics are key to victory, with resolutions frequently up for vote that may help or hinder one or multiple factions. Indeed, becoming governor of Arrakis is even a path to victory. But beware brazenly controlling the Landsraad, for you may put a target on your back. Where military power fails, assassination may prevail.

Which brings us to the espionage system. This wouldn't be a Dune game without spies and covert operations. Over time, you aquire agents who you can assign to monitor other factions, including core non-player entities such as the Spacing Guild, the Landsraad, even the people of Arrakis itself. Counterintelligence also features here, and is essential to preventing (read: delaying) assassination. Perhaps your opponent thinks they can weaken your territory by sabotaging your defensive missile batteries. With agents manning counterintelligence, you may capture your enemy's agent, and make them a useful bargaining chip in future negotiations. Shiro Games has done extensive work to immerse players in the dangerous position of a leader beset on all sides, and it shows.

All of this and I have yet to mention the single player Conquest mode recently introduced. Here you play as one of the (current) three Landsraad factions and attempt to dominate Arrakis through a series of sorties that act as miniature versions of the main game mode (Battle for Arrakis) with specific objectives apart from the traditional victory conditions. The missions and maps are different with each Conquest, so this mode offers a great deal of replayability when you can't find a multiplayer game to join. It also makes for an excellent teacher of basic game mechanics for those who are newer to the game, and gives a good opportunity for players to learn Harkonnen, Atreides, and Corrino (the factions currently playable in conquest).

Obviously I've focused on the positives up to this point, I suppose there's room for the negatives. Faction balance is not strictly even at the time of writing, but Shiro has been tuning this regularly and I expect will continue to do so. Assassination can at times be an uninspired way to lose the game since you can potentially never know an assassination is ongoing against you. This is where the value of counterintelligence comes in, which a player must choose to invest their rare/valuable agents into. Tutorials are currently not comprehensive, which makes for a high barrier to entry for newer players. Performance can occasionally take a hit in the late game as well.

Lacking an eternity to gush about this game, I must conclude: Dune: Spice Wars is an absolute gem that to me is shockingly underplayed, but not to worry. I'll keep getting my friends to buy it, if only so I can crush them into dust and scatter their remains across the sands of Arrakis.

When they changed the fremen to be lead by a woman when they were a patriarchal society, I left it alone because they said that this mirrored the new movies. annoying but a understandable choice. Even though I don't think this character would lead the freman and should instead be a advisor character. 

But now the latest faction has altered another house and swap its book character archduke Armand Ecaz into a black woman, and just adding a A to Armand. If they wanted so much to have another female lead house, they could have made another house faction. 

The developers are willing to have guns be usable unlike the lore, they shouldn't have trouble making a strong female house faction, with cool mechanics rather than stealing another character from the original book and doing the blatant alteration of gender and race swapping. If this is an alternate universe they are willing to alter so blatantly, they should focus their energy on adding new units and environmental hazards that improve the game-play. 

Anyone who is a fan of the original books should avoid this adaptation. I am taking this as a sign of the wrong direction of development. I guess this is the problem with early access.

Nevertheless, Dune: Spice Wars managed to capture and keep me, by giving me a happy middle-ground between the two.

This game has deep systems which remain accessible to the player in their simplicity. It has three gamemodes - Battle of Arrakis, a 4-player contest played either in an FFA or 2v2 format; Kanly Duel - a fast-paced 1v1 with more abundant resources to get you straight into the thick of it; and Conquest, a (to my mind) very interesting roguelite campaign mode where you gain unique bonuses and face interesting challenges. Conquest is by far my favourite mode; I have submitted countless bits of feedback in hopes to see it improved. Currently, in Early Access, it suffers from a slight lack of variety and a few bugs that make it unappealing after the first 3-4 runs with each faction, but I'm certain we'll see it improved with the launch of 1.0. I'll see if I can update this review once the game releases.

As any game, it does a lot of things right, and a few things wrong. Where it stands out for me, however, is the developers. Devs respond to feedback frequently, either by implementing it or explaining why they don't want to or cannot do it. They frequently share their design philosophy and engage in two-sided dialogue with the players that ask the questions. In this way, they keep all the things the game is doing right, while diligently patching all the things the game does wrong. I have seen bits of my own feedback in the patch notes, and it feels incredibly gratifying. I can't say I've felt the same positivity for many other companies in the modern gaming industry, and I want to celebrate it.

Frank Herbert encouraged free thinking in his books; warning against the act of blindly following someone's ideology just because it makes you feel good about yourself or your feelings. I do not like his worldbuilding, but at least I can agree - the act of making huge blobs of negativity on functionality you haven't actually seen implemented, just because someone else said they don't like it, and you want in on the bandwagon... is, to charitably put it, horribly misguided.",1693826890,1693826890,True,2,0,0.498187780380249023,0,True,False,True

It takes elements of both and combines them into this weird mixture of both systems. Real time combat, tech trees, diplomacy, espionage and more. These systems that might be deep and fully fleshed out in their respective genres are simplified quite a bit, which is definitely alienating for people expecting a pure 4X or a pure RTS, as this is neither. If you're looking for a pure 4X or RTS (Dune 2000 remake) this is not it.

Without this expectation though, and definitely for fans of both genres there can be some appreciation for what they've managed to do here, as its truly a very unique experience that I haven't quite had before in a game.It creates complexity in the breadth of things available to you and decision trees become vast and complex as each game is always not quite like the last. 

The game has a few different modes, Conquest(Basically customized skirmish games in the form of a campaign(no story)), Skirmish(Which can be MP), and Kanly (1v1, Can be MP). This review is from early access (for posterity) and I do hope they continue brushing up conquest, like its fine but its nothing really special. The game shines if you're ever able to get into the MP scene where the games feel incredibly rewarding to play. Skirmish against AI is good, for a while, but as with most AIs in games the more you play the more you begin to see the cracks. It did take me quite a bit of time (as you can see) to start seeing a lot of these cracks but I still do find the game enjoyable with the AI (though Shiro if you read this improving the AI would be great). 

All in all if you're looking for a interestingly weird and unique strategy game I feel like you should definitely give this game a try, but if you're looking for a true 4X or true RTS this is probably not it. 

Now to lore.....

The game feels like Dune. Its atmospheric, visually striking, and is a well realized adaptation of the universe from the books - though don't expect a lot of story, there is plenty of flavor especially for those who read all the text blurbs but this is a game built for replayability and too much story likely would've become tedious by the eighth smack down outside the gates of Arrakeen or Carthag.

The core game experience is an adjustable skirmish mode - pick your settings, pick your faction, pick advisors that provide different major bonuses, and off you're plopped into your main base/city somewhere on Arrakis. The map like a game board is broken into territories each with various attributes and resources. Some are deep desolate desert that obstruct and swallow up ground units, some have rare minerals, some promote base building synergy, and the best have high wind levels where you want to build wind traps to collect water OR have that precious, life extending, mind expanding spice - the reason any outsider is on Arrakis at all. 

You have to pay a spice tax by the way - if you miss your payment you get hit with debuffs and if you miss enough payments the Landsraad sends troops to punish you and i've seen an AI faction get destroyed this way - too bad but they should've protected their spice fields from my veteran swordsman.  

There are various was to win such as: Domination (destroying all opposing main bases by brute force or guile), Diplomacy (being voted the governor through the landsraad which is its own gameplay system), Economy (Own majority shares of CHOAM the mercantile hegemony of the Dune Universe), and Hegemony (Haven't figured this one out yet but it seems equivalent to a cultural victory in other games). Most gameplay systems are simple but the way they interweave can be overwhelming at first and satisfying once figured out.

This game shines on more contained maps such as small or medium because annexing territories is strategic and smaller maps ramp up that pressure to a strategic scramble. See, annexation costs water and authority, water you get from building more windtraps but authority you amass over time and while the rate can be increased by agents and research its never fast and the farther from your main base the more authority is required to annex. Early game you'll stake out the core of your empire but eventually you hit a wall and have to choose which territory do you go for now and which one do you risk falling into an opponent's hands. Do I try to extend toward a third spice field or do I try and get that region with a natural wonder that boost research so I can build heavy soldiers OR do I take the region with level 7 wind so I can boost my water levels to expand my army because, of course, troops require water to support? 

I play skirmish on medium maps at hard difficulty and they typically last 2-3 hours. This is probably the biggest feature of the game for me, long enough to be intensive but short enough to feel guilt free lol

Its not the most hardcore RTS out there but its fun and challenging enough.

The 4X style systems are too numerous and too complex for them to be easily implemented in real time, so as the midgame develops, you feel like you're frantically managing cooldown timers more than anything else. The same systems might have worked well in a turn-based format that allowed the player enough time to thoughtfully engage with the systems... or maybe not. The game gives me a lot of the same vibes as the generic Slitherine 4X games that always end up feeling very beige. As for the RTS elements, they are pretty shallow and cannot stand on their own merits.

I see that some of the lore/setting decisions are controversial. Sometimes this is for good reasons, sometimes for questionable ones. For my part, the idea of having a house whose sole reason for being on Arrakis is to build a hotel is just silly. It makes that house hard to take seriously, and its very presence undermines the atmosphere that the devs were trying to build.

I would also say that the writing is pretty poor. Many names for technologies, spy missions, etc, read like they were generated by using a thesaurus of cool scifi words. Ironically, it is hard for me to put this into words myself, but take a close look at the tech tree and you'll see what I mean. It's not like it's written in ungrammatical English or anything like that, but there is something subtly... off about the names.

If you want just slow pace rts with a lot of unique mechanics, the game is for you.

If you are here for the Dune game or atmosphere of that specific universe - then I have bad news for you. 

There is already lore abomination in form of house Ecaz with some additions from art team on top of them. The problem here is not black transgender house leader, real problem is that there  are plenty of strong woman and different characters to choose in canon, a lot of options to make everyone happy on release (everyone excited about Ix or Tlailaxu for example), but devs decided to take house from EU (which is glorified fanfiction for considerable part of fandom) that never was on Arrakis, gave them most absurd reason to be here: to build an amusement park! And on top of that, change house leader gender and aesthetics. And the worst of it, that there is no reason for this change story wise. Just change for the sake of change. It is a statement which I cannot support.

It seems dev team see “involving community in EA” only in reporting bugs.  A shame really. There was no real discussion, and the idea of the poll was rejected outright. Looks like a classic cashgrabing approach to franchise which is expected from Netflix, Electronic Arts or Amazon and usually not from a small studio. Take some beloved franchise, promise to be as faithful to source material as possible, kindly take money and then start pulling unexpected lore defying twists. 

One member of dev team is active here on Steam forum and I received clarification on that subject I'll just leave it here:
1. No plans to change the design, we're happy with our direction and so are the majority of our players. You can't please everyone, and again, this exact scenario happened with Liet Kynes' reveal which also proved to be a very vocal minority.
2. They've been taken into account and discussed but they don't reflect the wider response of the community/players.
3. This is a game based on Frank Herberts works and will continue to use it's characters and the world as it's primary inspiration and direction.
4. Steam deal with refunds as distributors, that's not a decision for us to make.",1693496709,1693496709,False,29,1,0.516028761863708496,1,True,False,True

In a nutshell, this game confuses MORE with BETTER. This is a trap I feel that many 4x games fall into, and its compounded here because its bolted onto an RTS frame. So you lack time to deal with the nitty gritty that you might if the game was turn-based. The game is pausable playing against the computer, but this isn't possible playing against people.

So my basic beef with the MORE is that most of the MORE are different points/currencies which allow you to acquire benefits which give a relatively small percentage boost in acquiring other points/currencies. Besides outright military victory (which is probably the most difficult victory) there are a number of other victories which come about when you've accumulated enough of one set of points/currencies, more or less.

This is rather dull. The percentage increases are quite incremental, and growth feels more linear than exponential; in fact, it seems asymptotic, making it harder and harder to keep growing as the game progresses.

This is compounded by the fact that the game certainly doesn't explain how these points interact in the tutorial, and also it is fairly opaque in the UI where the points are going and coming. At least that's true of Hegemony, which turns out to be the most popular victory condition.

Most Modern RTSes have eschewed the vanilla ""percent bonus"" upgrade alone to introduce interesting new behaviors and radical changes in unit capabilities. I would point to Company of Heroes as an outstanding example of such game. The emergent situations that happen there are exciting and interesting. Here combat is almost exclusively a numbers game.

A couple of smaller issues. The Landstraad will often have voting on issues that affect everyone; if I really took the time to analyse how that issue would affect my opponents (and tbh, most of the time you don't have that information), I might care, but I never really have time for that, nor is it much fun to be totalling up how much benefit in numbers they are getting from this or that point system. Even if you win a faction advantage, inevitably it is another percent boost in something, which you hardly even notice as you are distracted by so much else. Certainly you don't notice if your opponent gets it.

A small pet peeve I have is micro-managing spice mining. While the spice miners are picked up automatically at worm sign, you have to watch for the worm to go away and send the miner back to mining. This is needless busy-work IMHO, and should be automated.

So just to point out some good things. The game is very well executed and I find the UI pretty intuitive and easy to use. Bug-free as far as I can tell. The pausablity is a God-send. It is a good-looking game.

I believe the developers are really trying hard to make a good game, and I think this is case of good-intentions gone awry. The game needs to add complexity where it makes a more interesting/strategic game not for the sake of giving the player more things to do.

Good real time 4X set in the Dune universe.  Each faction has unique powers that make playing each one a different experience.  For example, the Atreides are stronger on defence and have powerful council bonuses, while the Smugglers aren't even on the council at the start, but can steal a % of resources from enemy cities.  

As of now, the game lacks a story-based campaign, but comes with a Conquest mode.  This is a map with multiple provinces and you pick which province to conquer next.  After playing through that area and winning, you can choose a permanent bonus which will be with you for the remainder of the maps.  Each region has a specific goal for victory.  It might be to accrue enough Hegemony, find the hidden sietch (and then destroy or protect it), destroy the enemy base within a specific time period, etc.  Each region also has secondary goals like be voted to 2 Charters in the council, don't lose X number of men, etc.  Secondary goals increase your Fremen standing, which provides other bonuses for the duration of the Conquest campaign.

The game is faithful to the Dune universe. The factions, units, and technologies are all based on the books and movies.
The gameplay is deep and strategic. There are a lot of different factors to consider, such as resource management, unit placement, and diplomacy.

The game is challenging but rewarding. It takes a lot of skill and strategy to win, but it's very satisfying when you do.
The game is beautifully rendered. The graphics are top-notch, and the sound effects are immersive.

Overall, I think Dune: Spice Wars is a fantastic RTS game that captures the essence of the Dune universe. If you're a fan of the books or movies, or if you're just looking for a challenging and rewarding RTS game, then I highly recommend checking it out.

Many, if not all of the negative reviews critique the game due to the accuracy and respect to Dune's lore. However this is a game... If you want 'lore accurate' then watch the old film or read the old novels- simple.

The game itself is magnificent and probably my favourite amongst my selection for RTS games. I don't have much time to play games as much as I like to anymore- but this game is satisfying enough to play in the free time that I have it.

The mechanics are quite simple, and very easy to master so that you can enjoy more of the time you play rather than spending it on learning how to play.

Pro's:
* Magnificent graphics and soundtrack
* Satisfying gameplay
* I have yet to encounter any bugs
* Multiple styles of play (many different win conditions)
* Very frequent updates being made to the game
* Good replay-ability as you try other factions/win in different ways

Con's:
* Some balancing problems with some factions superior than others - but I guess this is expected in all/most RTS'
* No option to ""realistically"" prevent assassinations

House Ecaz is Shiro's contribution to Herbert's Curse. It is remarkably tone-deaf even by game developer standards, Ecaz is on the most treacherous planet in the universe in order to [b]build a resort[/b]. This does not reconcile with the source material. Ecaz either trivializes the existing Houses by turning the planet into an amusement park, or they're exceptionally incompetent and pick resort locations using bottom-tier mentats. 

It's likely the latter, based on the art their leader wore a bejeweled robe with a long cape to a desert planet known for endless sand dunes (contrast this with the form-fitting, utilitarian motif of the other faction uniforms). They're on the planet wearing jewels and drinking from goblets, the very picture of the stolid complacency of wealth, out-of-touch with the planet they're on as much as the Emperor's entourage was in the first book. Where the source let you make your own conclusions about how humanity devolved back into feudalism, Ecaz is as subtle as a sledgehammer, with a unit roster that is explicitly medieval, because you can't be trusted to make your own conclusions. I could go on, but I'll just echo the community, there were many other good, lore-friendly House choices that didn't source from the awful B. Herbert and KJA materials.

The game is actually quite enjoyable otherwise. However, this review and downvote is for Shiro's contribution to the pile of low-quality, hackneyed Dune fan fiction that gets awkwardly bolted on to the brilliant originals.

Also the tutorial is so basic you don't even need a tutorial unless you want to reassure yourself. The gameplay really only gets interesting in late game with more units taking up to an hour. Tech tree is confusing but you learn it from trial and error. The politics is really confusing and should be the main focus of the tutorial cause half the game is politics, a quarter is economics and the rest is military. Also I never figured out the agents even though I put them in random slots and tried to get them to do missions, they never made sense.

The game is basically Northgard re-skinned in Dune with new unpopular factions being added. I think many more factions that people don't really know will be added to the point that the main factions will be a different skill set of Military, Economics, Diplomacy bonuses taking away the power they have in the story over the other landsratte houses.

What I like is the spice crawler being almost eaten by sand worms going around it and the unit models look cool although I think there's a bit too many units with some being useless. Also the devs seem a bit fishy based off this games steam reviews which is abnormal for steam games I see. 

I wish I could refund the game cause it's lackluster and gets boring almost immediately although I haven't done a multiplayer game I can't see it being any better. 

Also the trailers are really misleading cause when I first saw them I heard the great voice acting and sound which somehow made this game look better then it is. Don't let the story of dune make you buy this game, look at the gameplay without the theatrics and imagine doing that for hours.

I enjoy the game, personally.
This game is still in early access, so things may well change. Take the review with a grain of salt.
Overall I think it's a solid RTS and one of the better Dune experiences.

Pros:
It's a multi-layered approach to a rich franchise. Historically games trying to capture the allure of Dune have only focused on a single aspect (typically combat, like Dune 2 and similar RTS). This game layers diplomacy and politics to varying extents.

Each layer is fun in it's own right. You can roll over your enemies, or assassinate their leaders. You can focus on whichever aspect appeals most, but you DO need to work with them all or you will lose to someone who does.

The lore feels appropriate without being imbalanced or heavy-handed. The various factions function in ways that are flavorful, but still competitive.

Cons:
Since there are multiple aspects to the systems involved (RTS is the focus, but not the ONLY layer), none of them are quite as good as you would find in a game that focuses more heavily on a singular element. It's not a Starcraft, or a Dune2/2000 (RTS), or a Crusader Kings (Diplomatic/Political layer), really anything with a hyper focus. If you are expecting something just like those this may not be for you. You aren't going to mass enormous armies of monstrously powerful tanks. The military choices available to each faction are limited.

The AI is somewhat weak, and so appears to have various resource buffs. This may cheapen how your battles feel at times.

Unrelated comments:
Most people want to compare this to Westwood's take on the Dune franchise. Those were certainly fun games, but were solely focused on the RTS side, and left the rest of the flavor and elements by the wayside. I don't think the comparison between those games is apt or relevant.

Many people will also compare this to Northgard, the studio's other big game so far. There is a lot of truth to that in the way it feels. The zone approach to the map, with limited construction options and specialization options for each one really underscores it as you build up your faction on each map. But I think it has merits of it's own, and shouldn't just be considered a ""northgard rip-off,"" as it has many unique aspects.  

There are a lot of discussions about this game's choices in the characterization of individuals (gender, race, etc), and complaints about favorite characters or factions not being developed yet. I can acknowledge that is not a 1-1 depiction of the books. Your personal mileage may vary with that, and that's OK. I'm a book fan personally, and every now and then something doesn't quite fit. But there is plenty of content that is enjoyable whether you're a literary fan or not.",1692997770,1692997823,True,14,5,0.484271705150604248,0,True,False,True

Played this right after it dropped into early access and saw a lot of potential.  And as I do with EA games I decided to keep it and wait for 1.0 to fully enjoy it since they promised a campaign.  

Now 1.0 is releasing with no campaign.  Huge disappointment.  Conquest mode seems like a cop out replacement for a proper campaign.  And now adding house Ecaz of all things seems like a baffling decision, at least to me.  

Maybe it will yet live up to it's potential, but if all you want is a skirmish based RTS with no campaign there are much better options, just without the Dune setting.

Update August 23:
Many reworks have made the game a lot better. It's still a slow-paced RTS with a surprisingly deep asymmetric game play (between factions). PVP is where the game absolutely shine and, having played it with 3 friends (or ex friends should I say), we just haven't had this feeling in years.
Overall very confident on the future but the game is allowing a lot of replayability.

Aside from that, the game strategy is very complex and fun to explore. There is a balance you have to maintain throughout the game to make sure you're managing every possible outcome. The ways in which you can can win are varied and another faction can easily steal a win if you aren't paying attention (damn you house Corrino). The real time aspect also adds a layer of tension, although there is a pause button in single player.

My main complaint that I had when I started playing is that there isn't much in the way of tutorials after you learn the basic mechanics. They give you basics of the game and then throw you in to the full game. However, after playing a few games on easy I quickly learned the game. I would say it takes around 10 hours, or three to four games, to fully understand the game's mechanics. 

Finally, I will say if you don't already like the atmosphere of Dune or didn't have interest in/didn't read the first book, the game play might not be very enjoyable to you. I find it so enjoyable because I really like the series and the gameplay does make you feel like you're part of it. It adheres nicely to the source material.

The intimate scale of the map/conflict makes every decision give immediate feedback. The emphasis on smaller skirmish's and raiding, giving way to large scale conflicts in the endgame, gives a great feeling of progression

Diplomacy is fun, with some pretty major decisions into where you want to pump influence into.

Overall- love this game. The criticisms I hold for it are as follows
Conquest is lackluster. Destroying an enemy base takes way too long especially when you know after the first 5 minutes whether you're going to succeed, then have to commit for the next 20 minutes.

Obviously it's a bit rough around the edges sometimes, but it's actually already a lot of fun to play. 

Positive:
- Dune atmosphere
- Innovative game mechanics
- Politics, military, economy, research all have their roles and influence one another in a way that makes the game more complex and fun than the sum of its parts
- The combat system has few units, but they're all useful
- The campain has different types of missions that require different playstyles

My thoughts on what could be improved:
- The ""campaign"" has no story - I think it would really improve the game if we could follow the fall and resurgence of house Atreides from the book in a story-driven way
- The capture-a-village-to-build-some-buildings system is rather dull and repetitive. The village traits are a poor incentive to micro-manage which buildings to put down. Why am I limited to building only one of each in every village anyway? Why couldn't I fill the whole planet with windtraps if I wanted to? I think it would be better if each village had a number of inhabitants that limits the amount of buildings and you could just build buildings wherever you wished. Not sure this is the optimal solution, but the village building system needs an overhaul.
- Some victory conditions are unbalanced, mostly in the sense that there's sometimes little you can do stop someone from winning - for example getting 50% of CHOAM shares, or assassinations.
- Dune doesn't seem as forbidding as it could be. Your heavily armored troops are happy to trot around in the full blazing sun for far too long. I like the day/night cycle, but it could be made more extreme to allow more tactical options. For example, day time could disable (or severely penalize) any heavy troops, allowing for skirmishes and hit-and-run attacks with stillsuit-equipped troops where the fremen reign supreme, while night-time is where the Sardaukar dominate. This mechanic could perhaps be linked to the water supply - heavy troops use more water during the day and start to die if you run out.
- Dune doesn't seem as mystical as it could be. This would tie in to the first point about the campaign quite well. There are hardly any references the Bene Gesserit and none to the Tleilaxu or Kwisatz Haderach. For all its faults the old Emperor: Battle for Dune had some interesting mystical nonsense happening in the campaign, and such an atmosphere could really improve the gameplay experience. Another option is to introduce Stellaris-like mini-stories: a reverent mother at a sietch tells of a prophecy. A facedancer appears in one of your villages. An old research station is full of sandtrout. Or perhaps Tleilaxu experiment with spice has gone horribly wrong.",1690813150,1690813150,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

However, if these gripes aren't enough to deter you from experiencing a superbly balanced and engaging RTS, still in early access, I really can't recommend Spice Wars enough. 

It's thrilling to me to see my all-time favorite grand-sci-fi story and universe represented in this way, from the atmosphere generated by the world of Dune and the means through which you can interact with Arrakis and the Imperium at large, gameplay that rewards patience and consideration, operating ""plans within plans within plans"" (as Baron Harkonnen would say) to play to your faction's inherent and selected strengths (depending on which councilors you pick) and outwit your opponents, and, of course, the developers' clear loyalty to and appreciation for Frank Herbert's work, the game owing much of its own competence to Dune's intricately crafted and highly dynamic lore. And, reminiscent to how Dune's story is actually told in the books, power in Spice Wars can take many faces, but remains the same in nature - in the game, this philosophy is reflected in its every facet, creating a certain strategic syncretism that I have had yet to experience in another game (maybe I haven't looked hard enough). But from my experience thus far, the game truly puts a fully interactive Arrakis in the palm of the player's hand, and for a project that isn't even complete yet, we have every reason to expect further greatness to come.

Edit: Dare I say it, I wasn't wrong. The recent Conquest update is absolutely fantastic, especially for fans of singleplayer roguelike strategy. It adds an entirely new mode of larger scale than either of the previous two, in which you play as one of the three major noble houses (Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino) and take on various types of missions that are conveniently available on a bird's-eye view map of the planet's entire northern hemisphere, or at least the part that can sustain human life. The devs say that each run is procedurally generated from a selection of mission templates that will expand with future updates, and will provide somewhere around 10 hours of playtime per run. In my experience, this seems accurate, obviously to the mutual benefit of everyone. If you've had any doubts about the game before, you should probably check it out, either here or on YouTube for no cost other than time.

Those familiar with the franchise will appreciate that the Spice does not directly translate into money (that being the Solari), but you can set how much of your income you keep to pay your imperial Tax (or bribe the Spacing Guild in the Fremen's case) and how much you sell directly into the open market (which you can then buy shares in). The amount of Spice you need increases each month, so the game forces you to keep expanding or you lose the political benefits of being able to fulfil your contract...and earn the ire of the empire itself. But expanding isn't that easy. Anything on the sands (including harvesters) has a chance to attract a worm, which will eat whatever it finds, but the rocky areas are safe staging posts. Unfortunately, being out in the open also drains your units supplies, and so a military campaign requires a lot of investment and preparation.

This leads on to the main focus of the game, espionage and politics. Being in open combat with a faction does not prevent trade, and you can use a promise to stop trying to assassinate someone as part of a deal, or even just trade captured spies. Having a truce with someone unlocks longer lasting contracts such as economic agreements. But this does not stop you from infiltrating them. Everyone expects you to be looking into everyone else, and are doing the same to you. It's only a betrayal of their trust if you use it for something aggressive rather than information gathering, such as sneaking a thumper into where their army is gathering to make a sandworm attack them. If you're good you can win the game entirely on the strength of your spies and their affects on the world. The other large political component is the Landsraad. Every few weeks this council of minor and major houses gathers to discuss several political ideas. The member factions (the ones with House in their name) have set numbers of votes to support or discourage these, but everyone has political influence that they can use to further nudge the result how they would prefer. This can create massive opportunities for players if worked on properly, and is key to one of the victory conditions.

I have only done two matches so far, and so have not tried all of the factions, but each one seems suitably distinct in play style even when they share buildings. A few interesting examples: most factions can build airfields to move people around the map, but the Fremen can ride worms around if they have Thumpers available; everyone can infiltrate and cause a lot of damage with it, but the Harkonnens can make it a suicide mission for the spy to get the operation over with fast at the cost of needing to hire a replacement; House Corrino, being the house of the Emperor, can deploy a secondary main base to help co-ordinate and reinforce their settling procedures, while House Atreides can annex villages peacefully using their political influence and reputation for being honourable so that their military can work elsewhere. (Edit: forgot to mention the Smugglers, who can create underworld buildings in other people's territory to sneakily expand and leech off of everyone else.)

In summary, it's a very interesting game. The combat may seem simplistic, but between unit effects and the tide-turning power of espionage it gets more mechanically complex quickly, and the AI will use it against you without hesitation (and leads to chaotic scenarios such as releasing chemical weapons in my own territory to try and discourage an invasion while my troops got there, while the enemy dropped an EMP to weaken my defences and tried to use a thumper to make a worm eat my troops before they arrived). Tutorials are in it at this point, although while they do let you work out some things yourself they can be repeated whenever you like and the in-session pop ups can be set to show up each game to remind you.

Edit: Another thing that is interesting is the limit on your army size. Most battles are skirmishes and while you can have stationed militias in areas and build defences, your actual aggressive capabilities and response forces have to be carefully thought out when your territory expands.

The early exploration game, however, can be a bit painfully slow, and you'll be wishing you had more than a 2x speed.

To win via military can be a struggle as home bases are incredibly strong (But winning by military is incredibly fun and longs out the games). But theres way to counter this with operations.

I fully appreciate the effort and respect for lore/canon (you people are also fans and that's a good thing).
I also appreciate that it's in early access.

However, the systems are cumbersome (can we disable some?)
The campaign is conceptually flawed (why can we complete (definitive end game task) which would lead to total victory in any other mode, yet we still need to fight future conflicts?
You can win anyway you like! However, if you haven't invested in military and the enemy attacks, you're DEAD. Like every other game that's every suggested this path.

I'll check back in later, hope to be proved wrong in the long run.

Campaign suggestion:
Instead of slightly modified skirmish missions strung together, could we have a narrative attached?
ie. Atreiedes campaign starts with you in a lose only mission, harkonnen and emperor attack. Then you become renegade (similar to smugglers) until you rebuild strength, become a full house again and then do a final battle for victory.
That would be interesting an not just procedural generated repetition. Also, lore and canon respected.
Just a thought.

We play Northgard every yearly LAN (yes we still phisically move into one Room and sit there for 3 days with 8 people drinking beer and playing games).

I somewhat wished it would support 8 players like Northgard but I guess that would be to crazy for this game. 

I'm a versatile player and not a specialist on 4X games. But my recent memory lets me compare it to Endless Space 2 or Age of Wonders 3. I guess the biggest difference for me is the fact that the game is full Realtime. I like that. But must admit whilest playing singleplayer fallback to pausing the game just to get a brief moment of respite. Just like in Northgard there are various possibilities to achieve victory (still not sure how to actually go for a majority stockholder victory) and require you to optimize Development (Research Tree).

We need to try it on our next LAN when the earlier sleepers go to bed and the 4 night-owls still are up. Wonder how the game plays when I can't just pause the game.

There is one huge flaw at the moment and that is the performance in Mid-Late game. At a certain point the game becomes slower. Small stutters, ingame menus take longer to open, moving the map is laggy... I had the same experience with every Total War game, the longer the game takes, the more unplayable it gets. It's not as bad as Total War games tough.. still runs pretty smooth but it can be frustrating when many things are going on at once to keep your calm when the menus just don't react as responsive as previously.

I always have to keep looking up how to get a harvester setup. The whole thing feels like a board game that you didn't get to read the rules for beforehand and where setup takes an hour.

Small update: I sunk a ton of hours into the Conquest mode recently, which is alright, I guess. I still feel that the very early and the mid to late-mid gameplay is slow, almost tedious. Normally with Dune, the universe setting and the storytelling might tide me over, but here that's also a bit too much in the background for me.

Edit: Since the developers asked: Im doing a Defense mission on Hard as Corrino vs Atreides. You start with horrible economy in defecit and only have a brief moment to fix it, barely have time to research anything to improve your economy, you have to go for all out defense.

I spent every single resource i had on building defenses, max missile turrets, garrison, try to hire as many units as i can (with my horrible economy since i have no econ upgrades)

You fight huge hordes of Atreides non stop, i BARELY manage to replenish my garrison before another wave hits, over and over, the lulls in their waves are way to brief, in the end i get attacked by a SEVENTEEN+ wave of units which just steamrolls my defenses.(this wasnt even the last wave) If you dont kill them fast enough, you wont have time to replenish your garrison before next wave hits, you will barely have enough to make new units. 

If a second wave spaws before you kill the first one its basically impossible, since Atreides gain AoE bonuses from other units, and their deathball will just roll over you. They are also incredibly tanky with several Wardens with Healing drones, stalling me until next horde can combine with them.

Even if i hold out for the reinforcement army that one is way to weak, even when i paused and microed they could kill my entire reinforcement army underneath my HQ spamming missiles at them.

I would not call this a slight disadvantage.

I have also restarted this mission several times, trying different strategies, same result in all of them.

Game is slow. It would be okay if there was a lot to do, but that's just not the case.

Unit control is also a complete fucking mess. Sometimes they'll push past units to go after others and you have to micro them.... Which is ass since selecting single units isn't easy at all... Often lose units because they walk into main base or missile battery range even though I am scurting said range. Lost a few flying units because they just follow enemies.
Also, it's either units do whatever they want and chase to the ends of the earth or they just stand still and don't even bother helping other units next to them (if you order them to stand ground). Stand ground should make it so that units have a certain engagement radius, instead of standing there either like punching bags or like douche bags that don't help their comrades 5mm away.

Boring, slow, a chore to micro (and I played starcraft 2), not much there...

I really don't what it is but I find opening elements good and then I just struggle with the mid transitional play of the game. The mid section of a game should set you up for final pitched battles with opponents but more often than not a resource crunch happens and there is not guidance to resolve it. You just end up begin crunched up..

I think there is so many little bonuses skill links in the game yet no proper guidance on how these works..so rather than a partial logical approach I find myself just guessing. Its more than likely just me but the in-house guidance is a little muh! 

I personally haven't got to the end of a session in this game on multiple occasions, so strange it seems easier just to quit it but again come back weeks or months later. I dunno its odd why a mid point seems so muh! Honestly graphically and feel beautiful.

Simple combat has a satisfying RTS / 4x blend of decision and depth without falling back on turn based tactical battles other 4xs have explored (Endless Legends, Age of Wonders). I don't mind turned based, but some certainly do given it breaks up / slows down play. Appreciate pause was included, but I can see that playing without pause was clearly intended as the preferred style of play. Feels rewarding to play with it off as the game has a more brisk pace and a good tempo of events.

The ""throttle"" concept that has been building traction in 4x is always nice, though some probably hate it. What I refer to as ""throttling"" the game is a resource that is tough to ""break"" or produce exponentially. It is generally used in claiming territory and insures there is some sustained competitiveness even when factions benefit from more bold abilities regarding other resources. This allows factions to be a little more exciting and asymmetrical without the risk of them getting out of hand. This can be seen in a lot of Paradox titles with regards to systems like Prestige for claims in Crusader Kings and Influence in Stellaris. Paradox isn't the best at figuring out how to use them, but I think Shiro Games has really nailed it.

The only negative is really about me, I don't find Dune really that interesting of a setting. Fortunately I think this engine could shine in a lot of preparations. My lack of play compared to other 4xs is likely is more about me not being interested in the factions versus the game play.

I imagine multiplayer is quite fun, but not my thing. The game seems decently balanced and designed for a multiplayer experience while not detracting from the single player one.

I don't know if the tutorial will change when main game is finished but for now you must play one player first to learn the tutorial.

I really want to like this game and I hope that they do make some changes. This is very similar to stellaris in a lot of ways, which was done pretty well in comparison. There are a few huge issues in my opinion and they're not bugs. Overall, the game operates very well as designed, but you're stuck on a pretty basic path. You can't pick a strategy and go for it. I played Harkonen and Fremen and they didn't feel very different personally. Air power is nearly unusable and definitely not worth the investment. The raiders had a mech unit, but that's it.

First off, the economics are extremely convoluted and limiting. There are basically 12 currencies and each one is very oddly setup. There's a single building limit on each building. You can't even try to focus down any resources that you're short on and the output is pretty low on each so you're stuck running basic buildings and units. Why can't I build multiple wind traps? You can't play the way you want to really. You're basically stuck on a path with little room for variance, which leads to the next issue.

The units are all very basic. Each one feels the same as the next. Even the extremely expensive elite ship unit has a single build limit and it's not very effective. The early units are all you need until you hit a point where you get slaughtered by defenses even with the late game units. You can't even field enough of them, because of their cost and then upkeep will bankrupt you. The air units feel next to useless. They're expensive, squishy and don't even do much damage.

The voting system seems counter intuitive. You'll generally get outvoted regardless and the outcomes aren't worth the effort to win them. In order to even vote, you have to spend a resource(that's again hard to accumulate) that causes you significant penalties if you do spend it.

I really hope the game improves. I'm still very interested in the game. I also realize it's early access, so maybe it's just still in early stages.",1682995075,1682995075,False,1,0,0.494486391544342041,0,True,False,True

The good:

The game is incredibly atmospheric, with high end graphics and pleasing background soundtrack.

The Bad:

But that's about it.

The game, at onset appears to present significant depth and interest with various mechanism of control and avenues to victory. However, as you begin to master the elements of play you realize that a lot of this is a facade. 

Combat is not well balanced at all, and lacks any sort of impact whatsoever. While the adage applies ""Don't fight a war on two fronts"" this game forces you to literally corral most of your army into a spear and attack and defend en masse. These skirmishes are of minor impact, as truly as long as you turtle well and amass the technology to increase your defensive turrets you can sustain yourself until a victory condition is achieved. Unit pathing is atrocious and large armies suffer the same overlap problems as Northgard did. Micro is nonviable in active combat. Armies path into the deep desert on a whim and are lost due to supply issues. Replacing fragile units takes *time*, so losing skirmishes to random unit loss usually waiting a long time to build up again, because often your opponent can't threaten you that well either.

The intelligence / spy system seems of great benefit until you realize the rate spys are acquired, brutal RNG for success and the fact that you're better off slotting them in for their economic/control bonuses.

The Landsraad is minimally impactful, with the randomizer presenting with little opportunity for strategy. You ability to alter or control resolutions as you gain power makes this forgettable as well.

Spice collection is not intensely rewarding and dangerous, but rather banal and your spice gathers can be (mostly) automated. The threat of failing to meet your spice delivery plays a part of minor economic victory. Similarly, Worms whether in combat or spice collection are more a nuisance than a thing of legend to be feared and respected.

Build economic production early, push to cap and you'll find yourself with more authority and resources than anyone can feasibly challenge mid-late game. A strong economic pushes the CHOAM victory out of reach of other players as you can use your surplus Solari to manipulate the markets. Hegemonic victories are a minor threat as your great wealth affords you all the room you need. Eventually, certain resources become ""obsolete."" For example, plascrete in particular is useless after you've established a foothold. With no market, or exchange systems really in place at the moment this further limits strategy or trading.

Research trees make... minor sense? But there's no real way to easily increase / trade tech and research a meaningful amount. You can enter into any number of agreements but like a lot of this the major influence it has is essentially to sue for peace. More frustrating, it appears there is no way for allied victory, it is winner take all *only* meaning your alliances are essentially set pieces in the facade of diplomacy in this game.

 AI cheats rather than gets better, requiring human opponents at the moment for fair play.

Shiro games appears to not have really learned any lessons from Northgard, which is another game that appears to have gotten the same surface level treatment. Systems are set in place, pleasingly appropriate to the lore and at first glance appear more complex than they actually are... until you realize there there is very little variance in strategy and whether purposefully or not, appear to have very little attention paid to their balance. A lot of both works speaks of passion, but little in refinement, and an unwillingness to spend the time necessary to build a fully fleshed 4X. This results in long, boring and repetitive game sessions with unfortunate unbalancing elements popping up in later patches and dlc. This is something that be rectified with more time and attention spent to the systems in place and that they are modifying or opening this up with mod tools/customization to allow the community to take these rough cut stones and polish them into gems.

Using the Dune setting to make a strategy game has been something I really wanted to see. This game sucks, and is a cheap and lazily designed game. Way to go messing up another great opportunity to create something using a rich and deep universe. I do not recommend this game both for Dune fans and strategy game fans. So I have had a request to elaborate on my review.  The strategy style that was chosen was lame. It has been the demise of many games. This game is just a strategy game with the DUNE name to get it sold. Nothing about this games design makes it unique or even fit with DUNE. If you are asking how I would have designed it, well I do not have that much time. I play RTS and TBS a lot, Some games have aspects of both. I wish I could put my thumb on which game this design came from. It is so familiar, and forgettable because it sucks.This game has a feel of someone trying to create a cross platform or a game that can be sold and played on a console as well as a PC. That is always a mistake with strategy games based on an existing universe.  The units were generic and laughable. The premise was a joke, an empire building feel that does not translate well to the planet the game is set on. The stuff that made DUNE cool the personal shields, the swords, the wierding way all lost to the basic design of this game. Graphics remind me of Command and conquer the early years. So JayTwoPointOh if you are a developer you failed, and took down the only opportunity we DUNE lovers had to get a well thoughtout and designed video game.

I haven't read any of the books, or watched any of the movies or the TV series. Maybe I will at some point; the books sound good from what I've heard, but the Internet has rotted my brain to the point that I have trouble sitting down and reading a book these days. If that disqualifies my opinion on [i]Spice Wars[/i] for you, that's fine.

So, not knowing anything about [i]Dune[/i], why did I buy this game? I bought it purely because I love [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/][i]Northgard[/i][/url], a previous Shiro Games title with a similar RTS/4X hybrid design. With over 200 hours played, [i]Northgard[/i] is one of my top games on Steam, and I figured that [i]Dune: Spice Wars[/i] would basically be more of the same but in a different setting.

To some extent, this is accurate, but [i]Spice Wars[/i] feels a lot more complicated than [i]Northgard[/i] to me, and therein lies its downfall. There are too many systems, too many interactions, too many resource types, and too many choices to make, to the point that it's overwhelming. Few of the decisions you make seem to have an immediate, substantial effect on gameplay, but they'll come back to bite you in the ass ten minutes down the road when your economy has become totally imbalanced and it's too late to recover.

To be fair, if I were more familiar with [i]Dune[/i], I'd probably have a better intuitive understanding of some of these things. But the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining all of this complexity. Even when playing with a friend who knows [i]Dune[/i] lore, and who has more experience in the game than me, I struggled to learn what I should be doing on a minute-to-minute basis--what my build order should be, which resources to prioritize, what buildings would serve me best, etc. And my friend, for his part, was struggling to figure out some of the changes and new mechanics that had been introduced between patches. (To be fair, the last part is always a risk with early access.)

[i]Spice Wars[/i] also fails to improve on some of the longstanding issues that [i]Northgard[/i] has. The AI doesn't seem particularly intelligent, but it compensates for this by cheating like crazy. Matches start off very slow and take a long time to play through. Map generation is not always balanced.

If you really love [i]Dune[/i], then you might still enjoy [i]Spice Wars[/i], because I've been told that Shiro has put great attention to detail into making it consistent with existing lore and designing the game systems around that. And that's cool; I'm glad that they went to that effort for the fans. But even as a fan of the studio, who wanted to like the game, my ultimate conclusion is that it's overly complicated, tedious, and frustrating to play. If you're looking for a solid RTS/4X game, there are better options out there, including Shiro's own [i]Northgard[/i].

Edited to add: I appreciate the dev response. That's part of the reason I like Shiro; in my experience they have great customer service and are very communicative with the fans. I will certainly give the game another try once some of the streamlining changes have been released.",1681628896,1681979596,False,2,0,0.44241902232170105,0,True,False,True

Many games will stagnate as players simply crawl towards the hegemony victory finish line. 

**Something that the devs could add to spice things up would be random events that pop up and add to the depth of the story in each run, like in Stellaris. The Ornithopters already function very similarly to the science ships in Stellaris, so why not take another cue from a successful Paradox model?

***As a big fan of Frank Herbert's writing, and not such a big fan of the recent movie, I don't like the dev's decision to portray Liet Kynes as a woman. Their explanation of the decision only served to solidify my feeling that it was an unnecessary detour from the letter of the books, made for garbage reasons.

And...

On top of it, again, few seconds later, due to a missed spice tax an imperium group of ~8 sardukars tried to liberate a key region which gave me +1000 hegemony. Being in a close run to hegemony victory but still in the lead this leaves a bitter taste after playing for ~ 2 hours. Especially when constantly defending and defeating enemy waves being coordinated from Harkonnen and Atreides together for about an hour.

Absolutely ridicolous. Either i missed a specific game mechanic or i just had a rare bug. Btw on that occasion where i was raided by the sardukars i was in a truce with Corrino. All other games played before were fine and depending on the situation hard to easy but everytime still winnable.

When 4 decent players are in a game it's rare for one player to dominate since the other 3 will usually try to cripple their progress. The different forms of winning are also really interesting, diplomatic, hegemonic, and economic victory can be attempted by all factions simultaneously or each can focus on one or two of the above. Domination victory is impossible in my opinion which is quite nice as it pushes players to actually be strategic rather than spam a military and try to dominate. 

The individual factions all have their own style of development and military builds. Corrino usually plays tall whereas Fremen plays wide. This is a wonderful change from most other RTS games where each faction will spam out its strongest units for a pretty mirrored endgame combat. In Dune Spice Wars even the beginner units can and will be utilised well into the endgame. Finally, the incorporation of Sandworm attacks and sandstorms as per the source material is wonderfully well done. 

I think overall, what the Lord of The Rings trilogy did with Tolkien's books Dune Spice Wars may be able to accomplish with Frank Herbert's books. The genuine respect given to its source material is what really blew me away. However, if you haven't read the books then what I am saying is going to blow over your head.

As someone who's played Starcraft, Crusader Kings II and III, and Civ, I can say that Dune does a good job of combining the 4X and RTS genre. The problem is that in doing so, the overall pacing of the game suffers. 4x games are a nice slow burn where you can watch your cities grow, while a good RTS emphasizes mass unit production which can quickly be turned into fast attacks on the enemy. Dune tries to mesh these things together, so the player has to do a balancing act: occupy the surrounding area quickly enough so that you don't get overwhelmed, but don't go too fast or you'll burn through your resources. It's a bit of a headache to get used to, but it's unique enough to feel fresh, and I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of it, which is why I would lean towards a thumbs up instead of a thumbs down.

Dune: Spice Wars is a refreshing taking on RTS with 4x elements. Multiplayer is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of the Dune universe.

Then, in the endgame, people have full armies and finally have the courage to mount an attack which either totally wipes out the enemy or fails and changes nothing. Most of the time the game ends with the Hegemony win condition, which is like a time/score limit. The matches last a long time, don't have tension, and end anticlimactically. Spice Wars doesn't feel like an RTS battle with 4X elements, it feels like a light 4X game with RTS elements.

Dune is pretty, but a desert is still a desert and will get visually dull pretty quickly. The units look good and are unique and distinct for each faction, but have really boring animations, so there's nothing to see unless they're standing still, and that novelty wears out fast. Whether it's explosions, swinging swords, or soldiers dying, the only thing to really look at in fights is just the health bars. There is no spectacle, which is a shame, because even losing can often be fun in games if it's fun to look at, the best example of which would be the Total War games. It doesn't have to be much, but if I blow a group of enemies up with a missile, I want to see something else than them just falling on their knees and fading out of existence. This feels especially disappointing after the Dune movie, in which the Atreides were your basic sword swingers, the Sardaukar were threatening brutes, and the Fremen were like sand ninjas. None of that can be seen here.

Not only are the battles visually uninteresting, the real time strategy itself is usually like that as well. All of the strategy in battles is just trying to play around the missile turrets that defend villages, because they are so damn strong and everyone keeps building them, obviously. They WILL change the tide of battles, so unless you can totally trample your enemy's forces, you don't attack. One time I was about to actually lose a crucial village on my border with my army unable to defend it at the time, so I just used the Orbital Strike ability to stop the enemy from attacking because they had to flee from the damage. There was no strategy there, just a ""nope"" button that let me stop the enemy from playing.
The couple of times I've had fun with the combat have been against the AI, because there were some tense situations with smalls amounts troops tussling about, but the reason those situations came about was because the AI is so bad at battles and troop management that I could play around it in a way that would never work against a real player.

It's possible that the game is meant to be played differently, but the 4X elements make players passive (me included), and in multiplayer you don't see skirmishes or smaller scale battles around the map that could make the game more interesting. Thematically you're supposed to be fighting over Spice, a resource that spawns around the map, but there's always enough for everybody and the Spice doesn't change locations, so it's just another resource like the others. That is wrong on many levels.

There are a lot of good things about Spice Wars, like how the differences between the factions make them feel different from one another, or the voting system, or the gorgeous soundtrack, but because the core gameplay is not fun, those good things can't carry it. For the early access, I would have rather had a really good RTS game as the base and have those 4X elements be added to support it as time goes on, but so far it's been the complete opposite.

Can't go wrong with backing Shiro Games. They constantly turn out innovative or quality content, generally both.

Gameplay note: the videos just suck at showing gameplay or there are too many videos to find a concise gameplay video on the Steam store page. This is effectively a game where you have an HQ, many neutral villages to capture and limited build on for resources/bonuses, resource harvesting based on a static point but with a mobile unit (think similar to C&C (minus Generals) harvesters, random bonus items ""crates"" to collect like old C&C games, and Civilization styled unit armies that fight in RTS mode but are closer to allowing fine grain control in what would be a Civilization dice roll for the same thing... Combat is not fast paced. You can capture villages from your opponents. Any conquered village takes resources to claim... if your raid it it costs more to claim in the future... same goes for if you liberate it. There's a long colldown time to it becoming cheap to capture again and liberation costs resources.


The game:
- Takes heavy queues from the latest Dune movie (as they should).
- Has Asymetric gameplay (factions play differently) - Huge plus here... too many games with nearly identical factions and gameplay styles. If they allow even limited modding then the player community can aid with balancing.
- A little buggy achievement-wise... albeit I don't even expect achievements in Early Access games.
- The Fremen faction is very limited in the quantity of what they can build in a city.
- The game currently does not scale well to the largest maps as it starts to cost more resources than one can stockpile to expand and there's no way to increase said stockpile... which makes large maps somewhat more friendly to the Fremen faction per how they can get bonuses from neutral villages.
- Unit ticket cap limited by research and there is a hard cap, so the other victory conditions are feasible as you just have to fend off your opponents rather than worrying about being overrun by an ungodly sized army where he who micro's the most units wins. This is likely also a plus for people without high APM's or whom are aging but still want an RTS with multiplayer.
- Sand worms feel less impactful and dynamic than in Westwoods iteration of the game. It is unclear if thumpers can be manually used to divert sand worms from targeting units in danger of being gulped by a worm. 
- Allied camps don't feel impactful as a military force.
- There are no neutral planet dwellers to co-opt... Emperor Battle for Dune had 3 the main houses and then a massive amount of sub-factions one could co-opt into their faction that made the gameplay highly dynamic.
- Spy/intelligence network actions that are impactful and arguably required to be able to destroy an enemy HQ. Think debuffs, buffs, and rebellion.",1675401623,1676748891,True,2,0,0.532250106334686279,0,True,False,True

Dune Spice wars is a great 4X strategy game or whatever that means. I don't normally like these style of games because of their painfully long and boring style of game play. But Dune Spice Wars just does it different for me. When you first load up the game you a greeted by a simple menu, which is great. I love when a game is simplistic in it's design. All the options are working as intended.

I recommend starting the game as Atreides because they're the most simple faction to learn out of all of them. This game does take some getting use to, at first glimpse it's easy but you really have to dive into this games advanced mechanics and what not. I know it's early access but i truly think it has good potential. 

The music. man the music is amazing seriously. It's the same thing that got me hooked into Halo, the music is so important in a game like dune because it has to perfectly capture the atmosphere and it does it extremely well.

My only main issue with the game is the unit direction. A lot of the gameplay is mainly focused on kiting with a ""death ball"" like it's Starcraft. I feel like there needs to be more on the battlefield that you can have. There needs to be more types of units because these current ones feel a bit boring. I would love to see all the units get their own abilities like how it is in Red Alert 3 sort of? I know it would be hard balancing such a thing considering this game combines 4x and standard rts elements when it comes to Camera controls, macro and micro

The Devs do listen to their community (which is rare now and days) they released a community patch that fixed a lot of bugs and balance, Thank you Devs for listening. 

I recommend Dune Spice Wars if you're a 4x RTS game enjoyer. If you're not i would be careful about it like i was at first because it might not be the game for you.",1676594960,1676594993,True,2,0,0.499086767435073853,0,True,False,True

This one is still fresh and below the 100 hour badge criteria but it’s already warmed my heart enough to make the cut, plus, I’ll admit, not only am I a huge fan of the original title from the previous century but I’m also fully steeped in the Dune universe. I’ve been reading the Dune saga savoring every word, re-watched Villeneuve’s film several times, dissecting the scenes, and then this little game popped up to complete the immersion trifecta. I expected it to be just a standard film companion, trying to capitalize on the hype of the moving picture but this is not the case here. It’s still early access but it already stands firm on its own many little legs, wait… worms don’t have legs.

My eyes watered upon seeing the beauty of the Arrakis sand in the morning. It was graceful, glowing, warm, and somehow, despite all its peril, inviting. The oozing soft warmth of the zoomed-in dune map combined with the atmospheric music gives it a “fireplace and pretzels” kind of vibe. You can sit back and turn into the noble Leto Artreidis, the spice-eating Fremen, the always scheming Harkonnen Baron, or the Padishah Emperor himself. What a joy to have such power at the touch of a finger — “My Desert. My Arrakis. My Dune.”

I was sold on the “smell” of spice melange, the beautifully captured desert ambiance, and the sparkly clean UI, as I often am, when the interface fails, nothing can save the game for me, (unless it’s a mind-bending, deep WW2 wargame), I will abandon it and never think about it twice.

The music, and isn’t that a common thread in this series, sometimes it just plays in the background and I sit there and sip its cords. Makes me want to grab that beautiful deluxe blue edge-stained edition of Dune sitting on the bookcase beside me and sink into a page of some best science-fiction writing ever for just a minute or two… and port over.

There are a few things that typically sway me over, sometimes it’s the subject matter and the UI, the art can do it too. If the game has any of these I will be compelled to spend some time with it and give it a fair shake down. After all, I strongly believe gaming is a most worthwhile hobby.

Prolonged fighting will invite worms — it’s best to deal with opposition swiftly
Being in early access the game is still going through some teething problems, especially with combat which feels a little too RTS-y “all units blob vs all units blob” kind of action.

I always crave more micromanagement and complexity in combat mechanics but conquest is not the only way to conduct your campaign. Even though I won my first game by achieving Hegemony I was neck in neck against the Emperor who was going for a win by acquiring a majority stake in the CHOAM conglomerate shares. This comes with a share price graph and all, so if you’ve ever traded stocks you’ll feel right at home, and if you haven’t here is your chance. Another way to win is to hunker down, use diplomacy to turn your foes into allies, and work on acquiring enough favor from the Spacing and Landsraad Guilds.

Depth is also still work in progress with story-driven Conquest mode having been recently announced, but do not not be put off by these small misgivings as there plenty of juice to be squeezed out of this Dune.

There aren’t many strategy games out there that can claim they have atmosphere, but Dune Spice Wars most definitely does. Whether you’re a die hard Dune fan or just a passerby, there is a high chance this title will at least grab your attention if not fully satisfy. Personally, I’m standing by for the game to go gold so I can push another hundred Sardaukar hours into it.

This is the third of the Magnificent 7 Strategy Games worth playing featured in this series.

It’s all about the feeling and I will be showcasing more Feel of the Game in an ongoing series.

Real problem with the game right now, IMO, is the way all it's complicated system works, they tend to create snowball effect. If you have a lot spice, you will have more money, political clout, all kind of resources and will race ahead of your opponents. Once this advantage reached some level, it's really hard to catch up. because you will have to smash his advantage on alll levels. and now it's not enough to just get a lot of spice, because some resources take time to develop, some systems are complicated and somewhat random, etc. So either you sit on your opponent's heels tight, or there is a large chance you will lose, despite what you do.

If you like 4X/Strategy games like Humankind, Endless Legend, Civ, Europa, etc. yet are a fan of real time game play, this is definitely worth a pick up. 

Shiro does a wonderful job with the art style and it runs buttery smooth (I have a 3070 and a Ryzen 9). And if you are a fan of the Dune at all, you will really appreciate how they've kept everything so relevant to the world and factions of the book/movies. From names of units and towns and the mechanics of gathering spice/saving harvesters to the CHOAM economy, Spacing Guild bribes and each faction playing their own role in politics (Landsraad Council) it is truly awesome if you're even a slight fan of Dune. And it's a great world for an strategy/RTS game regardless of if you know the franchise.

In terms of gameplay it's a great blend of real time game speed, unit control and battling but with in depth strategy elements like economy, politics, spying/infiltration and resource management. Everything ties together really nicely. Learning in single player is recommended as learning all the strategy mechanics in real time is difficult. Single player allows pausing at anytime and it auto pauses in menus, giving you plenty of time to read and learn.

All the factions are very unique and cater well towards certain play-styles. Yet they all have nice bonuses that allow them to be viable for most victory types. Though some will excel better than other at certain victory types. Like Smugglers are definitely the best for an assassination victory with all the benefits they get to infiltration through their underground cities. And the Fremen not needing to colonize to harvest spice and not needing refineries/harvesters and instead having stealthy tent camps is super cool.

All in all it's a really great game. A new favorite strategy game for sure. For being Early Access it feels incredibly polished!! You could tell me this is full release and I wouldn't bat an eye/complain. So excited to see how it develops.

There are a few suggestions I'd have for the devs, but nothing major. 
1. Allow a further level of zoom out before going to the full map screen. The current max zoom just feels a tad too zoomed in. Not a big problem, but I find myself scrolling back wishing for just a bit more breathing room.
2. Please make all the names of things hoverable with tool tips. This will help sooooo much with learning. It currently takes a while to fully understand everything as a lot of the highlighted names of things have no tool tip on hover, so you kinda just have to hope you find what it is later.
3. The pop up tutorial tips could use a bit of refining and clarity. They definitely help, but sometimes are a bit vague and don't explain initial mechanics very well. For instance, I played almost my entire first game without understanding the tax system for spice, and that the purple/yellow bar was a slider to change how much you were stocking vs. selling. A huge part of the game, and it was just not explained well at all.

Very minor things, and mostly to due with tutorials, which I see there is a full tutorial mode coming soon. So that should solve most of the tool tip/tutorial issues!

In summary I'd say 8.5/10 in it's current state. Easily a top 5 RTS/Strategy game for me already; can't wait to see where it goes.

Basically you have RTS core mechanics (unit selection, attack order, movement, etc you name it) but it is all embedded in a ""big picture 4X"" gameplay.

Now, this COULD theoretically work well, if the RTS aspect is tuned down to SERVE the 4x / meta gameplay, but this is not the case.

Quite the opposite: The camera tilts, when zooming in, making unit selection worse than it already is. Flags hover over your units, obscuring the battlefield. However, clicking on these flags is a buggy mess, as they overlap, and feedback indicators (such as worm danger) are even obscuring the clickable layer of the flags.

In a good RTS, units come with abilities, depth, sometimes they interact with the environment, sometimes they have intelligent modes, etc. 
In Dune, you have the absolute barebones of RTS gameplay, which leads to very simple challenges on the RTS layer (mainly target prioritization and cat and mouse kiting for low health units). 

So you got a game that presents itself as a strategy game, creating expectations on the 4X front, just to bury it all in it's combat mess, where it's pure RTS chaos, with back and forth of units, attacking, retreating, pulling enemy into missile range, etc. etc. as a _constant requirement_ to perform competitively. 

This is not only exhausting, but due to the length of a game session, and the lack of interesting things units can do it's braindead. (it's basically just passives, like""-10% damage for enemy units hit"", who even cares?!).

Sometimes I wonder if designers even ask themselves ""Is this actually fun"" before just going through the motions of writing down implementations of standards. 
Cause to me, the whole RTS part seems like: ""That is how you do RTS unit movement and behavior"". Yeah, but can you provide the usability, depth and compatibility to the rest of your game that make this RTS part FUN?""

If the answer is no, maybe find another system that fullfils your needs for military projection on the battlefield.

I now get a black screen launching the game, when it was working flawlessly before. To work around this I needed to edit the game's options.ini file to change the ""Driver ="" line to be ""Driver = DirectX"". You can find the options.ini file in your Steam path under steamapps/common/D4X. With this change, it's back to working as before.

I just gave it another try to see some of the recent changes and couldn't complete the first tutorial in about an hour because I never saw any spice. I would assume spice is rare but four ornithopters explored almost the entire map before I gave up. Some of the systems beyond that could really use some more introduction but I'm assuming that's coming or I couldn't get to it due to not being able to complete that early tutorial.

While the game ran well enough and graphics are generally nice, at 4K some of UI graphics seem upscaled from lower resolutions. This makes some things a bit blurry compared to the generally nicely detailed art and 3D graphics, it's a pretty UI heavy game so I hope this is improved.

Some good stuff though, the CHOAM market is an interesting way to approach an economic victory. It does feel like you're making some meaningful choices in other aspects with various tradeoffs at every point of play. I'd started down the economic path and had some initial success before losing out politically, which is a really Dune way for it play out. I didn't get far enough to see everything but there's a lot of promise the complete game will be pretty fun. The atmosphere and character art is also pretty great, it feels like Dune.

I was, however, definitely wrong about whether the game is worth purchasing, and I was especially wrong about the game being surface-level. 

The hegemony, CHOAM stock, faction bonuses, and intelligence system all show a deep understanding of Dune lore and are relatively well implemented. The sliding scale of trading harvested spice for Solari is a great feature, allowing you to dynamically balance your spice stockpile with your finances. The whole atmosphere is one that pretty accurately captures the oligarchic-corporate-capitalist system that Dune presents in the book. 

I’m still not a huge fan of the idea that you have to capture certain regions to produce certain resources efficiently, but the maps are large enough for this to rarely be a problem. Are the maps too large, though? Maybe. The influence *and* hegemony system is a little obtuse still, I think; wouldn’t it make more sense to spend hegemony instead of influence? I have trouble understanding why they are different resources.

I still, however, think combat is fairly boring and difficult to parse. If I have three Landsraad Judges and two Heavy Gunners, will those beat some militia and a missile turret? The outcomes seem to be somewhat unpredictable due to the bonuses and slow positioning of infantry. I’d hate to blame the game for not being “fast paced,” because it’s not meant to be, but I can say it is hard to tell if you’re going in with enough troops, and the AI seems to understand the inscrutable system in a way that I don't.

Nevertheless the game is much improved and my initial take was premature. This is definitely a buy. So no one can fault me, I’ve included my original negative review below:

Dune is one of those properties that will never stop spawning games, and this is another one. I am sure I will come back to this game one day, but so far, the game just isn't interesting enough to hold my attention or earn a recommendation.

Spice Wars is ostensibly a 4X game, but the exploration amounts to ordering ornithopters around the map, expansion is samey and has you discover all the game has to offer within a few provinces, exploitation is surface-level balancing of a few meager resources, and combat is boring. Diplomacy and espionage are obtuse, and the factions don't have enough to differentiate them--which is unbelievable, considering the Fremen and smugglers could not be more different in quantity or quality from the Great Houses of the Landsraad.

Maybe I'm missing something, and maybe it'll get better, but for now, the game is just not worth it.",1672458680,1674250336,True,0,0,0.552567720413208008,0,True,False,True

There are many ways to win a match, but matches usually end one way.

Most matches end with a Hegemony victory. The math doesn't work out for the other strategies. There are other ways to win a match, Political (elected winner), Elimination (destroy bases), and Economic (buy half the CHOAM shares).

The problem with all of these is that the a Hegemony victory is much faster and easier than everything else. When factions get access to ticking Hegemony buildings the game is essentially over on a timer you can't see. Taking a few special regions and playing the Landsraad game correctly will hurry a competent player to the Hegemony victory faster than any other strategy.

Political victories can be undone easily. A sitting Governor can have the conditions for governorship invalidated, and lose the victory condition. Hegemony, on the other hand, is durable. There aren't many ways to undo score. You could lose a special region, but that would only set you back a little bit. Most of the time if someone is elected governor it will evaporate for no particular reason in 20 or so days. 

Hegemony should escalate the game, but not be a victory condition. Removing the Hegemony victory condition from my games dramatically improved the experience.

Assassinations are fun as an idea, but are slow moving and require significant technology investment to complete, far more than any other victory type. They eliminate only one opponent, and it is unlikely you'll be able to assassinate all three opponents prior to losing to, or yourself winning, a Hegemony victory. It's very powerful, but also way too expensive.

Assassinations will destroy a main base with an off-map espionage action. The downside to this is that it's much cheaper, and much quicker, to invest in army/econ tech and attack the base. You can trade away intel for resources to build up your army, and use them for some of the basic (but very effective) intel missions. A faction requires heavy investment to pull off the entire Assassination chain, nearly the entire Statecraft tree, and there are better ways to spend your research.

CHOAM shares are a waste unless you're going for the Economic victory. It's also easy to forget to buy your daily dose of CHOAM shares. Autobuy should be introduced into one of the early economic technologies. Dividend payments are quite low as well. It should be possible to take a portion of shares from defeated opponents, or extort CHOAM shares through espionage.

Aside from the victory conditions, the Emperor/Guild's demand for spice makes very little sense from a roleplay perspective. From a game POV it's to escalate costs and keep pressure on the factions to expand and create conflict, but from an in-universe perspective, it makes no sense. If you miss the tax by even 1 unit of spice it's as if you didn't pay it at all, yet it still deducts the entire balance. For this reason you might as well either plan to pay in full, or not bother at all since the penalty for being 1% short is the same for being 100% short.

Spice taxes should be worked into something more dynamic, even something where over-contributing has benefits, small under-contributions can worked out. There should be and other ways for spice to filter into the guild so they still count for its needs. If I sell spice for coin to CHOAM that spice eventually ends up in the guild, it just costed them coin instead of them getting it for free.

The Emperor experience is being squeezed by non-paying factions, and an incredibly greedy Guild that wants more spice than actually exists. Factions also don't pay until after the Guild fees are paid, if they pay at all. The Emperor's penalties and benefits for keeping the Guild happy, or annoying them, are marginal. Faction benefits/penalties for the tax, however, are significant.

All-in, this is a fun early access title with a lot of room for polish, balancing, and maybe some refinement but there's a great core game here.",1674063479,1674063479,True,13,0,0.692090868949890137,0,True,False,True

Game currently has four win conditions with four tech trees having research possibilities that are aimed at achieving those, while giving you meaningful changes to the way your game plays even if you don't go all in on one. You can truce everybody and aim for a condition that will win you the game without direct violence against an opponent, the exact opposite or somewhere in between. You'll have to take your location, surrounding terrain, enemy factions and their chosen councilors and a bunch of other things in consideration when deciding which win-con you'll ultimately go for. It's an evolving progress, as you'll have to scout the map and develop constantly, so you'll be reacting to council decisions, aggressive/passive playing, luck, spying etc. which makes games play differently in interesting ways.

The supply mechanic that most of the units have is superb. Once your units leave the area around cities, they'll start running out, regenerating once they're back nearby. Units lose more at day, less at night, a lot in hostile terrain known as deep desert. This creates a delightful pace to the game when it comes to the RTS aspect of it.

I've been playing bunch of Terraforming Mars recently, and can't help but compare the similarities. For example, in how you are subtly working against opponents without being overly aggressive, due to certain necessities; such as that one opponent does not get a stranglehold on all others. Sometimes it's a race, sometimes it's a brawl, but it has that sort of auto-chess-ish progression to it which comes from map differences, factions in the game and how everyone plays etc.

Graphics are enjoyable. Arrakis looks great.

Sounds are okay-ish. Some things really need work, some bring a smile to your face.

Performance is meh. Some sessions get stutters, some don't - haven't quite managed to figure this one out yet if there's something I can do. Usually there is. Haven't encountered other issues.

Currently there are only two main single play game modes: 4 factions FFA or dual.
I haven't tried yet the multi-player.

I'm looking forward to the campaign when it gets out :).

I really like how many ways there are to win, and how different factions are quite unique in their preferred playstyle. This makes Dune Spice Wars a very replayable game, though there is no campaign for it as of early January 2023. I'd say that, if you enjoy the Dune setting (I certainly do) and you like strategy games you'll enjoy the game. The art style and visuals are great, it's a very pretty game in my opinion.
My pet peeves with the game at the moment are that the units don't have an aggressiveness setting and they often just waltz right into sand worms' mouths, and the game ends without any game recap or cinematic to help you savor your victory (or defeat, if you're a masochist). Furthermore, notifications easily go unnoticed with everything going on, and combined with the AI not thinking about where it walks, you can often end up losing units or even your whole army without noticing.

The core issue with this game is the lack of even a most primitive gameplay balance. It's a thing that doesn't require months of development, just a simple values correction. Lack of balance in every core game play field. At this production stage, suggest that it will never get better.

Spice economy - one of the game systems that provides you with money. What can you do with those? You can pursue an economic victory centered around purchasing CHAOM stocks, after purchasing 50% of them you win.
To get stocks you have to spend around a few thousand gold, in return you get a profit of around 10 gold per day.

While attempting to reach a rare achievement, which is winning the game with ONE OF IT'S CORE VICTORY CONDITIONS (1% players won this way according to steam achievements)
I picked the largest map and easiest difficulty setting, with every disaster turned off. I was earning around 2k-4k gold per day (maybe a 100 gold from CHAOM stocks), and I still didn't manage to get those 50% before I got a hegemony victory (victory based on how good generally your faction prospers I guess?).

Warfare - making units is cheap, defender has a huge advantage, you cannot destroy the main base without using around 20-30 units for a prolonged period of time in which you can get attacked.
A simple strategy, the most basic and primal one, is to liberate every enemy player village. It destroys every building a faction bought on this land. While also demanding of conquered players to repeat the process of capturing this land.
After employing this tactic the result was devastating. Faction was dead, it's power level was reduced to a dank
beginning of the game, with tax requirements of a game later phases. If after all of that it ever would manage to return from its grave to even half of its former size. Repeating this process would be even easier than before. There is no point in making main bases so tough, the player after having his faction ravaged like that, basically dies anyway.

Voting system - sounds really cool. You could learn to predict AI. It offers global random events, a nice system. Until you check who has the most voting power - ""minor houses"" being outside of the game that acts in a completely random way. I'm not sure what the aim was?
Negative events will always affect the strongest player, and every positive event, also him. How is that possible? Every event is faction targeted, if it's positive, each player uses every resource to vote for himself, the strongest one wins.
If the event is negative, every faction except the strongest chooses it, and the strongest one has no say in it. He cannot target anyone else with enough voting power to outweigh votes on himself.

Ohh and an espionage system - a requirement for the second of the rare victory condition (~4% of players).
I would recommend to a new player to never bother with it.
It's completely random. A single choice you could make in this system is in the research tree, it's called ""engage in this spy system"". Wasting research on it compared to any other research option is really questionable.

TLDR: In conclusion: It's easy for the developers to change values to make even a single choice in this game meaningful, but it's hard to care about a soulless cash grab.",1672676534,1672676534,False,8,0,0.576955556869506836,0,True,False,True

	not half and half
	in the games and shows/ atredies is blue
	in teh books in green and black

	and lets be real this could 100% be a mobile game besides maybe the map size
	if it was optomized correctly

Massive sale or see where early access goes. Right now I guess its ok if your a fan of RTS games....and have money and time to burn. 

You are honestly better off just downloading the other 3 DUNE RTS games if you want a lore, or a strategy fix.... this game honestly feels like it could very well be a mobile game. Which is sad because I wanted to like it and I honestly don't give a crap about the ""woke"" crap... but if you are messing with lore you need to go all in on either the ""new"" lore from the tv show, or go all in on the old stuff.... the mix and mash is almost always a recipe for pleasing no one and pissing everyone off.

Then, some reassurance. Those developing this game know what they're doing. Northguard convinced me of the quality of their craft, and this only makes the game look more promising than it already is, on top of being rather solid already in its early access state.

Each faction is definitely unique in the way it plays, though the scale at which this is the case varies. In a way, this is great. If you're looking for an easy introduction into the game, without too many faction-specific features to take into account, the Atreides are your best pick. They lean a bit on the diplomatic side of things, but they're still decent from a military standpoint.
On the other hand, the Fremen (or maybe the Smugglers) are much more refined, and will require that you spend some time understanding their playstyle.

Overall, this is a fantastic early access. As an RTS, it can stand on its own though it gets a bit repetitive, but in today's gaming industry, it's rare enough to find an early access worthy of anything less than harsh critic.

It's a 4X wargame with a political dimension: there is the 4th X, the extermination ""domination"" victory, but there is also a political victory and a general hegemony victory and an economic victory.

(Hegemony is a complex mix of the various factors of your control over the desert planet:
social, political, military, economic, espionage (hard power, soft power).)

Very subtle and nuanced for this genre. Ballet indeed. A masterwork!

DUNE fans will love it!

There are the visceral and beautifully ""Lawrence of Arabia"" poetic visual experiences
like seeing your Fremen riding the giant Shai Hulud worm
fleeing a raging sandstorm under the moons of Arrakis on a cool desert nightscape.
And there are the administrative details of what to build and how to manage the resources of your villages, but DUNE is a sci-fi fantasy version of ""The Great Game"" Afghanistan (the hundred year geostrategic contest between Britain and Russia for control of Eurasia in the 19th century. The arena for the Great Game was all the lands, kingdoms and nations between the two Empires.)

Play it at the speed it was designed to be played at, not the adrenaline-junky 1.5X ""very fast"",
and you will have the full ""Lawrence of Arabia"" experience,
as it was designed to be enjoyed.

Its slower default speed is for fans of the books and new movie to savor the theme, the cinematography, the intrigue and shifting allegiances, the subtle nuances of DUNE the Great Game as it was designed to be experienced. 

If you enjoy immersing in a deep 2-hour contest of wit and will, 
then welcome to DUNE: Spice Wars,

[b] Cons: [/b] 
-Replay value is lower than other games in this genre. You have some variation with lieutenants that allows for a different play style with the same faction, but not that much of a difference in how you will play the same faction again. 
-Combat is lackluster. Not a terrible thing, given that Dune is also about subterfuge and power politics, but I never had any particularly exciting moments playing the game. 
-AI diplomacy feels bad; weird deals, breaking truces at odd times, agreeing to truces again for nothing in exchange, etc. At a certain point, besides defending your borders and watching victory conditions, you can ignore AI players entirely.

To me the issue is that it just doesn't seem like a uniquely ""Dune"" game. I feel like it would be more accurate to simply call the game ""Arrakis: Spice Wars"" instead because I just don't think this encapsulates the experience I feel when I think of ""Dune.""

I played Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle for Dune back in the day and while that era of 4X game was incredibly simplistic in a lot of ways, what it did do was allow games to feel fairly unique with small changes. Adding a few unique troops made a difference, and so it was easy to project your love of the books/film and the fantasy elements of the story into the world you were playing in.

That is all kind of missing in this. It feels like I could slap any number of franchise skins over this and change a few things and it'd be the same game, but now it's LOTR or something. Tadaa! Maybe that's unfair, I'm sure there are mechanics that separate the game and make it unique to Dune somehow, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. It has the feeling of a reskin itself, even though it has completely unique features and gameplay.

And that's not to say that they don't have something going on here. I wouldn't want to give the impression that it's all bad...it's not, but it still needs some work to balance as you can read plenty about on other reviews with guys that play way more strategy 4X stuff than I do.

The finer subtleties of this game really start to show after a while. The strategy in this game is a very delicate balancing-act of measures risks, planning for the future goals, and keeping your faction afloat just long enough to (hopefully) see those goals come to pass.

My only issue is that hemegony victories seem to be the most common, the only victory condition that I or any opposing faction has successfully used to complete the game, in fact.

Even the combat has become more interesting after getting to know the smuggler’s faction. I’m delighted to see what the development team has in store for us in the future.

Previous review:

I'm a fan of Northgard, but my main issue with Northgard is the same as this game:

-Absolutely killer potential
-Fun and engaging economic decision-making
-Very lackluster military engagements

There needs to be more units with more flavor to set up more interesting fights. The tactics in fighting has more to do with timing fights and amassing units than it does with the actual fights themselves. There needs to be weapons of war. large technological artillery units that counter unit spam, more flying units that counter the artillery, ""Hero"" units with crazy abilities. 

Honestly if they just made the combat/military aspect of this game 3x more interesting, this game would be endlessly fun. Currently the game is amazing, except for the combat aspect, which is very bland.

Edit: First of all, I really want to commend you and the team for making a beautiful (and very well optimized) game, and secondly for your very quick response to my review. My combat recommendation would be to take a note from two games, 1 being Northgard, and another from a long-lost gem of a game called Battle for Middle Earth 2. Two changes that would vastly improve the combat aspect would be Heroes and Special Faction Abilities:

1) Heroes.
In both Northgard and BFME2 you have Hero units, which vastly improve the flavor of each faction. They have their own powerful spells and abilities which can greatly effect battle outcomes. Snare abilities which pin down powerful units. AOE damaging spells which splash damage onto massed units. Damage over time abilities (Which I noticed you have already implemented with the Smuggler end-game unit and supply-draining abilities). Direct-Damage spells like Saruman's Fireball from BFME2. These abilities add an extra layer of combat that forces more micro-management, but each have their own counters, like spreading out your units when going up against an AOE-using hero for example.

2) Special Faction Abilities.
In Battle for Middle Earth 2 there is a feature called Faction Powers, which are essentially similar to Spice Wars operations. When engaging in combat, you gain more power as you engage in more battles, and after hitting certain thresholds you can cast weak, medium, and extremely strong Faction powers. Examples can be found here (https://bfme.fandom.com/wiki/Powers), but they range from small vision-based abilities like Probe in Spice Wars all the way up to summoning huge dragons to swoop in and damage multiple enemies.

A lot of the abilities I'm mentioning are somewhat embedded in Spice Wars already, but the tactical layer isn't quite there. When I cast Gear Sabotage, it certainly helps the fight, but all that happens is a small debuff on the screen and it's hard to see and ""feel"" the effect of the ability, making it less exciting and not as immersive.

If I had a magic wand, some of the things I would change would be:
Make the debuffs like gear sabotage affect a radius instead of a region, and to give it a noticeable visual debuff. This allows me to interact with the ability, and cast it across a specific group. Tactically this allows me to span it across two regional lines if I am fighting on a border, but also if I can lure the fight close enough to their base, I can cast it over their missile turrets as well. Inversely, this makes the opponent think more about where to place his missile turret to prevent the grouping of units and turrets, thus heightening the tactical layer of turret placement.

Give each faction 2-3 heroes to choose from, but they are of course costly and typically you will only to be able to field 1-2 at a time. These are named heroes with special skills like bolstering local unit's defenses, heroes that can sniper-shoot other units and pin them down, or even a Fremen hero that can call in a Sandworm at a specific location.

Some of the ""Faction Powers"" I would recommend would be things like 

Summon Sandworm: Call in a Sandworm to a specific location. After a 4-5 second delay a Sandworm appears and demolishes everything in its path. This would give the enemy time to react, but, if they do not they can take heavy losses.
Summon Sand Storm: You can cast a sandstorm to a specific area which moves in an unpredictable direction.
Nuclear Barrage: For a hit in Landstraad standing and resources, you can drop a nuke in a specific area as opposed to a region, causing massing damage to units, buildings, production, etc. This area becomes an almost unpassable terrain for a period of time, damaging armies over time and costing severe supply penalties.
Sand Traps: Plant bombs underneath the sands that lay in wait for invading armies.
Strafing run: After a short delay, an aerial bombardment strafes across the battlefield in a line, damaging all units within its path.
Sand Ambush: Hide your Fremen units in the sand, awaiting an ambush moment. This reduces their upkeep, prevents them form moving, and makes them stealth until they pop up and surround their enemies. 
Subjugate: This hero is a tyrant, after attacking and successfully besieging an enemy territory he takes control of the territory for zero cost until he leaves, is killed, or is forced out of the area.
EMP: This AOE will shut down all mechanical units, grounding them for 5-7 seconds. This would allow ground units to deal damage to them for a short period of time.

These are some minor military suggestions that I believe would add to the combat layer of the game. I do fully understand that the point of the game is not military conquest, but combat should always have a high level of thought and complexity, especially in DUNE, which is an unforgiving warring planet. I personally believe that all other aspects of the game are doing quite well, you've made the decision-points impactful and meaningful.

Thank you for your time and interest in my response. I really do enjoy the game beyond the combat element.",1670328706,1670571487,True,0,0,0.50071871280670166,0,True,False,True

- Did not experience any bugs, crashes or other game issues.

Middle Ground:
- Graphics are not bad, but they are not great.
- Espionage could be improved and better defined, but gets the job done.

Cons:
- Spice bribes become steep very quickly (for those that wishes to play a long running game).

Firstly, I'll clarify that I read the books first and watched the movies second. Only recently have I seen the modern one, and honestly I'd say its pretty good, too. The answer to the casting question shall one day be solved, but most importantly, I went in wanting to see if the factions' gameplay was faithful to their role in the books (though this only covers the first one). 
I've tried every one of the factions, each of them have their interesting gimmicks that make them unique and fun, except the Harkonnens. That is the stem of my criticism, not because I enjoy the murderhobo fantasy being exercised in strategy games, but because its neither faithful, nor fun. Why? Well, in the books, the Harkonnens are basically the run-of-the-mill bad guys who oppress planets and use quasi-slavery and literal slavery to get that 110% profit margin out of every world they own, led by the fattest, cruelest man in the galaxy. In this game, they feel like a coalition of LARPers doing shitty Astartes impressions led by the fattest reddit moderator in the galaxy (also doing shitty impression).
Early access titles are always like this when they come out, and I have a problem with early access in general, mainly because a lot of the things people end up hating end up sticking around somehow. If the Harkonnens, the second most important faction, are going to be that, this game will be shit.
Their problems, as I've seen them, include:
-Army mechanics are self-defeating, you take damage to deal more, but your units don't have enough health to begin with, and all your supporting units only serve to deal more damage to your own.
-Your only hope for success is rapid conquest, which is unarguably the hardest possible way to play this game, given that its main design features focus on diplomacy, trade, and spying rather than outright war.
-Not only is it very hard to keep up a war economy, its impossible to fight on two fronts when you can only ever reasonably fund 4-6 units until the end game, when it barely matters because you could just win by Hegemony (basically a better points victory from Civ)
-They also start out with such a weak position in the Landsraad that the second you try to pull off this conquest, you'll get veto'd and shot down at every law. The enemy will demote you, defund you, and castrate your faction into an Islamic republic on this shithole of a planet called Arrakis.
-Say goodbye to any influence you've been saving up, because you'll need all of that to stop people from overtaking your territory as every other faction in the game gangs up on you after you annex a bordering region and built 2 more units more than they like.
-Also their advisors are the worst in the game. None of them provide very good bonuses, nor do any of them really play hard enough to the factions strength (conquest).
Not very fun playing as Harkonnen, and I've tested this on every difficulty so far to the midgame (and will continue just to make sure, will update this if I find differently) and it looks like, yes, you should basically ignore any chance of a combative victory, which entirely defeats the mechanics of the Harkonnens.

My fix? I'm not a game designer but I remember the books. The Harkonnens' plan was to assassinate and plot their way to the rulership of Dune, the army was there, but more as an oppressive force. House Corrino (the Emperor and his lads) were the military force in the novel, they were the ones who wiped out thousands of people a minute and could carve their way across the planet if they wanted to. The Harkonnens are the manipulative, greedy kind who rub their hands together and plot how to best take over a planet from the inside, right under everyone's noses.
I'd change the mechanics to reflect the Harkonnen doctrine of subversion and spying, maybe changing it so that intel = attack power, since they learn to use their enemies' weaknesses against them. Right now, they're a military-based faction in a game where military is the last, last, last resort, not because it is difficult to use, but because it is impossible to finance unless you're incredibly lucky with a ridiculous start and get a ton of rare elements.

The worst thing I can imagine is that the Harkonnens were overlooked, that the dev team spent a good week or two on every faction, but went to the Harkonnens and said ""Hmm. Red and black uniforms, slavery, evil voices.. yep, those are the Harkonnens. Also they spy on people, I guess, so lets add an advisor for that.""

Suggestions:
Despite the factions or houses being very different in the lore, they don't really seem all that different in the way they are played, from unit tactics, gameplay or otherwise...

The Fremen should be way more focused around keeping Arrakis free and liberating the settlements, instead of occupying the villages and becoming stronger for it. They should become stronger by keeping the settlements free from occupation (especially by other factions) and by allying them, who in turn, would contribute with resources and allied forces, controllable or not. They would get weaker by having villages occupied.

I wish there was more content about the Bene Gesserit, Ixians and other ""factions""...
On this point, there should be ways to get Ixian technology, units (like the Orship) or upgrades should be more prevalent. So far I only managed to find a modified ""scout"" (don't want to be too much of a spoiler).

I like that the way the Emperor (House Corrino) expansion is limited. However, the way it is currently working makes it difficult to conclude a game. Some places can never be controlled or reached, making it almost impossible to finish the game.
A quick fix would be to limit annexation authority costs to the maximum you can earn, even if extremely high. Currently the maximum authority you can earn is 500, but the annexation costs can greatly surpass this.
So you could cap these annexation cost at 1000 and the authority cap at 1000, as well. It would make it extremely expensive, but still possible to finish the game.
A much better fix (and more lore-friendly) would be to have indirect dominion over far reaching provinces.
One of these indirect ways, would be awarding settlements to (allied) vassals. The minor houses would be a good option. The Emperor would rise in standing within the Landsraad and the minor houses could rule these places and count for the victory conditions.
Maybe the could contribute with spice, resources and autonomous allied troops. Maybe even even rebel and go renegade, if the conditions are met, like low standing within the Landsraad or them preferring other great houses, like the Atreides. Would be pretty fun to see such a mechanic.

There should be more veteracy levels. The unit veteracy is very limited and doesn't reward you enough to invest on keeping your unit alive in the long run vs achieving objectives. Every faction feels like the Harkonnen because of this.

The unit barrack ""upgrades"" is also quite limited. It is so unattractive that I many times I opt out of upgrading my units with the spare parts. So, there should be more upgrades to chose from...

Often I get overwhelmed by the constant messaging/notification system, even on the lowest speed. Something needs to be done about this...

Even with the automatic recall option on the harvesters they keep getting eaten by the sandworms....

Having played other Dune games, it confuses me that the Ordos/Smugglers are blue and the Atreides green. Maybe it would be nice to have a way to pick the colors or have an option to enable an alternative color set, with this in mind. It would also be cool to have some of the units from other Dune games present here.  Thopters and flyers (like lasgun missile and gun thopters, Kindjal ships), groundcars, like (sonic) tanks, trikes and quads, rocket launchers and such. Maybe shields reacting to lasguns (atomics). The long-range department is quite lacking... The soundtrack from Dune 2, from decades ago, is waaay better then this one. Either improve the music or give us an option to import music from the older ones, please.

Modding could be key to every shortcoming this game might have. The thumbs-up might depend on this alone ;)

At first glance just by looking at graphics some ofyou propably will think that all the factions are too simillar to each other. Heard some people think that factions are mostly the same rocollored with little to no difference on play styles. You will be gravely mistaken.

Give it some time to learn mechanics and try different combinations of advisors to have few different play styles.

Money well spend so far in my opinion. Have rally high hopes for the final product and future support of the title.

But as an early access title it still has some issues. Although some may depend on your perspective.
- The landsraad system is pointless: Since the AI cheats. 
- There are obvious balancing issues with the perks that each house gets. Game difficulty is currently determined by which house you pick to play with then anything else.

Currently battling an opponent is not satisfying because you never feel your opponent is actually weakening. At certain moments they have this complete asspull of unit spawn  (roaming units) to counter your attack. Combined with that they still singlehandedly outvote you in the landsraad even though they have only 4 villages left, while you invested 100s of influence to push something through... It makes it too obvious the AI is cheating.

But those are all things that can be fixed.
Ultimately for me i feel its the same as with NorthGard, i liked the campaign but skirmish was completely uninteresting to me. If this game would ever develop a campaign. And I hope its a seperate one for each of the major houses. Then i would play it. But i'd probably not be picking it up again once i finish that.

I purchased the original Dune: 2000 as well as Emperor: Battle for Dune.  The makers of those games gave credit where it was due to the original movie and books by enthralling the player with ""worm sign"" as well as the themed factions in the game following those of the science fiction masterpiece.  This game takes aspects of the originals and modernizes them into the current gaming world, while keeping the game mechanics smoothly delivered and the story line of the book/movie solid and intact.  The inclusion of the storms and the depiction of them is very well done, as well as the fact that they incur damage on units as well as buildings.  The warfare as well as diplomacy are decently balanced.  I enjoy the fact that the ""shielding"" on our units is most aptly displayed in the fights that take place between units.  The theme music is well balanced with the unit sounds and the fighting can be heard clearly while zoomed in and fades away when you zoom out, this is a very nice touch.  I have only played a few hours of the game so far, but I would like to see a campaign with DLC.  The territory view on the map is classic Dune, the way the colored territories are divided is wonderful and I am very very glad to see it in this version of the game! It brings me back to the 1990z games....if it works never try to fix it!  Minimizing the need to over manage the placement of structures or defense of a single base is a wonderful difference in this game vs older RTS strategy games.  Overall the strategy and design of the UI are well done...I feel the tutorial is oddly lacking though.  If I had never played this style of game before I might have been confused for much longer.  I had to figure out on my own how to balance the economy with my army/structures.  This is something that a campaign usually delivers to the player, experience. I like how the units kind of find their own way around obstacles and get caught by the worms in transit, I just don't see any sign of the worm like a shark swimming into the shallows just before the kill.  Ornathropters taking multiple missle hits is also kinda unrealistic, but if you account for the most recent vs of the Movie, they have personal shields. 

A few cons though, the ornathropter 'sound bytes' are so similar to a christmas carol that its hard not to think someone did it on purpose.  The notifications are small and not easily discerned as they are all symbols with alert sounds that are not very well delivered and so it's difficult at best to react on time to worms while 12 notifications for building ques, diplomacy and commerce etc etc etc are taking place all while fighting a couple battles at once.  Not being able to rotate 360 degrees on the map could be considered a simplification of map management but i find it restrictive and limiting.

There has been a blue screen bug in the game for months and the developers still haven't fixed it yet. Basically, the game just turns into a blue screen.

To explain a little bit, tutorial is not enough. Just start with 2 units, 2 drones and a spicy village but don't overdo. Then, you should know influence, intel and researchs are just for diplomacy(you can make peace, trade, make agreement and even tribute them all), voting phases and intelligence operations. Mostly, use minerals(easiest to obtain and consume) and solari(main currency) to build and maintain, manpower for military/militia units/buildings and boost the spice production. Water(human units and villages) and fuel(for spice building and drones) are constant need and do not accumulate however can be converted to spice or solari with research or tribal trade. Then, hegemony counter and choam stakes(fluctuate too much) are passive win conditions. The research tree is a flat and easy, just watch for bonuses, penalties and handy base building. 

However, the spice being not useful as advertised, except for imperial tax(gradually increasing) and prior selling(changes after voting), is sad. If you save too much, they are less valuable. Also, the exploration is hard to follow and the opponent's bases are located too far away, and conflicts(even starting with a state of war) are delayed.

Colossal, extremist Monarchies rule the galaxy--inbred politically, if not even physically to a lesser extent. A mighty monotheism of political control and drug addiction. Violence and fanaticism are common tools to hold the power: Spice. He or she who controls the Spice controls the universe!

Dune is the battlefield, the cradle of addiction, and home to the delusions (and hallucinations) of messiah-hood. Blood must be shed to protect and distribute the drug. He or she who controls the Spice is the drug dealer! The insufferable, dystopian future in the name of a narcotic! 

Dune is a serious book (including the other books in the series, and also, Brian Herbert's/Anderson's literary extensions of the Dune universe) basically detailing a future of galactic drug addiction and environmental decay (and hope), and the loss for the multitude of humanity of their mental, physical, and political control, as well, to aristocratic dominions, would-be messiahs, and biological/mechanical manipulations, among other flotsam and jetsam.

This is a drug war! Not to rid oneself of it but to control it.

This obviously brings one to this game based on Dune. It's enjoyable, and has potential to be very good. At this point it feels, according to my viewpoint alone, extremely superficial when compared to the literature. But then again, it's unfair to compare it to the many years and thousands of pages that Frank Herbert, and others, have added to the Dune universe. Let alone the movies. It's basically Dune-ish with a typical video game construction, in a particular genre. For the most part, I think people would enjoy it.

Indeed, one point that needs applauding is the music! An excellent mixture that conjures the imagination of Dune. It certainly works for me.

The art-style is typical mainstream fare. Although done well, It looks like something from the Star Wars animation series. My personal artistic preference would've been something more akin to H.R. Giger's or Alejandro Jodorowsky's vision. Something with a darker, sci-fi feel to it. As a long-time artist and writer myself, I feel that the artwork still squarely fits within the overwrought, mainstream, digital art perspective, and isn't very original.

At the end of it, though, I'm grateful to have something to play that's in the Dune universe. If you're interested, and invested, in the universe of Dune, and enjoy city-building/4X; and not too critical because of the success of the books and movies, this game could be fun and unforgettable.

If the game is continually worked on as they did with Northgard then this game will be a shining gem but as of now I have to admit I was pretty disappointed. Others have stated their flaws, mine is that the economy is so slow to build and armies are small. I like the drone exploration but units are so expensive. 

I'll keep revisiting this game and add to my review and change it once I can recommend it. As it is, if I want that class Dune RTS experience I expected, I'll need to revisit the classic Dune game which REALLY needs a proper remake (yes I've played the free remastered games for Windows 10, those don't count)

Not only is it closer to the source material than any other Dune game to date (perhaps with exception to Dune1 but that's arguable), it also innovates by introducing 4X elements on top of an RTS chassis. No longer is it all about war; espionage, politics, economics, diplomacy all play an integral part in the game and can become avenues to victory. I recommend this to anyone interested in the Dune universe, RTS (especially if like me you are bored of the traditional RTS formula), 4x and strategy games in general.

Aside from some early access bugs, my two complaints are the lack of a 5 player FFA mode (currently it's 4 players max), there are rumors that might be implemented at full release. Secondly, as is traditional with all RTSish games, overtime, the MP community has migrated to the fastest speed 1.5x which is annoying for those like me that prefer the normal 1.0x speed.

There is a lot on my wish list that I hope gets added to this game to make it much more unique and enjoyable. 

Some things that I hope get added, changed or improved:

-A second tech tree in the style of diplomacy with factions not directly in play. This could be a 3 pronged approach between, 
A: exploiting Dune for all its worth and getting the most from what you have. (we don't need help, dune is ours) 
B: Taking a lighter approach and siding with the natives, getting unique bonuses through them but not being able to exploit dune as much. (the locals are the experts, they've been here long enough to learn how to survive and we will use that to our advantage) 
C: Either a middle ground approach (boring), or siding with some third faction. The Emperor? The Bene Gesserit? The Ordos? (taking Dune without some help is foolish. We will need some assistance). 
This can be a key decision for your overall strategy. 

-AI at max friendship should not be using agent actions against me. Some lower tier actions can be understandable, but causing a riot seems a little much for someone with maxed friendship

-More unique tech in the tech tree between factions. 

-A larger unit roster

Dune: Spice Wars is a game developed by Shiro Games and published by Funcom and Shiro Games

The game offers some nice graphics and a nice aesthetic, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and although it is in Early Access, it has a lot to offer

Dune: Spice Wars overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a really good 4X strategy game to play in short bursts!

If you're a massive fan of the Dune series like me and have been anxiously waiting for a new Dune game, as well as a new 4X strategy game, although Dune: Spice Wars is still in Early Access, it marvellously honours the Dune series and is chock-full of stuff to do, even in it's current state!

I absolutely love the quality of games coming from Shiro Games. When you start up Dune Spice Wars you can feel the ambience ooze with love through the audio and visual queues seeped in lore.  
The slower pace of Spice Wars is equivalent to that of Stellaris and allows you to focus on the expansion strategy, diplomacy and management of your growing sectors.  There's a lot of intricate systems and mechanics which grow into foundational pieces reminiscent of most grand strategy 4x games, and I'm excited for what this will mean for the future of Dune Spice Wars.

[i]Unfortunately it's not there yet[/i].  I would have appreciated if Shiro Games took a bit longer to tidy up the UI so that you can click on the various keywords to understand better about the mechanics and lore going on. They could certainly take learning from Crusader Kings III's tooltip system here!  The research is still a bit clunky while not fully knowing why you need to do it or really what the affect would be - and there's no way to ""research"" yet.  Council votes seemed [i]tagged on[/i] albeit as a somewhat foundational diplomatic mechanic. Experiencing lagging issues when combat or worm events start is a bit of a worry for a 2.3Gb download game on a 2080 Super rig with 32 Gb RAM and SSD's.

And... probably the most disappointing experience for me is that I my troops (and harvester) straight over an [i]existing[/i]  sandworm warning for a [i]very long time[/i] before it [i]finally[/i] emerged - removing all sense of ""danger"" for me.

The premise of the game and the audio and visual representation is absolutely amazing. I love that it's more a 4x grand strategy game than an RTS.  The core game is very functional and playable albeit with seemingly random performance encounters and a rougher than it needed to be user interface.

As a lover of the Dune saga - this game is amazing and worthy tribute to the Dune legacy.
As an Early Access title [i]it's only Okay[/i] though. I truly wished they would have held out a little longer for a bit more polish.

[b]I'd recommend the title as a whole[/b] as a worthy entry in any Dune or grand strategy fan's library.
[b]I would also recommend you wait[/b] for a few patches before picking it up though.
I don't like supporting the ""Early Access"" trends of developers lately and don't want to encourage them bringing rough around the edges games... especially with such a beloved franchise.

The biggest problem with the game is, that its mid-game is just too.....uneventful? slow? The average game lasts about ~2-3h depending on how you play it. I currently found that it's best to play on double speed always on and pause to read events. otherwise the game just drags for too long.

They haven't found yet good pacing for this game and combat is a little too simplified, I think they should add more variety than it currently has. Like different weapon systems, currently its all based on close quarters infantry, which is basically just making a task force of different buffs and just destroying everything on its path with supply drops.

The world is nice, and even tho its seems like a Settlers of Catan map as permadesert, they have found beautiful balance in how to make map not flat, but give it different choke points and movement corridors.

Sand worms sadly are trash right now, they are not danger. I think if they'd make them more randomized and actually give them purpose of hunt, then they wouldn't be so predictable and easily avoided.

The 4x part is done well, and everyone who is saying they think this game has too much things to do, is just used to playing games on one field at a time. Currently it is good that its not possible to dominate on every field, otherwise it would have no point in having different houses.

As a Shiro Games fanboy, I love this game, I'd recommend it to other Shiro Games fanboys, but I wouldn't suggest it to random people who like to play some RTS or Civ on the side just yet. It is clear that the game is still in early access, and needs some more content and pacing balance, before I could suggest it to my friends as a fun game..",1651179985,1669272721,False,21,0,0.655083954334259033,3,True,False,True

Because I don't hate it and it's not a bad game. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's after a complete immersive Dune experience.

I had high hopes, and am a big fan of Northguard this developers other big famous game. But after 20hrs of playing it still just felt like Northguard to me. There is some homage and love paid to the previous Dune games -  that I grew up with and love - but overall, it just feels like Northguard re-skinned. All the main mechanics are very similar, and while they do indeed lend themselves to a spice/land-grab area domination concept well, it to me just feels hollow and lacking all the magic of Dune. In many ways it perfectly captures the original simplicity of Dune 2, but not in a way I find captivating. Overall it feels like 70% DNA of Northguard, 30% Dune 2.

The choice of illustration and simplicity of the game concept all feel like missed opportunities to me. The Dune universe is loved because of its richness, depth, huge explorable / open imaginative world building, and its detailed lore. Spice Wars unfortunately, despite being a challenging area domination game, doesn't have any of those things really. I honestly feel Dune 2 or Emperor Battle for Dune did better in that regard, and those game had some serious limitations.

The few mechanics that are somewhat original - like the Landsraad Council, are my least favourite things and in fact I've came to loathe interacting the council much like the World Congress in Civ 6. You know what I'm talking about. I want Dune suspension of disbelief - give me massive maps, detailed nuanced base building, open world / sandbox, beautiful interactive worlds. I want to forget I'm playing a game and be on Arrakis. I know I'm describing a different kind of game here, one which would be a A+++ title and require a lot of resources, but I'm also qualifying why this Dune experience wasn't the one I'm after. 

But I don't regret giving it a go. The game designers clearly do love Dune deeply and I give the atmospheric rendering and audio 10/10.

If you love Northguard and this kind of game mechanic, then you may love this game as well. I wouldn't want to warn people off it if they're curious, but I also wouldn't rave to another Dune fan about how great it was. 

After some more content is added and the game exits early access I will probably give it one more go. I am curious to know what happens with the Campaign mode when it's ready - it could potentially add a lot.",1669261027,1669261045,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,True

Ornithopters can be upgraded to gather inTel while in enemy territory.

I've attempted to many times but always thought that it never conveyed the XYZ of what makes the game great. However with Dune: Spice Wars I have to make a concerted effort as the Dune universe holds a dear place in my heart that allows me to be a proud Sci-fi fan. 

Anyone who has read the novels and/or watched the movies knows what they're expecting and Shiro Games have gone to great lengths to bring the Dune universe into a modern game setting, and they do not disappoint. I feel like the 4X system is the perfect way of conveying Dune into a game considering the scale. Just like Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle for Dune did back in the day, Dune: Spice Wars is a worthy successor for the modern era. 

The art design, environment, visuals, aesthetics, model design, sounds, OST etc are excellent and really bring it all to life. Making the control for Arrakis even more immersive. 

There are currently 5 factions in the game and each of them have their own flavour and play style. A selection of Councillors (that are taken from the Dune lore) to give extra abilities to the faction you are playing, so from one game you can go for domination, to the next hegemony, and then to the next governorship victory conditions, making just 1 faction replayable over and over again. 

Each faction has access to unique buildings and research developments allowing you to play the way the faction was intended (from a lore perspective) but doesn't limit you just to play that way either. The unique mechanics some factions receive are also entertaining and very fitting - looking at you Harkonnen. 

The unit selection is very nice with each military unit serving a specific purpose in a combined army. Although some will be rated higher than others by the player base it's nice to have the choice, makes fighting engagements different each time. 

I could ramble on forever but I really do recommend this game, its a highly polished 'Early Access' game that is only going to get better with the patches and updates. Any Dune fan in particular will love this game. Any 4X player will probably also enjoy the game for its atmosphere and game mechanics while maintaining the 4x style you know and love.

[b]Update:[/b] Just like to say a massive thank you to those that have awarded this amateur-review, hope you found my crazy ravings somewhat useful. 

As the Air & Sand is here and has already received a patch thought I'd just point out a few updates. All factions have access to two air units; one being a light craft and the other a super heavy type. As you'd expect these units follow the same design of their faction's owner and has mixed up the game play even more. A neutral renegade faction that at a certain point start to land and claim villages to eventually gear up and send out raiding parties to attack you and your opponents. Three [i]Wonder[/i] buildings to help you gain the edge in a certain aspect furthering your goals of victory. And of course even more patches of improvement and performance boosts. 

I wish I could be more critical of the game to provide you some negatives but I've currently played 400+ hours and encountered very little. A few visual bugs and pathing, maybe? But nothing game-breaking and considering the 2012 laptop I'm running with its integrated graphics? I'm surprised this game runs for me at all. 

Also will mention to any of those that are worried about the game system requirements. I have Win10 | i3 | 6GB | Intel HD 4000 Graphics and all my in game graphics set to low and I get between 20-25 fps and at worst (heavy battles) around 15fps, not the best I know but I'm used to games running mega slow on this old girl. If you have anything better than above (and I'm sure you do) the game will run even better than stated above. 

This game is still in Early Access and with the current update my game runs even better.

I would like to offer my free time to find holes to a game i suspect will provide a great deal of long term play utility.  Who am I?  I am the guy that finds good strategy games and will make a self imposed law to not use a discovered exploit so I can enjoy the game for what it was built to be.  I am the guy that (when possible) max the difficulty.
Example of an exploit everyone will notice when playing so far....
- A.I. exploit to consider changing.  When computer attacks a territory...it only takes you a single unit to get the attention of the entire attack force and lead him away from your weak territory over to your well defended base to die.

Masters of Orion
Alpha Centauri/Alien Xfire (20 years worth of play on max difficulty)
Many Total War builds.

As Atreides (and maybe other factions), one thing going wrong causes your side to spiral out of control.  
Your small army takes a while to put together and can be wiped out in a single battle or by one sandworm - while you might survive, your fate is likely sealed.  
There are at least 6 different types of resources to manage - a shortage in one will not only cause penalties relating to that resource, but also another resource too.  All villages, buildings and units have a construction / capture cost and a maintenance cost comprising of multiple resources, making it very easy to get into deficit when one of your villages rebels (guaranteed when you're next to Fremen), a village is attacked / pillaged (mid game, often 2 will get attacked at the same time).

After playing Starcraft a lot, for like 20+ years - this game feels like a breath of fresh air. No APM focus, but mainly your strategy here defines your chances to win. Heavy military operations or/and sneaky spy missions to assasinate your opponent - choose your own way to win.

One of the most interesting parts even in the early access are the 2v2 games we have with the global community! And it's even more fun to talk to people in Discird while playing these 2v2 games - something solo 1v1 strategies like Strarcraft or Age of Empires miss and will never have.

[b]No depth to diplomacy/trade:[/b] The simplest form of diplomacy/trade, instead of feeling the hostility from the factions you're at war, you are welcomed with a boring trading screen where you will find what the other faction needs or not the most, trading or not with them what they are in desperate need of, doesn't change the dynamics of your relationship, and doesn't add to your story with this faction, so it is indeed a very blunt experience).

[b]No depth to combat:[/b] Fighting units even in the old games such as Age of Empires have more effects(catapults, fire arrows, etc.) while fighting, and ways you can fight, making different units more effective in different situation and terrains, now this game has nothing, just a simple take as many strong units you have and hope you don't get swallowed by the worm(the worm is a nice thing that needs to be refined).

[b]No depth to defence:[/b] And the same goes for defences, we need instruments that will allow s planning positions of our building within the world so that we are giving our cities advantage if we place defences and building in certain ways, all you gave us is the boring range circle of our defence turrets...

[b]Strangely implemented Spice economics:[/b] the more Spice you produce the more the empire takes, and the AI complexity is definitely not well implemented since, if you manage to produce a lot more Spice right at the start than most factions, somehow they still don't end up bankrupting from the penalises and their inability to produce sufficient amount of Spice.

The AI seems to grow armies and resources much faster than the players.   Additionally, there are raiding parties that invade your controlled space.   As a player, it is impossible to afford militia's because they take manpower which you disparately need for the front line armies.   Then the armies have this supply feature that limits how far into enemy territory they can move.   Of course, if you get caught up in a stretch, you level 3 armies die because of the supplies - the game could be a bit more generous.    

Also, we need to be able to stop the game and evaluate - there is only one way to pause the game that I found and it does not let you look at the field.   The AI makes decisions much faster than a human, so you need to give the humans a chance to catch up.  

Yeah, the game likes to raid a village when you are attacking across the board.     Happened about 8 times in the few games I lost.

Multiplayer hits different. Somewhat. The mechanics are great for laughs and groans. Which brings up an interesting point I've seen in some of the reviews. What is this game's identity? WIll it cater to both a robust single player campaign and an engaging multiplayer experience? WIll more focus be given to one aspect at the cost of another? Is it possible to have both (I believe so)?

Games that require you to go to an outside wiki and read about how it works means they creators didn't make the game well.   I really liked northgard so I have hope for this but as is I cant say I recommend it.

2nd Edit - After several more hours and play throughs I'm doubling down on the the whole ""what is this supposed to be"" question.  Its like a really dumbed down 4x played at ultra slow RTS speed.

General: I was really enjoying the game up until I realised its a broken mess. I had explored the game, learning about the base buildings, development tree, units, factions, etc and had intimate working knowledge on two factions (Smugglers and Harkonnen) and was enjoying the experience until a friend and I tried two new factions Atredies and House Corrino (faction I chose). Thanks to our accumulated knowledge, the learning curve was shorter and we had a good idea on how to set things up for our victory conditions, but then he attacked with the Warden build with support troops and melted my troops. I sent three waves against the same army... NOTHING. It reminded of the time my friend got melted by my Smuggler Scav + Freeman build. I thought ""meh, get BETTER!. But now, this experience exposed a fatal flaw in traditional rock, paper, scissor philosophy of strategy games... some factions just dont have a counter and that is anti game. In CoH its beautifully simple, HMG counters Infantry, Mortar counters HMG, Infantry counters Mortar and this basic formula works for ALL factions. True, there is some disparity between the same units among different factions but the fundamental, underlying linchpin holding everything together is solid. In Spice Wars, they try to circumvent this system with the victory conditions; factions can really only go for certain victory conditions but the commonality is everyone has military units but the disparity is far too large... BROKEN!

Gameplay: Novel. Interesting exploration into the merging of TBS gameplay into RTS genre. Think Civ but in real time. Requires huge amount of time to understand basic gameplay.
Expansion is time and resource locked which makes early rushes, bread and butter for any RTS, IMPOSSIBLE. The games are also needlessly long and drawn out. The only solution is playing on a smaller map, but that then feels cramped.
Kanly is unplayable as factions are soooo unbalanced. It's ridiculous how bad the Dev Team got this. Worse balancing I've experience in an RTS.

Time: Ability to expand, research is similar to Northgard in that it is ONLY possible after certain amount of time and games are never less than a couple of hours. They really need to fix this if they want to appeal to an audience that don't have 2 hours a game. Look at any successful RTS, AoE, CoH and you see that the time needed to win isn't condition imposed on you by the game but, ultimately comes down to the players' actions.  

Strategy: Poorly lacking basic 'hold', 'attack move' commands or formation settings which make the game needlessly time consuming. Also, why can't I control when my garrison attacks. I find it infuriating that someone can avoid my garrison and fight on top of it by being careful and not clicking on the town and clicking on the unit. So silly and infuriating to think the difference between me holding and losing a settlement is me praying the other player misclicks and attacks the town.

Pathing: Poor. Units often have a mind of their own when pathing to settlements. It is not at all obvious where the paths up cliffsides are on the map and they seem to be randomly added.

Balance: Non-existant. I can't think of another strategy game I've played with worse balance issues. The victory conditions or game mechanics favour some factions so much it makes Kanly (1v1 gamemode) unplayable and forces players into certain builds.

Verdict: The Dev Team are trying but they really shouldn't be asking people for money for this broken game. Really shouldn't. They are getting free data and money for this early access game.",1668493702,1668493702,False,43,4,0.624151110649108887,0,True,False,True

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It's all about expanding so that you can acquire the various resources you need to expand and acquiring more space with which to build buildings which require more resources, so you need to expand more to acquire more resources to build buildings ect ect. AI is decent enough, though diplomacy is fairly weak even for House Atreides, the diplomacy faction. Most of your interactions with the other factions will be through warfare and sabotage. Warfare is simple and more Macro than micro. Rarely will you have to control units manually except to get them out of wormsign. Instead, you need to place more thought in where to deploy your army, as travel times are long and airports cost money and the even more valuable building space. Like civ, the factions are broadly similar, and most of your game to game enjoyment will come from map variety and dealing with the land the game dealt to you, which I feel a lot of reveiwers miss because the desert theme makes the map feel more samey than it is. 

TL:DR This isnt Dune 2. This is its own thing, a slow paced real time 4x game. If any reviewer thumbs the game down and brings up Dune 2, you can safely ignore them.

First off this game is only somewhat an RTS which I think throws off some reviewers.  This is a board game that has been modified to run as RTS because turn based is mostly dead it seems.   So if you move forward with thinking of it as a board game I think it fares better than if you try to compare it to RTS.

This is a very deep game where I like the different victory modes, usually I find the non-militaristic victories boring and cheesy but in this they seemed to have them well thought out, if maybe unbalanced and in need of tweaking since some victories are really too hard or too easy.

Balancing is the current gripe I have but I think they will improve it.

The other gripe many will have is the games can run too long to be practical with rando typical quitters on the internet. I imagine most people will just rage quit because they have attention deficit disorder or they dont want to play out a long game where they are on the losing side. I have only played it solo and with someone I knew to not be a rage quitter:).  This is more a commentary on gamers but still it will maybe be an issue for this game once it is fully released.

So I think it is A+ for originality and B or C for current completeness/balancing. But, found it thoroughly more fun than most repetitive uninspired RTS trash out there in the ""RTS"" world of clickfest unit spamming.

This game has few units so it's how you manage those units, your victory points, and your strategy which is refreshing compared to Starcraft RTS type unit spam.

Yes: I am VERY much enjoying this game, it is a very ... unusual combination of game play that reminds me of the Board Game from a long time ago. It's not Star Craft.

No: I have an old computer, I got it in late 2015. Skylake 4.0Ghz, 16GB Ram (2033 Mhz), GTX 970. Most of the time the game, on high settings, functions at 60 FPS. However, inexplicably during combat (between 12 units tops!) the game CRAWLS to 20FPS. The same thing was happening when I zoomed in and out too many times on Ultra Settings. Otherwise, on Ultra I usually got 40-50 FPS. 

Something is clearly wrong and weird here and not functioning properly. I dk if it's the result of my computer being old or the finicky GTX 970, but I will tell you my computer is smooth as can with Stellaris, hundreds of ships flying around with lasers, missiles, around gorgeously graphically modded stars. I also get very high FPS with Battlefield 1, 63 players running around, on ULTRA graphics, with every blade of grass beautifully rendered. Finally, Mad Max 2015, flying down the roads at top speed in a v8, NO PROBLEM. SMOOTH.  But 12 units having a World of War Craft attack fest and the machine virtually stops. Same thing with zooming in and out. This isn't right.

However, I am going to take a leap of faith and recommend this for everyone else, if you have an up to date machine. Hopefully, it works for you. It's a cool game, though definitely not for everyone.

And you can do that quickly, so you sit there staring at the screen waiting for something to complete and repeat the above steps.

The combat is nearly non-existent, very small scale and not dynamic.  The maps are stale and add nothing to the experience.  Defense is basic and mostly just a stall until you can send units to help out.  You don't have that many units, so building airfields and moving the whole ""army"" around is really the only logical thing to do, but again this is tedious and boring.

If you choose to do anything other than domination victory you'll end up winning before you feel like the game has started.  I won on Hegemony points without realizing it beforehand on the first try, then the game just ends.  You can continue on, but something happens to the AI after that.  Not sure what but they change their habits and the game gets easier.

If you want to make this game better the combat needs to be totally redone.  As of now you don't even really need to do much in the way of combat to gain territory and defend.  The tiles are fine, but there needs to be more to the base.  Why am I placing buildings????  I have never had the AI even attack one of them.  They just take the town and neutralize the turret if I'm not there.  Get rid of the physical buildings and add them as an extension of the town, so the town gets physically bigger when I add a building.  Make the town fortifiable and upgradeable defense wise.  The militia should be upgradeable to specialized units or static defenses.  I should be able to set up a ""siege"" operation on a village instead of just going up to it and standing there.  Set up a siege, bring in some artillery, reduce some ""resistance value"" to zero, take the town.  Where are the ornithopters bombing support............  Where are the devastators............  Sonic tanks?  If you're concerned that combat will cascade when someone starts taking over someones territories with tanks and full combat then do something to slow it down.  Make the map MUCH bigger and don't have towns on each tile.  Instead of supply killing the units (Let's face it.  The supply drop is dumb and negates this.) Just have terrain slow everything down.  Tanks get stuck in soft sand  and carryalls need to come unstuck them.  It's too hot to move quickly and foot units get slowed.  Magnetic anomalies abound in the tile and the units get turned around and exit in the wrong direction.  Tile is navigable by a certain path only.  Etc....

The voting needs to be more impactful.  There are too many items that really don't do anything.  Deliver 3 units to someone.  50% cheaper military....  These should really be part of the larger vote which has multiple parts to it.  Who in the 20th century votes on one item at at a time???  Real voting means you have to have things you don't want in there because you need other things to be in there.  And everything is known when you vote on it?  Why?  Should be a section that is revealed only after the vote is complete.  Things tacked on by smaller houses just before it becomes law.  There should be ""gang up"" votes as well when someone starts to become too powerful.  Atreides has all the titles and the governorship?  Side votes open up to the other houses take them down a notch voting wise (send them off planet for a series so they can't vote?).  Harkonnen took over 20 towns this series?  Tank ""fuel"" doesn't get delivered this series and tanks can't be used.

I could continue, but again the game isn't very dynamic.  Spying is a real let down.  Development is a chore.  Economy is unnecessarily imbalanced early to late game.  I have 200k Solari late game and I just buy CHOAM shares to no end.....in blocks of 20.....",1665411154,1665413183,False,2,0,0.531341552734375,0,True,False,True

Once you have worked out how to balance a local economy it is very hard to mess up, the pattern is repeated as you expand and you become very proficient at it.

The lack of units become a bore quite frankly. I know the developers are trying to stay true to the books but the result is a detriment to the game.

Dune Spice Wars is a slow game. You will take the first half to build up your lands and take over. Before going full out war either by Potlicking, espionage and just by might to destroy your enemies. Either way. Spice wars isn't a game for people who wants a fast pace RTS and instead it takes its time to build and it takes time and patience to rule Arrakkis.

each faction has a different playstyle. With different advisors that has pros and cons to a specific playstyle you are seeking. Such as the smugglers being economic savy with their water or spawning more underground network for their increase solari. Or the Fremen being masters of arrakkis and just not triggering Sandworms. Granted some factions are just better than others. 

Everything changed when House Corrino. And oh my god i love them and it just reignites my love for this game. Their faction is really everything about the emperor and makes you play another stlyle. The Style of being a turtle. You won't be able to expand wide instead have to divide and conquer two main bases in late game. instead you have to focus on your cities and make sure your authority counts. Don't simply take over cities and instead have a small handful of em. I love them so much. Plus it is also help that sometimes a game allows you to play as the highest authority of an organization.

Some bad tho. firstly, is that there are some bugs since it is early access. I am going to let it slide since they are always working in progress of their game. such as invulnerable bases where I can't even destroy a base with my units or the fact that the Ais cheat in their economy able to buy so much stocks when they are having 2k-3k gold. A bit strange but i hope they solve it out.  Additionally, is the combat. It isn't stellar and pretty and pretty basic. Just get your troops and beat each other to death and thats about it on the combat. Don't go expect an explosive one (UNLESS YOU BUILD ATOMICS).

The game rewards devious schemers, just as any game set in the Dune universe honestly should. Your options for ruining your enemy's day are vast and varied, and military action is only one way to devastate the enemy.

Espionage actually gives you information about your enemies, as well as providing underhanded methods to even the odds or even cause severe damage.

[b]#2.[/b] The game is fantastically slow. If you thought that Civ was slow, then wait till you play this.
[b]#3.[/b] The amount of different buildings you can build at the start is 15... and that's incredibly little if you compare it to HUMANKIND's 28 at the start for instance. You're just basically starved of choice.
[b]#4.[/b] The supply for your troops outside of your region run out way, way too fast.
[b]#5.[/b] The amount of buildings you can build by default on towns is 2..... that's hilariously little and it makes this already slow game feel & play even slower.
[b]#6.[/b] There's frequent hitching and stuttering
[b]#7.[/b] There's no mini-map or map
[b]#8.[/b] You aren't sufficiently notified when you successfully explore a location or finish an infiltration
[b]#9.[/b] Tooltips aren't displayed on many places where it rightfully should be.
[b]#10.[/b] The offensive infiltrations (sabotages) are all low-impact and basically useless.

I didn't like HUMANKIND that much, but I'd rather recommend that you spent $50 on that, than $30 on this. Or get Endless Space, or Civ, or Total War instead, because I just really can't recommend this game for $30. Dune from 1998 is more enjoyable. But Shiro can certainly improve upon what's here currently... and I love Northgard & Evoland, so best of luck to them.

But the spirit of the game is 100% on the right track. I've already gotten 40+ hours out of it, and I strongly suspect I'll easily get a couple hundred more. If you enjoyed games like the old school Dune 2, or the Command and Conquer remake, this has the spirit of those and expands them. BUT BE WARNED – it IS Early Access, and is still in need of a lot of polish. If that's an issue for you, wait. ALSO: I noticed a lot of negative reviews, but they also appeared to be from earlier versions, and it looks like the devs addressed them - but the general problems (mostly over tedious game elements) still exist in other areas. I see the fact that earlier complaints were addressed as a good sign (they seem open to player feedback), but there's clearly still some work for the devs to do, so wait if you're looking for a finished game or these issues bother you.

Detailed breakdown (and feedback for the devs):
Having grown up with Dune 2 and the Command and Conquer remake, I can say I've enjoyed how this game has captured the same spirit without being a simple clone. It's clearly not a coy/paste remake of those games, but it does capture the essence of their magic. The best comparison I can give is to my experience with Satellite Reign - where it clearly wasn't a simple remake of the original Syndicate Wars so I got to learn and play an entirely new game, yet still managed to capture a feeling of nostalgia. This version of Dune has done the same, and that's high praise in my book, so I'm giving them a thumbs up. Honestly, I wish I could give a no-thumb review as the game still needs a lot of work, but steam doesn't allow that, so I'll give them the thumbs up because in the end, I've already gotten my money's worth and it really feels like I'll get many many many more hours out of it, plus there are positive indicators that the devs are progressing in the right directions and listening to user feedback.

Things they got right:
1) The feel of Arrakis - it is a wholly harsh environment. I am almost always more scared of the planet than I am of my rivals... It feels like you're taking pot shots at each other between dodging everything Arrakis is throwing at you. All while trying to juggle politics, intrigue, economics, tech, and good old fashioned boots on the ground combat. I feel like Duke Laeto looked...Harried, haggard, and triumphant over every little victory... And I love it! You have to claw your victory not from your enemies, but from the planet itself...

2) The feel of the houses(/factions) and their relationships! Your enemy's enemy is NOT your friend - they're definitely also your enemy, but sometimes they can be convinced, or tricked, or exploited, or bullied, into ACTING like a friend for a short time - but make no mistake, their knives are only hidden behind their backs, not sheathed - never sheathed - give them an opening and they will calculate whether or not it's time to strike. It's truly amazing to not only observe, but participate in the subtle dance of the power dynamics between the houses - truly splendid! Each is wholly original, and no two feel alike. The differences are stark, but balanced and create a unique (and lore appropriate) feel for each. Superb!

3) The UI is not perfect by any means, but is already surprisingly efficient and clean. There are areas that need some work, but given this is an early access, and the polish on the parts of the UI that are obviously older, I'm looking forward to that level of refinement reaching every part of the UI.

Things they still need to do in the next few iterations almost all come down to: Make the player less overwhelmed with pointless distractions so they can focus on playing the game...

1) Make harvester pickup and return automatic by default, then provide technology and/or effects that make it more efficient. Then add Operations and/or events that risk loss of the harvester. Again, the manual element is just unnecessarily tedious and distracting, even the 'penalty' for non-manual operation in this version of the game is just an unnecessary burden on the player's attention when they want it to be elsewhere - free our minds... please.

2) The buying of CHOAM stocks needs to be automated. I should be able to set a desired purchase amount (or sell amount by indicating a negative number) – which should update as stocks are bought(/sold) – so if I put in 1000 originally, and the automated stock assistant has purchased 50 stocks since I last looked, the number should now read 950), a max purchase(/min sell price when the amt is negative), and a minimum liquidity (ie, only buy stocks when they won't drive my cash reserves below this amount). Extra credit for a checkbox for disabling any of these parameters (big/small numbers can have the same effect, but a ‘disable’ option gives a more polished UI), and for allowing the entry of a ‘%’ sign in the amount field to indicate ‘buy stocks up/down to this percentage of the market’.
Every 'cycle' (the length of which would need some real play testing to get right, so I'll leave it vague here, but every 0.1 seconds might be a good start), each faction should sell 1 stock if conditions are met, then each player who has purchase conditions met should buy 1 stock. If there are fewer stocks available than players who want to buy them, then a lottery could determine who gets to buy. A variation of this where those who didn't get to purchase last time get priority might be needed if testing indicates this can become an issue in actual play. Another other option would be simply not to sell to anyone until there are enough for everyone - resulting in up to 3 stocks sitting there as the price changes until enough buyers drop out, or enough shares come onto the market; but this seems the less intuitive an option to me. These solutions may be too naïve of course, but the general idea should be valid. Basically, I should be dealing with stocks strategically, not be having to count 4, open the UI, buy 20, close the UI, count 4, open the UI, buy 20, close the UI, etc. - nor just sit there with the UI open doing nothing else...

3) Pet peeve, removing the 'political' win condition (hold the Governor of Dune charter for 45 days) disables the appointment all together (governor charter never unlocks), instead of just the 45 day requirement. Please fix this... It's not like disabling the 'Economic' win stops you from buying CHOAM stocks...

4) Since there are actual CHOAM 'Stocks' in the game, please use 'supply' or ‘avail.’ (or another word) in reference to 'how much stuff you have on hand'... (for instance the plascrete tooltip should say 'supply 247/5000' instead of 'stocks 247/5000' - it's just disorienting... especially for things like manpower... what even is 200 'stocks' of manpower?)

5) Build Queue for the villages - don't make me come back after every build. If I have the resources to buy all the extension slots and buy all the buildings, let me do so. You can still have them build in order over the appropriate number of turns, but why make me open that UI over and over - more importantly, why constantly distract me from where I WANT my attention to be...

6) Definitely need a PoI window with a list of all discovered PoI's so you're not having to constantly pause and hunt for them. While we're at it, a queue for these too (at least for the agent investigation option).

7) Multiple Autosaves - at least 2, but more would be better, a player setting would be best. At least 2 are needed because there are still issues with the game; and, tbh, is a decent feature to have in a game like this anyways.",1664299317,1664300598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've come to the following conclusions:
Pros:
+The Unit Voicelines are JUUUST right, it gives you that classic dune 2000 vibe (Hats off to the Sardaukar Who go ""arrakis Ain't bad"")
+Faction advisers give a distinct advantage (Wensica is my favorite and an auto-include for an ecolord like myself), and the gameplay impact will only grow greater I feel with the heroes of arrakis update to come
+The unpredictability of Dune Sandworms means that lengthy treks through the desert to attack a player can be a risky endeavor, leading to either bold useage of airfields or border skirmishes to attempt to blitzkrieg through via pilfered supplies
+The developers seem to be alot more likely to keep this going unlike Drydock did with Age of Sigmar Stormground
 
Cons:
-Even with the fact each faction's five units feel distinct and different, the fact each faction only has five unique units means that in general, you'll be able to tell what to expect and how to counter it with each house. Hopefully the Air & Sand update will spice things up.
-Unless the Bene Tleilax Get added as their own faction (which feels unlikely, they'd likely form a not on the map faction you have to bargain with most likely.), there's a succint possibility that the developement team has written themselves into a standstill..... Unless of course they wish to add in House Ix and Other Great/Minor houses as playable factions... Only time will tell
-Dear God Assassination requires you jump through hoops to get it done, granted it's not the only victory option however it is still mighty tedious and boils down to a Mana Point saving up
-There is no leader defeat screen, granted this is understandable for a hegemony victory, however in the duneverse this feels like a cheap insult. Especially considering both destroying their main base or assassinating them takes a great deal of effort.
-The Ai is flawed.... maybe on higher difficulties it's more even (through cheating though I wager...) but so far in both my games I've noticed the fremen seem to almost always wind up being the abuseable underdog. Though that might simply be due to the fact Fremen bonuses are better made use of by players, and not AI.
-The OST is something i have to remind myself exists, the developers are of course welcome to their own musical tastes, however while a subtle soundtrack that seems to fade in the desert wind might work for peacetime, it does make the game feel emotionally lacking when combat begins. This is a minor complaint for me though as you can always just mute the music, and play whatever music you feel better fits Arrakis.

Thank you For Reading my Review, This Game I feel is a gem that needs only be polished, it has potential and I feel is definitely worth a try on a good sale.

You’ve made it more complicated which is good. Thank you! But it could be better. First of all, a mini map is needed and also if there could be an in-game encyclopedia; it will be great because it's difficult to understand what is what and how to use them in your strategy. It was very exciting to try not to be eaten (especially harvester) by sand worms but in this game, it was not as exciting as it used to be and why can't I produce more than one harvester in one area? I prefer to be able to produce more harvester and lose more to the sand worms if I don't keep tracking them and focus on another area. 
Is it possible that I could see the name of the sources needed when I move the cursor on them (it'll be great especially in the intelligence menu, I couldn't understand what I needed to assassinate my enemies and how I could get them)? And also, one time I tried to capture an enemy territory; but I needed 536 authority points which was impossible to get because the limit was 500. Also waiting to get some authority points slows me down more than I like it (it's ok at the beginning but when I'm powerful why my authority points increase slowly even though I broke my engagements?) and it’s boring. I have more thoughts. You can reach me if you need further assistance. This game is important for me, I have precious memories playing it. Thank you! 😊

It is hollow and empty despite trying to throw everything into the mix.  This is an odd mix of 4X and RTS genre of games but lacks on both.  You develop a process of building and gathering troops then take over the next territory, rebuild and the redo the same thing.  At this point the units, the buildings all get to be repetitive.  Dune tries to make it a challenge by limiting the number of troops you can build all together, and the number of buildings in each territory, but it ends up being the same mix each time.  Eventually you get so deep into things, it becomes pointless to go to rear territories to re-balance your buildings.  At the same time if you are going for victory other than conquest, you need to remember to go into the Choam Market to gain enough stock to corner the market.  

Then there is the spies and diplomacy and trade. All still lacking.  Missions with spies are essentially suicide, otherwise they just sit there.  Diplomacy, you can try finagling your way into something but it only lasts a few ""days"" but really minutes, that might give you a temporary upper-hand. Trade; I never could figure out how to counteroffer or if I was being able to make a good deal. 

Then the land starts building up with exploration encounters, but most become useless and obsolete so they sit there cluttering up the map. While you are trying to balance all of then it gets announced that you have won a hegemony victory.

Mechanics in general are good. Combat is fairly balanced, but you do not have enough troops to provide internal security from rebels and marauders and project attacks. Moving troops across the map is slow and painful, the air transport is lacking. Path finding needs work to avoid hazardous areas; way points work but not really.

Being a big fan of the Dune world, including the first two books and the new movie, I was excited to see this game drop several months ago. I'm definitely not a fan of the RTS genre, though, so I was initially bummed that it looked real-time. Personally, no matter how hard I want to enjoy well-crafted games like StarCraft, I can't deal with the time-sensitive approach to strategy gaming. There's just too much going on for just one old man to manage. Thankfully, this isn't the case with Dune, which allows you to Pause anytime to issue orders and scan for happenings.

Although I'm hesitate to share a review for an early access game, I enjoyed my first playthrough so much that I felt compelled to write my first-ever review, briefly covering the following areas:

VISUALS
+ Great art style overall. I wondered if it would feel too cartoony, but it never goes too far in that direction (like Civ6). Villages look cool, and the buildings add a nice touch. Having come straight from Stellaris, I was relieved that this game didn't feel like I was simply managing a massive spreadsheet covered by a thin graphical veneer.
+ I experienced mild but frequent split-second stuttering, maybe every minute or so.
+ Graphically, I'd like to see more special effects to emphasize the Dune world - maybe like the Spacing Guild's heighliners and other ships blotting out the sun, or at least their shadows, upon arrival to Arrakis to pick up the Spice. Other ideas: lasguns, Holtzman shields, MIRV rockets (like the ones expertly depicted in the new movie), etc.

SOUND DESIGN
+ Some great sound effects (ex. sandworm, ornithopters, din of battle, etc.)
+ Music was not so memorable. I mentioned Stellaris earlier, which had sound effects and music that blew me away. Despite playing 6 straight hours of Dune, the music did not stand out (nor did it detract)

INTERACTION & UI
+ UI is relatively sleek and simple to use. When watching videos before purchasing, I was initially a bit intimidated at the complexity of the game. Like Frostpunk, I jumped in and everything simply felt intuitive. It's possible that my understanding of the Dune theme and setting supported my understanding of the UI and mechanics, but overall compared to above-mentioned Stellaris this was a cake-walk to learn (again, like Civ6).

MECHANICS
+ The learning curve might be steeper for people completely unfamiliar with Dune. The regular CHOAM taxes, the Spacing Guild (whom you only ever see in the Espionage window), the sietches, etc. - all concepts and vocabulary that are most likely puzzling for newbies. This is NOT a complaint, because Dune is a fantastic world (one of the best in sci-fi), and to not have that thick layer of lore and depth would be a missed opportunity. In fact, I would have liked to see even more, including the Bene Gesserit, the Bene Tleilax, ""kanly"" assassination operations between families, the Padishah Emperor's heavy-handed Sardaukar, 
+ Trading was not particularly useful in my playthrough, and might need some more work. In my short experience admittedly, opponents were unwilling to make fair trades; I was neither able to sign a non-aggression treaty despite the overwhelming price I tried to pay, and other factions proposed ridiculous trades to me (like half my inventory spread for a pittance of Spice, which I was absolutely swimming in).
+ Despite having my Harvesters on auto-recall (something I highly recommend doing, despite the tiny loss in spice accumulation), I was losing them left-and-right by the end. Around 30% of my Harvesters were getting gobbled up by worms the moment wormsign was announced. Is this an intended mechanic, or a bug?
+ Combat is simple, with very few types of combat units. Personally, I don't much care for micromanaging combat unit in strategy games, so I was not turned off at all - even thankful. But I can see some room for improvement here by either adding a more expansive menu of combat units, or tweaking how combat plays out a bit. Some ideas: siege units for cities/villages, some faster ""horse"" style units, lasgun units, artillery...? This might be a stupid idea, but when combat is initiated, it could seamlessly transition to a small grid-based approach to facilitate positioning and battle lines. Whatever, I still like it!
+ Graphically, the Harkonnen faction should have a more ominous look; polluted, industrial black, neon green lights...

CHARACTER & THEME
+ What can I say? It's a Dune game steeped in the book's setting, lore and the recent movie. I'm all in for this, take it and run with it as much as possible. MORE!

DEFINING MOMENT
+ When I sent an agent over to the Harkonnens for an assassination operation, and he was sadly captured, used as a bargaining chip unsuccessfully, then brainwashed. Total Harkonnen move!
+ I was really hoping to work out a way to assassinate an opposing faction, but sadly my attempts were stymied. I imagine it's quite difficult to do; I didn't get anywhere close, despite steamrolling on an Easy playthrough.

Overall, I really like this product and can't wait to see where it goes.

However I do recommend watching the new DUNE, 2021 film. It helps clear up some of the political issues and gives you a better understand on who is who. 

Alright now with the game review. 

From a visual perspective, its artistic, simplistic but beautiful. The sand glittering, the mysterious smoke that surrounds you all builds up to create this dangerous world. Might I also mention, its quite polished for an EA game, off to a great start!

The Game-play is simple but hard to master. Learning what you need first is a must, but comes with time and experience, since is its a 4x world, you have to plan ahead, be one step in front of your enemies. Otherwise....well goodbye Arrakis.  

Now with some negatives / feedback:

Having played it for 8 hours plus, at the time of this review. 

- I wish there was a way to properly communicate with your ""Neighbours"" Instead of going straight to a trade. I was hoping there would be more options in negotiations, political trees and power etc. Most games I've played like this just jump into a trade. A great innovative idea which can surely be done throughout EA, is adding different conversations, which may help or deter your relationship with the other factions. 

- I would have liked more identity in troops among factions. Having played for a bit now, I have noticed that the troops among factions are somewhat similar. Having more of an identity in troops among the few factions would be nice! Hopefully down the line. As well as new fighting animations, at least make them look a touch different :). 

- SPICE! The most precious resource in the game, a MUST have for survival and economic growth. Since every-time you jump in the world is randomised you sometimes might be MILES away from Spice, making it nearly impossible for you to reach at the start. Some might argue and says ""Well it's not supposed to be easy etc"" ""Life isn't fair"" HA!. So I say in regards to this, if you don't spawn near it ""Fine"" but at least put it somewhere close by so that I can venture out and attain the spice without having my troops die from lack of resources and sand worms...

1. Balancing - there exists a fremen exploit that makes them extremely powerful. Essentially, you can build structures to power up your army, and the ability stacks with every structure you build. And theres nothing stopping the fremen from constructing as many of these buildings as possible. they also have a feydekin heavy infantry unit that has more health than any other unit. These two attributes, coupled together, makes a fremen army unstoppable, This power mechanic makes using the other factions very unrewarding. 

2. Simplistic combat mechanics - this game is still early beta, but as of this writing the combat may be the most glaring flaw. You will spend the length of the game building an economy that can sustain a sizable military. Units cost a great deal to maintain, and if you lose your army the game might as well be over for you. Once defeating you in battle, there is very little stopping your opponent from marching right up to your base and destroying it, killing your units as they spawn in. Even if you have time to build a fresh army, they stand little chance against an enemy army that's been leveled up,  feeding on your military for exp. 

3. diplomacy and infiltration are underpowered - its surreal to spend 30 to 45 minutes swaying congress, just to get steamrolled by an enemy military in 5 minutes. If the combat took longer, perhaps you could pose stiff restrictions on the aggressing faction. Or infiltrate their ranks and insight rebellion or mass desertion. But military engagements, and wars as a whole, are over so quickly and can destroy your faction so definitively it is impossible to use diplomacy or infiltration in any significant way. I think part of this is that the time to research and use these abilities is very long, and will not stop a faction using a military build.
 
These issues hold this game back, but i believe there is real potential here. Its a little rough under the hood, but the user interface is stylish, and the macro is satisfying. if the games micro were integrated better with its macro, and the balancing were taken care of, this game will be awesome. Perhaps once their new update is released and the next faction is included, they will be able to take care of these balancing issues.

+ So played 26 hrs over 3 days, pretty much non stop. Doesn't happen to me very often.
+ Every faction feels unique and plays really well with their respective theme in Dune universe. This uniqueness builds into asymmetric gameplay far exceeding just special units. The gameplay is shaped that you actually feel like Fremen when using the Fremen mechanics!
+ As far 4X go this one has really good pacing. Good early, mid and late game.
+ Minimal micro management 
+ Very interesting set of 4X mechanics that fit the Dune theme perfectly 
+ Hard AI is a balanced challenge, feels very fair.
+ Wasn't sure about the art direction, stylised variant of the themes in the recent Dune movie, but it looks nice and is very readable.
+ Feels well made and robust on technical side

Negative
- Hegemony victory seems the default way to go, You can just safely grind into it which makes the end game go flat and timid.
- It's great if you know and love Dune universe, but the game itself doesn't really introduce the world really well on it's own.

So onto this game: 
I have never played any kind of 4X games before - they really do not appeal to me, so at first I was worried this was not going to be a game I enjoyed. Boy was I wrong - I guess thats partly because this really is not a 4X or RTS game -  Its a hybrid game blend of quite a few game types - something that is very refreshing.

However - be aware as this game is early access and a new hybrid type of game - do not expect the game to explain much about the in depth aspects of this game. For some this might make the game seem shallow - but I can assure you, you just need dig deeper into the game and try new things.. The good news you can save the game before you give something a shot and see if it works out. I have heaps of hours on this game now and every time I play i found out something new.

Now once you have got the gist of the ""general"" game  (prob around 2-8 Hours of game play depending on how quickly you pick up on new things) you can really start to enjoy self and start exploring what this game has to offer.. 

Now a couple of points for the older Dune games fans (I ams one of them).. I have played every westwood RTS ever released including Dune 2, Dune 2000, Dune Emp:BFD  - I loved them.. and i hope to see a reboot of that game.. However this game is NOT THAT...  For one - House Ordos is not and I can not see how the game devs would be able to obtain the rights to even use that IP... (Yes EA Games owns the rights to the Ordos house IP) .. This game is not a base building RTS game... if thats what your looking for.

Welp, I'm not an expert on 4X games, played some of them in my time but my concern on those games was that there was too much to learn/so many things to get a grasp on. So I always quit or got bored before mastering any of them.That doesn't mean those games were bad.
Simply put, ''It didn't click for me''.

So, Shiro's Dune isn't one of those 4X games but that doesn't mean it's good, it's rather shallow or dull compared to Civ, Stellaris, Endless, etc. 

Since it's early access, there are lots of room for improvements but it's pretty hard for me to recommend if you like the 4X genre as a whole.

Every system has one big resource required (buildings require 'plascrete,' politics require influence, researching developments require knowledge, etc.) and they often intertwine, requiring you to build and micromanage your economy very mindfully. At the same time, it is not overwhelming to input commands like it is in other rts games (starcraft), the overwhelming part is mental in that you have to consider the long term impact of your actions. Truly a good 4x game. 

This is, however, quite a bit of information and it is not presented clearly to new players. It will take a few games to figure out exactly what is going on and which actions lead to which results. Particularly several late-game only mechanics are quite opaque on a first plathrough (what is a 'contraband event? is it any good?') Hopefully this will get better as the rules crystallize coming out of early access, but I do think it will get better as the devs seem to pay great mind to the UI of the game. Even just a proper wiki would do wonders. 

Like the UI, the rest of the game is simply stunning. It does some real justice to the Dune universe. Sound design, graphics, menus, all of it is just crisp with very little in the way of bugs and hiccoughs, until the later portions of the game anyway. It seems that once medium-large armies begin clashing (8-10 units on each side) even the beefiest 3080 will stutter. On my rig though, it is only a stutter, not game breaking in the least. 

After 60 hrs, the combat is a bit difficult to wrap my head around, though in large part this is due to a recent patch. Before then, I felt I had a very good understanding of who would win which fights and why. Now, it seems that defender's advantage (with turrets and militia) can win a fight on its own. Still, sometimes it is obvious that the AI simply knows something I don't. Again, this is something I expect to get better as rules are finalized towards an official release. 

The factions each have quite unique playstyles even though on the surface there is not very much difference to them. This is due to the complexity of how the systems tie to each other. For example, house Harkonen is best at spying, but spy missions can turn the tide of battle and can even be their own win condition if committed to. Similarly, the Fremen are the only faction able to 'fast travel' (or even just stealthily walk in) to enemy territory, making their threat to your main base ever-present if you make the mistake of overextending.

In the early game, you are expected to ratchet up your spice production ([b]""spice is life""[/b]... duh), but after that, you just need to balance your growth between other resources and expand your military. Combating the various rebel raids or rebellions and then potentially incursions from other factions keeps it interesting up to mid-game, but the fun fizzles there (sorry sand worms I can replace my troops easily enough). All factions have effectively the same tech tree with very little difference between them (this isn't Northgard another Shiro game with better and high variability), and so you can easily brute force your style of play on any faction. Here are my ideas on how to take this game to the next level:

- In the late game, you find yourself wanting to zoom out to the high-level map to manage better, but then get stuck having to switch back down to local level. It'd be great if you could therefore effectively play macro or micro only with all the commands available on each level. 

- Shortcuts would help as well, e.g. you will constantly need to re-deploy your harvesters after a sandworm attack if you arent The Fremen. 

- The AI also has a tendency to ""give-up"" where if you box them in but leave an opening for new growth they don't seem to re-build. 

- Battle mechanics could be smarter to keep you on your toes. Like Northgard, its also a question of numbers in combat - always make sure you have more and then just focus fire the units (I usually target ranged first). 

- Lack of on map heroes is a bit of a miss too along with the lack of unit variability - each faction gets the same type of ranged, melee and support with only minor variations on effects, e.g. Harkonnen.

- More automation for other elements beyond the tech tree, e.g. map searches and the ability to focus solely on the ones related to research. 

- Raise authority caps since I'd like to actually rule the entirety of Arrakis but cannot since you are capped (500 max authority last I checked) on the number of towns you can take, even after finishing off all factions.

The reason you shouldn't buy this game is that the price does not reflect what you get. The game is very shallow and you have tried most during your first few games. If they lowered the price there are some key ""features"" that doesn't work at all. There are worms that show up as you battle and move around the map. These creatures is an event that can't be stopped and is wildly unpredictable. A totally random event that can't be stopped which can eat up your whole army out of nowhere is not a fun feature. I rage quit every time a worm eat my entire army as I am about to clear the map. The warning you get for the worm attack gets shorter, which I guess makes sense since a large army makes a lot of noise but it really doesn't change how bad it feels to lose to the game instead of your opponents. The same problem occurs when using harvesters for spice. These vehicles can be managed manually which means you will have to react quicly to save your spice. However a ""safe"" choice is presented when hovering the unit. It will gather less spice but recall automatically if a worm attack is on coming. These feature only saves the harvesters half the time, which also sets you back in so many ways during the game.

Besides the worms there are a few building costs and expansion costs that doesn't make sense. I would also like to mention that the map quickly gets boring, as it is very predictable and you don't need much strategy to fight off most attacks. I won't even cover how dumb the building grid is as it makes no difference at all where you place any building except two buildings used as defensive structures.

TL;DR
The iconic sandworms are annoying as hell and ONLY adds more random events to the game. They can without warning turn your certain victory in less than 1 hour into a certain victory in 2-3 hours. Simply a feature to stall gameplay. The game is too shallow and doesn't offer much strategy.

Main problem I have is the tutorial is outright dreadful/non existent, so have been relying on online tutorials to try get the gist of it. 
My other issue is the bloody worms!! I'm not complaining about the randomness of them, its that there is no clear way to protect units from them. Surely there should be a button or option to have them gather inside a safe zone? Seems ridiculous that no matter how hard you try to get all units within a safe area, if one group is slightly out, they're swallowed :( I feel like when you click to put a squad within a village, they should be protected?!

I don't want to waste time hunting them down and click return every time they need to drop shit off at base. Sandworms also need a lot of work, perhaps more warning that the few seconds (if that) you get before they take out most of your army or you harvester.

""I CANNOT THUMBS DOWN DUE TO FAN LOYALTY AND WE NEED THIS GAME TO STAY IN THE ALGORITHM""

just bought it...will update after more hours on here.. first impression was... ""what the heck is this? This aint Dune...lol"" new mechanics for an RTS a bold move and i cannot say it was the wrong move... I will say these mechanics that we know are not in the OG Dune gameplay seem interesting to say the least and promising at best...  with maybe some more head knocking around between the devs and outside influence on adjusting things...I think the whole ""go discover then conquer then produce then fight"" aspect really does in fact cover the 4X rules..but its like a cross between dune and civilization 3,5,4,6  

it isnt perfect im an all time fan of Dune EVERYTHING and i will buy to support but as is... i do not like this game...the irony is that this (based off my 60 min of gameplay) is civ mixed with dune  (civ/aoe) a mixture of game genre that i have raved about one day being able to play when it gets created...since i tried myself and it was very hard hard by myself.  But I am happy to see that someone out there is working on the fantasy of my 2 favorite genres mixed in one and im even happier to see Dune at the front of the mutation.  Im pretty sure ive missed some earlier pioneers doing something similar but as stated before Im a Dune fan so i dont know about all that other stuff i know about Dune lol

I dont like it but please still buy it...because we love dune and even if it isnt perfect we can show that we want the game by purchasing it and also providing helpful and constructive feedback.  This genre should be one of the biggest esports in the world but its up to the gamers to vote for what they want with that all mighty dollar!  Lets make RTS and all 4X popular again!

Game is extraordinarily boring. The unit suck. You're forced to expand very slow due to maintenance. The randomness of the map can absolutely ruin the game. For example there are only certain areas that can generate solari (the money in the game) I had a game where all these areas where on the other side of the map near enemies. There are ways around this through treaties and trade which means playing a 4X RTS game by clicking through trade and treaty menus and hoping you don't get raided because you can't afford any troops. if spending 2 to 3 hours building up 3 or 4 territories so that you can afford to maybe expand into one more sounds fun to you then get it.",1653144822,1661182079,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

[*]The tech tree is basically the same for all the factions, just slightly different names and numerical tweaks.
[*]The start is always the same. You need A to make B and you need B to make C. So there is no choice here, there is a set order of starting research you NEED to do, otherwise you can't progress.
[*]Because of this the factions feel very ""samey"" despite thematically being very different.
[*]What doesn't help with this either is that the few units there are basically fullfill the same role. They look different and have a few stats shuffled around but they're basically the same.

Game is great. Lots of in depth mechanics that are not obvious at the beginning. My favorite match I used diplomacy to keep a non agression pact on my enemy, and proceeded to surround him and keep him expanding. Meanwhile I used the espionage ability to spawn rebels on his spice territories. End result was a victory that involved lots of actions but literally never had to fight him. 

Each faction has a really unique feel, while still using the same overall mechanics so they all feel familiar. Very excited for future factions additions. 

Multiplayer is lots of fun! It’s a good slow rts game, but not so slow that it takes days and days (cough Stellaris). Matches took 2-4 hours or so.

I had a fantastic time trying to balance between my spice production and how much I was choosing to sell to the CHAOM for Solari, especially in the early game. Making sure to gear towards what I want during that time period can be a challenge too, especially with how you need to allocate your authority to take over villages, I found myself jumping at the opportunity to get more which changed depending on what faction I was with. (Such as smugglers pillaging for Authority and Fremen paying the spice tax.) 

I feel like the late game begins to lack, even on Insanity. My best strategy for winning an Insane difficulty game was playing as Smugglers with excessive pillaging with the authority chancellor and setting everyone up for an assassination attempt. (17 underworld headquarters all providing reduced chance to get caught, intel, and higher chance to be aware of operations). But in most of the games I played in late game begain to feel like I was self-sufficient, able to isolate from the AI. But I guess that is typical of the type of games such as Dune, Civ 6, etc. 

My only other flaw to mention is operations. It feels like there is very little that I can do to stop the AI from putting down an operation such as a supply drop or a counter assassination operation. I can detect and maybe steal an agent, but that won't prevent them from stopping them. The best route to keep yourself from being assassinated is to have 3 spies in counter intelligence at the same time to max out your per day capture chance.

Unlike other strategy games I played during my years, like Starcraft, Warcraft, the already mentioned Dune II, is that the harvesting of Spice, building infrastructures of different kind of resources can take forever if you are not used to such slow pace of gaming. Visually, the game is gorgeous. The style was clearly inspired from Denis Villeneuve's movie. It is simple to master, and you will mostly enjoy it if you read the novels, although this game does not exactly follow the lore to the point.

i like the art and visuals they have going on but thats a matter of taste
i had no technical issues playing or crashes single or multiplayer BUT

its disappointing,
first of the game needs alot of balance at its current state, there will be alot of trials and changes until they reach a stage of nearly okeh balance between factions.

unit variety is lacking and some units are just useless, and i mean useless not situational u just skip them in any given situation.

speed, even with 2x speed option which makes the game nearly impossible to micro manage with everything going on... the game is slow... a min of 2h++ thats pure minimum for solo or multiplayer.
every new game i wanna play solo or multi i just think of the hectic tiresome start of a slow game this is.

Research trees are just meh slow and boring

Campaign ! no there isnt one at the moment !
DUNE is a very rich story, USE IT...
create a rich story driven campaign for each and every faction, with missions and such introducing units and special weapons or strategy for each faction. give them identity. people will buy and play this for a rich story driven campaign.

I believe their selling point of view is the dune Theme.
i know they put alot of effort into this and maybe at some point it will be what it should be.
but not for now

for now they copied the mechanics from a previous older and more finished game with a viking theme called Northgard. so if you like the mechanics of dune and dont mind changing theme for a more finished product. go give that game some love.

otherwise support the devs maybe to improve what they already have at hand if you dont mind what i mentioned above.

I love the Dune books, the 80s movie, the TV mini series, the new Movie, the C&C type games i.e. Dune 2 and Emperor. Not so much the first Dune game (a bit meh even then).

This game is a nice mix so far. Yes it is in early access so it seems a little basic in options, but I really like it. I like the pace of it. I am hoping they just make it bigger and add more stuff. A nice single player campaign would be awesome but not essential. Forget the multiplayer please! I hate strategy multiplayer. Last strategy multiplayer i enjoyed was Earth 2150, or Artifact. Even then though, I preferred single player campaigns.

The same in that it's a RTS where you're trying to beat the other factions to control Dune.
Different in that there's a lot of micro managing to do.....Focus too much on combat and suddenly spice production is below par and you lose standing with the emperor, or plascrete production is in the double negative figures and so too is your solari income. And before you know it you can't recover and you have to start again.

If you like Civ 5/Civ 6, or other RTS games such as Command and Conquer, Starcraft II, etc., then this game is for you. It's super fun, addictive, and it nails the Dune universe vibe really well!

Pros:
- Excellent graphics that give my GTX 1080 a run for its money.
- Challenging gameplay that rewards trying new things and managing your resources (think engine-builder type games)
- Excellent feel for the Dune universe vibe. If you liked the new Dune movie, you'll love this game.
- Feels like a proper modern RTS with snappy controls, nice UI, easy to understand controls, etc.

Cons:
- My first game on Medium... got rekt
- My second game on Medium... got rekt
- My third game on Easy... finally figured it out but it was still a challenge. Basically, don't give up if you get destroyed. Just try again. I'd recommend playing on Easy as House Atreides for your first 1 to 2 games.
- A few bugs since it is in Early Access, but nothing too major.
- Tons of resources and systems to manage. It's fun once you figure it out, but it can be a but much at first.
- Not much in the way of a tutorial/strategy hand holding. It just kinda throws you in.",1659744751,1659744751,True,10,0,0.621213376522064209,0,True,False,True

The way everything is designed makes it impossible to play it like a true rts where you have to apply tactics with your armies, instead you are forced to follow the category of research you want. In other words, there is very little freedom to develop your own playstyle. On top of that, the generated maps can be ridiculously unbalanced at times. I've spawned with 2x minerals and 1x spice field on the closest tiles, and other times I've spawned with no resources what so ever on the closest tiles. The Landsraad mechanics is also utterly pointless, and only serves as a distraction. You have an incredible 3 edicts to chose from, and you have to vote for each one. The edicts are all pointless, and only there to give the illusion of depth. Diplomacy is also non existent.

This is closer to Sid Meier's Civ games and as such is a much slower, longer game experience with a lot of layers of strategy.

For me it's over-complicated and slow, playing across one big map - rather than playing and upgrading across multiple smaller map levels.

2. It's not ""Dune""  enough. Replace spice with a goldmine and a sietch with a bandit holdout and you can set this game anywhere you want. Only the worms are unique and they:
3. Worms are not done well. I've had quite a few instances where i walk across a border - not a worm in side, and the moment i step over the line WAMMMMMMMM, army gone. Also the AI never gets eaten...

To anyone looking for a tip, I would recommend ensuring that you can produce 4000 spice in a tax cycle, which can usually only be done after researching spice-harvest related technologies. 4000 is the maximum tax later in the game, so if you can match that you should be fine.

** The Good **
- The mechanics of the game are quite good and it brings some great new ideas to RTS
- The factions each feel very unique and fun to play, with advantages and disadvantages in units and knowledge trees
- The different win conditions are very nice, with options for military, diplomatic, or economic victories.
- The unit pathing is quite good
- Animations, graphics, sound - all very nice!

** The Bad **
- Early buildup is fun, late game gets stale
- THE AI CHEATS LIKE A MOFO.  Seriously, here are some examples. I choke out its resources? It sends units endlessly like resources don't matter.  I see an attack coming? I get my units ready to defend, preparing to move them from one nearby village to defend the other, and a worm will instantly (with no chance) swallow my entire army - all while the enemy units are standing on my border IN THE SAND for 5 minutes without being eaten by a worm. The game spends more time coming up with counters to you then actually trying to win through win conditions. Build up a force to go on a military attack - click the move button on your army and suddenly your towns are rebelling or a fremen seitch decides to attack your only weak spot. 

If the game needs to resourt to absolute gimmicks to beat me, then I don't see a reason to play. Developers need to tone down the ""fate"" they have for the AI to take advantage of. If they are massing units in the sand at my border - where are the worms? If they are out of solari and their spice is drained dry, how are they sending countless units to attack my weak points to fend off my own attacks?

That being said, this is genuinely the only 4X game I've been able to really enjoy and the fact that the game is real-time is definitely a big factor. The mechanics are easy to wrap your head around, so you quickly internalize how to play the game and what strategies you should be going for.

However, the combat as it currently is, seems way more engaging than it ends up being. Units have different abilities that should shape the way they play, but in my experience the combat gets repetitive pretty fast, no matter what faction I'm playing. Squishy melee units chase down ranged, tanky melee ties up the enemies melee, and ranged kills them while they're engaged with your units.

The UI needs work too. Timed events are pretty easy to miss (playing at 2560x1440p, so that might be why), you don't see a progress or time tracker without opening them up and they will rarely force you to change your strategy, if you're already doing well at the game. Shared events (ie. shared between all players, first faction to complete it gets the reward, with pity prizes for others who complete it in time) would also be a good way to force players to interact and race each-other for a common goal. 

The tech tree is inscrutable at a glance, but the options within seem to be fairly balanced.
However, I don't like how easy it is to miss that your research queue is empty, since the reminder gets buried in other messages. Better colour differentiation or just moving those reminders to where they're relevant in the UI, like a big danger sign over the research tab when you're not researching anything would go a long way. Same goes for espionage.

As for espionage, I really like the idea, but in practice you will rarely use it for anything other than combat bonuses, rebellions and resource production. Most options are just too niche compared to ones that directly debuff your enemies combat power or weaken their base. Spying on other player factions is also a good way to lose your agents and the reward doesn't seem like it's enough. I mostly end up trading my intel away for resources, since bots value it so highly and having more buildings/troops/districts seems more useful.",1656003841,1659121407,False,3,0,0.531179904937744141,0,True,False,True

It's still the same survival-but-also-RTS game where you try to get the correct balance of resource gains based on your environment, so you don't run dry of resources and self-destruct when the winter (the imperial spice tax) comes for your resources.

This simplicity of that gameplay in Spice Wars' slowed pace doesn't sit right with me; there's no intricate politics, and you're really just voting against whatever will absolutely murder you in the Landsraad (eg. army costs debuff when your army just died). There's no complicated use of resources beyond that, so you only have a chain of resources that aid in getting another. Ultimately, I feel like I'm too often idling for a resource to stock up, so I can build another thing that lets me stock up another resource faster. Northgard didn't have this problem because combat was frequent and fast, and micro controls were very efficient-- resource management and base building couldn't afford to be more complex. Spice Wars could afford to be more complex, yet it barely has anything over Northgard except the fire-and-forget Agent system and the Landsraad.

The gameplay is something between and RTS and a 4x game, something along the lines of Stellaris if it was on the ground instead of in space. You can micro units, but fighting with armies is only a small part of the game. There is a HUGE amount of intrigue, spies, diplomacy and politics that you need to engage in to be successful, and most of the victories are non-military--accomplished through the games other systems. I feel this really helps to capture the essence of Dune. The story had armies and battles, but it was never ABOUT that conflict. It was much more about politics and spies and assassins and so forth. This game does that better than perhaps any of the Dune strategy games previously. Graphics are eh, but they arent bad, and the game has good atmosphere. The biggest flaw is probably the similarity between units, making army strategy feel similar regardless of which faction you play. Overall the game is slower, which is a nice break from something like Starcraft, but it's not quite as slow as something like Stellaris. The pace is made up for, however, by the very large number of things you need to keep track of and juggle: armies, standing, spice tax, politics, diplomacy, spies. Its quite the list and since it is real-time everything is always flowing.

To be blunt, the game is meh in its current state. I would say there is enough to achievement hunt it but not more. This is a shame as i was looking forward to this game but after one playthrough i don't see myself coming back after i have the achievements, even for a single casual game. BTW. they are easy af to get as well. Got 20/32 in 1 4hr run and thats due to me being slow.

4 factions, each with their list of advantages and disadvantages. 4 managers each which also have extra advantages for the player but none of it matters as you won't take advantage of unique mechanics, even if they are present, as they are just aren't significant enough or game changers.

Lets talk resources. You would think that spice, the unique, hyper valuable resource that is the basis of the franchise's lore would be important right? nope. You get a 5k cap and its only used to pay off taxes, trade with other players or sell for a miniscule amount of cash. Its not even your main source of revenue in the game nor does it have any significant impact on the game. All other resources are pretty much bog standard, money, manpower, building material x, diplomatic/expansion resource, govt influence and clout. Even then, they all have arbitrary caps and when you get to the mid/late game most of them lose meaning as you no longer need them.

4 research trees which are arguably the only real important aspect of the game as the game as they are the only significant game changer. No gripes here as this is probably the only significantly impacting thing.

5 units per faction, 1 for melee dps, 1 for ranged, one for building destroying, 1 support and 1 tank(as in rpg kind of tank not a physical tank). There is 1 non faction specific unit that you can only get via a govt position but even then its basically just a mix of the melee dps and the tank. I was honestly looking forward to using some really cool possibilities eg as the fremen, using the sand worms to attack but no. 

On the topic of sandworms, completely useless and only affects the player if they aren't paying attention. They will either target your harvester which rarely will ever get lost as you can set it to auto pickup so it usually gets out of danger or your units. I haven't seen a single enemy unit chasing me get eaten. Even then, units are so easily replacable that there is no need to care if my units just got eaten. Especially as the atreides faction as a combination of manager/research and building make your units pretty much elites the moment they are produced.

How about building,
Capital side, there are 4 different buildings per type being research/economic/military focused. There is also a district mechanic where filling the entire section with one type will provide bonuses. You get a 3, 2 2s and 3 1s. Too bad the individual buildings are more significant than these district bonuses. Legit, the only one to ever consider making your 3 piece district is science as the other two are just that insignificant. Even then i would argue the 1 size district bonus is better that the others as it impacts the relevant research speed.
Village side, there are more buildings than you have slots for so you need to plan ahead. Not by much though. Some buildings are seemingly useless such as the rocket tower as the ai never seemed to attack me and some require region specific assets or monuments. In my case, after i got enough building material x or gold gen from other sources i literally just spammed air fields on my front lines and influence generation. I never bothered getting the hegemony generation building as it generates such a miniscule amount that its not worth the upkeep.

How about the goal of the game. There are 4 ways to win. The typical destroy all enemies main bases, you can get a diplo victory which isn't really diplomatic. You need to have conquered a majority of the map and also gotten alliances with 4 different hidden villages and then get elected and hold that position for x time. Too much effort. You can assassinate the enemy leaders as well, which also is a case of too much effort as you need to spec into spy tree, have enough spies, have enough infiltration and money/intel for 1 attempt that may fail and if the ai finds one of your spies, you lose a level of infiltration and thus it can stop your attempt due to the sudden drop. The fourth way, hegemony victory. Basically control large territories, be friendly with natives, pay taxes and be a good little boy.

The final point to say is the diplomacy between factions is bare fucking bones. There is no voice acting for the 4 biggest characters in the franchise, the times they contact you are few and far between and usually completely pointless. EG i had a smuggler gloat about taking resources which i didn't even notice as he was so small that it just wasn't worth paying attention to. How about the actual diplomacy, none. You get a trade screen where you can trade the 6 possible resources, bargain for a trade/research/ceasefire agreement or you can extort them for resources. Thats it.

Gonna stop the rant here though as its getting late. TLDR, game feels unpolished, needs more time and needs more of a why so to speak. None of the aspects that should stand out, do stand out.

Positive Notes

-The UI is very well designed and matches the scale of the game perfectly.
-Factions feel and play uniquely.
-Constant updates.
-Nailed the look of Arrakis.

Improvements to be made

-Harkonnen AI could use some work, they seem to fall behind almost every game regardless of the diffculty. Harkonnens are not weak by any means but AI doesn't necessary utilize the strengths of the faction properly.
-Better optimization for lower-end systems would be appreciated.
-Needs more units, spying operations and of course more factions -can't wait for Corrino!-

It's probably fun with friends but I think once you really know how to play, where you land on the random map might influence your chances to win more than strategy.  

Overall It's probably worth the money but giving it a thumbs down for now until I see what they do in the air and sand update.  Right now unless you play a faction with air support, you just can't control anything, you get attacked on one side of the map, and you run your people there to defend, then get attacked on the opposite which means you can't protect it, remaining on offence is too expensive to replace your troops and eventually you end up at the other factions home bases and just die.

Dune: Spice Wars เป็นเกมที่ทำออกมาบนพื้นฐานตามท้องเรื่องของนวนิยาย Dune (จริงๆมีหนังด้วย ล่าสุดของปี2021) จริงๆเรื่องราวจักรวาลของ Dune มันก็ใหญ่มาก แต่อันนี้จะโฟกัสที่การแย่งชิงอำนาจทั้งการเมืองและการค้าขายทรัพยากรล้ำค่าที่เรียกว่า spice เพื่อขึ้นสู่ตำแหน่งผู้ปกครองดวงดาวทะเลทรายแห่งนี้ แน่นอนว่าต้องใช้ทุกวิถีทางทั้งกำลัง(การทหาร) การเจรจา(การเมือง) เล่ห์เหลี่ยม(การจารกรรม)

ความขัดแย้งบนดาวสะท้อนออกมาผ่านขั้วอำนาจฝักฝ่ายต่างๆ ซึ่งตอนนี้มี 4 ฝ่าย(ขณะที่เขียนรีวิว) แต่ละฝ่ายยังสามารถเลือกความสามารถเฉพาะได้อีก 2 จาก 4 อย่าง โดยรวมทุกฝ่ายมีวิธีการเล่นที่ค่อนข้างแตกต่างกัน มีสิ่งที่ต้องสนใจและกลไกเกมที่ค่อนข้างแตกต่างกันอยู่บ้าง สิ่งก่อสร้างแกนหลักและแผนผังเทคโนโลยีส่วนใหญ่เหมือนกันหมด จะมีแค่บางอันที่ถูกปรับเปลี่ยนไปตามฝ่ายนั้นๆ เช่น สีแดงมีเทคโนโลยีสร้างความหวาดกลัวเวลาปล้นหมู่บ้านทำให้กลับมายึดง่ายขึ้นในอนาคต สีฟ้าสร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างกาฝากในเมืองคนอื่น สีเหลืองไม่มีสนามบินให้สร้างเพราะสามารถขี่หนอนได้ เป็นต้น

ด้านการทหาร ยูนิตแต่ละฝ่ายมีชนิด (class) ที่ค่อนข้างเหมือนกัน แต่ชื่ออาจแตกต่างกันเพราะความเก่งต่างกัน ทำให้สุดท้ายประโนชน์ใช้สอยแตกต่างกัน เช่น สีแดงมีทหารปราบจราจลที่มีเกราะหนักและโดรนหายตัว สีฟ้ามีโดรนที่ช่วยฮีลและพลแม่นปืน สีเหลืองแค่นักรบธรรมดาก็เก่งอิ๊บอ๋ายแต่มีจำนวนไม่มาก เป็นต้น มีระบบคลาสสิกแบบประสบการณ์ยูนิต(ติดบั้ง) แต่สิ่งที่แตกต่างก็คือมี command point ที่ไม่มากนักแถมยังมี upkeep
ทำให้เราไม่สามารถปั๊มยูนิตมาล้นจอแบบ RTS บางเกมได้ ส่วนการดำเนินเกมก็ใช้ระบบ 4X ทั่วไปคือเริ่มจากสิ่งก่อสร้างแกนหลัก ยึดหมู่บ้านตามเขตต่างๆเพื่อสร้างสิ่งก่อสร้างเอาทรัพยากรวนเวียนไปเรื่อยๆ โดยหมู่บ้านอาจเปลี่ยนมือได้ แต่หากสิ่งก่อสร้างแกนหลักแตกคือฝ่ายนั้นๆแพ้ทันที

ด้านการเมือง มีระบบภาเพื่อทำการโหวตมติต่างๆไปเรื่อยๆทั้งเกม โดยมติมี 3 ประเภท ได้แก่ 1. มติแบบที่มีผลกับทุกคน เช่น เร่งการวิจัยเทคโนโลยีบางสาย 2. มติที่ผลกับคนเดียว (ต้องเลือกว่าจะโหวตใส่ใคร) เช่น เป้าหมายติดลบ 30% ค่าอิทธิพล 3. มติเกี่ยวกับการแต่งตั้งตำแหน่ง (ซึ่งมี 5 ตำแหน่งในเกม) นอกจากระบบสภายังสามารถตามหาชนพื้นเมืองเพื่อค้าขายเจริญความสัมพันธ์เพื่อสร้างพันธมิตรรับเอาโบนัสอะไรบางอย่างได้

ด้านการจารกรรม มีระบบการจัดวางสายลับเพื่อรับเอาโบนัสด้านต่างๆ เอาทรัพยากรก็ได้ หรือจะจัดลงตามฝ่ายศัตรูเพื่อดูรายละเอียดปลีกย่อยและเอาค่า Intel (ข้อมูล) ซึ่งสุดท้ายค่านี้สามารถเอาไปแลกกับ""แผนการ"" เหมือนกับความสามารถ buff / debuff ใช้สนับสนุนทหารเราเองหรือป่วนคู่แข่งได้ เช่น 50ข้อมูลเพื่อเปิดแผนที่ 200ข้อมูลเพื่อสนับสนุนยุทธปัจจัยทหาร(ให้ฟื้นเลือด+supplyนอกพื้นที่) 500ข้อมูลเพื่อให้เมืองเป้าหมายเกิดกบฎ นอกจากนี้ความโหดของระบบสายลับในเกมนี้ก็คือท้ายๆเกมมันสามารถทำลายฝ่ายเป้าหมายทิ้งได้เลยผ่านการลอบสังหาร3ขั้น ซึ่งใช้ทั้งทรัพยากรและเวลาค่อนข้างมาก แต่หากทำสำเร็จก็จะทำลายฝ่ายนั้นๆไปเลย ไม่สนว่าจะมีพื้นที่มากแค่ไหนหรือมีทหารมากแค่ไหน

โดยรวมตอนนี้ยังเป็น early access อนาคตน่าจะมีอะไรเพิ่มมาอีกเยอะ เช่น เพิ่มฝ่าย เพิ่มยูนิต เพิ่มรูปแบบแผนที่ ปรับสมดุลความสามารถ แก้เรื่องการทูต(ที่โคตรโง่) ระบบความยากที่ควรทำได้ยากกว่านี้(เพราะ AI ยังโง่มาก) ซึ่งการปรับความยากเกมสมัยนี้มันเป็นอะไรก็ไม่รู้ (ปรับ normal ดันเหมือน easy ส่วนปรับ hard จริงๆคือ normal เป็นต้น) แต่รวมๆแค่นี้ก็ถือว่าเล่นได้สนุกพอประมาณแล้ว เรียนรู้โคตรง่าย ความซับซ้อนยังไม่มากนัก หลายๆอย่างก็ดูแอบคล้ายบอร์ดเกม แล้วถ้าไม่ได้ดูหนังหรืออ่านนิยายจะเล่นรู้เรื่องไหม คำตอบคือเล่นได้สบาย (ผมก็ไม่ได้อ่าน+ไม่ได้ดู) เพราะแม้ว่าหลายๆอย่างมันคือชื่อเฉพาะทำให้ฟังดูเหมือนจะเข้าใจยาก แต่คุณเล่นรอบเดียวก็รู้แล้วว่ามันคืออะไร เช่น Landsraad ก็คือสภา Sietches คือหมู่บ้านชนเผ่าที่เราไปค้าขายด้วยได้

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== [สรุป] ===

++ 4X เบาๆที่ใช้ระบบการรบแบบ RTS เรียนรู้ง่าย เล่นง่าย ความซับซ้อนไม่มากนักแต่สนุกใช้ได้ ให้อารมณ์บางมิติคล้ายๆบอร์ดเกม

++ ตัวเลือกในการเล่น 4 ฝ่าย (ขณะเขียนรีวิว) ที่ค่อนข้างมีจุดสนใจที่แตกต่างกัน วิธีการเล่นที่แตกต่างกันเล็กน้อย ผ่านการปะทะกันทั้งใน 3 สมรภูมิคือ สนามรบ การเมือง และการจารกรรม พยายามมุ่งสู่รูปแบบการชนะ 3 รูปแบบ

+/- ใช้ชื่อเฉพาะค่อนข้างเยอะ สำหรับคนที่ดูหนังหรือเสพย์นิยายอาจรู้สึกอิน แต่สำหรับคนที่ไม่รู้อะไรเกี่ยวกับ Dune เลยอาจเบือนหน้าหนีเวลาเจอชื่อเฉพาะเยอะๆ ทำให้เกมดูเหมือนจะเรียนรู้ยาก แต่จริงๆเข้าใจง่ายมาก เล่นตาเดียวจบก็รู้แล้วว่ามันคืออะไร

- AI ที่โง่คือเหยื่อ โดยรวมถือว่ายังขาดการขัดเกลา ความยากในเกมก็ยังดูไม่มีประโยชน์นักหาก AI ยังคงโง่งม แม้ว่าคุณจะเล่นระดับความยากสูงสุด (insane) ก็ตาม มันก็ให้ความรู้สึกว่า AI ดื้อด้านดึงดันเหมือนเด็กเสียมากกว่า นอกจากนี้ระบบการทูตก็โคตรโง่ เหมือนเจรจากับคนสมองเสื่อมซึ่งมันไม่รู้ตัวด้วยซ้ำว่าตัวมันเองกำลังได้เปรียบหรือเสียเปรียบ (แต่อย่างว่าแหละ นี่คือ early access)

- Quality of life บางอย่างยังดูขาดๆ เช่น รถเก็บ spice สามารถให้หนีหนอนอัตโนมัติได้ แต่พอหนีมาแล้วก็จอดนิ่งๆ ต้องมานั่งกดให้มันกลับไปทำงานเอง (เพื่ออะไร?) จัดเรียงยูนิตการ์ดไม่ได้ ขาด shortkey หลายอย่าง ฯลฯ (เหมือนเดิม นี่คือ early access)",1657954242,1658017895,True,5,0,0.558528423309326172,1,True,False,True

in a nutshell: this is northguard with a dune theme 
but slower and more confusing right to the point when you say to yourself: ""who gives a shit about this warning message because i simply don't know what to do with it."" guess what: you loose.

that's not the bad thing, to loose, i mean, but at least i would want to know or find out what went wrong. your're pretty much on your own in this department or you need to google your obvious deficits. event that would not be a problem.
the real problem there is, is that the gameplay itself is so slow (even considering this alone would not be a problem) that i don't feel the urge to restart a new game to get to the point of doing... things(?) better this time. look a my playtime. it's just one and i fear my only match. 

another real turnoff, at least for me, is that you can choose your faction but you cannot choose your color.

Beautiful, cool, nice representation of the Dune universe blah blah blah. All of that is true. 

However

It is an incredibly shallow, supposedly '4X' strategy game. Game feels too simple and easy to master. 

Worm about to attack your spice miner? Send in a lifter with a single click, or better yet set it on auto and never loose a harvester in the entire game. Mega death worms, the single biggest danger on the planet, neutralised.

Enemy troops attacking? Send in the exact same number and type plus one, and win.

Need more water? build water collectors.

Need some more plascrete? Build a plascrete factory.

You get the idea. While talking about resources, lets get onto spice, the heart of the games issue and the reason for the whole thing in the first place. Spice is the oil equivalent for Arakis, the reason the planet is invaded and the reason this story and game takes place. 

This provides a unique, cool perspective for the game devs to go on, but they sadly do not take advantage of it.

The resources feels stupidly unimportant in this game. It is super easy to pay the spice tax, and apart from that, I never felt a reason to harvest the Spice, other than to sell it.. to expand... to get more spice. This in the only planet in the universe with this ultra in demand/valuable/important resource, yet it never feels like that. The Harkonens got stupidly rich from selling it in the original story, yet it never feels like that. Sure its easy to get tonnes of cash, but for what point???

I found myself in game, with a spice field in the next province over and I actively decided to not harvest it. I just couldn't be bothered and it wasn't going to help me achieve victory in any major way, which is kinda ridiculous. Spice is the reason for the whole story!

This game lacks that deeper soul to its mechanics and deeper purpose. In the original story, the factions revolve around the spice, the Freeman want to protect their planet while the others want to exploit it, yet it never feels like this in the game. Spice is simply just a method to make cash to further expand. Instead of a very unique 4X exploitation based game, the game focuses on purposeless expansion that gets boring very quickly. Arakis is a dirty, hot sand filled planet, why are we there fighting over it if not to exploit it?

I've had fun playing, but as you can see I only got 10 hours out before I got bored. Each faction is unique, but only in how they harvest spice to fund their pointless expansion.

This game lacks the why. I know what I'm doing, I know how I'm gonna do it, but there is no why, no driving meaning behind this game that raises the tension, makes me want to win this battle, exploit this spice field, seize this village. There is no good and bad, no emotions, no connection in this game. Annoyingly, all of the answers are right there in the books and the super cool movie with ultra sexy Chalamet playing the lead, just take that driving meaning and plonk it into this game. Expand the mechanics to go with it, and then you'll have a truly excellent game.

You can build similar tech paths and ended up winning with all the factions. This really watered down the ""specialty"" of each individual. You will get the feeling of playing these ""same but different"" games.
AI's also don't respond well to some events. You can literally keep annoy the with silly shenanigans until you fry their brains. They will just do nothing for the rest of the game. Here are some examples of that:
-Rebels operation nonstop on their spice until they are so in debt and the IRS shows up to raid their bases
-Back and forth juking with troops to waste their supplies or drag them around for free damage to kill them(eventually AI won't have resource to build up troops)
-ceasefire+poison reserve wombo combo that wipes out armies of troops
Despite the things above, this game has a lot of potential and it's already in a better shape comparing to most games those are also in early access. IMO, this game is a 7.5/10. Some people will love it while others won't when it comes to mechanics.

World is looks nice, sound is good, especially the Fremen starting soundtrack. 
Game is slow, a medium map takes about 1.5-2 hours to win unless you cheese it like that one guy did with Fremen. I personally didn't play on large, but I heard one of the matches in a large map tourney took 4 hours. 
RTS or 4x, dunno chief, looks and feels like an RTS to me, but in my limited experience has the speed of a 4x if not slightly faster.

The game says not finished, balance is still in the air/all over the place, people are doing hot takes about weak and strong things that become invalid the next day, features aren't implemented yet.
Wait til it comes out, unless you like being part of new things, even if they are unfinished.

The game is a dream for all gamers loving strategy genre, because it is not mainly about micro like in many RTS games. The main focus is on managing economy, espionage, politics and military to achieve the win condition that seem to you the best option at the moment. You really have a lot of possible actions  to undertake against your opponents. Military advantage and few good fights do not guarantee you victory at all. Asymmetrical gameplay for different factions makes the game more variable. And new faction along with the new win condition (I hope coming soon) will make it even better. Of course there are a lot things to improve in terms of balance and military variability (add tanks, planes etc) but the core mechanics works out well in single game and even in multiplayer. I look forward to the appearance of ranking and other features in multiplayer (the developer if you read this I think ranked matches will booster interest for Dune a lot). 
I also as many other players used to play Emperor battle for Dune but I find this game much more interesting and gameplay deeper than Westwood rts although I have good memories of good old Dune).

There are a lot of things to manage (without overdoing it) all the time and I didnt find a single boring moment in my first playthrough.

I also find the blend between RTS elements and 4x quite good. Imagine an auto advancing turns 4x game (but you can still pause often and make moves and unpause and watch them unfold).

The boardgame comparison is a decent way to imagine this however its a lot less static than that.

Factions feel different and I think the game captures quite well what I imagine a harsh Arrakis with shrewd survival by any means at your disposal, playing your strengths and the enemies weakness .... and of course reloading several time when your harvester was suddenly eaten by a sandworm....

Base building is also reduced to a small number of structures that you build in villages you take over. 

Diplomacy is a roulette wheel of minor bonuses you can try to earn by clicking 1 button and deciding how much influence to spend. It's passable, but super boring and unoriginal.

Like things getting so expensive on a large map that you end up sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for enough resources. 

Example: For the Smuggler faction you can send 9 of the top tier units to a base that is rioting, And if you don't watch them, when they get there they stand around and do nothing. You have to tell them to kill each rioting unit one at a time, because if they kill one they just sit there getting killed. And then after you kill 5 groups of units the village switches over to the enemy color and spawns a whole set of 4 units, and then whne you get close to taking it over they call a ceasefire that makes them unkillable and all your units die from attrition because you are enemy territory and you have used your supply drop already and your units are damaged from fighting 8 packs of units and won't make it back to your lands before dieing.  Sound fun? Nope.

With that being said ... there are two huge, game busting issues that I encounter every ... single ... game.

The first being that if I go for a military victory and build a large force to start attacking people, without fail, every time, my army is eaten by sand worms. Repeatedly causing me to go from overwhelming military might to jack all a dust bunny could kill me. And there is no recourse or option to avoid it. Just too bad, the army you spent an hour building is gone and now you are down eight territories. Enjoy.

The second major issue I have is that if you start out as any faction but Attraides, you will get stomped by Attraides (probably not the right spelling I know). They will simply out maneuver you by gaining enough influence to win at the 30k cap. And you cant catch up, attack them, take their territories, or beat them in influence production.

So there is only really one playable faction, and thats Attraides. All the other factions simply get eaten by sand worms if you try to do anything.

First, i caution that this is not a true RTS as you have to pause constantly to take action if you don't want the AI to gain on you. It is also not a real war game as the fighting is minimal. Building armies is constrained in so many ways -manpower requirements, command points, money, training slots, research advances, and funds for upkeep-  that you never really have a full fighting force. The best you can do is have enough units to defend your borders. This game is really a resource management game. 

PROS: 
I particularly liked the fact that the devs stayed true to the original Frank Herbert books. They used a bit of what the previous Dune games had done but went back to a more faithful version of the story.
The graphics are nice, the map is simple and being procedurally built, it changes every time. The artwork for the faction leaders is very good, the symbols are easy to understand, the animation is limited but adequate.
Commands are straight forward, unit movement, map scrolling, panning and menus are simple. Each faction has its own advantages and challenges. Each faction requires a different approach to game play.

CONS:
Game play has a steep learning curve. The tutorials are useless, you have to learn the hard way. There are so many constraints that you learn along the way with no instructions i.e. (Spoiler alert) the Fremen cannot build a water extractor in the Sink Pole region but I wasted time and resources in capturing the region only to find out it was useless to me. Don't expect to win a game even on easy until at least the third or fourth try. You will most likely run out of some resources and be defeated or forced to quit. The game is extremely slow even on highest speed. The devs tell you a game can last 2 to 3 hours but this is game time. However, because you have to pause constantly, a game can take you 6 to 8 hours to finish. Building units and villages takes an eternity and the research is painstakingly slow even when building research hubs in every village you own. Being slightly colour blind, I can't make the difference between the Atreides units (light green) and the Smugglers units (Aqua). You cannot rotate the map so sometimes units are difficult to see when behind others. If you click on something and there is another item nearby, it may not give you what you aim to activate. Even though there are different ways of playing, there is a lot of repetition. Replayability while possible, will still bring back much of the same at every game. 

CONCLUSION:
As I enjoy resource management games, I liked it after getting the hang of the particulars. I hope the promised additions to the game will come soon as I have exhausted most of the game's fun after 120 hours. I also hope updates will be free. This dev created Northguard which I liked initially but hated when they charged for every little DLC addition they made. I never bought any of the DLCs and basically abandoned the game. Northguard is a money grabbing game and I hope Dune updates will remain free.

I also do not play multiplayer as I have learned that the winners in those kind of games are the ones that know how to take advantage of the game's drawbacks and weak spots. Since I am very competitive, I prefer not to play rather than be frustrated from constantly losing. Reading the discussions on multiplayer also leads me to believe it is flawed.",1656780850,1656780850,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

Dune franchise will always hold a special place in my heart. As far as I remember, the first real time strategy game I ever play is Dune II, on a MS-DOS computer from my father's office, I probably still in the elementary school at that time.

I did play Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle for Dune, which also great game at the time, but after that the franchise just kinda fading away into the desert. For almost 20 years, finally the Dune game is back and it is developed by Shiro Games, one of my favorite game developer who develop games I love such as Northgard and Evoland, I couldn't be more happier.

The game mechanic is mostly similar to Northgard, each faction is unique on it own, Smugglers has an underground network mechanic, Fremen got environment manipulation, House Atreides, and House Harkonnen almost the same but since each faction has their own abilities and unique military units, you will never feel the same.

Truly to the Dune franchise, strong economic and logistic is the key to success, military is very expensive too maintain and Arrakis is a very hazard battleground planet. Sending your military units too far across desert without a decent supply = sending your men to die.

The art is very nice and knowing Shiro Games, there will be a lot more contents and DLC coming up for sure.",1656757090,1656757090,True,1,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,True

I won the second game against the medium AI. didnt want to take the slaughter victory so it took like 5ish hrs before one annoyed me enough to kill them after they were my ally the entire game. once that was over i realized they were fighting the other 2 ai the whole time so i just went for it and took the murder victory because i didnt want to go for another 4 hrs to get a victory when there already on the ground saying just finish me. anyone trys to move a large army a sand worm eats the entire army 60% of the time.

The instructions to fix, other issues similar to mine are complicated and change to GL graphic, change options.ini file, remove other files systems etc, this seems overly complicated and beyond my technical competency. I am not here to be a developer but a gamer.

I was skimming on Reddit 4Xgames and saw Warhammer Gladius and this suggested as something to pick up in the summer sale, so I did.

So, it's early access. And it shows. There is very little in the way of help, and there are an overwhelming number of resources.

I started a couple of games to try and unpick what was going on. After 2 60 min false starts, I had a pretty good handle on what was going on, and played a 3 hour game to victory on default difficulty.

It's fun. The initially complex systems quickly prove to be quite simple, which is no bad thing. As mentioned, there's no much in the way of help, so when you research the tech to unlock a building, It's not clear where that building is. that will be fixed with time, no doubt.

But it's very much a nice change of pace from a total war or endless XX or Civ where a game can take days or weeks, to a game taking an afternoon or evening, and feeling rewarding.

I'll probably play one more game for now, and check back in as updates are released.

I have played almost 1500 hours of Northgard, and being a fan of the Dune universe (especially the new Villeneuve flavoring of the recent successful movie) I had no doubt I would enjoy this game. If you like the Northgard game-play, I think this is a great adaptation/combination of that rules-set and Dune. Artwork, sound/music and voicing is great. Seeing this game compared with popular AAA titles from bigger studios says something... here is a smaller, lesser-known studio taking their spin on a popular Intellectual Property with a proven game-style (the art and game-play mechanics of Northgard) and they are delivering something truly awesome. 

If you haven't played Northgard or if you have and don't care for it as a game of planning for multiple disasters on a map that is randomized every time that will sometimes hand you a crushing set of bad events with only minimal ways to mitigate the damage, then yes I could see this may be a game some people will not enjoy much. But if you already love how Northgard is as a game, then it is really a refreshing and enjoyable way to experience that style of gameplay again in a totally different setting. The resources are switched around a bit, but they all make (more or less) logical sense for the setting. Instead of snow/winter every year, you have a world that is almost all desert. Instead of the dreaded Blizzard event, you have sandstorms (that can help sometimes but mostly they hinder) and the dreaded worms. Answers to some of the cheesier elements of Northgard are found in this game such as the supply mechanic which will eventually kill your units if they run out of supply (say if they are trying to cross the desert... always a risky proposition). Units gain experience and improve the longer they are kept alive... a mechanic that was not present in Northgard, making your units less as just throw-away means to an end and giving you a reason to keep them alive longer if possible. It is still a game of exploring tiles and expanding on tiles with an increasing tax on various resources the larger your empire grows. Managing resources and min/maxing various elements IS the gameplay. But to make things easier here, there is a usable real-time pause (at least in the single-player, for now), another subtle change from Northgard. Home-bases cannot be steam-rolled with early rush strategies as the home-base tile of each faction is an armed citadel of sorts that takes some considerable muscles to bring down (debuffs help to do this later on in the game).

There is just a lot of game here, easy for me to recommend, very playable for a couple hundred hours even in this early early-access phase (I only have about 30 hours played so far but that is mostly in just two of the four starting factions... looking forward to playing the others). There's more coming to the game of course, so I can only see what is a great game already becoming even better. Probably not the game for everyone though... if you really did not like Northgard, you aren't going to like this game for those same reasons. Same thing if you dislike the newer Villeneuve-style Dune theme... if you aren't a fan, this game won't change your mind about it.",1656218925,1656218925,True,3,0,0.526162087917327881,0,True,False,True

I really like this studio and absolutely LOVE Northgard.  This feels like Northgard with a Dune skin overlay and some additional mechanics but this isn't meant as a bad thing, I actually like this approach a lot and makes the game accessible and fun.

I can't recommend the game currently however because it feels very shallow, almost too early for early access.  Playing a game of Dune feels more like going through the motions than making actual, strategic decisions that affect the outcome.

The factions are not balanced, Fremens are a cake walk the Atreides depened a lot on the map and Smugglers were a nightmare. 
The map randomness is not well made, in my first game for example I scanned 8 villages before getting one that produced spice. Except for Fremen, they have an advisor that shows all fields on the map from the start.
Landstraad votes make no sense, the minor houses have too many votes and there is no clear way to influence them.
Worms attack your troops far more often than enemy units and you can't really do anything to prevent if you're not close to rocks. I had one unit chased by 3 of the enemy's melee in close range, worm came in and killed my unit but didn't affect any of the AI's chasers, it's insane. 
Harvesters set on auto-recall, even with thopter cover do not have 100% chance of escaping in time so you constantly have to watch for wormsign and even then you don't have enough time and loose a lot of manpower. 
Unit AI is garbage, and you don't have simple orders like ""stop"" or ""hold position"". I had to take a village under missile fire from other villages and ranged fire from over the hill, those garbage units kept moving out of the circle to attack to go fight the attackers.
You have a cap on authority of 500 but endgame villages cost over 500 to take so they are impossible to conquer and you can't get closer to the enemy's bases. But because of lack of support, you can't move too far away from your own territory... unless you are Fremen, if you play Fremen the worm will get you anywhere, collecting spice does not trigger worms, everything is calm and a breeze.
About the feeling of the game and how the world is designed, let me give you an example, Fremen people are based on Beduins who speak Arabic. In this game, the Fremen units speak with a American accent, like close to Texan, when you hear them pronounce ""Arrakis is our home"" it breaks any trace of immersion in the game. It's another proof of lack of attention to detail from the developers.
Overall, the experience depends a lot on luck but it's never a challenge, you're either against impossible odds but you need to waste 4 hours before you find out, or everything is a walk in the park.",1656194973,1656195869,False,53,2,0.645383954048156738,0,True,False,True

Dune: Spice Wars is a very good example of that: it has signs of a interesting game, but in present state it is just very disappointing. On the surface, it is RTS, although many reviewers and I think creators of the game claim it is 4x game. Let me be honest, it might be called hybrid 4x-RTS, or RTS with elements of 4x, but it is not 4x. The systems in the game, especially managing and building cities (or ""villages"") in the game are rudimentary, not even on the level of Civ 5-6, not mentioning Stellaris, or any other renowned 4x game. In cities, you essentially fill all the available slots and forget, that's the extent of managing your cities. You can build only one copy of each building in a village, which is very limiting (so you cannot specialize your cities as in 4x games). Most of the game you spend waiting until you get enough resources to build something, a new unit, or building, and do nothing in meantime, because there is nothing to do. 
You command your units as in a regular RTS. However, units have very small models on the map so it is extremely difficult to recognize which unit is which (all infantry units, btw.). Don't get me wrong, visually the game is very pleasing. But the map is quite boring: every map is the same, the number of unique features on the map is very limited, it doesn't force you to play differently, essentially you play the same way in each playthrough. The factions (only 4 of them) do not differ that much, so again, whether you play Fremens or Harkonnens or whatever, you play mostly the same way. Also, there is no way to customize your leaders, they have just ""advisors"" you select for some additional features, and there is no other way of customizing your factions. Nearly all 4x games allow for customizing leaders or/and factions, but not here. 
Game has no tutorial, it offers vague missions to complete, which can help you somewhat in the game, but do not explain much. So you have to decipher how to play it on your own. For example, it is difficult to figure out how Landsraat voting works, after 5h of playtime I still don't understand this. Again, the game is unfinished, and it shows.
Frank Herbert created a very rich and fascinating universe in his Dune series; the game, though, simplifies it to basic RTS game with only superficial elements taken from books (or movie?) to provide that Dune vibe. For example, you wouldn't know that in Dune the universe is ruled by feudal houses: the only allusion to that is Landsraat in the game, but neither Harkonnens or Atreides are organized in game as feudal houses are, they have some generic units and buildings, that's it. Smugglers and Fremen are not factions in the book, and game confuses a lot by making ""villages"" and sietches neutral (btw. sietch is a Fremen term for a ""village"", lol) while they were all inhabited by Fremens. So when you play Fremens you conquer villages from other Fremens, geez. You can form alliances with sietches which give you some bonuses, and this is interesting, while being rudimentary. It would be much more interesting if Fremen were a neutral, non-playable, faction, and players could either go for alliance with Fremen, or remain hostile to them. Right now you're just conquering or raiding villages, form relationships with particular sietches, and that's all. (btw. you cannot destroy villages or sietches, generally maps are unchangeable and features remain indestructible, again very odd choice).
So in general, the game has little to no replayability. After a couple of playthroughs, you would see everything the game has to offer, There is nothing surprising, nothing particularly unique. In Stellaris or even in Civilization, each playthrough is different, here, almost no change. Dune: Spice Wars requires a lot of work, in fact, the complete revamping of many in-game systems, to really compete in 4x space or in general. But judging from the fact that many games remain in never-ending early access for years, I wouldn't get hopes up for that.",1656166806,1656166806,False,2,1,0.474090397357940674,0,True,False,True

I had a few false starts as I got to know the game systems but my first win was with the Fremen. After building up to around 40 supply worth of units I realized that the Landsraad can basically hand you an easy elimination against a single enemy with the ""architectural surveys"" event. With the base taking extra damage and unable to fight back, an army of this size can easily kill an HQ with good preparation. I steamrolled 2 enemies before deciding to take out the last AI with an assassination. This ended up being a huge pain, since I learned the hard way that even though the first 2 missions require 2/2/2/2/2 infiltration, the final mission requires 3 for the faction and 3 for Arrakis. This presented a problem since the only way to get 12 agents is by unlocking a late-game Statecraft tech. I had to wait almost an hour just fast-forwarding time to get the tech, the agents, and build up enough infiltration to do the mission.

My second win was with the Harkonnen. This time I knew about the infiltration issues and unlocked the 5 extra agents much earlier. Since *all* tech scales up in time to unlock as the game progresses, targeting a single high-level tech early can give you an immense advantage, particularly in the intelligence game. I rapidly got enough agents to assassinate 2 AIs relatively early in the game and finished the last one off with a military victory. This also taught me that assassination is way too strong, once you have the agents it's basically a death-clock waiting for you to get enough money to launch the missions and there's no way to stop it. The game badly needs a more pro-active intelligence defensive game to prevent this kind of abuse.

My third win was with the Smugglers. For this one I just kind of relaxed. I expanded heavily and beefed up my economy but the normal AIs didn't really try very hard to do much of anything. I kept a strong defensive force at a few obvious attack points and they didn't try to attack me in a meaningful way, and a few buildings and expansions quickly got me a Hegemony victory without much trouble.

For my final victory I wanted to go for the 100% completion on achievements and switched to Insane AI. I admit that I did need a little save-scumming and some luck that the AI's mostly targeted one another for the early game, but once I was able to stabilize my military and get some HQ buildings built to compensate for the AI's base resource and HP advantages I was able to keep a balance long enough to get a Governorship victory. I think that if I had wanted to assassinate and do military tactics it would have taken some time to build up enough strength but it certainly felt doable. Importantly, the gameplay didn't feel ""harder"" in the sense that the AI behaved any smarter, it was just a flat advantage to the AIs to make things harder for the player (which I hate). Incidentally, this was the only game I continued after my win in order to get one last achievement and I noticed that the intel screen wouldn't open any more following the victory. This may be a bug.

My thoughts on the factions are that there's clearly some thought to try and make them unique, but there's not enough to make it stand out as a true advantage. And sometimes it works the wrong way. The Harkonnen, for example, get a penalty to annexing villages after pillaging, but then a tech later on unlocks the ability to make them easier after pillaging. This is counter intuitive, and importantly one stack doesn't translate into another. So I actually had a village that had one stack of each modifier cancelling each other out. But in general, none of the unique features were enough to make me change my playstyle substantially. I didn't feel encouraged to pillage or annex peacefully or anything else. I think that some of these features need attention.

Overall thoughts, it's a good basis for a game but needs much more depth. Everything from the tech progression to the unit selection to the intel game needs to be more and deeper. Otherwise this game won't have any meaningful replay value. I've logged more than 1400 hours in Civilization, but unless the game mechanics themselves really change a lot I don't see myself revisiting this game for a while now that I've gotten all the achievements.

I loved Dune 2000 and played a lot of it as a kid. This doesn't give me the same feeling of building, planning and control. This game could be wonderful and something to play over and over.

Fighting AI looses dynamism as you defeat one faction and face off with another. To take a sietch out was forever. I think in PvP scenario I would have lost the game while trying to take out the player's HQ with max troop numbers I can have. You can easily overpower the last one remaining but then you have no 'government' resource that accumulates painfully slow and every consecutive village needs even more of it to occupy, and it takes progressively longer to occupy. So the game becomes incredibly tedious and even frustrating when the spice bribes become too expensive and you left with no money suddenly, and unable to grow. You can liberate the villages but it just stalls your troop progress as the AI throws everything they got every minute or so and you wait forever for it to occupy with no heal.

In my view, this game is purchasable via ""early access"" too early, as in the current shallow and underdeveloped state players will try it out and eventually never come back once it is ""released"".

The map (although quite small) looks great and the sound design is totally on point, I'll give it that. I'm mostly really not digging it for its jokey, cute/polished & contemporary 'Fortnite meets Stellaris meets Barbarians(mobile game)' animation style, with its very simple texture package and simple color palette. Major disservice to the finer details of the weird and wild Dune universe! Superficial complaints from a Dune fan aside, it might be cool for someone new to RTS games. Maybe worth a try when it goes on sale.

When I first heard of this game, I was hoping that a 2022 Dune RTS would be something more advanced, like a Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak meets a Total War style game for Dune's melee combat. Which would've made a lot more sense, all things considered, instead of this safe and basic 4X RTS we got. The devs really should've focused on producing something more story driven, with greater attention/detail to its combat mechanics and animation. Something more innovative. Spice Wars feels like a low budget, low effort cash grab made by people with some loose affinity for the Dune franchise -- except for whoever worked on the sound or the map textures. This game doesn't come anywhere near to the quality of presentation you'll get from the books, or either the Lynch or Villeneuve Dunes. 

Lots of other pretty disturbing superficial issues, too. Here's a list of some specific ones.

- House Corrino and the Sardaukar were left out of the game
- The DLC (or update?) we get in the summer is going to include a new faction (of course they gave us a foundationally incomplete game)
- We got these smuggler nobodies. Why?
- Combat is super dull
- Unit design and combat mechanics are similar to Civ VI (this is not like what you saw in theaters)
- There's nothing sensical, creative, or enjoyable about the diplomacy component
- You get these weird popup events and challenges for what would typically be mundane happenings in other RTS games, like ""occupy a territory with TWO (2) military units to harvest spice"" that serve as this game's answer to its lack of a tutorial (it's like they knew there wasn't much to it)",1655885938,1655968630,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm a Dune fan, and all the praises about the ""work"" that has been put in respecting the Dune universe is nonsense. It may have a desert map and some sandworms, cool, but that's pretty much it. How much sense does it make to have the Fremen ""conquer"" Arrakis the same way as the imperial houses would?

About the game itself, the 4X tag is simply a joke and an insult to real 4X games. This is a game with somewhat complicated mechanics, that will give you a relatively hard time to grasp at first (for the first few hours) but has no depth at all and bores you to death after 10h tops.

The game shifts between calm and hectic quite often, which offers a decent variety in gameplay. It forces you to pay an ever increasing resource tax, wich forces you to advance and attack like a closing ring in a Battle Royale game would. Each playable faction has their own unique traits and abilities that are interesting enough to actually try all of them at least once. I think right now (EA) there are a bit too many currencies you need to keep track of, and the game is limited to just one map which is a shame. The single player offers in-game (tactical) pause, which is a really, really big plus.

Among the nice things:
- The rendition of the desert is beautiful and the overall soundscape is nice and gets you into the Dune mood.
- The game has the same addictive sort loop that a lot of the Paradox games seem to have - there is almost always something to do to - be it balance the economy, expand territory or engage in some diplomacy. Now that the multiplayer is released and I've tried it - it seems fun to play with friends too.
- Landsraad and espionage are implemented in a very interesting manner allowing for all sorts of play style.
- UI is clean and understandable, you have neat little descriptions and breakdowns of relevant values, the game is easy to pick up and just start playing.

Although its rough around the edges and falls short in a few things:
- I am a bit disappointed at the lack of unit variety or any sort of unit customization, considering there are only a few types of units in each faction and they largely fulfill the same roles across the board. Would be cool to at least give units some flavor by allowing individual unit upgrades for more gradual progression. It seems like I am spending way too much time sitting on 3-4 unit squads because owning units is way too much of a drain on your resources and you have to micro them like hell to let them skill up.
- AI is not that bright and seems to be cheating pretty bad especially on harder difficulties they seem to have no issue whatsoever popping out squad after squad of advanced units to just trickle them one by one into your ball of bois and with the amount of territory they have, it just doesn't feel believable.
- Tech tree makes little sense to me. It provides all sorts of gradual upgrades but I am never excited to acquire one as they don't feel all that impactful and the entire system seems both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. There are just too many things to consider in one go and none of individual upgrades allow for cool new strategies. My take is that there is just not enough content to provide meaningful variety in research but also there is too much choice from the get go - I feel like it would benefit from not allowing such vast amount of choices right away.
- There are a few infuriating mechanics that just seem like complete BS - sandworms eating your harvesters even with perfect micro or automated recall is one such example.

The region-by-region style of 4X conquest blended with real time combat and economics is the kind of evolution the genre needs and seeing the concept further refined in Dune's absolutely brilliant setting is a dream come true.

Many strategy titles incorporate politics, subterfuge and espionage in their gameplay yet so often these mechanics feel too ineffectual, complicated or time-consuming to really add that extra dimension to the 4X gameplay loop.

Thankfully, Dune's Agents, Landsraad Council and Operations truly have an impact on the game, aren't horribly intrusive and relatively easy to grasp. The Hegemony system is an excellent representative of ascendant political power on Arrakis. Agent deployments and Operation usage have thoroughly significant impacts on gameplays and manage to be fun and not a chore.

Finally the visuals here are delightfully painterly. Gusts of sand blowing over oceans of dunes, a seeming oasis with lakes full of acid and the titanic effects of sandworms are each superbly animated and capture the feeling of Dune. The desert nights backlit in blue and coloring the sands look outstanding. Each faction's units stand out notably and look great, are animated well and voiced competently.

Really I adore this game, they framed the world of Dune in a beautiful brush-stroke style and deftly employed lore factors like the native Fremen colonies, giant sandworm attacks, water scarcity and even terrifiying debt collectors in awesome power armor with chrome blades into the gameplay loop with care and sensibility.

All of this done right, and it's still in Early Access.

Still feels early access with the limited options but also feels more like a fully released game than most ""fully released games"" have been over the last few years. With the early access roadmap looking good I think the game has a lot of potential.

Would recomend at current Early access price! It takes me about 8 Hours to play though a standard game and just take my time and go slow. With 4 Factions currently in the game you should get at least 30-40 hours playtime (depending on the difficulty level) just by playing one game for each faction.

However I didn't quite enjoy the gameplay, my first feeling is the pace is too slow and it's a bit tedious.
It is probably because the developer wanted to mix 4X with RTS which I absolutely love the idea, yet it's a bit tricky to strike a balance. 

The ""4X"" aspect is more like Civilization rather than Stellaris e.g. it lacks a in-depth lore and less fun in eXploration.

The rewarding windows are few -- apparently the player can only gain advantages by:
1. well micro-managing the troops
2. well prioritizing the overtaking of regions/resources-mix. This is a bit dull and straightforward.

As many mentioned in their review, Sandworms are not noticable, some serious reworks needed.

Afterall the game is still in EA and it has so much potentials, can't wait to see it improved!

. For an early access game, Dune: Spice Wars is extremely well polished. The game works pretty seamlessly, with little to no obvious bugs to speak of.

. It is a beautiful game, the visuals are nice and if you zoom in full you are rewarded with a beautiful skybox.

. The voice acting for units are unique and well done, giving an individual feel to each unit.

. Having different advisors for your faction gives an extra layer of complexity, and can change your gameplay. A very nice addition.

. It's complicated enough to be stimulating and fun to play/learn. There are many incomes to manage and balance, whether you wish to conquer Dune by peace or force. 

. That's my first feedback, I really enjoy the complexity of the game but a lot of it is not fully explained. It took me about 2 trial runs to fully understand how to play, and even on my third play there were things I had missed - albeit small. 

. What there is of music is atmospheric and engrossing. However it is one track that lasts only a couple of minutes, and does not repeat often. This leaves the game feeling a bit sparse and empty (it's a desert planet, I know, but I mean as a gaming experience). I feel parched for music like parched for water. Some more soundtrack would really add to the experience and make it more captivating. 

To use my favourite game as an example, Emperor: Battle for Dune, each House had its own separate soundtrack, giving individual feel and character. This doesn't have to be the case for Spice Wars, but the game desperately needs some more auditory depth.

. Going into more detail about Houses and character, the Houses themselves could use a little fleshing out. The units themselves are mild variations on the same theme, so different factions aren't really that different, except for voice acting. (E.g. look at Wardens (Atreides) vs House Guards (Harkonnen). All buildings are ubiquitous. The Faction Bases are individualised of course, and look great, but that's where it stops - other than in the trade scene.

. In my second playthrough I was determined to win a peaceful victory as House Atreides, by being votes as Dune Governor. I was eventually successful, but it took me longer to achieve than a Hegemony victory (which I passed first). The land requirement and the reticence of AI to expand meant it took a long time for the Dune Governorship to actually become a voting option. That and the randomised nature of voting meant that it took 3 cycles for the Governorship to even roll around. Maybe an additional mechanic can be added, where you can expend influence to put forward specific charters for voting? This would make balancing influence use more interesting too, as you'd have to spend valuable influence to bring up a Charter vote that you also need for actual votes.

There may also be a bug in the voting system, but I cannot be sure. For example, for about half of the game, the Charter votes only cycled between the Voice and Eyes of the council, even though other Charters had been unlocked and could be voted on (like Speaker). The other options only came up after letting another faction to win one of the Charters, or through the option to cancel all active Charters. Either this was a bug, or a consequence of the randomised votes, which I would link to my above suggestion.

. This also meant that the game was too long, and even though Hegemony is the ""long game"" way to victory, it was passed long before the Dune Governorship even became available. I would like to see the Hegemony cap increased (30-40K?), as even on my first playthrough as House Harkonnen I just about to won the game through force before the Hegemony cap kicked in. 

Those are my thoughts an feedback for now, but I do love this game, and I love it's potential. It's so exciting to have a Dune strategy game again, and I'm looking forward to all future updates!",1655573348,1655573348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There’s no population management, choosing instead for buildings that add modifiers to your various resource incomes. Resource management is still front and center, but DSW has an increased emphasis on diplomacy, espionage, and large scale warfare. 

DSW increases the game time length from Northgard’s 1-2 hours to a solid 3-4 hours experience, maybe even more time on the larger maps. Because of the lack of factions (4 at launch) and campaign mode, the longer games are a welcome addition, adding more play time. 

As far as it being a Dune game, it makes sense and hold up well. Although I don’t know why Spice merchants are a faction when the books have more obvious and active factions that would have fit, like a House Corrino or an Imperial faction. Also I feel like the “lazeguns create massive explosions when they hit a shield” dynamic is missing. Hero units would be nice as well. 

The graphics and sound design are good, and really drive the experience. 

I would recommend Dune Spice Wars to a Dune fan and also someone who wants a solid RTS/4X hybrid with potential to expand.

There is no point to playing the other factions since all of them are the same. The smugglers are terrible, although they have been buffed in the newest patch is still not enough. It is no where near enough. Sietches you cannot actually destroy only raid. Thus making the game a frustrating slog as you accidentally click to attack a seitche when you didn't mean to mid combat causing floods of unit to kill all your men. The worms do not add challenge to the game-play just make it impossible to move around, the path finding makes it worse too as your troops will blindly run straight into the worms mouth.

The command cap is an arbitrary limitation on your ability to play the game and will never be enough. With no way to increase the command cap there is no point in playing the game as the command points you get from techs will never be enough. Manpower is another thing, you will never have enough and there is no easy way to get manpower. I would hardly call this a strategy game because i see no strategy in it.

Learning the game- there is a LOT of reading- like any strategy game.  Take the time to read all the building/ special abilities, etc.  I started a new game every 30min until I was comfortable with the mechanics.

The UI is fresh and easy to understand.  You get small visual alerts and sound notification on important events throughout the game.

The games take a long time to win, so sit down for breakfast and maybe you'll win by dinner.  I enjoy the pause feature and the speed change option.  I wish there was an option that decreased the speed, cost/ price of buildings so that the game would be over faster (Like in Civ 6 theres an ""Online to Epic"" games speed option), however, since the game is in early stages the base balance of the game should be high priority. 

Overall, from a casual players perspective this game is really fun.  The last few updates have added more content to prevent each game feeling like a repeat of the last.

In the wake of no new Command and Conquer or Civilization titles for some time, this game melds elements from both RTS and 4X genres in interesting ways, and usually to good effect.

[h1]The good:[/h1]
[*]The factions, while few, are very unique from one another and no faction feels [i]too[/i] overpowered or underpowered. They all perform kind of as expected. The Fremen master the desert and the worms, House Harkonnen is disgustingly wealthy. The Smugglers can weasel their way into power and siphon enemy resources, and House Atriedes is probably the most ""standard"" faction.
[*]The sound design and artwork is fantastic, and lends character to the map and leaders alike.
[*]Resource management is very important, especially in early game, so if you need to cripple your opponents you can hit one of their villages with high spice or water production. This feels like it's gonna be extra fun in multiplayer!
[*]No major technical issues so far, even as an Early Access game. Nice!
[*]Multiple genuine paths to victory, some easier than others. If you've played Civ, you may recognize these as Domination, Culture, Political, and a more unique spycraft-based assassination victory (although this plays into Domination a bit)
[*]Games can be done within a few hours. Longer than your typical C&C or Age of Empires game, but far shorter than Civ or Risk. 
[*]The desert is a real danger to the unprepared. In the early game, you need to really prioritize what resources and villages you need, because you won't be able to travel quickly or cheaply with your already limited armies. More than once I've used uncaptured desert territory as a shield against attackers while I capture and pillage the closer, safer villages.
[*] It's just genuinely fun. As limited as it is right now, you probably won't get hundreds of hours of play out of the Early Access version. That may change, but even as it is I've won multiple victories (and a couple losses) and am still enjoying myself plenty!


[h1]The bad:[/h1]
[*]There's only one map right now. It's still fun, but it's not gonna feel great for tens of hours longer.
[*]The combat is perhaps just a [i]tad[/i] too small and not quite strategic enough for my taste. It's less about rock/paper/scissors and more about who has better tech and more units. The most I've had on the field is 10 units when I was rushing to destroy the final capitol.
[*]Only four factions at the moment, but there are more coming. Can't wait to see House Ordos or Corrino in here!
[*]Lack of a tutorial makes your first game pretty confusing, especially since this is such a hybridization of genres. There were some text box guides and I was able to get a pretty good handle on things, but I can't imagine being someone new to strategy or even new to gaming and trying to make my way around Spice Wars. It's not an overly complex game, but it's [i]just weird enough[/i], you know?
[*]There's no way to tame the Deep Desert! Perhaps this is intentional or maybe it's gonna be changed, but I was really hoping for some high-risk, high-reward water and other resource gathering in the late game. As it is, the Fremen can use the DD essentially as another lane of attack in mid-late game, but other than that is is a portion of the map carved out as a death pit and nothing else. 
[*]In my opinion, the Fremen shouldn't get an Authority penalty for allying with Seitches. C'mon, they're essentially brothers! Maybe a steeper Water or even a Spice penalty- but if anything, I feel authority should increase, not decrease. 

As it is, I'd recommend Dune: Spice Wars if you're a fan of strategy or of Dune- and I can only see the game getting better.

With how things stand it's replayability factor is at best play it once with every faction. Then you're done, as the game - big picture wise - plays out the same. 

Pros:
 - Good looking game
- Immersive soundtrack, really sets the mood
- Does not require insane micromanagement

Cons:
- Feels empty (and dont tell me thats what Arakis is supposed to feel like :P)
- ""Selection"" of units but it all comes down to sheer numbers, whoever has the most wins
- Why the f@£$ would House Atreides ever be designated green when the ""Smugglers"" are blue and House Ordos is missing ( they're supposed to be the green wearing dudes), I know I'm weird but that really ticked me off!
- World events? Sandstorm just stay in base, worm sighting run and pray to the rng gods, the rest is on the diplomacy side of things which by the way needs a lot of love to be functional, the treaties currently very underwhelming

Conclusion:
Very promising, but at it's current early access stage needs work to be a worthwhile release, the concern being that some of the work would need to be on the creative side. Then again, if you are happy just playing every faction once, for the experience and paying 25£ for it, you will not regret the purchase.

I am a big fan of Dune... for decades but this is a missed opportunity. After 3 hours I feel like I have seen everything and doing the same things all over again.

The troops are pointless. It would have been honest if troops are just a numbers popping up on towns after they are build. There is no strategy in fights. Troops could have been implemented as a card game like ""Gwent"".

You feel the object oriented approach from well meaning programmers. This is the problem: everything feels like it is derived from the same object... with only different ""property"", very generic with a different name tag on it. There is no life in the characters. Trading and diplomacy  is pointless and boring.

Long story short: it feels what it is: a game made for smartphones with a simple and few generic things to do stretched for hours and played on a PC. It is more of a boardgame... and not even a good one. Different resources, different development trees and on every line you do the same streamlined progress.

Throw away your ""object oriented"" approach. It makes the gameplay barren and boring.

After 3 hours I have not the feeling that I made even one meaningful decision. I don't think there are any ""suggestions"" to save this game. The problem is deep in the core of the game. I don't want to see what is in that black area... I know it is the same thing with a different resource at best.

-> no motivation to explore

There is no way to ""expand"" the maps are very small. Expansion is slow as you have to progress on every generic path...

-> no motivation to expand. Why should I? Cause the tax gets higher and higher with every second?`That is not really a motivation.

There is no ""exploit"".. no optimisation of resources to get better. There is a techtree... but there is not more than ""build your buildings where you get the most out of it""...

-> no motviation to exploit and optimize

The units are very generic and the ""real time"" has almost no impact. Troops are Gwent Cards. 

-> no motivation to exterminateä


This game does not meet even one X ... in a ""4X game""

I am very sorry but in this case: start again and use the licence for Dune for a better game.

A game with this game as rough ""world layer"" that zooms in for RTS fights and basebuilding while fighting would be an idea....

An RTS/4X hybrid with good foundation, decent amount of gameplay depth and faction identity, guaranteed to keep you hooked for hours on end.

Thrown into a planet filled with sand, you and 3 other factions must vote, trade, fight, backstab eachother to become the governor of Dune. With multiple win conditions, it is up to you to adapt to your local surrounding, decide how you will claw your way up, and prevent others from snatching it right under your nose. It is truly free-for-all, in a game of monopoly, but with religious zealots, purple-tinted cocaine, and a lot of sand. Oh and sandworms - who care naught for your personal squabble, devouring anything that dare to make too much noise on the sand.
  
As of now, the game is a bit barebone in terms of content, with a few rough edges, especially UI-wise (Arrakis Infiltration need an indication whether they're idle; Landsraad phases are hard to keep track of; and sometimes in the midst of a heated conflict, your notification bar gets so cluttered that it becomes hard to read through, to name a few). But a roadmap has been announced, teasing a brand new faction and aircrafts, while feedback are being considered on their discord server, so hopefully the game experience will get better from here on.

Key highlights for me where to the diplomacy and economic system is far more advanced than a lot of games I have played. This is a real plus for as there are plenty of video games where you just simply build an army and squish the enemy under your boot. A simple small mistake or a missed notification can compound so quickly and really cause issues in your house, I find this very true to the narrative of Dune. I have read the book and seen the new movies and this game give good respect to both.

Just be aware if you are purist who often gets upset by change or development in lore every time someone develops anything to do with your chosen narrative you will be disappointed by this, it probably says more about you than the game. So if you are a hard to please self righteous, lore lawyer, neck beard who cant handle a quality artistic impression you will probably bore everyone to death referring to individual sentences of the book and waving it around like a bible screeching about why it wasn't done exactly how you imagined. Also if you played the original game this edition is a bit different, there is combat but it is not the be all and end all like it was in the original game it is also a bit slower paced being economic and detail oriented. If your looking for the nostalgic experience of the old game it isn't the right one for you, that being said if you want a modernized experience it may be just what your looking for.

I would really like the game developers to continue adding detail, lore and complexity to the game . A lore based narrative campaign for the main narratives factions could be really cool and for the free play style I would welcome the addition of any of the other houses, or the forces of the emperor. This would be great as you can really sandbox, and ""what if"" the fate of Arakis. I also think the developers need to keep replay ability in mind and make every play through a bit more unique.

I had a fun 40 hours but until new content is released or the game changes significantly I am probably done. I've won with each house and each victory type. That was a fun adventure but now that I know how to do it, it doesn't sound appealing to do it again. 

This game isn't really an RTS and in my opinion should abandon or rework the RTS piece. The RTS elements are easily the weak part and seem to be in there to make a comparison rather than for actual gameplay purposes. Pausing makes micro easy, the computer doesn't micro at all so you can kinda abuse that, there isn't much to do besides assign attacks. The one cool part is during seiges you can pull individual units to heal at a nearby base then send them back in. This feels fun and leads to some good gameplay but isn't a good reason in itself to have these RTS elements. 

The strongpoint of the game is that it has good mechanisms for managing expansion and it encourages you to make smart expansions not just ALL THE EXPANSIONS. This also shows in the games win conditions which are each pretty different and can absolutely be achieved without just dominating militarily. 

Overall thumbs up if you are a Dune fan, if not, wait until the game is released and see what people are saying then. It could be amazing and endlessly replayable but right now it is worth about 40 hours to someone who enjoys the lore.

Performance is inconsistent for me, I get particularly bad frame dips during sandstorms but it runs fine most of the time. 
The soundscape and ambience are haunting in this game, I definitely recommend taking it in a bit before you listen to other stuff in the background.
I do have a few criticisms of the game that I will go over but overall its a great experience in its current state for people who enjoy economic/political focused strategy.

Criticism:
I dislike that for the Fremen Sietch Tabr has no interactivity until you get to the first Hegemony threshold, and that in the early game the Fremen play a little too similar to the other factions. Conquering villages and expanding conspicuously demarcated territory is exactly what the Fremen should not be. I think the Fremen should be more focused on building hidden strength and subterfuge with petty raids and sabotage until they are ready for all out conflict. I can see why the devs made the choices they did considering that it seems like multiplayer balance is going to be an important part of the game but making the Fremen need to conquer the Graben people erodes a lot of what makes them interesting. When the major houses enter a village it shouldn't be immediately clear whether Fremen have influence there. I get that it's not necessarily fun in a multiplayer context to get steamrolled out of nowhere by a faction you had half forgotten about but as a book fan it's a bit disappointing. In the books the Fremen and smugglers have built hidden stockpiles, labs, and outposts in the desert and that's something I'd like to see more of in the early game.
Sandworm travel is also quite limited for the Fremen right now. You get three thumpers that can transport a whole army of units but otherwise the worms don't fit into the Fremen playstyle until you can start generating thumpers at 5k hegemony. It makes no sense for thumpers to be this scarce, and it makes even less sense for them to only be useful for travel. Thumpers are cheap to make and thumpers are weapons. Fremen should be able to set a thumper the way Terrans can launch a tactical Nuke in Starcraft and watch their enemies get slurped up. I don't think using sandworms for travel should be tied to Hegemony; why would your influence over the people of Arrakis improve your ability to ride the worms? In my opinion the only thing that should matter is unit experience and technology. When Fremen units reach level 2 they should be able to ride small worms that carry a single unit and have several thumpers in that units inventory that get restocked at friendly settlements. Also when the worm is called there should always be a risk that everyone gets eaten. >:)

The game is already fun and worthwhile and if it gets the same love that Northgard did it has the potential to be something really special. I'm just a book nerd who wants to rp in this universe and so far I'm having a great time.",1654588771,1654589298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was extremely excited to see a Dune game, being a huge fan of the books, but then was disappointed to see it looked more like a Civ game and less of an RTS Game in the image of Dune 2000.  I’ve now had sometime to play and dive into the mechanics, which lends the question; did it change my mind?  Let’s Discuss.

I Must Not Fear:  I was very concerned about this game.  I love all things Dune but have never really enjoyed the popular 4X games (Sins of a Solar Empire being one of the few exceptions) so I immediately felt this might not be for me.  I’m happy to say I was mistaken.  This is indeed a 4X RTS that is simplified in each of its individual components but when they come together as a whole creates a gameplay loop that I found enjoyable.  Like all 4X games there are many resources to manage but all are important and none is ‘useless’ no matter your play style.  I especially like how the game makes valid and effective all possible victory paths and even found myself enjoying the politics side of the mechanics.  The combat is still there and is still important but it is simply one weapon in your toolbox.

Slow on Attack:  This is not an RTS in typical sense, yes it is real time and yes you command units but really the game is about looking at the big picture and planning an hour in the future.  Most ‘big plays’ aren’t going to cost or make you the game and are recoverable by both yourself and your opponents; something that may push away the typical RTS fandom.  The game does a great job of making all the methods of winning viable; from destruction of the main base, assassination, or more political methods of becoming the Governor of Dune or just having so much influence no one can stop you; all of these are valid and enjoyable.  Every faction plays very unique and in subtle ways you may not immediately notice.  One faction focuses on politicking while maintaining a defense force, another may focus on steamrolling you on the battlefield and another makes behind the scenes the focal point.  I particularly enjoyed how the Smugglers were implemented with their ability to build bases even when they don’t control the area.

Wormsign:  The game lacks any campaign and I’m not even sure how they would do one if / when it is implemented.  The missions take too long (sometimes reaching into the 3+ hour mark) to have a traditional campaign but they may surprise me.  I also found the music disappointing for the grandness of the Dune setting and although passable the audio was nothing groundbreaking.  This created a game that I quickly muted to listen to something else.  I also feel the Freman probably need a bit more to their faction; it’s not necessarily that they are weak but lack anything that makes them truly unique at the level of the other factions (although riding the Sandworms is nice).

Maybe I’m just new to the 4X genre but I found this game very fun and mentally engaging.  From the politicking to ambushing exposed flanks the game feels Dune and I’m very happy to be proven wrong.  I’d recommend you grab this if you are a fan of the setting or the genre and I will be watching with great interest on the progression to release.  Enjoy!

This game continues to grow on the great world building of the Dune series, currently it doesnt focus on Paul Atreides or the Bene Gesserit which is a good thing in my opinion as I think those are the worst parts of Dune.

Criticisms, I feel the tutorial is lacking. There is a lot of reading and things you gotta just learn on your own or already know from previous games within the genre. I won't go into specific detail but I was playing on easy and getting frustrated to the point I almost gave up on the game. I looked around reddit, youtube and found a few beginners guides that explained certain mechanics that I didn't realize even existed within the game.

Looking forward to see how this game evolves from Early Access, I know they intend on adding multiplayer my hope is they add more units and perhaps an additional faction down the line.

EDIT: After writing this short review I saw the development road map, they absolutely intend on adding multiplayer, new advanced units like space craft, another faction and more this summer!

The map feels like a giant spreadsheet where you take one territory after another and just have to balance the income. It’s not necessarily bad other games do that too, but with no flavor it becomes dull.

The core problem is that every system seems designed to limit the player rather than help them grow. If you want to build a spice refinery, you have to have the right number of plascrete and a region with spice in it – okay, fine. But then you also have to have a fuel cell for the harvester and manpower to drive it. That’s three resources and a geographical restriction for the most basic function in a Dune game.

Moreover, fuel cells are *only* used for harvesters and ornithopters, making them feel completely unnecessary. (To be fair, I think they plan to add more vehicles.)

Unit movement is also annoying and pointlessly tied to a “resource”: supplies. Every unit has a supply meter that drains when they walk through unfriendly territory, then begins draining health if it’s depleted. This makes sense as a way to stop you from just parking your guys right outside the enemy city indefinitely. But it’s just kind of annoying. It feels like every time you want to make a move, you have to do it extra carefully and with perfect timing in order not to start the fight with diminished HP. It’s one of a million things trying to eff with your ish every two seconds.

Other games solve this by simply making it a diplomatic violation of some kind to incur into enemy territory, which is better functionally and thematically. For the neutral territories, why does it even matter? They’re just sitting there anyway. What is the point of making it more difficult/annoying for me to attack a neutral territory? How does that improve the game?

Similarly, as far as I can tell, units can only spawn on your starting base region. Seriously? I mean, what? Isn’t everyone being flown in from off-planet anyway? Why can’t they land anywhere?

Then on the tech tree, there’s a node that increases your units’ supply regeneration rate. I could see this making sense in a tense game where every second counts, but it feels like increased complexity for an already unnecessary system. 

It's also not the resource that limits your expansion anyway. No, that would be ""authority,"" another frustrating, game-slowing mechanic. Every village you take over costs authority, with increasing costs as you move away from your main base. However, this does not correspond to any increased rate of authority production. So what does this mean? As your empire grows in size and power, you can take over territory at a *slower rate*. You have all the units you need to conquer the place, but you have to just sit and wait for another resource to build up. That is straight up terrible.

All of which is to say that increasing your supply regen rate does nothing. It's like they thought, ""Well we have this supply thing, so we need a tech tree node for it,"" but didn't consider what that meant for the game, let alone what enjoyment value it might offer (or not offer) the player.

Speaking of the tech tree, I think more than half the nodes simply adjust your resource sliders in some way. There are very few unit unlocks, and as far as I can tell, nothing that fundamentally changes your build from anyone else’s. I haven’t gotten that far in, but I expect that every player will unlock the whole thing by the end of the game.

The most frustrating and perplexing element has to be the Landsraad councils. Every month, players will use their Landsraad votes, determined by standing and augmented by any influence they might want to use (toss another resource on there! Why not?), to vote for three resolutions. Most of these resolutions are terrible. What is the point of increasing everyone’s manpower usage by 30%? It just makes things difficult for no reason, and it affects everyone equally . . . so what does it really change? 

Then there are resolutions that only affect a single player, providing some large bonus or penalty. If the AIs all vote for you to get the penalty, it’s yet another annoying limitation you have to deal with for the next month.

These councils happen way too frequently, they’re super annoying, they have too many pop-ups, and they don’t feel like diplomacy/statecraft at all. I truly hope this gets completely re-worked before the game leaves early access.

It’s possible I just don’t like this type of game – I didn’t particularly care for Northgard or Stellaris – but I’ve played Civilization since #2 and enjoyed countless other strategy games, so it’s not like this is out of my wheelhouse.

Looking up the studio, they are very small, very young, and have very few titles. I think it’s a shame this project didn’t go to someone with more resources (irony) because everything about the game feels limited and barebones. They are also French, which explains why this reminds me so much of the abstract token-moving Euro board games that I can’t stand.",1653544868,1653611262,False,6,1,0.463096201419830322,0,True,False,True

I wanted to give a one to one response to the top review right now, because it misses the mark entirely. This is in reference to Cantore's review, which is currently in the top spot.

1) ""1) The amount of spice you need to bribe the empire with always goes up. By a few hours into the game, you will have an extremely high spice tax rate that you will be forced to contribute. Failure to do so brings some really hefty consequences to one or more of your resources. And, it gets worse - it compounds each time the deadline is missed.""

Spice is life. It's the most essential resource in the game, and you can't just ignore it. My guess is that the reviewer missed that you can control the slider that balances how much spice you stockpile vs how much you sell for cash to the CHOAM. As Smugglers in one game, I built my entire economy around black markets in enemy territory so 100% of my spice went into the stockpile for the Landsraad or periodic mission bribes. In another game, I took control of the Polar Cap, built a water harvester, and earned a fortune selling water and buying spice from others. You can expand your territory to find more spice fields. You can go down the research tree to build more crew on each harvester to extract more per territory, as well as build spice silo builds to produce 20% more. You can research to allow orinthopters to boost any harvester's they are over. You can search for ? items all over and assign missions to find stockpiles. You can buy spice from other factions by trading whatever resource you are specializing in. I've beat the game on normal or hard with each faction and never once missed a spice tax, but I always had to think about spice.

2)""2) Given much more major battles exist in the end game, you would think there would be some way to offset the amount of spice you need to contribute; or a way to gain independence from them. There isn't.""

See above. The CHOAM/Stockpile slider is where its at. As for gaining independence and just refusing to contribute, YOU CAN DO THAT TOO! There are ways to offset the penalties for missing tax day, and keep your favor with the Landsraad. You can focus on earning Influence and Intel, then run agent missions for ""Political Audits"" that boost your Landsraad standing +30 each time. There's HQ buildings that let you earn +1 Landsraad every tick. So you can generate an economy that can allow you to sell every bit of spice you get.

3) ""3) REALLY SEVERE debufs exist in the game, and exacerbate further when other factions start messing with your manpower and health restore on your troops. I am TOTALLY against magic debufs, and this game has a LOT of them!""

There are two types of debuffs. The direct buffs and debuffs that you can apply via agents, and the ones you can vote for/against doing the councils. To help counter agents, you can assign counter intelligence agents to catch and punish the factions that are hitting you with them. You can also vote for harsh punishments for a faction if they use one of these. You can of course run your own agents to build your own buffs and debuffs, and this is necessary. If you see that your force is being debuffed and you can't use your own agents to match... pull your forces out! Come back when you're better prepared.

4) ""4) The periodic faction voting is meant to debuf another faction so you gain an upper hand on them. I hate it personally. It should be votes on actually meaningful things, not just everyone against me. I find myself putting all of my votes into stopping the worst of the consequences so I don't get debuffed to death! It's stupid and really pointless. It needs a serious overhaul!""

Here's another part of the economy you can specialize in! You can absolutely build enough influence to control these votes. In the early game, its hard to pick more than one, but some factions specialize in manipulating this. As Atredies, you can bring Lady Jessica to give you the ability to remove debuffs. Smugglers can set bounties for factions to vote a certain way against a certain faction (and man do they like to vote for the things you pay them to). Harkonnens can secretly corrupt a vote that a faction may want to have so that the winning faction loses Landsraad standing. Buildings can generate influence for votes, you can trade for the resource, etc. As you build your standing, you could become Speaker of the council and get a chance to reroll one of the three options each week.

5) ""5) The units. You have soldiers, but there's a MASSIVE penalty to having them... but you need them, or you'll die quickly. The more units you have the more manpower you don't have. You have to offset this with a bunch of recruitment stations all over the place by the time the game is well underway. Even then, if the enemy messes with the manpower or your health regen - you're cooked.""

Manpower and water, another resource! Of course, you could do like I did with the Smugglers and build an entire Drone army run on nothing but money and batteries. Or you can earn some manpower by placing agents in the Space guild. You can specialize in a strong militia to protect each of your locations. Harkonnens can end up with a crazy strong militia in place if you build right. Place your missile batteries in the right spot and you can cover multiple territories for the cost of very little manpower. Well placed airports let you shuttle around a defending force to assist your militia wherever you need them (or ride the free worms if you're a Fremen). 

6)""6) Units don't have any specialty skills or icons. They're just a unit with more or less number values than another. It would be nice to have the military line unlock special skills that a unit can perform, or a defensive or offensive boost. As it stands now, the game is more worried about unit consumption of manpower, power, and water; all of which is of no affect during a battle.""

Every unit has a unique ability, some more passive than others. Atreidies like to have a varied army because each unit benefits the others in some way and some get stronger for each unique buff they get from others. Harkonnens inflict self damage, but can run agent missions to take drugs that keep you from dying. So you're holding out at one health hoping to finish things off quickly. Fremen can bring an advisor that boosts their strength for lone soldiers (and the run speed for everyone). You can then bring the unit that deals a ton of damage on its first attack, assassinate something and RUN. Smugglers are stronger against units as they lose supply (basically stamina), particularly their snipers. Their aoe attacker damages supply. Agent missions can damage supply. So theirs lots of strategies to exploit this. Each faction also gets a drone unit that works differently. It can cross territory that soldiers would have to walk a long ways around. They don't generate vibrations to draw worms.

Shiro Games' interpretation of Dune as a strategy game is already pretty awesome. With each update it will get better and better. As an early adopter of Shiro's Northgard title, I can tell you these devs care. They've got cred. Instinct tells me Dune: Spice Wars is the next Dune RTS classic. And we not only get to see it get made, we can influence its direction as players.

Will you like Dune: Spice Wars? I don't know. I do know a few things though:  1) - I know Herbert wrote Dune not only to entertain, but to challenge readers. 2) - I know I love everything about Dune. And 3) - So far, it looks like Shiro Games does too.

They have a tech tree similar to civ 6 but instead of being one big tree this one is broken into 4 separate smaller trees.

The combat in this game is quite unique but definitely falls more into your traditional RTS style combat.

The game  has a spy system that can be used for various purposes such as messing with economy, troops, or just straight up assassinating the other leaders.

There is a political system that can be used to hinder opponents or improve your own endeavors based on voting specfic things into effect. This is easier to control with some factions then others.

Each faction has there own unique way to play the game and all the units are pretty balanced so honestly hard to complain about the combat and i personally think it is the hardest way to win the game which is probably for the best as it should not be easy in the first place.

If you are looking for an RTS with heavy emphasis on combat this is not for you, if you are looking for a tradition 4x this is not for you.

My favourite aesthetic-choice for Dune. The visuals are very smooth and beautiful. 

Very resource management heavy so if you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. It's similar to Northgard (same developers) in the way that you have a home base, then you send out scouts to unknown regions, you then take over the village there (or pillage, unless you're Atreides). You can then build buildings that benefit you and you can purchase further slots (at increasing prices) with plascrete (a resource). You can also assign militias to defend them, but in the early game, they're weak until you research more to buff them and add more militia slots. 

Then you just have to win the game by fighting the other factions. There's only non-aggression pacts I think and no alliances. So far there's 4 factions with a 5th one coming in the future (probably House Ordos). I hope they don't stop there and can come up with more factions; even if they have to make couple up but they're lore friendly. 

Again, a very lovely game for the price and the devs seem to be listening to player-feedback as the first big update that just released addressed some key stuff.

This review is during the early access so I will review it again a few times through development, but right now it is a bit broken.

I assaulted a Harkonen base with 9 units which took me forever to be able to obtain as Fremen and literally destroyed the town and then the first wave of reinforcements and more dropships just kept coming. I think it was somewhere around 23-25 total units dropped and repeated this a few times and the same kept happening. It means there was no chance for me to assault any of their units and all three factions were attacking me alternatingly from the beginning so there was no real chance to build up. This happens no matter which faction you choose. The AI is just OP. Until they balance it better, I'm not interested, and that's as a long time DUNE fan. It also doesn't help that every faction has onithopters and no alternate potential fliers for the different factions as in the lore they didn't use the same ship types.

The game, simply put, is buggy to all hell: 
-Corpses not disappearing and capturing your villages. 
-Villages which magically switch sides without the interluding ""rebellion"" mechanics because the ""rebellion"" mechanics are bugged. 
-Harkonnen suffers from eternal rebellions, which, as I just mentioned, are bugged and sometimes auto flip your villages without warning. 
-The game lags out the ass in the late game; the AI is either dumb as hell on the two lower difficulties or cheats out its ass in the higher difficulties and keeps spamming annoying defenses because it has no need for economic buildings.
-The UI is bugged and on the highest difficulty there will be so many AIs teaming up against you that you will not be getting notifications that you are being attacked because you are being attacked in too many places at once that you will not get notified a village is being attacked until you have already lost it.
-Storms can form without warning directly on top of your armies and kill them instantly.
-Worms will sometimes instantly eat your entire army instead of giving you a warning before hand.

Did I mention this is all stuff I have noticed AFTER their first patch?  Yes. It's still broken.

Not to mention most of the game mechanics are not well thought out.  
One. Apparently the devs wanted players to use small armies for more ""tactical"" engagement and to not death ball - and so they made the number of troops you can field quite small.  This has the opposite effect in game, however, because units are very weak and have no active abilities so death balling your entire army is the ONLY strategy there is.  If you break your army into smaller bits you will lose.  The AI will break its army into smaller bits and attack you in multiple places.  Do not be fooled - this is not a good strategy, they are doing this because losing their entire army by splitting it up doesn't hurt it because it cheats for resources and can instantly rebuild its entire army once it loses it by splitting it into parts.

Two.  Espionage and assassinations.  You should also know that assassinations (which instantly kill a player) have no counter... now the AI isn't programmed to assassinate you as far as I know... but just wait until we get multiplayer and things are going to be WORSE than Crusader Kings.  In Crusader Kings you probably. won't die so long as everyone in your court likes you and your spy master is competent.  There is no such mechanic here: if a player has the prerequisites to assassinate someone, the assassination WILL succeed... eventually. It's just really slow but unstoppable. There is no counter.  There is no intrigue.  Just gather some points, spend it, and after half a dozen bureaucratic hoops, a player just dies. It honestly feels less like an assassination and more like killing someone by successfully filing your taxes.

Three. Rebellions.  Because even though I mentioned they are bugged it begs iterating that even if they were not bugged they are not well thought out.  Losing cities spontaneously and having all your militia just disappear is just stupid and is just not fun.  Easy fix: add a happiness mechanic and instead of rebellion events or rebellion intrigue operations resulting in cities instantly breaking away from you, you should just make those cities lose tons of happiness.  Add a tax mechanic with this that allows you to reduce the taxes to increase happiness.  Then you now have a way for players to counter the rebellions that does not involve constantly having to send your troops all over the damned map.  I cannot stress how unfun rebellions are.

Is this a good game for a DUNE fan? ----> No, it´s not.

I didn't play long, I've just checked somethings to make sure if I like this game or not.
As a DUNE fan, there are too many things that make no sens for me, which annoy me.
[olist]
    [*]You are on a plant, but the map seems sooo small. I was expecting something like EU or Kingdome Cruseder - size of the planet.
    [*]Sandworms - what are they for? For travel? Not much use. Maybe for harder travels through sands, because it will call them - Sorry, also not. Walk as much as you want, appeard once during 2h.
    [*]Fremen - You would think they need to be nice, moving silently through out the dessert, usung their knowladge, being hidden in a deep desert. Nope, you're also wrong here. Randomly on the map, like all others hunting for villages like others with small bonuses. Ah, and the Harrkonens discover your location and don't try to erase you, makes much sense.
    [*]Hidden treasures - Big water storages that Freman had - Nope, Botanical gardes - Nope, Harkonnens using they big guns from the Orbit - Nope. House Atreides super soldiers - Nope.
    [*]Smugglers - as someone already wrote, they don't make much sens as a proper faction, as a sub faction they would be perfect. Here I would love to see House Corrino with their Sardaukar. Maybe something going on in the space around Arrakis.
    [*]Villages - Arrakis is mostly one big dessert and only Fremen could really live there. What the hell are these villages? It would make sense to upgrade your capital and take control over areas, but the whole thing with conquering them, especially by House Atreides makes not much sense.
[/olist]
As you see there are a lot of things which would annoy a DUNE fan and probably a lot more which I didn't discover.
I think the game is too plain, missing the atmosphere and the big difference between factions. That is what I have expected in the game in the univerese of DUNE. It to be more like Stellaris combined with Europa Universalis and maybe Civilization in case of developing cities.

i first watch Dune (1984) with my dad in the early 2000's still not seen the new one. as for this its pretty good has a fantastic look to it cool soundtrack much better than the C+C style that was around in the 90's in my first run i had no fkin clue what i was doing, took a few restarts to be able to understand how to play it and survive.

There are 4 different factions to choose from: House Atreides, House Harkonnen the Smugglers and the Fremen each have their own unique units and building as well as political and espionage benefits, it takes 1 of 3 ways to win, Be merciless and win by annihilation, be a sneaky politician and pat your enemy on the back just to aim you knife ready for Assassination, or impress them enough that they recognise you are the true and rightful ruler of Arrakis all the while having to apese the spicing guild no spice no power and it goes up each time, they are the true rulers....[b]DON'T TRUST THE FAT MAN![/b] each ruler has a personality but i can honestly say house Harkonnen is just a gross slimy Jabba the Hutt's turd looking MF 

Combat is not like a mass army management its smaller squads fighting close to your own villages or enemy villages some which may be defended by the local denizens and you need to keep an eye on your troops while they fight as the further out you engage while in enemy or neutral territory the more supplies it costs and your troops can die from exposure combat out in the desert is risky and can attract a sand worm to swallow you all up which can be used to your advantage if you are paying attention that is.

+ ""It just works"" -- smooth gameplay and no obvious bugs that I found. I like the polish that this game already has. The UX/UI design in this game is awesome. Whoever designed the gameplay interface is an obvious genius. Feels like everyone who worked on this game just retired from years on Apple's design team. That being said, the competition in this area is very weak -- looking at you Paradox & Amplitude. 

- The gameplay is a little too slow for me. The key to civ, humankind, ck3, hoi4, etc. is that you always have a progress bar ticking somewhere, or you always feel like you're trying to keep several plates spinning at the same time. That sense of urgency and dynamic/chaotic progress is missing, except for the very early game. To put it bluntly, the game hasn't quite gotten the ""One More Turn..."" vibe yet. I will play on smaller maps in the future to try and spark earlier conflicts. I think the default map may have been too big. Or the rate of change for authority needs to go up. Something needs to change to make me feel like I'm making faster progress. Right now I'm sitting on my hands doing nothing for too long in the mid to late game. 
- Please do not make me micromanage my harvesters. It adds no value to the game for me to have any manual interaction with the harvesters during sandworm events. It becomes a small annoyance once you have 5 or 6 spice fields. Clicking the redeploy button is not a strategic or tactical decision, nor does it add color or story. It's just filler. I should only care about manually intervening when enemy units come and attack.

It needs polishing in the UI, and at first can be hard to determine what you need. I restarted a few times before I really understood the resources. Other than that, the biggest issue I've hit is that the AI far outclasses your best intentions very quickly, and the way that they are able to recover from battles & attack again in rapid succession feels very off, especially with how long it takes for the player to rebuild lost military. 

If you also pay attention to their resources (at least the ones that can be traded) they produce resources at an astounding rate, which even with the best planned villages I couldn't manage to recreate as early on as they can. This is definitely partially because the AI knows exactly what it needs to do and I'm still a novice player, but worryingly may also be inherent to the game. That being said, they only seem to really outshine in Solaria and Plascrete (currency and production resources) & constantly request Intel or Influence (in the early game at least.)

I love the asymmetry of the different starting houses but it needs to be better balanced. Fremen4life but I do hope to see more of the asymmetrical-but-equal aspects. I've only played Smugglers and Fremen so I can't say how annoying the Atreides inability to pillage is. I'm also very bad with airports and deployment, which makes Fremen ideal if you suck at RTS airdrops, but the Fremen really should have a better time surviving the desert if they are the only house that can't air drop. Worm travel is cool and can help in a pinch, and strategic deployment is nice when you do get the ability to reload the thumpers. I definitely used worms to swing on Carthag and Arrakeen.

Since I've only played Smugglers and Fremen, the Landsraad council was a big disappointment in early game. By mid to late game, I was able to outvote on some big decisions that did ultimately help me attack my opponents bases without any defense on their part... Atreides legit had a 6-man army a territory away and did not defend their own base (maybe ten Fedaykin was overkill?)

The destruction of the enemy bases is glitched out (at least for me.) I had the same thing happen with Conan Exiles when I would die - the screen freezes until any effects are mainly over. I assumed this was console specific since I played Conan on PS4, and they did patch it on both PC and PS4. Same thing on a domination victory - the victory screen stuttered a bunch, and really it wasn't that much fanfare for a victory screen. I would have liked a little more here, and maybe some better endgame content.

I do recommend it for what it is, and I really hope that they do take criticisms and fix some of the less fun aspects, because the game looks great and it can be hard to quit - it's still early access & the point of early access is to playtest and fix the weak parts, so I wanna believe that they will.",1653053762,1653312250,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a fan of the book series its clear that they paid great attention to detail to the lore and world. I love how they implemented things like CHOAM and the Landsraad as critical game play mechanics. Further each faction's abilities are based off of those that are represented in the books. That said I wish that they went a little bit further, adding faction specific victory conditions, i.e. Fremen develop their terraforming plan by building specific buildings in specific regions, Harkonen's Eliminate House Atreides and hold a certain number of Landsraad influence, ect.

The art styling is fantastic. It's clearly inspired by the movie, but not to the point that everything is ripped off wholesale. They keep their own style and its beautiful. 

I did encounter a few bugs in my short time, mostly minor but bad enough I had to exit the game and log back in to fix it. It's my hope and belief that these will be hammered out soon.

It plays well enough already as a single player experience. You can give it your full attention with the worthy soundtrack or half-ass it with a TV series: most 4X gamers enjoy both intensities and this game works for either.

I've had one lock-up in 35hrs, this has been the only tech hitch apart from occasional frame drops where the devs need to fire up a profiler and smooth out the wrinkles.  I've hit a few gameplay bugs here and there. The most fun one was discovering I could delete sandstorms by having my armies use airports in a way that created flightpaths through them. Second place favourite bug is the oppression spam for the gingers. Might be a feature, but if so, it needs a balance pass.

My most significant gripe is quite minor (in the context of this being (EA, v0.19): the micromanagement of sending harvesters back out is 100% chore. It adds nothing. I can imagine the design claim being something like. ""...it is an 'immersive loop component' necessary to experience the annoyance of your spice mining being cucked by Shai-Halud.""  
Nope.
Nor will it be part of a meaningful skill gap in multiplayer.
Please add a button for auto-redeploy to go alongside the auto-retrieve button.

Overall I get the impression the devs fully respect the material they're working with: the heavy mantles of 4X/RTS history and Herbert.
They probably also play Twilight Imperium. The approach to Lansraad diplomacy gave me vibes. There's no conceit about whether or not you're at war, backed up by mechanical limitations and gates, you just manage synergies and kill and negotiate and deal with consequences until you've won. I am struggling to think of a better system that matches its game better, mechanically or narratively, in the history of single player 4X (of which I have experienced the vast majority, on PC at least).

1605220,115728022,76561197992641909,0,7,2145,0,440,1654241157,"First let me say that I love Dune and this game DOES show promise and COULD be one of the best Dune games in history... if they're willing to make some pretty huge changes, because it has many fundamental flaws at the moment. Below is a tl;dr, followed by my very long critique.

tl;dr: This is currently a fairly simple, tedious, and forgettable 4X with a slew of underdeveloped features, a lackluster UI, and numerous strange thematic decisions (see below). The game could be great, but I find it unlikely to receive the breadth of changes that it needs to save it from its current mediocrity.

1. This game has a LOT of different resources (solari, spice, water, plascrete, and many many more). While not inherently a bad thing, the UI has them scattered across your screen, many of them in different areas and in varying font sizes. I understand they attempted to group them with their related areas of the game (intelligence near the agent menu, solari near the spice slider, etc), but they should really all just be listed across the top of the screen in the same font size.

2. The UI does not have any single area where you can quickly look at all of your villages, their buildings, and their micro-economies. For example, if you own 5, 10, or even more villages, the only way to manage each of them is just to sweep around the map manually selecting each one. And even when selected, the village doesn't easily present you with its economic status. This game badly needs economic menus and tabs, similar to Stellaris or Civ, that lists all of your villages in a menu with the most important stats summarized, with additional stats available via mouseover.

3. Trading and diplomacy need some serious improvements. If a rival tries to trade with you, there is no opportunity to make a counteroffer: you either take the trade as-is or decline it, which incurs diplomatic (relations) penalties. And diplomacy is almost non-existent in this game. There are only a few treaties, two of which provide some passive economic bonuses and the third which basically just allows you to travel through a rival's territory. As far as I can tell there is currently no way to really make solid alliances or more nuanced trade agreements.

4. Combat is honestly a joke. There is extremely little unit diversity, microing is next to impossible/pointless, and the units just run into each other and attack until they fall over. Units have some entirely forgettable passive effects and military advancement is fairly simple. Military victories are usually a tedious grind in any 4X, but they are doubly so here. You'll notice this point is much shorter than all the others, and that's because combat is so shallow in this game that there's virtually nothing else I can say about it.

5. I understand that this is a 4X and not an RTS, but if you're going to make your 4X real-time and not turn-based, there should be a significant amount of the game that leverages and takes advantage of that choice. Right now the only real consequence of being real-time is that you have roughly a 5-10s window to recall your spice harvesters after you get a worm warning. But you can also freely pause the game at anytime, which you'll often find yourself doing during trades, council voting, building management, and basically any time you're doing anything and don't want to risk missing alerts. Debate all you want about whether 4Xs are better as real-time or turn-based games, but as it is now there is virtually no mechanical reason or design feature that justifies this game being real-time, especially with combat in its current state.

6. Council voting is currently extremely underwhelming and far too frequent. It all just blurs together after awhile, to the point I frequently find myself ignoring it because I just don't care. Don't get me wrong, some of the effects are powerful, but they rarely feel substantial or exciting. It's just kind of a boring and too-frequent mechanic.

7. The tech tree is pretty weak, with under 40 techs in the entire game. Each faction has a few unique techs, which is nice, but with even moderate knowledge income you'll end up researching all the techs you want every game. There are also a few techs that seem absolutely mandatory while many others are entirely forgettable.

8. Operations/missions balance is non-existent. Supply Drops are so insanely good for 100 intelligence you should just be spamming them all game and in every battle. These need rebalanced badly.

9. Ornithopters, while thematic, are implemented in about as boring a way as possible. They're basically scouts from Civ, which doesn't sound too bad, except that they can't be attacked by anything. This removes any opportunity for counterplay and any incentive/need to be careful/crafty with scouting dangerous territory; you basically just turn them on auto-recon every game and forget about them. There's almost no reason to manually micro them.

10. Speaking of manual vs. automatic options: turn on auto-recall on your harvesters. I know, I know: ""but mah income, it says it will produce less spice!"" Yes, true, it produces about FIVE percent less spice while removing one of the only things you manually have to micromanage. Slipping up and losing even one harvester will lose you far more than 5% of your income. For this to even be a real consideration, it should be at least a 20% penalty of spice income.

11. Now that we're talking about harvesters, let's talk about worms. You know, THE iconic monster of the Dune universe. As it is, yes, they do what worms do: occasionally try to show up and munch a harvester or military units blindly autoattacking each other in the middle of the desert, but that's it. There are no cool spontaneous worm events, no variety, nothing. You just let your harvesters auto-recall and make sure your idiot soldiers don't fight in the middle of sand dunes and you will literally never see a worm the entire game, which is a shame because they look great when they do show up. They are currently just too easy to avoid. They should trigger more often and with far less of a delay, especially in deep desert areas.

12. Where are the Bene Gesserit? Arguably THE most powerful and influential faction in the entire Dune universe, the group that orchestrated all of the events of the books, is weirdly absent. There are practically no Bene Gesserit mechanics: no events, no unique currency, no options in diplomacy, nothing. The only evidence of them at all are a couple councilors and the occasional agent with the randomly generated Bene Gesserit trait. Pretty poor representation of this absolutely iconic group.

13. The AI is bad. Like BAD bad. Like worse than Civ 6 AI at launch bad. Frequently their units just kind of run around in small groups of 2 or 3 doing very little. And if you go for a military victory, you'll frequently see the enemy units running around the map trying to capture villages or just sitting completely still instead of coming to defend their main base, remaining idle all the way until their base is destroyed and they lose the game. The AI needs a complete overhaul, because it is currently extremely easy to exploit or ignore entirely.

In summary, this game has potential, and a solid foundation, it really does, but it needs overhauled in several areas and considerably more development time to deepen the gameplay and really commit to the theme. However, I find it far more likely to launch largely in its current state, and if that happens, I am sadly confident it will be just another dead and forgotten 4X within six months of its launch, and another squandered opportunity with the Dune IP that is just begging to be done right.",1653042002,1653129306,False,3,0,0.515488505363464355,0,True,False,True

It purposely holds back the player so the computer can catch up and native enemies will attack you much more  than the computer as well as worms have a tendency to ignore enemies over your minions and it gets worse the more powerful you become. 
Game definitely needs a campaign mode, Current houses need a re-balance of perks because smugglers skills are just pathetic. Game does not explain all the skills, where they are or how to use them. You just have to figure it out for yourself.
No reply value, after 10 hours you will find there is no real reason to play the other Houses due to the balance issues and  even if you get far ahead of the computer it will bog you down so that it has time to catch up; there is no point in improving if you are punished for doing so.

============
Paracompass => Spectral Imagine is useless atm / I would never research it in any of my tactics 
Send diplomacy = Economic Lobbing +/- the same for any faction
Gold and Plascrete is the least needed resources if you play it right. (Agreed with that just a bit more balance as most of my ""endspile games"" gold is overflow.
As well ornitopters should be more useful second half of the game
Spying mastery never researched. 
Combat drones or any mechanical unit should be without supply drain (as it is for the Harkonnen)
Too much is depending on the map random.  

The game is still great! Thank you. Just wanted to make it better as much as I could.

The four current factions all feel pretty distinct in playstyle, though I'd prefer to see just a little more flair and distinction among military units.  Aside from copy-pasted military units with slightly different abilities, the factions all feel like they play differently, asymmetrically balanced, which is always great to see.

What I really like about the game is that it seamlessly blends turn based elements with a real time ""things are happening while you're distracted"" mechanic.  In single player by mid game it gets pretty tricky to manage all the layers: economic, diplomatic, espionage and military, but the pause button is a crutch.

 I love 4x games and I love RTS games. Sadly, I feel like this is too slow for an RTS and has no real 4X basis due to some of the game limitations. The random generation was somewhat poor as there were several times I simply could not find the basic resources that are needed within the early game limits for early game buildings. I feel like going for a standard 4X more in line with Civ or more in line with an RTS style with constant income instead of 'timed' incomes.

I really wanted to like it. I don't think it's necessarily think it's a bad game, but I cannot recommend it as it is.

Now, aside from not liking the gameplay, which can be considered a personal preference, I dislike some UI elements.
When it comes to a new player starting out any game I don't think the player should have to read through multiple menus to find simple information.

Lore accurate game, and something that brought me into the universe of DUNE.

I like this direction, personally, and feel 4X is a great genre to explore the setting in, but I didn't come into the game expecting a continuation of the old RTS's, so keep that in mind if you're considering buying this. Know what it is you're getting, because most of the negative reviews and feedback seem to come from people disillusioned with the game based on what they were expecting to be a continuation of those games. I've even see some people refer to those old games as the ""original games"", as if they're the origin of the Dune franchise and this is a direct continuation of them, but it just really isn't. Separate devs, different studio entirely, different genre entirely, really no connection to the old Westwood games at all except for the setting, so if that's what you're hoping for you may well be disappointed.

One gripe that I have with the game is that there are very few units, and little unit variety. I really hope to see more units in the future.

I like the implementation of the politics in the game but the seemingly have taken full control of the game as there is basically no rts in the game. If they were to swap that and have the game as a rts with elements of politics this game would be fantastic I think but to move yourax army of 5 little groups or single people around is just pathetic. Being able to build only 5 buildings per village (only after you pay to upgrade for the extra 2 or 3) is just stupid. In my opinion this game should be more of an rts and it would florish.

For me, the combat needs more variety. I support vehicles, but would be happy with additional  infantry if it achieves a more varied combat experience.

Pro:

True to Dune: Big Dune fan (books, RTS games, movie), if you are any of those things you'll like the setting. It does very good service to the lore.

Optimization: I've never played an early access game that ran so finished. Game loads fast and no bugs that I have seen.

Resource Management: Arrakis is an unforgiving planet- its expensive to expand, develop and run a military. Slight changes to a balanced economy can be range from an annoyance to a massive burden to your strategy.

Politics: Being able to screw over a militarily superior force by targeting them with additional burdens (increased cost to field an army etc). Got plenty of water? Vote for a water tax and cripple your opponents. I've played a lot of 4x games with politics but I generally ignore, economy and military are more important, but politics could ruin you in Dune. 

Spies: Infiltrate your enemy, organisations or at the local level. Sabotage enemy equipment when they come to attack or force a ceasefire. Same with politics, I like that you can't ignore this.

Situational strategy: You might come across another spice field early in game, you'll need to save your manpower to crew the harvester rather than hire militia to protect your town or raise more troops. Settlements around you might have weak wind speeds and you're struggling for water you'll need to change tactics again. Where you start can put you at an advantage or disadvantage, and can alter your overall strategy.

Con:

No Story: There is no story or single player campaign.

Single Player Skirmish only: You generate a circular map with maybe 20 zones, your main base appears near a spice field and try to beat the AI. The game is very limited and specific. It feels like a demo, which I guess is what an Early Access game is.

No Multiplayer: No multiplayer.

Limited units and tactics: Ground infantry only. Game mechanics aren't beneficial enough to have melee, ranged blends of units-  Best to produce top tier melee infantry only. The angry mob build never lets you down.

I am in favour of vehicles.

Old fan of the RTS games so I was expecting a military focus, but with so many other things to do it looks like military has been sidelined for now.  But we've been promised more untis so we'll see how we go.",1652075652,1652787188,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Highly focused on delivering a good, thematic 4X where constant pressure to produce spice forces all factions to grow, but due to their unique abilities they will have different methods of doing so. Resources are often tight and small shifts in power can cause a cascade of change where stabilizing your economy takes a lot of effort (and in the same way can cause your opponents to collapse if you destabilize them properly).

I enjoyed the feeling of a small scale real time 4X, as well as the well realized Dune setting.

Some of the mechanics feel inconsequential such as the landsraad. Even the game's 4 factions feel too similar to each other.

Biggest issue I have is with stuttering which I've pinned to when select units via drag box and sometimes just random in later games with large maps.  This really hurts the smoothness that experienced elsewhere throughout the game.  I've played every faction at least a few hours and here's my general assessment. 

I believe the Freman should have quicker resupply of the thumper as the other factions can easily move throughout the entire map as long as they have an airfield.  Maybe I just dont understand the meta with their caravan unit yet and maybe it's intentional but it definitely hinders them. 

I understand the masochist boys like their numbers, but they get at max 6 militia in their towns while the other factions get 4? I get you can get some specialized militia and buff militia but damn that really adds up when playing on higher difficulties.  - Through testing I believe the Ai only builds 4 militia (at least on hard)

My wish/suggestion to the devs are to make the Units models smaller, its visually hard to see a good fight when there 4 models/armies overlapping each-other on small bedrock areas.  My smaller wish is to field more units, its a good amount right now but more is better. 

The procedural maps help for replayability, though its pretty much the same layout in terms of faction placement, they do manage to randomize all resources (to a degree) and Landmarks. 

Freman and Scavenger Elite units are too similar and although its intended they perform differently than the other 2 ""organized"" factions, it hurts them more than helps them. - Through testing Scavenger Free Militia are op when combined with a full army. 


-Have yet to figure out the Freman Strat but very different faction mechanics flowing here.

This game is fundamentally a gestalt of an RTS with a 4X, and succeeds at both ends of that spectrum.  It can be exciting and tense during battles, and often throws enough at the player to make moments feel overwhelming, yet gives breathing room in other moments to allow thoughtful consideration, such as making a decision towards which research project to pursue.

At this stage, the game is limited to the player against 3 AI opponents, and is a contest for control of the planet.  There are multiple avenues for victory, in tune with its 4X influence.  Each faction does have their own ""feel"" to them, and requires variance in playstyle.  Although a full single-player campaign is promised, the game doesn't suffer much without it.  Much of the reason this review recommends this title as enthusiastically as it is doing has to do with the ""core gameplay loop"" - i.e., the actual playing of this game is fun.  That's it.  The time spent by the player to sort this real-time puzzle out is deeply entertaining.

The game is also a breath of fresh air for those who are enthusiasts of Frank Herbert's work.  Not merely content to ride the coat-tails of the 2021 movie's popular reception (which this review will not criticize - the movie was refreshingly well done), Spice Wars is far more attuned to the novel itself.  The designers were likely truly familiar with Frank Herbert's work.  The inclusion of the Smugglers as a playable choice, and a lack of ""House Ordos"" (which never existed in any of Herbert's six Dune novels) makes this title feel like a faithful use of the license.  Small issues persist, such as the pluralization of Fremen into ""Fremens"" in one audio clip which slurs the experience a bit, but supposedly, this is what early access is meant to flush out.  It's jarring to a fan of the book, but doesn't come close to being a dealbreaker.

The game feels custom-made for a sublime and thriving multiplayer experience.  One does not yet exist, but it is plainly intended to.  Hold this space.

There are multiple additional factions that could fit well into this game - the Bene Gesserit, Bene Tleilax with their face dancers, even the Emperor's own House Corrino and their Sardaukar legions.  The possibility of expansion is promising.

The game as it exists right now (early access) will suffer from long-term loss of interest.  There is replayability here, but it isn't infinite.  The campaign will clearly help, as will new factions, but a well-crafted multiplayer mode will be required to keep this game flush with players.  It is here that the designers must take care not to drop the ball.  That said, this game delivers a polished, fun, and unique experience for a discounted pricetag.

This game IS early access, so any review must be written with caution, but this title does not feel like there is a threat of over-hype and under-delivery (e.g. Cyberpunk 2077, and early days of No Man's Sky).  Taken on faith of what has been presented so far, this game delivers an excellent game for the money, and seems likely to deliver more down the road.  Very well done, and strongly recommended.

- Painfully slow game play
- Strayed too far from the genre that made the franchise popular
- Over complicated systems with a UI that doesn't really provide much feedback or 'clear' guidance
- The team made some very 'questionable' design decisions

I've loved and played the Dune games to death. Unfortunately this one lands a bit too far off the mark for me. I love the lore and visual styling of the game, it looks great. But I think they should've tried to get a bit closer to the genre that made the franchise so successful/popular. Perhaps even taking some ques from Northgard - I think that might have been the happy medium.

I found the game play itself painfully slow. The interface and in game controls aren't especially intuitive and any guidance given isn't clear. The quests that I assume are there to teach you the basics fail to communicate exactly how to do whatever it is asking you to do and I was left hunting for buttons or info on how to do stuff. There is very little feedback to let you know if you're doing something correctly or not - even simple tasks like moving units around.

Also, I really dislike the unit scaling. Towns are really small, refineries are the same size as the towns. Your units are giants and 10x the size of towns. The worms are either big enough to swallow an entire town OR about the size of a horse when compared to your units... Doesn't affect game play at all, but it's just a styling decisions/direction that I personally hate.

I'm not going to say this is a bad game. I personally wouldn't really class it as a 'Dune' game as it has strayed too far from the true RTS style that made it so popular. If you prefer the slower Civ style games then it might be for you. But if you're expecting a 'Dune' game, then I think you'll be disappointed.

I will be following the development and jumping back in from time to time to see what changes have been made - but at this stage, I don't think it's one for me.",1652614008,1652614008,False,9,0,0.513870358467102051,0,True,False,True

Combat is straight forward and simple. Worms are almost non-existent and when they do appear they are very easy to avoid (you don't need to monitor your harvesters, I have yet to see a worm attack one). I played Fremen and they have the ability to call and ride a worm. I didn't see any tutorial on how to do so, so I called one. My guys jumped into the ground when the worm appeared and then it disappeared and they were def not riding a worm. It's fun, don't get me wrong, I played for 4 hours straight, but in my opinion worms need to be a bigger threat, and riding worms either isn't working or needs a tutorial.

I spend more time, worrying about event countdowns than anything. These events are just annoying and ruin the game for me. I find myself “working”, rather than “playing”. 

The game does not pause when you are prompted to make decisions relating to espionage or politics, making these events extremely annoying when you are busy managing something else. I find myself just right clicking to close notification messages from other houses. These communications are pointless, they add nothing to how the houses interact with me, plus there is no option for me to respond to their comments. You quickly get the feeling that these events are better suited for a turn based game, not an RTS game. 

The unit cap is a joke, in most cases you must protect a vast area with only 15 units, you spend most of the time flying them around to protect villages. If you wanted a game like Dune II, this is not it. There's no wall building, or any fortification building apart from the slow firing turrets, which also cost a full building slot? All villages have the same building slot limit, so the rock/geography does not play any part to how you plan out your villages. 

The strategy of Building and protecting assets is completely missing.  Again, I feel very disconnect from the land and what’s on the ground. Troops move like zombies, you ask them to go from point A to B, they will walk through storms and deep dessert and die. They will not walk around any danger to get to the target. Think of them like lemmings with swords/guns. If there is a worm sign, your troops won’t seek rock, they stand there waiting to be eaten. In all, I spend most of the game with my palm to my face, frustrated, trying to enjoy it.

If you are looking for a remake of the old RTS games you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a unique and complex 4X game you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an immersive experience on Arrakis as Frank Herbert created it, you will be disappointed and perhaps irritated as you watch your conventional troops walk across open desert while Fremen fly around in ornithopters searching for profit on behalf of their goddess queen Liet. 

You might like it if you like patiently watching your bar go from 0% to 100% as you scan/harvest whatever, or waiting for soldiers who are more or less indistinguishable from each other resolve a slow sandy slap fight. You might like it better if you never read the book so it doesn't seem odd when Leto takes a Harkonnen trade deal the first turn.
 
The quest for a deep immersive Dune 4X experience goes on as unfortunately the best available is still an old mod for Civ4. Early access or not the design seems set and its unlikely this shapes up to be anything more than a Dune novelty to be sold for $3 in a year or so.

Captures the themes of the original book pretty well - skulduggery, spying, warfare both guerrilla and otherwise.

The planet is itself a character in the game by which I mean you are constantly having to consider the environmental effects of Arrakis in almost every decision. On Arrakis you waste nothing that gives water.

Beautiful graphics, taking cues from the 2021 film while still being its own thing.

Not afraid to show the influence of earlier Dune properties, eg the opening chord of the loading cinematic brings to mind the theme by Toto for the Lynch movie, the musical cue for one of the UI windows to me borrows from Frank Klepacki's score for Dune II, there are probably more but in general it sounds familiar to a pleasing degree.

There is an elegance to how this game works: essentially you are trying to balance six different kinds of numbers, and going all-in on one will mean you start losing the others very quickly. The AI is for me quite challenging, probably because I play Atreides in the manner they operate in the books - a balanced mixture of spice mining, diplomacy, aggressive spycraft and military power, forgetting of course that they get rinsed in the space of a few days.

Negatives:

Audience expectations will probably work against this game, which is not its fault: it is not an RTS-type rugby scrum of Siege Tanks in the middle of the map, nor are there any cheeseball FMV cutscene shenanigans. TO be frank it is probably a little bit low on Action Depicted On-Screen - most of the political stuff happens off-screen so you only see it through tiny green or red icons hovering at the edge of the screen. If I say this is more like a board game than a war game I mean to praise it but some players might be disappointed with that. It is still in Early Access so the UI text could use a polish, there are framerate drops in Directx mode and of course there is no multiplayer mode at the time of writing, although I believe this is due pretty soon.

In conclusion: for fans of the books it is about as theme-y as a game can get without getting into Frank Herbert's particular political idiosyncrasies or any of the psychic/precognition stuff. I think you could call this a ""secular"" adaptation since spice is just something you harvest to stop the Sardaukar murdering you rather than the thing you use to chart the webs of the future.",1652377094,1652377094,True,2,0,0.502645492553710938,0,True,False,True

Here are some of the things I hope to see:

- RNG: The randomize map does create an advantage / disadvantage based on where certain resources spawn or if you get one of the special tiles close enough to you. 
- Resource management: yes this is the DUNE world and things are scarce but I would love to test and see if this could be fixed by making the max number of buildings 7 instead of 5.
- Unit AI: sometimes they just sit there as I'm trying to either take over a village or liberate and they literally just chill next to an enemy unit (without the cease fire operation activated)
- Utlity of ornithropter: Yes you explore with these and then you can pluck them onto your harvester but they really feel a bit useless, especially with the auto explore option.  Build - set to auto - forget.  I'm not sure what the solution is for this tho because I do not want to micro manage this unit but maybe provide an improvement or enhancement where it serves a different purpose late game
- DOMINATION Victory is significantly more difficult than other victory paths.

However it seems to add a lot of mechanical complexity in the shape of Diplomacy, the Landsraad council, agents/operations as well as the research tree. At the same time there is no population management mechanic anymore - this does make sense of course since Spice Wars attempts a more large scale strategy. 

Coming from Northgard a lot of this is a welcome change of pace. There is less micromanagement of the population which frees up more time for grand strategy. The economy and resource management is different which takes some getting used to. For example you will just want to build plascrete factories everywhere. Literally. 

I feel like the game is at its best when you're engaging in a protracted war back and forth and trying to push your boundaries, raid the enemy faction and consolidate gains while supporting with special operations. On the other hand diplomacy feels entirely perfunctory to me, not fleshed out at all and barely even functional. Want to sign a peace treaty or ally with someone? I didn't find a way to make that happen. So expect to have to treat every faction as an enemy.

Furthermore much of the action takes place in abstract menus and tables where there are endless text description to read about what each technology, building or Landsraad resolution actually does. Sure, this can all be learned in time but it's not very intuitive. In Northgard the amount of abstract text-reading was kept much more limited, which I prefer. Dune: Spice Wars seems to throw a lot of tedious management in text menus at the player, which can feel like busywork that only distracts from the actual gameplay. At the same time, really important in game events like rebellions and invasions are sometimes hard to even notice because of the lack of a minimap and lack of proper alert messages. How about adding some voice messages to these very important notifications?

Overall the game is a more mechanically complex cousin of Northgard, set in the sci fi deserts of Dune. The game takes a while longer to learn than Northgard and gets a bit too abstract at times. It also seems to burden the player with a certain amount of unnecessary management work that distracts from the actual strategy layer.

Good game with a lot of potential, the different factions are fun to play and their units whilest being uniq to the faction, have simmilar battlefield roles, which makes learning a new faction easier.

Writing this after I have gotten all the achievements. Its the same basic ingredients as Northgrad around game play with tweaks for putting you on a desert planet. It is not designed to be a quick game, multiplayer may will change that. 

 If your a purist for either books or movie there will be things in the game that annoy you. But it draws on both and there are some nice easter eggs  if you know what to look for. (PS if your the smugglers miss the bribe three times and the emperor sends you a present).

I love the Dune series and was so excited when I saw this game that I bought it with little to no research (I read about what kind of game it was while it was installing).  Going in almost blind, it had something of a learning curve but it's very quick to pick up on if you play games like Civilization.  Actually, that's how I would describe this game in its current state: real time Civ with little unique elements thrown in to help create the Dune experience such as sandworms that will pop up and eat your units if they are running around on the sand too long.  While there are only 4 playable factions at the moment, I think they each have unique enough elements that make them all feel different from each other.  So far Fremen are my favorite just because they have the ability to ride the sandworms but each is fun in their own way.  I love the graphics, they have an illustrative quality to them with vibrant and warm colors.  Audio quality sounds fine to me, can't really find anything to critique there.  For me the only thing to get used to was the UI.  I learned recently that pressing ""i"" on your keyboard will bring up an overlay that shows a lot of useful info for each region.  I'm really looking forward to what they add to this game, especially if that includes a single player campaign that coincides with the books.  I will scream in a chorus of excitement with the collective voices of my ancestors if we get a God Emperor of Dune campaign.  Also looking forward to possible additional factions.

How is the performance in its EA state?
- No lag or any FPS drops even after going 10+ hours in a single game (Achievement hunting)
- Very smooth launch state, we have to see how it handles mods. Currently it is beyond other 4x EA launches in this department.

Are there any mods?
- None in the current state of the game
- Devs have stated they will add them if players want them. So expect them to be relevent like any good 4x game as I believe this is going to be demanded by community members like myself.

How many bugs have I found?
- I had only two very minor bugs in my first game which was over 10 hours long. And I was trying to break things by testing every thing I could. I reported both easily in the ESC menu with a convient in game bug report.
- No need to go to external links, entire report is done in the ESC menu without interrupting your play through! Which is surprisingly not as common as it should be in EA titles.

Other FAQ based on other 4X games which some buyers might want to know:
- Can the game be played without any time limit? Yes, even after winning you can continue

-Is there enough content for a EA launch? Short---Long answer YES --- if you care more about the dune universe itself and less just a great 4x game then its a solid maybe instead. If you are a fan of Dune you might be disappointed till they add more lore and voice acting/interactions that bring the world to life more.

- Is this game an RTS? This is where some negative reviews have been coming in. It is a pausable RTS, so your gameplay will have the pace of a TBS while maintaining the smoothness of a RTS. Unless you do not pause the game, so ignore the reviews complaining about a slow gamepace. YOU set the pace.

TLDR: Game is in EA what some games are when they have their full release as of recent years. With mods and some content updates I would exspect a thriving 1.0 launch, and many great hours in EA till then.

This game has a HUGE potential!!!
I closed all achievements of this game, and want to describe last game.
Insane difficulty, hegemony victory.
It was good until I understand that all 3 AIs are focused on me.
Probably there is a need for rework in AI, because all three focused their operations, attacks, politics etc vs ME! Game was about 3 hours long, and 90% of this time, I was forced to travel from one point to another on my territory to fight rebellions, to fight AIs who start to attack my border AT THE SAME TIME!
GOD, this was so huge a waste of time... but I made it, now I may sleep in peace with knowing that I made it all^^
Suggesting you to try this 'early access' it is good, but there are still issues in balance of fractions, lack of units, lack of balance between economy and science. At early game you are focused on lacking of each resource with any new territory, late game you are faced with TONS of resources due to huge income because of science research.

A decent strategy game, with mechanics that prevent rushing, a number of resources to balance(and not in an annoying way), and a decent AI(though it does have a few hiccups).

Bad
The one bug I've encountered is the frame rate is unlimited or at least tries to be which can causes problems running other programs(ex: a podcast in the background). This can be fixed by with software from your graphics card manufacturer to manually limit the frame rate, which may take an hour or two to find if you haven't done it before.

Definitely needs the multiplayer as I could see myself and my friends trading blows with how the systems work. More specifically, the political, intrigue, and combat are geared toward thwarting or complicating situations between players. 

Example: Using a combination of revolts in far off territories, the enemy player may be preoccupied while I am able to sneak in a quick-attack force to either conquer, liberate, or pillage their village, thereby crippling their spice flow if the territory has spice in it (which is quite crippling as spice is the most important resource).

The game definitely reminds me of board games (which is why I am excited for MP). I can definitely tell the Dune board game by Gale Force 9 was an inspiration (such as with the faction colors and other mechanics).

While I do recommend the game I also acknowledge that it could be so much better with some quite easy to implement changes. While I mainly focus on things that could be improved there still is a lot that I like about the game.

I've played the game on all map sizes, on all difficulties except easy and on all factions except Harkonnen. Here are my thoughts on some aspects of the game and how I think they could be improved. 

VISUALS
The game looks great, gotta love those sand dunes. The sand storms are cool, and I wish there was bigger version of them, a rare colossal storm that would sweep across the whole map. Also, perhaps we could get more variation in the landscape? Just some more cliff and hill types, special regions and landscape features in general.

SPYING
I like the spying mechanics, but I would definitely like to see faction exclusive operations. The spy operations are one of the best places to make the factions feel different from each other, so why on earth are all the operations exactly the same for everyone? It's a brilliant opportunity to let the Harkonnen have more agressive, brutal actions, or give the Atreides a more noble feel, and just have the Smugglers have more smuggling and stealing operations. And. let the Fremen interact more with the Sietches and neutral villages. Also, how come I can't execute or ransom captured enemy agents?

FACTIONS
The basic gameplay is similar to every faction and while there are differences between them I feel like they should be taken even further apart. The biggest differences between the factions are how they interact with the Landsraad and the faction specific developments in the tech tree. Researching the faction specific developments can alter the basic gameplay quite a lot and I like that, but I wish there were more factors differentiating the factions.

WORMS
Worms are nice, but I want smaller and colossal worms as well.

AI
Well... let's just say that this needs improving.

The combat AI needs to be improved, really. The AI seems to set ""missions"" for their units and doesn't react well to anything going on around them. It's like they're blind to everything outside of their objective.

Voting on the Landsraad is problematic since the AI doesn't seem to compete against itself at all, the npc factions always seem to vote against the player, never really against each other.  Also, they always vote against the player on negative proposals even if it can't affect the player in any way, like ""+100% Landsraad losses from actions against other factions"" even if the player is playing Fremen, who doesn't even have a Landsraad standing at all.

Trading is a bit useless at the moment, except for the various agreements. The AI seems to always propose ridiculous trades, like ""Hey, I'll give you 200 Solari and you give me 200 Influence"" even though the player has 40k Solari in deposit with an income of +500 Solari and +30 Influence. The AI doesn't seem to really understand the value of each resource and simply know how much of each resource the player has.

The diplomatic flavor messages the AI sends you seem to be completely random most of the time. Like this smuggler guy, who multiple times told me ""Oh hey, you weren't using any of these resource fields so I took them, I hope you don't mind"". Dude! You haven't had an army for four months! I have had you completely surrounded for ages now. Jeez. And, then there was this really fat baron who repeatedly told me how he likes to squash me like a bug when his forces are being annihilated left and right, and he haven't had access to good food spices for months. Their situational awareness is almost completely zero. Sure, they laugh at you when your spice harvester gets eaten by a worm, but other than that they speak nonsense.

MAP GENERATION
I really love that it's procedurally generated and I would love to see more options to tweak the map generation, like have more/bigger deep desert areas and be able to adjust the rarity of special regions. Also, here's an idea, could the ""outside"" area of the map, where you can't go, just be completely covered in deep desert? It would let the players dare some risky moves, and to make them think twice you could increase the worm spawn chance in that area.

SOME RANDOM WORDS TO FINISH THIS OFF
I have so many thoughts about this game, mostly how much fun I've had and how it could be made even better. I hope the devs have it in their hearts to not just railroad us their vision of the game, but be willing to change and improve what they have built so far. I wish you all a good time.

Just keep gobbling up slices of land, and you'll do just fine, and win in the end. 
The interesting bit would then be how to win not just 80% of time, but 100%, as it seems impossible to make tactical mistakes or serious errors of judgement. Whatever mistake you make, you'll recover.

Resources?
After four or five times of playing, you'll have figured out how not to run out of resources.

Agents & spying on the other factions? 
Haven't had a need so far.

Armies? 
Barely necessary

Trade?
Not necessary

So you end up repeating the following cycle during the whole game:
- Capture a piece of land
- Click on points of interest
- Select which resolution to support/decline
- Redeploy harvesters after a sandworm was detected (if there's automatic redeploy after a sandworm, I must've missed it)
- Fight off a raid every once in  a while.
- Monitor if a siege has already become friendly towards you.

It feels at least 70-80% complete, is very stable, and I've experienced few if any bugs.  Not only does the game totally nail the Dune vibe and aesthetic, but it is a very exciting strategy game where the tension is palpable.  Sand worms are constantly on the prowl for your spice harvesters and military operations, spies are everywhere, your economy is a moderately complex juggling act, no one can be completely trusted, and just when you think you're on the brink of disaster, something good happens to keep you in the game.

For me the pacing of the game is perfect. There's a lot going on to keep track of, but unlike strategy games like Total War and the Hegemony series I never felt the frustration of information overload.  It's also worth mentioning that as with the Dune universe, brute military force is certainly an option, but far from the only option and often far from the best option.  Additionally, the four factions play very differently, probably more so than any strategy game I've tried, and this is completely in keeping with the Dune universe.      

The production values are excellent and put you right in the Dune universe.  Beautiful visuals, excellent music, sound effects, and voice acting.  The devs obviously love Dune, as evidenced by their attention to detail and touches from the books as well as the movies.  Speaking of sound, the devs deserve some kind of award for superior sound design, I've never experienced anything quite like it in a strategy game.  For example, zoom in on the ornithopters and you can hear the beating/twirling of their wings.  The sound contributes heavily to your immersion and the dark ambiance of the forbidding world of Arrakis.      

I know the legendary publisher Funcom has had their ups and downs, but at the end of the day they've given me three very special games that I love; The Longest Journey, The Secret World, and now Dune: Spice Wars. :D  At $30 dollars it's a steal, and as a Dune fan and knowing what I know now about the game, I would have paid twice that amount.  Not only does it work as a Dune game, but it's a great strategy game as well, with loving attention to detail in both aspects.  If this is what their late beta version looks like, I think we are in for a real treat with the official launch.  Highly recommended.

A bit bland and designed in a way that you could easily port over the core systems to an entirely different franchise easily(or was the reverse done with Northgard?). Here is my breakdown of some core systems:

Factions:
4 factions, with minor changes between each but are fundamentally identical in how you might play them. Some unique mechanics exist for each side, but can generally be ignored as each faction have identical victory conditions. This is...odd considering 2 factions aren't Houses of the Landsraad, and would have no formal relations at all with the Emperor.

Combat:
Combat is the most important and really only way to progress/expand in this game. All sides get 2-3 Melee style units, and 2-3 ranged units. Each faction plays almost exactly the same, with only a few opportunities to employ any strategy. Lots of melee units with one or two supporting/ranged units = win. All sides must use military to capture villages, including villages of local fremen who fight you if you're the Fremen.

Growth/Expansion:
All sides must use military to capture villages of Fremen, who you then force to produce resources for you. These villages are attached to a region that generally has a resource of some kind, or gives you a bonus in your production of a specific resource in that region. This even applies to the Fremen faction for some reason, with no additional mechanics existing to allow the neutral Fremen to join the Fremen faction without military conquest.
-Mention of the Sietch's is relevant here as well, as they are a neutral hidden village type location that raids nearby faction controlled villages to release them from servitude. This includes them making raids on the Fremen faction, to liberate the villages from....the Fremen.

Economy:
4-5 Resources to keep track of, that require certain buildings to be constructed to produce them. All sides require manpower, money, and water to produce units, and plasteel to construct buildings. Spice is a seconday resource that is required, but mostly to just generate income in the form of money. Yes, the most important resource in the entire universe is relegated to a secondary mechanic that mostly just generates income.

Overall, I'm feeling let down. The soundtrack isn't that amazing, the game design seems poorly thought out, and the factions are lifeless. The main elements that made Dune such a beloved series are almost completely missing as there is hardly any political intrigue or strategy involved. Where are the Bene Gesserit, or Bene Tleilax? Where is the Guild in all of this?

I don't think I'd be able to manage combat units with everything else going on in full swing anyways since infiltration, political bribes and voting, trading with your enemies, managing upkeep, dodging worms and sandstorms, trying to keep your military units alive long enough to get levels, defending your territory, signing treaties, catching resources with the flying scouting units, trying not to forget you left your military in depleting supply zones, kiting the enemy lines and raiding, being humiliated by bad decisions or RNG territory config and mountain terrain limitations (like Putin's reason for NATO) forcing to give up your resources to the enemy for needed supplies....

- Takes a deep breath -

...keeping track of where the other houses stand, trying to take opportunities in meeting prerequisites for events, satisfying the Emperor's tax (Sardaukars fkn reip son and they trash your shit like the mafia when your grocery store inverts on paying protection money), trying to force the other houses to attack each other and not you, dealing with the rebels, attempting to keep your agents from getting snatched while snatching theirs, managing the right research at the right time, trying not to expand territory to the point where you thin out or suffer transportation handicaps due to RNG map build in safe zone villages....

...and that's only 2 hours into the game from the tutorial point.

If the RTS combat military aspect leaned anymore towards the Westwood side I'd need a coop buddy +1 at minimum just to multi-task that.  It's a fine line Shiro Games is balancing to cross this kind of 4X management with real-time shenanigans.  Sure, I'll take more Westwood game-play any day and get muck'd up in Spice Wars happily, but I'm quite content so far if it doesn't turn up in later Early Access stages.

It's also a pretty much flawlessly executed EA release.  Not a single crash.  Low resolutions suffer UI clipping through the monitor, that's it.

That's.  It.  

Everything else runs smooth and looks great.  Art direction works.  It's colorful, which might be easier to manage in the long run with lots of activity happening in a tight space versus complaining about maybe the units needing to look more detailed.  I love the House representative behaviors and the music and sound production is stellar.

7.5/10: -1 for lacking a more Westwood Dune RTS action gameplay detail and unit types, focusing more on the Movie feel then the military detail that exists in the Books and Westwood games (even tho I'm pretty sure I'll be overwhelmed if I get my Westwoody wish anyways) and -0.5 for UI scaling, forcing me to play on more uncomfortable resolutions.  Units def look boring to me, but maybe if I could zoom in a bit more then the current max allowed.
EDIT [5/8/2022]: -1 Optimization late game starts to chug something fierce even with lower settings.  It is the result of seeing Combat Drones on your screen, perhaps the dust they generate isn't properly recycled in memory.

I'm not a 4X player at all.  This would be considered my first attempt at one.  It's not as complicated as the Paradox games and it's visually satisfying to execute in an RTS style field of gameplay.  The balance is very nice.  I can't say perfect because I have no 4X frame of reference.

Also the map generation:
I have yet to see a similar map config when starting a new game.  It looks seamless and natural and I love the elevations, the night day effects, the way the sand looks when the light hits it and the overal gameplay strategies that change due to land restrictions.  It's not about fair.  Dune isn't fair.  It's about surviving with what you got and taking what you need, looking for opportunities.  I must have restarted like 20 times so far just on a few decisions that shifted momentum, and I ain't even mad.  I deserved it and each time I did it, it always felt fresh because of the map RNG being so good.

One thing however. that I wish Shiro would improve is faction identity. Northgard's factions didn't enjoy much audio, or visual distinction, and that's fine. But Dune isn't Northgard. The factions have clear identities that, I'm afraid, are poorly brought to life here.

All the buildings and units are lacking distinctive flair, and the voice acting lacks alot of energy. Sure, the harkonan soldier has different lines, but it's all delivered so stale.

Firstof: The game is decent and it looks spectacular. There is no denying that. It also feels reasonably finished, this is not an early access alpha, but a well rounded, almost finished product. 

However: I refunded the game, the pacing feels wrong, infact several core concept don't agree with me.

The game is to slow for being a competitive multiplayer game and to fast for a grand strategy game. 
I honestly think the real-time-stop-and-go hurts the game. It should either be faster, or turn based. As it is now it just doesn't work, or atleast it didn't for me. 

The problem is, that several systems in the game are just like that. Army size, espionage, settlement management.... all of them simply don't click the same way they actully did in northgard.

Game runs very slowly and the mechanics are not well explained, very unbalanced at the moment. This game should be turn based not RTS.

Each of the four factions have different strengths and weakness. While you can win any way you want with each some winning conditions will be easier to pull off playing a specific faction.

Daemonhunters is a perfectly fine XCOM-like... but nothing in my library has fascinated me like this game. While trying Chaos Gate for the first time I was tapping my foot in anticipation of coming back to this.
I'm not gonna do a bulleted review of the features because it's all over gaming media, if you're reading reviews you already know what this game is about. 
What I find really intriguing is the pressure level of this game.  More intense, action focused titles have emotional peaks and valleys (Dark Souls comes to mind as the obvious example), whereas slower titles can drift down into drudgery between points of interest...
This game, while rather relaxing, tbh, maintains a constant pressure... it's not Major, but its steady, if that makes sense. There's *Always* something to do; something to decide on; something to push towards. I find myself consistently enjoying it (""relaxing"" is a fine term for this one, the more I consider it). When I get a chance (and I've frequently been Making chances), to play throughout the day, I always enjoy my time with it, I come away looking forward to playing more, later
For me this has become one of my reliable titles. Like, I might not even be in the mood for gaming, but I've got fifteen empty minutes, this one is gauranteed to be pleasant during that time. It's a steady dopamine drip instead of a sudden surge.

For a more objective take: It caters to Dune fans more so than those with a passing interest. (Per the novels Harkonnen should be dark blue, 0/10 stars). Stuff is 'missing'. No shields or lasguns. But it evinces the feeling of... specifically the first novel, extremely well.

PROs- Each faction brings different play style and victories easier to reach for example the green tribe will make it easier to win a diplomatic win. Also like the multiple ways they figured  out to win in the game. The spice feature is pretty cool depending on how well you can expand and get to the spice you can develop money fast or stockpile spice and trade it to other factions.

CONs- Assassination feature for taking out other factions take 3 stages to complete but each stage doesn't give any benefit toward completing it besides getting closer to the end game goal. They should at least get rid of the agents in one place or kill one of the 2 faction leaders assistants.
You should be able to make military alliances and coordinate attacks with allied factions as well.

Nevertheless, as I tend to with early access reviews, mostly for the developer's benefit, I'll focus my review on the things I hope to see improved.

Thoughts after my first couple of games:

- Unsurprisingly, this is a really well thought out game by the masterminds behind Northgard. I'm glad Shiro Games got their hands on this project. It's gorgeous, and I'm feeling the love on so many fronts. 

- Clarity needed in some areas on tool-tips (e.g. no explanation whatsoever that Fremen cannot build Water Extractor on the Polar Sink tile, and, either there are no spawn timers when building units or they're so well hidden that I missed them for 5 hours straight)

- On the RTS / 4X spectrum, this definitely leans further towards 4X than Northgard. I've got no problem with this, however it does result in a substantially longer, more Civilization-like game. I worry a little about the pace and potential of multiplayer when it becomes available, for that reason, unless there are plans to tweak the formula for MP. Most people don't want to play a 2-3 hour online session in my experience. We'll see what happens!

- I'm not sure about map size. I played on the default setting for my first couple of games (medium map), and it felt somewhat too much. It's more than possible to expand and acquire new territory, but it doesn't necessarily lend itself well to the limit of troops you'll have at any given moment. You'll hit a stage where you just can't be in two places at once, and you're trading territory. Even if you're acquiring faster than you're losing territory, it all starts to get a bit trivial in the end game when you can just throw excess resources into building tall rather than wide. Even building wide, there'll still be swathes of the map that won't get colonised once during the entire game. I'll revisit my thoughts here after playing the other map sizes.

- Similar to the tool-tip issue, can we get some clearer timers / sign-posting of buffs from vote outcomes / the politics system in general? 

- Loving what is there for the soundtrack - can we have more?",1651942138,1651942250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The 4X component is a bit superficial, with limited buildings, interactions, diplomacy, and spycraft. Yet, I love plotting out how best to expand to the more valuable regions on Arrakis, and feel a 'just one more turn' equivalent.

The RTS component is severely hampered by its lack of unit variety...and lack of units in general...Yet I love defending sietches, and how best to fortify border regions.

The four factions do have some notable differences when you're playing them, but I've never really felt I needed to change my gameplan depending on who I have on my periphery...And yet, I do feel fundamentally different playing as Fremen versus Harkkonnen, etc.

-Better mechanisms than in CIV (any civ)
-Better management than in Rise of Nations
-Really dives into Duneverse and into politics of it. Landsraad is good impelentation.
-Arrakis and SandWorms look aesthetic.
-Almost bugfree (never crashed)
-No turns (better this way)

Cons:
-No real planetary view (please implement this so you can see the real globe, like in Cryo's Dune 1)
-Not all lore-major houses are presented (where are Theilaxu, House Corrino (as in Sardaukar), Bene Gesserit, Ixians, and many more (there are over 200+ houses and many minor houses) )
-Lack of multiplayer (good thing it will be implemented)

Great game, big fan of the original Dune (1992 adventure game) & the later Dune 2 (by Westwood Studies) back in the day and I'm pleased to say this latest release lives up to them. 

The different dynamics of the Dune Spice Wars makes the game very challenging where you need to think carefully at your approach. I fell into the trap following how I play games like Red Alert, Age of Empires & Dune 2 by building everything as quickly as I could to expand my empire and control the battlefield only to run into economic ruin. Once I learnt this important lesson I started to really understand how this game needs to be played (almost remind me of those strategy style board games). As the game runs on it gets harder to maintain that balance of expansion & control vs economy where spice control really is key if you are to win. If you like straight forward Red Alert style games with all out war with hundreds of units you may find this game slow and too much to think about however if you like more strategy based games that require a lot more thinking & decision making this game delivers that, plus it's Dune! 

It will be interesting to see how the developers expand this game, I would lover to see other worlds added, maybe even have different houses start on their own planets and expand across worlds with trading & movement of troops between planets as the game runs.

It has a lot of promise, but I don't think it's currently worth the price tag, early access or not.

At the moment, all you can currently do is play a free-for-all vs the AI.
But you can't do anything to customize the map - can't adjust the number of opponents, size of map, difficulty, resource density, etc.
Replayability is you picking each faction once, and maybe chasing a different victory condition the next time around just to do it.

Aside from map customization, it really needs multiplayer game modes and a single player campaign before I could recommend it to anyone else.
The devs have mentioned multiplayer is likely going to be added at some point in early access, but it's not here at time of review.
Campaigns (or really good tutorials) are great and frankly necessary devices to introduce players to all of the game mechanics, the different factions, and why those factions exist.

[b]Quality of Life[/b]

Even after that, I still think there are some QOL issues this game has to sort out before I would consider it a good game.
It's missing a lot of basic in-game stuff I would consider standard in any 4X / RTS.
You can't issue advanced commands like hold position, can't queue commands, and so on.
You also don't have any easy way to manage territories and building (like a list or tab) - you have to click all over the map, constantly checking for open build slots and what's being produced in each zone.

[b]AI[/b]

There is also definitely some ways to go when it comes to the AI - it's hyperaggressive towards the player but not very smart.
They'll often make very questionable attacks that really only seem designed to bother the player.
Or worse, make obvious blunders like sending an army and then only attacking with half of it (and thus losing the fight).
And diplomacy seems generally worthless - even AI factions you have good relationships and ongoing agreements with will suicide into you more often than not for seemingly no reason.

[b]Pacing[/b]

Just as with the AI, the pace of the game also needs a fair bit of work.
In most games, you will eventually reach a point where you start to snowball and victory is likely assured.
But unless you get lucky, you will have to wait a LONG time after pulling ahead to win via politics or game score, even though you are obviously going to win.
There's just no way to speed that up, and really no way the AI is going to disrupt you - no end-game confederation of opponents, crisis event, etc.
At the moment, the fastest way to end the game to is probably just to kill the AI every single time.

[b]Dune[/b]

The last thing I wanted to touch on is the weird treatment of the source material i.e. the world and factions of Dune.
It's seems like the game designers took some liberties with the lore in order to fit it into this type of game.
The Atreides and the Harkonnens make sense - they're big imperialist factions claiming land and exploiting it for its natural resources.
However, it really makes very little sense for the Fremen and Smugglers to play the same way.
Why are the Fremen selling spice, subjugating villages, and using donkeys? (smugglers kinda do in the books, rarely, but come on ...)
Why can the Fremen and the Smugglers vote in the galactic senate, or win via politics at all?
As it stands, all of the factions really end up feeling very similar despite their minor differences and that's a bit disappointing.
I think they really missed an opportunity to focus on a more asymmetric design, having different win conditions and truly different playstyles for each faction.

[b]TL;DR[/b]

The Good:
+The 4 playable factions are visually distinct and have a few mechanics to set them apart.
+The visuals are stylized, sure, but nail the feeling of Dune.
+The spy operations that allow you to start a rebellion in one area while invading another feels rewarding.
+The exploration and economic management aspect is great in the early game.
+Multiple ways to victory, which includes scoring points, assassination through spycraft, by destroying enemy bases, or by politicking your way to the governorship of the planet.

The Bad:
-With female movie Kynes we're obviously in the expanded lore, but all the units feel very 'safe' so far.
-Speaking of the movie, the soundtrack lacks personality. Give Atreides some pipes and get some sardaukar throat singing.
-I'm an old man. If I put the harvester on automatic, I expect it to be automatic. I don't want to manually send it back out afterwards. There's already a penalty for it being automated.
-The early to beginning mid-game plays well, but the late game is a slog. You start out whacking people with sticks and by the end of the game you're whacking an armored fortress with those same sticks.
-The map is randomly generated, but you usually start next to spice and plascrete. However, those resources can be fairly far off and depending on how far, you can have a rough early game.
-A minor gripe, but the fact that your basic units can't scout a village they're on top off is bonkers and only slows the early game. The ornithopter is nice and all, but please let me speed up the early game by sending out troops quicker. Hell, add a supply debuff from going into unexplored areas.
-Another minor thing, research is important but the notification that your cue is empty is tiny. Moreover, you can only cue three items. Seems weird to limit it in the first place.

SUGGESTIONS:
*The devs clearly don't mind dipping into the expanded universe, so add some tanks and siege weapons. Get creative!
*A minor campaign like Dune 2K would be great! Just 5 - 7 missions to explore each faction's mechanics and lore.
*Speaking of Dune 2K, House Ordos would be a cool addition.


Bottom Line:
Dune: Spice Wars is a fantastic demo showcase of what's to come. However, at 30 £ it's a steep entry into a game that currently only has a skirmish mode with a pretty lacking endgame. In 1 or 2 major patches, though? I could see it being a fun game to go head to head with a few friends.",1651752008,1651905475,False,42,5,0.711119294166564941,0,True,False,True

As usual with games these days it wont realize it's best self until content, depth and yes the addition of House Ordos are implemented. This game does invoke nostalgia for those of us that played the old Battle For Arrakis. The artwork is nice yet doesn't quite hit on the hardcore semi realistic asthetic of past titles in this universe. If this game is truly 4x then we can expect patches and Dlc fleshing that out. So in a nutshell we have here a nice, entertaining romp back into the Spice conflict on Arrakis that leaves us wanting more out of it. If the Devs deliver this in the future I can see this game being a top ten. Quick note: Devs if you are truly catering to the lore of Dune we gotta have more political intrigue as the original books were more of a parody of the cold war and the ramifications of colonialism. I suggest adding events that deal with intrigue on a more consitant basis with artful popups conveying the incident or action.

RTS is a genre that is often overlooked but Dune: Spice Wars does a great job of allowing you to win your way. Military victories are more difficult due to the sheer map size and challenges of moving troops long distances in great enough force.

and suffice to say that I'm very interested to see how this game will evolve further and really curious about the impact a multiplayer mode will have.

It's surprisingly polished for an early access game, it has a visual style that balances a distinct 3D cartoon-like yet completely serious look really well and feels spot on for the kind of game it's going for.

But most importantly, as a massive fan of the Dune novels by Frank Herbert (as well as of the recent adaptation), I am shocked at how many aspects and themes of the Dune universe are represented in this game in some form.
There's so many layers to it, besides just the RTS aspects like the map, factions, units and tech-trees all being sprinkled with Dune elements and references, from the political voting cycle, the espionage/operation system, it all comes together in a pretty unique consistently Dune-themed package.
I am also glad to see that it's clearly taking the novels as the main inspiration (rather than previous Dune adaptations and games which took a lot of liberties and made up their own concepts like sonic weapons or houses that don't exist etc.), it also FINALLY gives the crucial Fremen a spotlight, by making them an entire fully fledged faction, rather than regarding them as background extras.
But to give the funniest example, there is a Fremen unit called the Kulon caravan, which is based on such an obscure detail, that I had to CTRL+F a PDF of the original novel to confirm that Kulons are indeed in Frank's work and something I overlooked, It's fantastic! LOL

The other interesting thing to me (this could be off-putting to some?) is that you can rarely disregard one of the major aspects of the game while playing. For example, yes you CAN focus on defeating enemies with force, but not without paying sufficient attention to the other mechanics and taking care of resources etc. It's not a typical RTS (your base building and units are fairly limited, but also individually valueable) nor a typical 4X game, it's very much a hybrid, which makes it pretty unique.
That, combined with the way the different factions have means to get around certain mechanics or have access to features that opponents don't, reminiscent of the old Dune board game, IMO feels very right for Dune.

The game seems to be in really good hands and I'm excited for the future of it.",1651850330,1651851163,True,2,0,0.525226950645446777,0,True,False,True

Like it says on steam, this is a singelplayer strategy game. Everything from atmotsphere, ui, balance, special abilities for houses are all well done. And like it says on top, this is just a good game. No one can argue with that.
Note to player:
 It is good to know atleast a little bit of the lore from the book (or movies, boardgame etc) before starting. Things like influence, diplomacy, espionage is important. And these factors might feel abit odd if you do not have atleast a basic understanding about the world.
Perhaps a lore video will be added in the future how knows, right now it is learn by doing :) Or look it up online :) I learnt the lore from watching a playtrough of the Dune boardgame.

Perhaps someone is going to complain about the price of the game. There is always someone whining about the price of games :) ;) To them I say. Get a job. You have to much time and not enough money, If spending 10, 20 or 30 € is a problem for you, you should not buy games at all.

First Impressions; Outstanding 
 Out of the Box; Graphics, Sound, User Interface all very well presented, U.I. simple to use, game play easy to pick up with the tutorial guiding you into play.
 1 Hour In; Wow what have l got here, Game depth is amazing with 4 houses with 6 combinations of play giving 24 possible paths to obtain 1 of the 4 win conditions. Mining Spice (Life flows from the Spice) is the first of the 10 resources you need to manage your infrastructure to support an army, spy's, researchers & diplomats that will help in obtaining your final Victory. Absolutely Loving It.
 5 Hours In; Getting to know the game easy, quickly picked up basic game play & control, learning the depth of the game daunting but alluring. Still have no understanding how to ""Really the Play"" the game but starting to learning how to play the game, learning what is what & why you need it & where to get it.
 10 Hours In; Several restarts in & ""Starting"" to learn how to ""Play"" the game but know need to learn how to do it, everything in this game has so many interwoven layers. More, More, More, give me More.
 20 Hours In; Finally starting to learn how l should have started & starting to learn resource & coal management to obtain the 4 ways to win and well setup on getting the two easiest ways (even with all the bad decisions) with House ""Atreides"" but still finding obstacles that l need to find how to overcome.
 30 Hours In; (Most of that on ""Pause"", just game time 2 h:21 m:24 s in the 1 main game l have played) Starting to figure out ""How to Play"" the game & seeing how to optimise play to achieve different coals but still so much more to learn on how to best optimise play.

First Reactions: This Game Is A New Legend In The Making
 Got to say ""Loving This Game so Far"", simple enough to play on easy but challenging enough game play to keep you playing so you will know how to do better next time. Can't see myself ever winning on Insane difficulty as l am not that die hard (skilled enough) of a player bit can see months of my life going into getting the different wins with each House.
 Can see 4 Possible Game Play Methods;
   1st is the Early Access ""Player vs A.I."" / Random Map mod; which l must say is truly incredible to the point of almost beyond believe for an early access version and l am fully hooked.
   2nd is the currently unavailable Multiplayer ""Player vs Player"" Mod; will have wait and see if this is limited to ""1 Player vs 1 Player"" with 2 A.I. Houses or open to 4 player ""Free for All"" fights to the death or include co-op games. Either way it will not be for be & will not be played.
   3rd is ""Co-Op Player vs A.I."" mod; with customisation of the game options there could be up to 8 Houses (each house having 2 Bases controlled by a mix Players & A.I.) These games would let players interact as a team in games that have a harder A.I. or co-op missions to win. This l would love to play as it is social player interaction while playing.
 Finally 4th is a Campaign Story Mod; This Is What l Play For, A Story that plays out over a series of battle that at first teach you how to play each house but then move on to follow the ""Lore"" story lines of the houses & individuals in each house. As l said at the start this is the type of game l adore as it gives immersive story lines with game play progressing the story.

Verdict: Way Too Early to Say but Hopeful.
   It is way too early to say as the game is still early access but it will come down to where the developers target their product focus, if it is too narrow on ""Player vs Player"" l foresee a short but intense life for the product but to fully support all the mods of play will be a massive undertaking but would result in unbelievable player numbers.
   But from what l have heard the best hope for this game is some form of Player Modding to be allowed, this would give the ""True Die Hard Lore"" fans a way to mod the game to their version of the lore possible & thereby play their book of movie while at the same time giving players the chance to better balance game play to lore or play difficulty balance so on.

Despite all the skepticism, the game is give fun. But I'm not sure that will be enough for a long time ... ...
It doesn't really matter who you play for, which faction you choose.
Crons
- The mechanics of the game and the factions are quite similar, but there are small differences between Atreides and Freemen for example (transfer of the army by aircraft).

Pros
resource...
+ Diversity of resources and their application. Solarium - money, Plastid - building material, Personnel - the staff you can  take, fuel, water, Authority - reflection of the influence of the faction, the situation in Landsraad 
 Each of the resources plays a role. Where we need to pay attention to the last two, which are not obvious, because they are more responsible for policy and influence.
+ Influence is a special case here, it is important in making political decisions and influencing them.
Influence is important thing  fore getting bonuses and  economy. or, you can getting extra army
 + Tactical movement and speed of unit deployments is important for territory control and expansion.

Also since it is real time, you can quickly miss out on the NPC's expanding territory.  Maybe the normal game pace needs to be slowed down just a little.

The voting period seems a bit too short as well, that possibly needs to be extended and the bonus/penalties of the things being voted on needs to be decreased.

The Sandworm are there but I haven't actually seen one. The threat for them appearing from the sand seems to be quite long so it turns out not to be as menacing after the first encounter.

Having said that the combination of 4X mechanics and the real time gameplay makes for a very fun combination. The game is very often tense with you having to juggle things mostly in real time, though you can pause and queue up actions.

Interestingly I've found that unlike other 4X games you can't really just focus solely on one path to victory, say like, military only and ignore the spying. You need the spying to gain operations with can be dropped on regions for powerful buffs and debuffs, you need to engage in the political voting in someway to prevent other factions gaining too many advantages and getting too many disadvantages dumped on you, you need a military and to expand smartly to keep on top of the growing maintainance requirements and prevent your opponent from freely winning.

The main criticism currently is that there is basically no tutorial to speak of, and because of that there is a LOT of trial and error to understand the game systems. As I said before, you sort of need to engage in all systems at least a bit in order to do well, so this can be very frustrating to learn. If you're use to 4X games you should be fine, but if not then it's a fair bit of a learning curve.

You are limited in army size and that makes capturing of defending not hard but makes you run around from A >> B >> C and back to A again because you just lost that region.

Suddenly, Shai-Hulud came and ate like three-quarters of my forces.

10/10 would pay tribute to the true lords of the desert again.

I really like Dune, especially the first four novels (things went off the rails with Heretics and Chapterhouse). The game is clearly missing a few important things like a tutorial, a few iconic groups like the Bene Gesserit and/or the Ixians, and of course, Paul Atreides, but if you've played Civilization and/or Stellaris, you'll have the basics down once you get through the tips the game gives you. 

The art style is more cartoony than realistic, which will be a turn off for some, but truthfully, this art style will likely age better.

Having played a few games now, I appreciate the differences between factions that make them unique. For example, Fremen can't use airfields to quickly move their military around, nor can they build certain advanced technological buildings, but they can ride sandworms to quickly move to almost anywhere in a large area. It rewards thinking differently based upon your faction and the lay of the game map.

Excellent game!

I went in thinking this and was turned on my head how different it was to the original 3. Playing for a while and watching some tutorial vids on YouTube from JumboPixel I started getting a handle on things and enjoying the experience. This game is not heavy on military units though they do play a part in the overall scheme of things.
Government, Spies, resources, time management and infrastructure play a big part in the winning combination.
And most of all mining spice. 
I have been playing in early release and some things may change on full release I think my biggest and only complaint would be that in the right side menu it shows units, ornithopters etc when you click on the unit icon it does not move you to where the unit is. This option I believe would help in navigating to where your military etc are on the map.

None of that matters because a game is either fun or its not and this in its current form feels shallow in all the worse ways. 

Pro:
-4 factions off the bat following the 4 traditional factions that had access to Arrakis (Atredies, Harkonnen, Fremen, and Smuglers). While the Smuglers had a role in the series, i would not have chose to put them as a main stay and playable faction. At most, they were someone you could have bribed or staged indirect attacks on your enemies
Con:
-Those 4 factions besides model changes feel exactly the same. The tactics are the same. You have a light melee unit to start with, heavy melee slightly more expensive, a ranged and a scout\assassin. Your faction has some % modifiers in how they interact with the map and the Landsraad but beyond reading them, i do not feel a significant difference in game play from one faction to the other. Sure, the atreides has flying units but having beat the game with harknonnen, fighting the other 3 factions was boring and flat. The games are LONG and tedious. Finally destroying a faction stronghold offers no significant obstacle other than time waiting for a little bar to meter down and swapping melee units out to rotate damage. incredibly boring. i could not WAIT for this game to come out but came into it with an open mindset. Shiro Games is known for making slow 4x procedural... 

This is slower than slow and not significantly rewarding at any point, even complete victory. 

Pro:
Sand worm mechanics and Spice mechanics are well executed.

That being said its a game of surprising depth and I think once PVP is added, the strategies that will be possible are exciting and possibly unique to other RTS games, or at least its a standout.  


I love the in game references with the game mechanics to the book.  I highly recommend any fans of the dune book to play this game, learn it thoroughly, and then go back and read the book again.  You will be surprised at how many things they put into the games mechanics that reflect the book.  I love how they did this and it shows a true understanding of the source content that SO MANY movie and games and shows miss.  


They did a good job of making it super hard to maintain rapid growth, a large territory, and a large military.  This is vital to a game made on arakis in my opinion so I'm happy they added this.  There is very little actual flavor in the game its mostly shown through gameplay and mechanics so if you are expecting a story or a lot of roleplaying, I would't recommend this game to you.  


It has great potential as a competitive RTS if the length of the game is tweaked and the factions are balanced over time after there is PVP data, and if they find a good pace that will allow players to not feel the need to pause but also feel like things are still happening at a decent pace.  The factions all feel fairly powerful and also very unique which I like.

ALL THAT BEING SAID
needs more factions

possibly need a rework on the intel/subterfuge part of the game as its overpowered in some areas and very underpowered in others

More complete tutorial for players that have played few RTS but are a fan of dune (not me but I have seen this complaint made many times)

I think that the harkenons have way too much micro managing to truly thrive with the oppression mechanic and it needs to be something you can permanently switch on or off depending on conditions.

I think they need a find a better balance of fun things to do in the game, and tedious repetitive maintenance.

- the systems that are in place are simple and fun. 
- I don't reaally like the Diplomatic ""landsraad"" thing, but also i generally don't like diplomacy in strategy games because i am a war monger, and also I have only been playing Fremen and they have limited access to that system. so. grain of salt. 
- I really enjoy the scouting, and the choice in resolving each site.
- i like the limitations on building too many military units and moving them around, this is well balanced with the defense system
- the economy system is very simple, and I like the slider between storing spice for the tax, and selling it directly for Solari (credits/money)
- the game is difficult for sure due to the continually rising spice tax.
- I like that i can have my army ride sand worms as Fremen :D
- I have won twice on easy. i lost horribly on medium.
- there is a good amount of unit variety. I am not sure yet about balance, but that's something that evolves over time
- I am worried about the fact that multiplayer has not been released. It is difficult to convert a game, and I am worried about how much multiplayer has been tested so far?

- Incredibly stable. Haven't had it crash on me yet. No weird glitches. 
- AI can either be brilliant or really stupid. More on that below.
- Attention to complexity. You can win on Easy just fumbling around but if you want to win on Insane you really need to have a deep understanding of the game.
- Beautiful graphics and immersive sound.

Cons
- With only 4 factions the long term playability is going to be an issue. The game on high levels requires a lot of time and can be mentally exhausting. I've only been playing the Fremen and Atreides since they are my favorite in the books as well but once I finish the game with Harkonnens and Smugglers how much will I desire to play it anymore?
- No multiplayer yet but hopefully in the future. I can see where this is where it will shine long term since all factions are good and unique  in their own way.

The AI can be brilliant at times and other times just plain stupid. A well timed cease fire operation buying time for reinforcements will ruin your day but make you salute the AI for doing it. Throwing rebellion ops just as I go on the offensive across the other side of the map also is impressive. However it also just randomly throws a poison operation in one of my villages doing nothing for the AI. If it would use those when I am attacking their villages that would be impressive but I rarely see it.

There are some flaws, but the game has amazing in-depth strategy that slowly reveals itself over time. This is one of the few games where I didn't read any spoilers nor watch any videos. I just jumped in and learned things the hard way. Been playing a lot, first on medium then hard then insane. Took 4 attempts to get a a win on Insane and it is extremely stressful! My 3rd attempt I almost won and even on Hard I lost a few close ones. 

Rebellions are extremely annoying in this game and are frequent late in the game. They happen instantly and your militia don't help. If you can't get there in time with your units you lose the city and when you are allowed to retake it you have to rebuild all your buildings again. They always seem to happen when in battle with another faction so it is easy to miss a rebellion. 

There also isn't much unit variety but given it is an early access game I hope that changes in the future. Same for factions, I hope they make the Bene-Gesserit and Emperor playable in the future. 

I am highly impressed by the lack of bugs in this game and it is very stable. Haven't had a crash or hang yet.",1651417090,1651730052,True,2,0,0.501432716846466064,0,True,False,True

The economy is interesting, and the diplomatic and political components really add strategic layers to the game.

->but a lot of things like District Bonuses etc. are NOT intuitive or explained WHATSOEVER and are left to trial and error by the player. (which means reshuffling buildings around for an hour)
Ok since this post i've CONFIRMED district bonuses aren't working as intended so not only is the tooltip not informative enough but the underlying mechanic is glitched. XD
->Needs to be a clear explanation via tooltips or grouping boxes that correspond to the listed bonus how things work because as it stands the game is unbearable with a lack of clear explanation into how things work. 
->Needless rebellions happen all over your territory even if u have maxed authority (whatever that means)
->Landsraad councils are constant (every few days, American congress doesn't even meet that much), often, have a short timer, and require your attention or else you get slammed with negative debuffs for not paying attention.
-> no roaming sandworms (p sure even the 1990's RTS has this), they just appear if a unit stands in the sand too long. Idk doesnt feel very 'Arrakis-y' but the worm animations themselves and the storms are very cool visually. I just wish they had more presence

The game is indeed an early access build, but that doesn't mean it is empty of content. An entire session can last hours, only feeling like an hour has passed. I've only been interested in top-down games as of recent so for me to say that this game is incredible and full of potential is a once in a full moon occasion. Although what I've said so far may seem like the game is full of flowers and rainbows, it is an early access game. So far the only issue that I've come across is sudden stutters. It is more noticeable when there are many troops on screen and when you try to command them all at once. One note is that this was when I ordered more ram; I first started the game with 16 gigs of 32000 ram. I got two more sticks and for the most part, the stutters MIGHT'VE diminished but I can't be too sure so I at least know for sure that it's the game's optimization for the most part. So far I am thoroughly enjoying this game, as someone who has only seen the movie I can attest that this lives up to it. Those are my two cents, thank you for reading.

My only gripe is that the Imperial Tax seems to be kinda eh.

Overall if you are a Dune fan, than this game is for you. However if you are looking for some nice 4x game that you can sink your time in, i would recommend waiting for the full release.

That said, as is, it's a boring game. Lots of neat mechanics and with a good campaign it could be pretty awesome! I bought this game, because I loved Dune 2000 back in the day.

Even if they added a campaign, currently the factions don't have enough distinction. minor stat changes are boring... +5% production when i have units in my village, -10% if I don't, -30% supply lose? Who cares...

A lot of hte base mechanics are really nice and fun. The worms are super near. The resources feel appropriate and it's interesting balancing them, especially with the large bonuses of certain regions. The fact that dust is mostly only a resource that is traded for money is pretty cool, and that you can hold on to some, until the exchange rate gets better, also neat! Also various factors can suddenly cause shortages of resources, which is immersive for a desert planet. The important of water is also neat and it's cool that it's both for units and expansions. The skill tree feels v unbalanced at the moment, BUT a lot of the technologies feel much more impactful than other 4xs I've played.

I also really like the lack of formal borders that other 4Xs have. It means that even if you're ahead... you could easily be attacked from several directions and some territories taken. Not to mention the random barbarians or whatever that attack.
Lastly, there's some narration with the random commuications you get, and it feels refreshingly specific sometimes... I have high hopes for it in the future.

In the end, I enjoyed a couple hours, but then got really bored and was basically just trying to access different parts of the game, and testing different win conditions... but like, I was way ahead, so it didn't matter... I was v bored by the time i finally closed the game.

Dune NEEDS to be a campaign game... I don't think they should have released it outside of a closed beta, until they had some amount of campaign done. skirmishes feel like a meaningless fever dream; it feels cool, but then you're like ""wait, what?

It's highly polished and in 28 hours of gameplay I have only encountered 1 major bug which left my town a very close Sietch in constant combat despite killing everything in it. Beyond this one bug I feel many things are kept very fair with the possible operations available to everyone if they get a good grasp for the possible tools in their kit. Just as an example of this, if you know you have a harkonnen neighbor they can use combat drugs making their army invincible for a time but bringing their life down to 1 over the course of the drugs effect, hold onto a ceasefire or perhaps lie in wait using stealth to hold back while the drugs wear off then strike back when they no longer are active or even just run across the border as the effects of an operation only are active in that territory and they would have to fight you on open sand if they want to get military victories and that wont protect them from a worm!

All in all I give this game a 10/10 as an early access game and if this wasn't early access it would still get a 8/10 for how good it is without having all the features I would want  yet.

I am currently waiting most on multiplayer as I feel this game will shine like no other to sit down with 2-4 friends for an afternoon of this game having a more chill feel to the game for everyone to get into it and grow within the game and then once all your borders are starting to collide pretty heavily I could see it starting to get rather intense as you have a combination of politics and military starting to play out then when shit starts to hit the fan we could see operations getting played on each other.

The mechanics are far closer to Civilisation or Stellaris than they are Command and Conquer. The game is real time, with an underlying 1 minute timer (days) that governs how things are built, researched, and explored. The pacing is pretty slow, with long stretches where you are basically just monitoring the situation rather than actively button pressing. While there is still an element of RTS-style unit control/positioning - including the use of top-bar abilities to swing battles your way - you will be controlling only about 3-8 units across the entire battlefield, and the majority of your time will be spent agonising over income streams and trying to judge whether you can afford to expand and how best to pursue your goals. There are a lot of resources to juggle, and often you need to fine-tune your acquisition rates of each to ensure that you can afford both your current units and buildings and also those you wish to acquire, and I found that to be a surprisingly interesting challenge. The RTS unit control stuff is fine, not massively interesting at this time, while the game's civilisation elements are more developed and engaging. 

In terms of Dune ambience, I felt that this was very faithful to the tone of the novel. While obviously the different factions didn't fight in this way, and the spice fields in the game are fixed in a way that they were not in the book, nevertheless I feel like a feudal lord fighting for control over the desert. You have to observe and navigate around the deep deserts and fight for control of the pans; there is a lot of political tension here (with one major route to success basically being to overwhelm your opponents in the Landsraad), and espionage operations feel far more important than in any other game I've tried. I would definitely consider this a great way to immerse yourself in the feel of the universe, even if it is not the Dune 2 that some were hoping for.

Despite that, I think the experience has already been worth the money invested. 
The second thing it does really well, is reflecting the Dune setting. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not a faithful adaption. Some in my eyes minor background Changes were made that I don't care about (personally I would simply have made it optional) but mostly the game diverts only where it needs to so that it can be a good game.
This is something that many other games get wrong. They either try to be too faithful to the source material (realistic if that sources is reality) or lean to far in the opposite direction. As fun as for example the CIV games and etc were, they did not really feel like you were actually leading a civilization, ruling a kingdom or etc. Dune: Spice Wars comes as close as any game I have played to making you feel that you are actually doing what the Background Setting promised.

Long winded version: first off, the game nails the atmosphere of the books. Not only in the art/sound design, but in the mechanics of the game as well. Everything here lends itself to the narrative of fighting for control of Dune. I've seen others mention the soundtrack as being lackluster, but I found it overall decent to good, and it fit the overall vibe of the game. 

So far, my only successful game has been with the Fremen, and even though I was primarily focused on going for a military victory, I still had to juggle espionage, negotiations with other factions, etc. And going for a military victory with the Fremen looks very different from doing it with, say, the Smugglers. There's a huge play style distinction between the factions, obvious even when just observing how the computer plays. As Fremen, I was cloaking across vast stretches of desert thanks to the faction's superior supply system; but my opponents would have to cross more carefully, utilizing air transport when possible. House Atreides seemed to avoid military confrontations most of the game, and tried going for a diplomatic victory by being named ""Governor of Arrakis."" I was impressed by how every faction seemed to stay competitive with each other having completely different focuses. 

There is a little weirdness here and there, definitely due to early access. Some animations are janky, particularly when Fremen hop on sandworms for transport. When some animations occur, the game can freeze for a few seconds. I never experienced a crash or game breaking bug, though. 

I'm not a huge RTS gamer; I do really enjoy 4X games though. Dune: Spice Wars gives me a similar vibe as playing Endless Space 2 does. And that's a good thing.

In terms of gameplay and mechanics, Dune takes inspirations from great titles like Civ 6 and Northgard to create a hybrid 4X RTS experience that is both tactical and strategic.

I've been thinking to myself for a very long time about a game just like this: Real time, but with a very slow pace, a feeling of building an empire over a long period of time. Diplomacy should be important, but also improved over other series' awful attempts at it. A good balance of resources, with none feeling unobtainable, yet still allowing one faction to obtain a benefit if they target it successfully. I wanted to see armies marching for long periods before they reached their targets, with a realistic balance among them (frontline troops should be the majority of an army, methinks). They've really nailed it, and did so with an excellent sci fi franchise to back it up. 

That being said, the negatives: Definitely needs some balancing work, in particular with things like rebellions (which can happen on a far side of the map and you have NO way to get to it in time. For the price of starting a rebellion, this needs addressed), defenses (missile batteries are okay for damage output, but they really aren't doing much for their price), militia (a little weaker than necessary, but they also should be weaker than regular unit), and the fact that some resources have hard caps despite demand going up, meaning those very long games can turn into even longer games if you don't play at a very controlled speed. That being said, can't wait to see what else they can do. I'd love to see even more Houses brought in, although it might not be canon to the original books, and I'd love to see higher unit caps and upkeep adjustments to see some truly impressive armies.

The game is a blend between 4x and RTS, similar in style to Northguard. The game runs as real-time-with-pause, allowing for micro on combat units while still maintaining that ""timer"" feel to the longer strategy decsions. The timers for technology, region captures, buildings etc are counted in ""days"" which equivocal to turns. 

There are a few different subsystems standard with a 4x entry, with there being a tech tree (four smaller separately themed trees), global politic arena with timed buffs/debuffs that are voted on, fluctuating economy thanks to spice tax and variable market rates, subterfuge/spying, and Arrakis as an environment to traverse. All of these systems are not particularly complex but are fun enough to play around with, particularly with how different factions interact with each system differently.
  
Four factions currently in the game each with their own pros/cons which do change up how you interact game-to-game. Each faction has slightly different units eg smugglers have a ranged unit that does supply damage and another unit that has +damage against targets with low supply. Fremen have a unit that can unpack and provide supply/regen no matter the location, allowing you for go on long treks across the map. The faction differences really have changed my different games up, eg smugglers focusing on building underworld markets in opposing cities, vs using sandworms to move my Fremen army around to harass whilst allowing them to stay on offence indefinetely with the aformentioned unit.

The sound design is lovely and evokes the atmosphere of Arrakis. I love the overall aesthetic, but no specific art piece stands out apart from watching worms eat your own units. 

Summary: The game is light on content but the foundation of a great game is there in aesthetics/systems/gameplay. There are plans for more factions and multiplayer, however no clear plans for further singleplayer content. Most of the design critiques people have brought up in other reviews have in-game solutions to them, or are personal design preferences. The game has a few classic early access bugs in there, and some strange AI on tile/map generation, but nothing that cannot be worked out in time.",1651640648,1651640648,True,3,0,0.555106163024902344,0,True,False,True

I enjoyed by time with it, but it appeals to me. Just some minor critiques

>Economy is currently wonky, with no harvestable resources outside of Spice, everything is built on those buildings. This makes it so you're always encouraged to build the exact same few buildings in every village to simply maintain the economy.
>Missions are a cool idea, but they take a while to get off the ground due to the Agents being slowly acquired, this isn't really factoring in how agents seem to be a bit broken currently. You will have a handful of Missions you spam, with one or two unique to each faction.
>Combat is pretty dull, there is some light micro which boils down to ""Position the rangers and walk a melee unit in the back"" and since everyone gets only a handful of units each, with many of them similar, combat either becomes right click and pray or cakewalks.
>Research is exponentially more expensive, making a few techs down the road hellishly expensive unless you invest in research, which combined with the economy issue, makes it a weird overt expense for not much. 
>Few buildings and fewer ""interesting"" buildings makes most villages ""Economy Village #3"" rather than a piece of a puzzle. Each village has a unique modifier, but they never really felt unique.
>AI currently isn't . . . bad. But not good, they frequently ferry 1 or 2 troops to fight a full stack, refuse to defend their main base from assault, or make strange call outs for [b] their own actions against the player [/b]. ""Stop setting up soldiers on my border!"" as they mass soldiers against me will never not be amusing. 
>City building is a bit poorly explained and unrewarding. If the districts rewarded ""everything"" than I feel it would be far more intuitive, but right now, it's a lot of staring at the screen trying to figure out what you want. Some more unique buildings in there would be nice though.

However, I think the largest issue is pretty simple: You have one feasible victory condition for most situations. The Hegemony victory requires you to amass 25K points, which you are rewarded for quite a bit of things. These are FUNDAMENTAL to the game, and the other victory conditions don't really feel . . . worth it.

The Dune Governorship requires you to win the Charter, which may not even come up until late game, which at that point 20 Days of holding the office means you're probably 10 Days from a natural Hegemonic Victory.
The Elimination Victory is a two-fold situation, as its forcing the player to engage in a mass mobilization early to achieve it, which requires research, economy, infiltration, intel, and everything else to be successful with. By the time you are reasonably capable of bringing total war, you're already crossed the 10k point, probably far past it as well. If you go 100% on it, you've probably crippled yourself as well in other fields, which are all essential to maintain the offensive for any length of time. 
The other way is Assassination which requires 10 Agents and a decent amount of intel, THEN you have to select which of the methods you're doing it with, which require more resources.  You have to do this 3 times, and if you fail any of them, you'll probably have captured agents which may simply not escape, making it so you can no longer continue. However, as stated above, you need -everything- to be faster, better, and have more of it to succeed. Which by that point, why bother, you've already won. 

So, in short, most games end up playing out the same. I've done three runs, and the Smugglers have been the most entertaining simply because you have a boatload of resources to do things with.",1651639983,1651639983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Though as a book it's infamously difficult to explain to people,  and it's even harder to adapt I imagine. The recent movie did it as good as anybody could hope, and even then a lot of the more important parts of the story and setting were cut out. We're talking about a peyote trip of a book here. But like, reading the Quran on peyote. And your friend's with you but he's a poli sci major and he just WILL NOT stop talking about the world trade organization. Also there's giant worms that are also god. 

So it's actually pretty impressive this game is not totally incoherent, never mind actually fun. And while it is lacking a bit content wise for the moment the core gameplay actually comes pretty close to capturing the essence of the Dune's world. The spice flows, the water doesn't, backstabbers are backstabbing appropriately..

Dune is a story about secret plots and political intrigue. Imagine that, worm-god is actually a side character.  Turns out we were the worms the whole time, man. Makes you think. Anyway, the game does have its own versions of all the different factions jockeying for control of Arrakis, and while you can build an army and steamroll across the map if you put in the time and effort it's just as possible for you to win by controlling important resources, or working on building your strength in the landsraad, assassination, etc. You actually have a lot of choice in how you approach it, even if the gameplay currently is pretty easy to grasp once you get the hang of it. 

If I was to compare it to anything it would be a scaled down stellaris. Less diplomacy, same type of exploration early game. I like stellaris so that was great when I picked it up and said ""oh hey this is like stellaris"". Mileage may differ on that, but the way simpler diplomacy and espionage systems compared to something like stellaris are probably the two main things the devs should work on. There's not really a whole lot in the way of character, or different interests, or much else going on. You keep CHOAM happy in simple way (spice, obviously), you win votes more or less the same way (only difference is fremen and smugglers use a currency titled ""influence"" to vote instead, and influence is easy to get), most faction units are pretty much the same with some small differences. Diplomacy is basically just trade, non-aggression, research agreement, the end. So it would be nice to see that expanded a bit more. Maybe not as complex and in depth as a paradox game, but definitely with some more dynamism to it.

Another thing I would love would be for something akin to the random events that pop up in (another paradox comparison..) crusader kings. There is currently a couple of events that pop up in playing, but they're in the same order every playthrough and they're mostly little challenges (earn x for y reward or earn y for x, that kind of thing). Really the only thing that breaks up the explore/capture/mine cycle is the occasional AI raid. Something to bring you into the world a bit more and throw different situations at you can do a lot to make you invested. Or at least get off the phone while waiting for your gold to go up enough to buy another building. 

All criticisms aside right now out of 10 I'd say 8, but if the devs expand on some of the current systems and add a bit more variety I could see this being something pretty special.",1651634499,1651634499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For an Early Access, it's pretty round and I haven't caught any significant bug.

Strategically for me was a breath of fresh air. Some people may think as another installment of Dune 2, where you build a base, mine a huge amount of spice, and use it to build hundreds of troops...it´s not (even because building troops and maintaining them is very expensive). In the end game, I should have about eight troops.

The idea here is different. Instead of a full open war, you need to gradually expand your influence over Arrakis, conquering villages, building structures that will help you increase your hegemony and resources, and finally defending them with militias.

The game offers several options for victory. Destroy the enemy base (a huge task), reach 25k hegemony (the victory condition I achieved), remain as governor of Dune for 60 days (controlling a good part of the territory), and even use agents and infiltration to assassinate the enemy leaders.

The game has other interesting mechanics that you have to pay attention to as you try to expand and defend your territory. You can participate in Landsraad council audiences, using your influence to vote on propositions that can give you some benefits (or harm opponents). You can infiltrate agents in different forces of this universe to gain benefits and even create espionage operations that can help you on some occasions. (I used a cease-fire to buy some time and bring more troops to a battle), developr a tech tree, paying a montly fee to the emperor, control rebelions and of course evading the storms and sandworms that can swallow your best trained troop in a blink of a eye. 

The game give you four houses to choose from, each one with their own quirks and flaws and differents styles o play. I eager to try a new house after my victory with the Atreides.

Overall it's pretty cool game with a lot a thing happening at the same time. Dune Spice Wars requires patience, perseverance and a little bit of lucky, a perfect analogy for the desert you have to face. The game still in early acess and I just can´t wait to see what surprises the final version will bring us.

This game is VERY resource management-heavy, even compared to northgard.

If you never played northgard, Then i would recommend Spice wars over it only when it goes on sale. It's basically a better northgard with less diversity of playstyles owing to the game being EA.

Right now there is no telling if the game is going to follow in the track of northgard and release more dlc that ultimately doesnt ""feel"" like an altrenate playstyle/identity to what the base game offers.

As an expansion to the Dune universe, it is exceptional. Factions & characters, gameplay & decision making, as well as art & design are such a fine compliment to the series.

Why are the Sandworms so boring? First they dont appear that often and second you have more than enough time to evacuate your harvester or your troops from a specific area because those Sandworms just take ages to appear. 

Female Kynes yeah yeah it doesnt change the story or anything, but the fact is in the Original Story from Frank Herbert in 1965 Kynes is a Male character. Yeah i get it the new Movie also made Kynes a Female one and so on. But still it kinda annoys me.

Review: 

It's clear that the video-game of Dune is based heavily on the board game; the play-space is actually a rather compact, self contained area that you will become familiar with within the first half hour or so of completely exploring the terrain.
The loyalty shown to the tabletop format has its charm, but comes with the related limitations that such loyalty would entail. Board games tend towards having play systems that can be comfortably managed by hand and mental calculation, a video game doesn't need to abide by these limitations so strongly. 

Each faction has strengths and weaknesses that make every playthrough slightly unique, though these factors can be so lopsided as to limit how each player might feasibly play; personally I can see the developers including more factions in future, and possibly more special characters to spice up what might otherwise become a fairly monotonous experience, thankfully the Frank Herbert universe is replete with many more interesting characters and factions that could make for interesting and variable playthroughs. 

Undoubtedly as the game leaves the Alpha development cycle and more multliplayer options, possibly with more game modes are included, this may become more of a gem, though these mild criticisms are not in any way meant to detract from the game itself; if you enjoy 4X games and Dune, you certainly need to play this.",1651538001,1651590093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In the other dune games you get to build actual bases, not just a few buildings. You have to put concrete slabs down then buildings on top of them. In this one you can only build up to 5 buildings and the choices are limited (at this point). The further you progressed the more buildings you could build and you unlocked more units. There's a house faction that is missing from the other dune games too, The Devious Ordos. Each House had a special unit (Ordos was my favorite with the Deviator in Dune 2000). The amount of troops you can have at a time is very limited due to needing command points and resources for upkeep. This is a good game just not the Dune I have come to know and love. I understand that it's still in early access but I feel at this point it's more of an economy based game than an RTS. I'll update my review when things change and at this point I feel like it'll never live up to the ""real dune"" game series.

 4 factions to choose from and they all have different enough play styles to be unique, though there should be a bit more (more units and unique mechanics would be nice) 

The map is large enough to explore, but not too large as to be annoying. 

Sections of the map have special features that add more resources, honestly think there should be more of that, like more per section. 

The interactions between leaders is very lacking. The art style for the leaders is great and it would be nice to have more interaction with them. Would also be nice to have some kind of interaction with the Imperium as a whole, like the emperor or his underlings.

It's not very fast paced, and definitely demands some strategy from the player to accomplish goals in the game. Personally I focused on asset denial for other factions, which led me to own the overwhelming majority of spice mines on the planet. The limited options available to you demand focus as a few wrong moves can set your progress back significantly.

The game can be a little bland at times, and I do question the Landsraad voting mechanics that allow you to win the game. The competing faction idea is a little jarring as well, considering how the first book and movies focused on what was an all or nothing fight to the death, not accruing favor over time by garnering points. The point system is all important in this game, making it more a board game than a military strategy game. At one point I became bored so I charged at the Fremen capital, only to realize I couldn't take the capital at all. This made me focus instead on the outlying territories, gobbling up resources that would weaken Fremen clout with the Emperor. 

That's another thing, don't think too hard on the factions. Harkonnen and Atreides houses make sense to use in this game, Fremen and Smugglers, not so much. I understand the need for 4 factions to make the game work, but couldn't the Fremen and Smugglers operate in a different fashion? Giving them special traits, but identical core mechanics doesn't jive with the books or movies. But oh well, I digress. This game is basically a board game brought to the computer, not an open world simulation, so limit your dreams. 

I did find it amusing that I could step away and accidentally run the game for an hour, come back and find that my territory was basically intact, just my resources were in the red. Wouldn't the other factions have gobbled up my land and run me off planet? Nope. My points with the Emperor were terrible, and I had little chance for a win, but House Harkonnen still existed... Yeah. Anyways. 

$30 is a bit much for this, but the game is stable and I love the flavor as I'm a fan of the books and movies. The game still needs balancing as I found little evidence of use of the expensive espionage tactics by the AI. AI military strategy is not very reactive either. I found that taking territory had little immediate recourse, with opponent armies just sitting on the border watching as I ransacked their territory.",1651374298,1651548622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A lot of effort has achieved an immersive Duniverse sandbox experience that expands on the science fiction culture while remaining accurate to the official Dune lore.

Where previous Dune games focused simply on economics and battle to resolve all conflicts this new rendition has the added elements of politics, subterfuge, espionage and socio-economics. Making endeavours even more challenging to manage a victory.

The harsh conditions of the desert planet Arrakis and sand worms are not the only challenges players must face.

While the player explores the planet, expands their controlled territories, exploits the game mechanics and systematically exterminates the competition they will have to maintain balanced relations with the fierce native Fremen Warriors, the Landsraad Council, opposing or allied Houses, the Spacing Guild and CHOAM Industries to become the titled Governor of Arrakis.

The groundwork has been laid for an incredibly fun 4X - RTS Hybrid where many of your decisions and choices leave you open for exploitation. One of my favorite aspects so far is the game masterfully presents you with choices and limited resources whether is be units, time, manpower or resources. Each path you take can have significant repercussions. All in all, the base mechanics are set, interesting and can potentially bring many hours of enjoyment. I believe a testament to how an Early Access game should be done.

That being said, it is most definitely early access in it's current state. Multiplayer is not working yet, I feel/hope more units will be added that will bring additional complexity to the combat. While the mechanics for intel/operations, diplomacy and influence/resolutions are in the game. I think many of these need to be balanced and fleshed out.

TLDR: Great Early Access title in it's current state, many hours of enjoyment to be had. Excited for what the future roadmap will bring.

Also research can make your army stronger or gain you more resources or allow what you currently have in resources to be more efficient at production, it can gain you influence, intelligence, Hegemony and much more.

Besides that though, the game feels pretty great right now, but needs some more work, for sure. To be clear, I think there's enough content right now that it's worth the price, but the game could be a lot more than it is.

Right now I think the biggest problem is that the Fremen are by far and away the best-differentiated faction in the entire game. Their unique worm-riding ability and desert stealth makes them play totally differently than the other three factions, and frankly, the other factions need to catch up.

I think the case of the Harkonnen could be helped by fleshing out the infiltration system more, and maybe give them an ability to see one or more of the missions that their enemies are working on. In the case of the Atreides, I feel like their peaceful annexation ability is a bit too anemic? It's too slow, and usually it's just as good to do a hostile takeover. It would probably also be good to give each faction their own tech tree or something, too. As it stands, the best thing going for overall faction diversity is the unique (or, at least, reasonably-unique) unit roster for each group. The sad thing is, in regards to the factions, this game is totally outdone by the Dune board game - though that game [i]is[/i] a rather lofty goal to reach.

On the subject of factions, the inclusion of the smugglers as the 4th faction is a very odd choice, given the availability of several other larger players to choose from. The spot would have probably been better served by the Emperor or the Bene Gesserits. In fact, choosing the Bene Gesserits as a 4th would have saved them the trouble of needlessly gender-swapping Liet, so they really should have gone for that.

As a final issue, I do fear a bit that, at least when multiplayer comes, ranged units may really struggle in the meta - given that melee units can simply run to the backline and kill them off. I feel like they may need to develop some sort of engagement/disengagement system for those sorts of troops to limit mobility a bit in combat.

Besides those issues, I think the game is really quite well done. I like the visual and sound design (except for that one fremen unit that mispronounces ""Arrakis"" and says ""Fremens"" for the plural...), and am super glad that they went their own way with it all. I also really appreciate how much you have to think about where you position your units so that you can avoid losing a village to an enemy incursion. The economy is also super tight - until the end of the game, you'll constantly be worrying about money and resources.

― Frank Herbert, Dune

Dune games have been a mixed bunch over the years, with all of them to date using the literature as the basis for an arena of war (or an RPG in one case) - but none respecting the power of the story.
This game basically takes the first half of the first book (or, the new movie if you want to look at it that way) and says ""what if...""
The pieces are all in place, but it is up to the player how it pans out.
In its current form, it is almost perfect. Extremely playable, and better than any of the previous RTS attempts (which I loved, each in turn.)
It simplifies the gameplay down to raw strategy, timing and planning.
As you would expect on Arakkis, resource management is critical - extend too far without planning, and you doom yourself to be consumed by the sands.
The initial choice of factions is perfect for the opening gambit.

Things I would love to see extended:
# campaign mode - tell the story as-is
# greater involvement of the worms and spice - some degree of development beyond basic small worm, big worm
# faction heroes
# slightly faster authority growth / more options to grow it / slightly lower penalties
# slightly more balance to maps - i find myself restarting to find two spice fields close to each other near me (go Fremen!)
# more of a feeling of involvement of mentats, war masters etc
# more individually named units 
# presence of the emporer
# IX and a greater involvement of the spacing guild
# ability to have the option keep conquered home basis, with penalties and risks

Saying all of that, there is a LOT to learn - there are some ""wish I knew"" pages out there now, which are SOOOO true!

It's pretty clearly a Shiro game (aka it takes a lot from Northgard, everything is a region with specific resources, you have to 'claim' each region one by one). Feels like it takes some inspiration from 'Endless' games in that there are like 10+ currencies 

I worry about the replayability, it seemed from the mid-late game to just be a constant grind of resources and while the bonuses of each faction kinda push you towards different win conditions, they all basically require the same resource infrastructure. 

RTS elements are kinda overly simplistic. You can build like 4 buildings per region, their placement doesnt matter (other than a missile silo thing), everything costs resources to upkeep so you're building the same resource extraction buildings everywhere. Combat is real simplistic. 

I realized that most of what I was doing was waiting for resources while playing an ornithopter minigame basically, sending them to question marks that'd show up on the map for a random resource.

All in all, kinda disappointed. It's not bad, but it also feels like it doesn't really have much underneath.

Also, capturing regions requires a certain resource and each captured region increases the cost of more, so you can never really do a full conquest. I managed to destroy the Harkonnen capital and it returned all their regions to neutral and despite being late game, i was only able to take a single region more before i was out of that resource (and it would have taken me about 10 mins to acquire enough for another region -- of the 20 that turned neutral).",1651510060,1651510060,False,14,0,0.569837689399719238,0,True,False,True

Though to be clear this game does not play much like Northgard, there are elements that are the same, their previous game was almost a scaled down simpler aoe2. Dune feels like a mix between Supreme Commanders unit blobs moving around a map, and Stellaris with its events and economy layout. 

The game seems to be all about focus and building bonuses, there are many inefficient ways to win the game but only a few effective strategies for each faction. Makes you specialize and think about what you are building and where and when. There is certainly optimal paths to take, but sometimes the game throws you for a loop in some unexpected way requiring a creative solution sometimes, especially when things get busy and a worm eats half your army, or a council vote goes way against you and you have no resource of a type.

Overall its fun, looks nice with a clean simple layout and a very fitting art style, good music though i feel the soundscape could be improved some.

[quote=Frank Herbert]""The unclouded eye was better, no matter what it saw."" [/quote]

[b]TLDR[/b]: Wait for the developers to add more. I can’t recommend Spice Wars as a Dune fan or a Shiro Games fan YET. Support Shiro by looking at their other games instead.

Do I recommend this game? No, I do not. Not yet anyway. Why? Well, let me spin you a tale.

I must confess I am a huge fan of the Dune books. I basically grew up playing the old Dune games (you are missed Westwood) and I fell in love with the world from the books. I also must preface that Early Access games are just that: Early. 

When I heard that Shiro was developing the next Dune game I was pleasantly shocked and cautiously optimistic. I liked Northgard for being a pretty solid real time strategy hybrid. Spice Wars is pretty much Dune Northgard (that will make sense if you've played Northgard). Swap the Viking mythos with Frank Herbert's Epic and you've got an interesting desert filled RTS hybrid. 

The groundwork has been laid for something amazing. Now, I know this review is going to sound like it takes a pretty harsh turn, but my comments are there because I want Spice Wars to be great. 

[quote=Frank Herbert, Dune p. 3] “A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows.”[/quote]

But right now, Spice Wars is really rough. The foundations have been laid, but the work is not finished.

Credit where credit is due, Shiro seems pretty committed to making a great game. Tip your hat off to anyone who tries to adapt Dune. If the films have spent the past 40 years trying to do it, you can imagine how hard it is for game devs.

So, what are a Dune fan’s thoughts on this? Well in no particular order: 

[h2]The Good:[/h2]

[quote=Frank Herbert, Dune p. 38]“Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.”[/quote]

-	[b]Style is on point.[/b] Shiro, I’d love to see the artbook you release after this game is finished. It oozes with a style that depicts Arrakis so effortlessly. You can tell they’re taking inspiration from everywhere. Morbius’ work, the Dune films (old and new) and Shiro Games with what they’ve learned over the years, injecting their unique flair.

-	[b]Northgard is a great game.[/b] Much of what Shiro Games learned from doing Northgard is found here. If you’re a fan of that you’ll know exactly how to play Dune. It’s a solid RTS hybrid.

-	[b]This game is surprisingly bug free.[/b] It ran without any problems and even played excellently. Not many games in Early Access can say they do that. This game is polished. 

-	[b]I like that resources carefully balance how you proceed.[/b] You can never overextend otherwise you’re at a loss. Some people might hate that, but it makes engagements more tactical. Each unit is precious and a huge investment, so you have to carefully maneuver as to not overextend. 

Now for what I think could use a lot of improvement... Which is going to sound like a laundry list of comments, or a mess of jumbled thoughts but I want Spice Wars to succeed. Devs, if you’re listening, I’ve got a few things to say.

[h2]The Bad:[/h2]

[quote=Frank Herbert, Dune p. 108]“You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.”[/quote]

-	[b]The game gets a bit stale after you hit the midgame[/b]. If you aren’t planning on destroying or dominating your rival’s HQs then be prepared for farming Hegemony (its Spice War’s form of Renown ala Northgard) or spending a ton of time assassinating your rivals. If you play to win through Renown, it can take a long time and the length of a single game can go up dramatically. I'm in it for the long haul, don't get me wrong, but you'll be doing the same things over again and it feels tedious.

-	[b]Agents are an interesting idea[/b], but needs to be fleshed out more. I love the idea of powers that you get from Missions you put agents on, and some are certainly more broken than others. Maybe fix the Incite Rebellion and some other fast acting powers by giving the affected player time to resolve them. Those instantaneous powers are broken.

-	[b]Flavor text or lack thereof.[/b] Maybe I’m in the minority here, but I like when games have more than “you’ve collected 5000 Spice” as an achievement. Maybe say something like “blue within blue eyes” or “ The Eyes of Ibad”. Maybe more ominous text? 

-	[b]Alerts can be better defined[/b]. My main issue is with how certain alerts clump together. For example, I had 5 Crawlers simultaneously attract sandworms. I don’t like losing 4 crawlers after resolving 1 worm sign so maybe fix the clumping of alerts or make a dedicated alert for worm sign. 

-	[b]Voices of units are boring[/b]. They all sound similar and lack any distinction. Would love more distinct unit voices.

-	[b]Faction variety is needed.[/b] Maybe more faction specific units as well as unique buildings per faction. I love the designs but I wish Atreides tech didn’t look the same as Harkonnen/Smugglers/Fremen tech. Maybe if the Harkonnen buildings looked more ominous. Maybe the Fremen structures would be built into rocks? Or The Smugglers being an amalgamation of everything. Their buildings should look dirty or cobbled together. Maybe Make each of their buildings distinct like the Faction HQ building. 

-	[b]Lack of good beats.[/b] The soundtrack is no Dune 2000. Maybe with more tracks the game could feel and sound better, but Frank Klepacki killed it with the OST of the older dune games. 

-	[b]The weather/sandworm system is great, but things never felt too dangerous. [/b] The worms are menacing, but I feel like you could do more to make them an actual threat other than eating your units for fighting on sand or destroying a crawler every once in a while. Up the menace of raids or even the world. I dunno, something that would solidify that Arrakis is unforgiving to outsiders. 

I've got a lot more to say really, about the Landsraad, about the lack of key staples of the Dune world that are missing, about a lot of things, but this review is already long so I'll wrap it up.

[h2]The Conclusion: [/h2]

[quote=Frank Herbert, Dune p. 423]“Ways change.”[/quote]

At the end of the day, If you’ve played Northgard you’ve played Spice Wars. Spice Wars can shape up to be a really engaging experience down the line and like I’ve said before, the groundwork has been laid. I do want more from this so I will revisit this game when there’s a lot more content fleshed out. I would love to see more houses, more neutral factions, more of the world fleshed out. Dune is a rich series of books and I can’t wait for Shiro to use more. Until then, I can’t recommend Spice Wars at the moment.

Build buildings to get more resources (or to capitalize on the special resources that are in that territory). Use the five resources (plasticrete, manpower, water, money, influence) to build more complex buildings to either protect villages or improve production. Build buildings to improve mobility and control.

Mining Spice fulfills two purposes - to make Solari (money) and to pay the Empire's/Guild's tax. If you don't pay your Spice tax, you'll suffer growing penalties. The Spice tax is always going up, as well. So after a while, you need to capture another field. Then another. Usually belonging to an enemy faction. It's both a conflict timer and something you have to watch because you can change the percentage of Spice you keep (for the tax) and the percentage you sell to CHAOM (for money). HINT: The little purple/gold bar next to the Spice harvesting counter is a SLIDER you can use to change the percentages in the harvest. Push it up (increase the purple) save more Spice harvested. Push it down (increase the gold), sell more Spice for Solari/money harvested. They don't explain that well (or at all).

Warfare feels slightly tacked on. While it's essential to take and hold villages quickly, it's also required to protect villages. Here, you have your mobile army produced at your home base, and the garrison troops that can only be used if the village is attacked. The level of troops ranges from 1 to 3 (1 being simple ranged, melee and explosive troops, 2 being veteran and slightly specialized troops, and 3 being the powerful House troops). There isn't a huge variation in the troops, save that your technology and buildings will make the bigger difference in fights. There's also a mechanic where certain mobile troops (especially for Harkonnen and Atredeis) have a ""supply"" bar that diminishes when moving around in the desert outside their controlled territories. If that drains completely, the units begin to quickly lose health until they die. So invasions are usually limited to short range strikes in territories near yours. Troops cost water, manpower and Solari. They also have a maintenance cost - usually in the same resources.

The technology portion is fairly easy to navigate, and each explains exactly what they provide if completed. You can research politics, infrastructure, military and Arrakis tech. Research is putting X amount of tech points created every day into the chosen tech. Buildings and alliances will raise that amount, so you find yourself creating both often. 

The Landsraad is a political mini game designed to help factions punish each other, or give themselves a big boost in Charters. The more influence you have, the more you can sway votes no one owns to your preferred outcome in voting. Of course, the two House factions of Atredeis and Harkonnen have the advantage here, and the Fremen factions the least. So you take advantage where you can afford it. I personally only paid attention to the votes that harmed me or gave away valuable charters. 

Using generic agents you earn every so often, you can put them into spying on the other factions, or leeching benefits from Arrakis, Spacing Guild, Landsraad and CHAOM. There's limited slots in each (tech sometimes opens more) but you can have only 10 generic agents in play. You can also prep a special op to use on the map (or against the active factions). Using these can help, but it takes time to prep them, so use them only when you need them.

Finally, each faction (two House, two Fremen) have a few unique traits, with 4 faction agents (2 which you can put into play) that give you specific benefits (they don't get involved in the actual intrigue agent part). This gives each game you try a different direction. The weird thing is that two of the factions you can play are considered ""Fremen"" factions (actual FREMEN and the SMUGGLERS) and then there's Sietches on the map of Fremen who conduct random raids on whoever the AI decides is a bigger threat. The factions have different ways of allying with these independent Sietches, but never can you control the eight military units that protect the Sietch. They are merely there to keep things moving - unless you are 100% friendly with them, they can send annoying raiders at you.

All together, as a Early Access game, it's pretty good. 8/10 in my opinion. I've won twice in 15 hours.  The planet map is always randomly generated, so you don't play the same map every restart. The factions have just enough to play different. The game can be as hard or easy as you set it up to be. I look forward to more changes and tweaks. If I had to pick the weakest part of this game, it's the battles. They are pretty much creep, creep, creep, feel out the enemy defense and strike. The AI is a bit weak in defending itself - they forget to restock garrisons for a long time after they are destroyed. Or they can't prioritize which region to defend over another.",1651500779,1651500866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First thing to to be aware of is that this game is much more a real time 4X game, than it is an RTS with 4X elements. If you are expecting a high APM game with large armies and complex combat mechanics, this is not that game.

This a game that is fought with diplomacy, economy, logistics and espionage just as much as it is with military and as such, taken independently, all these elements are somewhat simplified; however when all interacted with in conjunction, in real time, the result is a game that I find extremely engaging, without becoming overwhelming or exhausting. I will find myself sitting down with a drink and by the time I've finished an entire 3 hour game, I realise I didn't touch it, because I was so engrossed with the game.

Agian, for this reason alone it's a thumbs down.  Is that pedantic?  From this studio, no.  Second failure to do UI scaling which blows my mind.

I will of course update my review if proper working UI scaling (which, code wise, is trivial) happens.  I'm not hopeful.  Going to keep hours below 2... unfortunately, to refund if need be.

It is far from complex, very watered down to what the game could eventually be. A mix between a war strategy game and a diplomacy ""can't we all get along"" game. War is kinda inevitable, as AI is very hard to program, I get that.. But the trading system seems to be a few presets, and not recognizing what you might actually want for what they want. It's way too easy to lose diplomacy, and extremely time exhaustive to gain it. I have yet to make an ally as of yet, cause' War Never Changes..

It does have a lot of ways to go about war, and kinda would overwhelm you, if you don't realize that pausing the game time is a thing. Don't try to play without pausing, because there should be a an achievement for that, ha! But, as soon as alarm bells go off, pause, then take your time before you hit play again. Turning it into more of a Turn Style game, rather than full RTS.

The resources seem like they're a lot, but they're really not. Water = food, Manpower = population, Gold = gold, Spice = work, Plasteel = concrete, Minerals = iron, Influence = diplomacy votes, Intel = black ops currency, and Knowledge = science... I know way more games that offer way more resources than this. Oh and Hegemony, but that's basically Empire Standing, high influence production and several side missions can increase that. So as I said, very watered down.

Very few bugs, which rarely any other game could promote during early access. One being when you go to add a building to a settlement, if you click on a icon(town/unit) it will select the latter. So zoom in when placing. Nothing warns you that your losing hegemony(which do not let go down!), so run through a checklist while looking at all your resources.

Sietches get to be frustrating, but once your search rate is high you find them, then just trade them water and they leave you alone. allowing you to focus your troops elsewhere.

The Bad:  The tutorial was done as part of the early game, and should have been on a separate map and more detailed, as many important aspects of the game were not well explained and difficult to grasp.
The campaign consists, at this time, ONE LARGE MAP.  Not good or interesting if you like the game and want to replay.  NOT CONSISTENT WITH GAME LORE!  The resources that are critical are not only spice, which breaks with the LORE OF THE GAME HISTORY.

It's definitely the most competitive 4x I've ever played, and brings a lot to the RTS genre in the form of anti cheese gameplay. The macro economic heaviness of the strategic gameplay is respectable.

If you don't care about Dune, buy a different RTS because there are better RTS games at a better price point. However, if you do care about Dune but don't care for the faster paced style of RTS game, then you'll really enjoy this.

AI don't seem to be constrained by resources at all, and can take over territory within seconds while it takes you significantly longer to take over their territory. It takes long enough for the AI to train new troops and send them over to shoo you away. This is on easy mode, btw. 

Additionally, most faction abilities don't work at all, and might as well not exist. There is absolutely no tutorial (annoying pop up cards don't count) and games quickly get to a boring place where you trade territory back and forth until someone eventually gets enough xp to win, or the game decides to change resource drain on you and force you to lose.

There is diplomacy and espionage (offensive and defensive) elements to the game, along with voting power for resolutions that can affect a specific house or everyone positively or negatively. 

It is very polished for an EA game (feels like a complete game already) although there frame drops at times (but my pc is aging a bit). 

I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs (aside from a tool tip displaying on the screen when loading the game- which i had to restart the game to get rid of it). 

At first I found this game quite hard. Dropped into the deep end with no Tutorial (at this time of review- likely one will come when they add more content and balancing etc). But i was able to pick up on things since this is a resource management game that has similar elements to the genre. But i found a guide online that helped to explain the core systems of the game and also suggested to only have 1 Ai opponent and play on a small map in easy mode. So i did that and found i am enjoying the game much more, as with most strategy games your first few games is about learning the ropes.

I highly recommend this game.

I had a very hard time devoting time and energy to writing this review due the fact I've playing the game and loving it immensely! I’ve only wrote one review before and that was for the game Plague, Inc. and I said, “this game is terrifying!” And that was it. But’s it true, only because of the fact germ warfare is something many nations are researching. Anyway, enough said, lets get on with the review of Dune: Spice Wars.

This game plays similar to Dune II The Building of a Dynasty by and Dune 2000 with a smattering of Civilization. There’s a little bit of everything in the game: combat, espionage, strategic base and power building, resource harvesting, and diplomacy. The areas I would like to touch on are:

System requirements: not really that steep, I own an Intel and older GPU and have had no problems with FPS or anything else.

Game engine: I’ve encountered no glitches, no bugs, no CTD’s, everything runs smoothly. The devs did a great job with the programming.

In game concepts:

Harvesting: currently, three out of the four factions in the game (Atreides, Harkonnen, and the Smugglers utilize a harvester in order to extract Spice. The Fremen utilize a harvesting camp.	The advantage the camp has over the harvester is that they are rarely attacked by the worms. Harvesters, on the hand, have to be constantly monitored so they don’t fall victim to a worm attack. The downside is that the harvesting camps don’t collect as much spice. As for the harvesters, a way for them to automatically redeploy after the danger of a worm attack has passed would be great. You can assign them to immediately be recovered by a carryall once	there is worm sign, but you have to manually redeploy them yourself which can be tedious.

Construction: when a village is captured either through combat or diplomacy, you have the option of building certain installations that will benefit you in the long run. The buildings here 	are not the issue although if you don’t build enough of them, you can run deficits of resources that can be annoying to rectify. The issue is a building material called Plastcrete which is an invention of the books. Apparently, there’s been a lot of complaints in the gaming 	community about to much Plastcrete is required to build and maintain buildings and there rarely is enough of it. That and Manpower (which is another resource) can run deficits in the game.

Combat: other complaints are certain factional troops are more powerful than others. That is true but players can level the playing field by employing certain sabotage missions available in the espionage window of the game. Combat in the game requires a certain amount of 	preparation. You can’t just through your troops against other faction force and hope for the 	best. That’s a great way to incur huge losses with little gain. Though in the Dune'averse, life is cheap, the spice melange is not, battles that go sideways due to lack of planning can be more expensive spice itself! You can however, direct troops during the battle. Ordering a melee unit to attack a fire support unit in a flanking maneuver can do wonders for your battle plan!
	
Espionage: mainly plays a role in combat although there are missions and operations that can be used against enemy villages and other targets of opportunity that combat is not required. Such missions can wreak havoc on a village, a region, or troops on the ground. Although missions can be expensive, and you need a presence in a particular theatre of clandestine operations in order to pull them off. That and an abundance of Intel, which is also another resource in the game.

Diplomacy: the only real issue I have with diplomacy is that there is no way you can adjust a proposal given to you by the game AI. That seems to be a problem in the Civilization game series to. The inability to make a counter proposal in the game. You have to back out of the Diplomacy screen and initiate a diplomatic session on your own.

Messaging: In the upper right corner of the screen is where messages are conveyed in the form of icons. Some of the messages have a “go to” right click that don’t work. Also it would be nice if whenever you open a window for diplomacy, or espionage, warfare, construction, etc. the game 	pauses. As it stands right now, micromanagement borders on tedium.
	
Research: there is a level of R&D in the game, which seems odd since the game is set in the year 10191 AG (~23,352 AC; https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Universal_Standard_Calendar). You’d think that everything under the sun has already been researched! But not in this game. Of course, what strategic level RTS would be without a research tree. At present the research tree is uniform for the current factions in the base game EA release. All I can hope for is as changes are made, improvements added, that each faction will have their own unique R&D tree. Right 	now there are four branches to the tree, and they are Intelligence, Cultural, Military, and Economic.

Overall, I feel this a good game. Not excellent though, but it’s getting there. Since it's early access, I hope to see changes for the better in the near future.",1651453021,1651453021,True,4,0,0.528402984142303467,0,True,False,True

Though each system may not seem particularly complex by themselves to 4X and RTS veterans, in combination they really compliment each other and all are pretty much equally powerful lending to interesting and varied games where you can never really tell who is closer to victory down to the last second, snowballing isnt much of a thing as each system seems incredibly well ballenced.

This game taps into a neich that seems to have been ignored till now, the short 4X, i never really knew i wanted it till i played this, a full game doesnt usually last more than 4 hours and seems perfectly built for multiplayer, Ive never really played much 4X multiplayer as games can be frustratingly long and difficult to set up and get into. but this game has solved both, there isnt much of a way to edit the game on start other than map size and rather than missing the options im glad theyre gone here it only complicates multiplayers sessions anyway. And on game length 4 hours seems perfect to me, one streaming session, and about as long as people are willing to play one game.

2) Spice should be the central element, here it's a small purple stain found here and there. Harversters are forgettable and worms are... just a notication. No no no no.

3) Factions are dull in a game about factions waging war. Let me have a treaty between Atreides and Harkonnen, yeah, sure whatever. I was playing Atreides and could not feel anything peculiar about this. 

4) Playing whackamole with harvester notifications is not FUN, and after a while, you just ignore it altogether.

5) RTS element do not fit in what was clearly planned as a turn game. Units and fights too are boring.

6) Buildings are 3d models and nothing more. The only useful informations are the small icons below a settlement's name. 

7) After a while the game encourages you to stop expanding, keep an army in the middle of your holdings and run where you spot problems. (Usually an endless streak of unexplicable revolts)

8) Influence, authority, galactic senate, water, etc,etc, didn't you put too many currencies? What about food, shoes, sunscreen, turbans?

9) I cant shoot worms, worms should be renamed ""unexpecetd sand holes"".

10) The emperor, the guild, the bene-gesserit, are missing. The Landsraad experience is something really close to your mother calling every week without having nothing to say.

The game is not hard, at least for me, it's just not very funny and not giving me anything to relate with. The game fails to connect with the world and universe of Dune.

After numerous mission restarts, trying 3 of the 4 factions, the game feels like all the constraints and resource juggling imposed on you are completely ignored by the enemy AI.  In fact your best bet is saving every 2 seconds because the game likes to use everything at it's disposal to fuck with you.  What's that - you want to expand, ok here's a rebellion on the ass end of your empire.  No good? Ok wormsign resulting in your army being swallowed in less than a second with no opportunity to react.  Not enough? How about a raid, a faction attack and a dump of sardukar all at once.

Sure that could be fun to juggle if the resources weren't so ridiculously scarce and every unit lost feels like a massive hit in the early game while every village lost later in the game has the ability to sink you back to the stone age.  And if you somehow manage to balance all the bullshit and it seems like you're doing well, BOOM, you loose! Why, who knows, Landstraad picked Atreides for emperor or some such bullshit.  

Oh and I almost forgot, that worm seems to have a very selective diet, it will only eat player controlled units.  It completely ignores any other units in it's reach.  I've even tried goading enemy units onto a wormsign then quickly running away from it.  As soon as I'm safe the worm just vanishes.

Sure, why not...

If I can beat every civ or endless game and their like and heck if I can beat every Frostpunk scenario (talk about resource management!), then I firmly believe that this game is not properly balanced and the AI definitely isn't bound by the same rules and constraints as the player, which is bullshit.

Speaking of resource management.  Aside from what's already described above there is a serious lack of indicators of current positive or negative statuses on your resource generation.  Sure it shows what is generating and what is using a resource but no clue why I went from a significant surplus to a deficit in 1 day (turn).  Maybe it was a new Landstraad policy, maybe it was a hack, maybe the game just lost it's mind. Nobody knows.

One aspect of the game that I find intriguing is it's espionage system, however it also falls victim to time and resource constraints before the player can fully utilize it.

While the hegemony does theoretically look like an interesting way to slowly progress the complexity of the game, it also falls victim to shitty resource generation/upkeep.  Every single primary base improvement is quite expensive and requires very significant upkeep, so once again the player can only ""window shop"" like a beggar while the AI is flying ahead without a care in the world",1651438566,1651441405,False,4,0,0.539764881134033203,0,True,False,True

Since I saw a lot mentions of this game being complex let me reassure you, it's not. nor are the systems in it. they are just poorly communicated.

Politics
there's real attempt to incorporate the layered politics of Dune into the game but it falls short due to the choice of playable factions which serves to undermine the story of Dune.
The whole landsradd section should be reviesed to be more meaningful.

Where's the emperor? sardukar? not a mention of them.

The game imagines all of the factions (you can play) are at war and they are the only force that exists on Dune. it's a bit lackluster and unimaginative.

Balancing
The choice of playable factions hurts balancing and the AI actions are curious at best.
It also seems the AI can cheat it's way to victory with ease in certain cases with no limit to its ability to field units and accumulate resources.
There's also plenty to be said about spies and the landsradd but I'll spare you as this is a review.

Graphics/Music
Graphics are not to write home about but standard for such a title.
The soundtrack is interesting.
There's no story or plot.

This game, much like other works related to Dune, uses Dune as a theme and borrows a lot from Dune but in the end it is its own thing which has only loose connection to the actual story in the books.

There is horrible balancing and progression of your ""villages."" The tutorial is mediocre, and its only troops in your army. Where is the tanks, land vehicles, and specialty tanks and military equipment and other vehicles? Your villages have building slots, and you can only build something per slot unlocked. Resources are extremely limited, you can only build refineries (gives you 1 harvester) on specific territories with spice fields which slows your solaris production (currency needed for buildings, army upkeep etc). 
Played nearly 4 hours and every single new game I played it has been incredibly slow and actually boring. You can only have like 5-6 troops squads at a time...and the enemy houses AND rebel raiders attack you with more troops than you have every single time. The only way to increase your troop slot availability is to research certain tech, and upgrade your main base (which unlocks later). 

THIS IS NOT LIKE DUNE 2000 or EMPEROR BATTLE FOR DUNE..... this is drastically different and MUCH WORSE. Dune 2000 had more buildings, actually had tanks and specialty land vehicles. This game has zero vehicles, so all battles involve troops only. Battle animations are subpar and underwhelming, as well as the overall building art and quality. Game stutters some which is understandable for an early access... but this game is essentially missing..... well, a game really. 
I was hoping a new and modernized Dune 2000 game given the movie hype and game announcements.... but this game is subpar for $30. I wouldn't even pay $20 knowing what I know since playing this game.

I hope the entire game changes and has more player freedom, and less restricted game play based on slow mechanics and things that don't make sense. Go back to the BASE BUILDING concept that actually worked in the older Dune games. The territories being spread out on a grid-like map like Humankind, and Civilization, does NOT work for this type of game that worked best as an original RTS game.

This game was fun to play. 

Its not your typical RTS game and is much slower than what you would assume. 

Also reading the other reviews, it doesn't have as much combat as a standard RTS. 

All that being said I'm still really enjoying the game play. Its not really a true dune game, but it takes a little from the Dune universe..

I really wish they took more from the book and not the new movie. Also seeing some laziness in design, when playing the Fremen and riding a worm, all riders disappear inside the worm, instead of riding the worm. (Meh)

I've had 3 major blue screen crashes in my 6.7 hours of play time, resulting in a total loss of progress from the last save. 

Updating my review to ""No"" I really dont like the capping of resource storage. It again shows laziness in game design. I have no idea how Fremen could be capped on spice storage. That makes zero sense.. Then pushing a continually increasing ""Guild bribe"".. The result for the user isn't fun, it changes how and what you focus on. 

I'd wait and hope they improve the game design.

I do say that there is a lot of potential in this Early Access, and honestly this is probably one of the cleanest EAs I have ever played, it is very stable and honestly surprisingly enjoyable. Now that much said... Let me go into the Pros, Cons and Misc and a final commentary

Pros:
- Good visuals, the game is nice to look at and the animations are good for an Early Access game
- Interesting mechanics for a start, the economy is simple and straightforward once you get through your initial trial run, no non-sense stuff here. Spice Harvest + ""Gold""(I forgot what its called) = Money, Metal harvesters (I forgot what that is called too) to get your metal, Recruitment centers to get your manpower up and windtraps to get that water + a few bonus centers to get those points up. Along with research, influence and Hegemony stuff...
- Good diversity in factions, though I hope there will be more of them where I feel they do show a good fidelity of being faithful to the books more or less(Save for the Harkonen's colors which should be Blue and Orange).
- Nice ambient music. Though hope they add more tracks to the list.

Cons:
- Diplomacy is lacking, meaning you do not have that much options nor do you have the possibility of making an alliance
- Lack of a good tutorial
- The War side of things is a bit lack luster but it does work
- Some minor bugs, but nothing gamebreaking

Misc:
- This game rewards spice hoarding whroes
- The Spice must flow!
- Sandworms can eat things and people! I saw a whole Harkonen Army get swallowed whole, it made me smile
- Airports for most factions are vital, the Fremen ride the worm
- Balance is key

Final notes:
I am very impressed by this Early Access of Spice Wars, I was expecting this game to be in a bit more messy start, since I do have some minor bad memories with Funcom in EA(Conan Exiles), but! Honestly this game is a labor of love! And I do recommend at least keeping an eye on it if you're a fan of 4x games and also Dune. Now for those who were expecting a dune 2/2000 will be disappointed, there is no House Ordos, they were a minor house to begin with and should not be added(Read the books), secondly this is a 4x game played in Real time(So technically an RTS), but not the basic RTS you were expecting such as C&C, Starcraft and CoH, if you want that faster pace action, look elsewhere.

- Very well polished as I would expect from Shiro, even in pre-release.
- Very much like Northgard however this style of game fits very well with the Dune universe with its multi-dimensional complexity. 
- The art, music, and sound effects I find all very good. 
- They were about as faithful to the original series as they could be without making the game restrictive. 

Cons:
- The combat is meh. Essentially zero tactical elements. I feel like the 4D aspect of the game could be preserved while still introducing some more unit choices, positioning advantages, unit specific upgrades etc.

On that note, the 2 or 3 short games I played were more of a learning phase and by the 4th game I'd pretty much figured out how the mechanics and politics work in the game.  It's fairly easy to amass an abundance of wealth fairly quickly as long as you don't expand too quickly. The first game I won by becoming the Governor of Dune for 60 days, which I felt was way too easy to achieve as the Atreides with their enormous voting power, and didn't really feel like a meaningful win. 

In my second game as the Fremen it seems like I'm already at a disadvantage when it comes to the faction voting system as I don't have as much voting power as the other houses.  I'm not a fan of only being allowed to have 5 buildings per village, but I understand that this encourages expansion across Arrakis.  One of the win conditions for Dune is to destroy your enemies bases, which I found interesting when you consider the main base of enemy factions have like 20,000hp and would require a substantially sized force to destroy, which seems to make the politics side of winning more of the focus. 

Overall, the game seems to lack any kind of actual substance once you win your first game and with the price they're asking I expected a lot more content.  A lot of factions all have similar if not the same kind of buildings that give the same benefits.  The games all seem to unfold in similar ways, with political attacks being the main focus of winning. While the units have differing abilities, that buff friendlies or debuff enemies, none of the fights seem meaningful or difficult in the long-term and as long as you're giving supply drops to your troops, any sizeable force can move pretty swiftly from village to village without penalty.  A large focus of the game just seems to be on resource management and building your influence on Arrakis to eventually attempt to assassinate the leaders of the opposing houses. 

In it's current state I would probably tell people to wait for more content as there really isn't much variation in gameplay between the houses when it comes to base building / forming an army and the entire focus of the game is based around performing special operations against opposing houses to obtain more political control of Arrakis.",1651416951,1651417005,False,9,0,0.521208465099334717,0,True,False,True

1.unit build limit : Limited number of units you can use as with emperor battle for dune you had  troops , vehicle units and air units and even depending on who you allied with you got either freemen units or sardaukar units Ixians units or Tleilaxu units with no limits.
2: Base Limit :  A main base is all you get in this game with a limited selection of buildings where as other strategy games you can build more bases to expand and build troops from them. 
3: Story Line : granted that both Dune spice wars and emperor battle for dune don't have a great story line in spice wars you choose a house play for say 12 hours and the game is done.... finished , emperor battle for dune choose your house complete the little mission and begin attacking other regions keeping you busy for say 40 + hours to finish the game.

Technology : Nice touch adding that part into the game but focuses to much on political aspect of the game not into say unit upgrades or building upgrades.
Graphics : Nice and smooth in the game with very good detail to the environment , troops and buildings.

Early Access review: Strong fundamentals for a Dune themed 4X strategy game.

Unlike other games the espionage and diplomacy are strong features and not just window dressing. I would still like to see a lot more happening in this space such as events related to both these systems.

Some more voice acting, stronger music titles and other thematic gameplay events (I am thinking of stellaris) are needed to flesh things out further.

And end game crisis like the Sardukar arriving would be cool ( I saw some in one of my games but have no idea how or why they appeared and then disappeared while working for another faction).

Better tooltips are definitely needed with there being no explanation for a number of in game mechanics particularly for late game techs and units. A proper tutorial is also clearly going to be needed for most people.",1651398911,1651398911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is not at all like the Westwood Dune RTS games. The game is completely playable in the current (April 2022) Early Access state. The same advice goes for early access and pre-orders: don't assume what the game will be or might be when deciding to spend money, base your purchase decision on what you know it is today.

The core gameplay is solid and that's why it gets a recommend from me. I've enjoyed my first 10ish hours in the game and played 3 different factions. The Harkonnen and Atreides play similarly but the Fremen are very different. The devs have said at least 1 more faction will be added by the full release date. I hope they continue to make the factions play more differently to emphasize different mechanics in the game.

The biggest gaps in the game as it is now come from content and balance as you'd expect in Early Access. There is no campaign mode or multiplayer yet though the devs say those are coming. The rebellion covert operation ability is really overpowered in the mid and late-game since it can be used on any territory you own, starts with 0 warning, and destroys every structure you have in a region in addition to turning the region neutral if it succeeds. Some of the resource mechanics also need some tuning like manpower (used to build military units and structures) and authority (used to capture new regions) which feel really restrictive in the early game.

On the downside I think this game really needs a tutorial. Apparently while mining spice I needed to periodically stop spice mining when a worm was detected...sounds great. except...how do I do that exactly? Game doesn't tell you...so my troops died. Also, I have to pay a bribe to the guild...and I didn't have the spice in time because I didn't know how to build a spice collector (or how to pause mining as I mention above). You have several things on the map and it is not always clear how to interact with them (some things require agents...which I still don't know how to make), some require regular units and some you can't interact with directly (only via a local village after you capture it). 

All these things seem cool, but without a tutorial explaining how to do things it is just frustrating. For an EA game I think this is pretty good, as it is pretty well developed. For a newcomer though, expect to die a lot as you figure things out through trial and error like I am still doing. 

Also, the game does slow down quite a bit at this stage (EA i know) so that will likely go away when the game is further optimized, just know that it is currently an issue. 

Overall I would get this if I were you, just expect to do some trial and error until they make a real tutorial mission to explain the key concepts of the game. 


Edit: ok so the lack of a tutorial is annoying but even worse is the AI...even on easy it is crazy...this game needs to have the :""difficult"" tag added or they need to fix the AI.

All that being said, the game is early access for a good reason. I was introduced to Shiro Games through Northgard and was blown away at their potential. They have come back again and surprised me once more. The issues of the game stuttering made it difficult to play later on and the balancing will need to be worked on tremendously. It’s early access so its within the realm of expectation. The neutral tiles in the Desert made it basically impossible to traverse anywhere. Now throw in a bunch of faction AI and it’s chaos. You need a better managment supply system besides having to spam supply drops to cross desert tiles. It’s not always possible to forge a path of my own territory when neutral factions will just beat the crap out of you and take all your stuff anyway. It’s better to race against the clock and charge forward despite resource drains that could happen any minute. However,  I found myself waiting around a lot to collect resources. And the bad moments would only happen  after waiting a bit causing me to rethink my plans lol. It’s not like I had a crappy income, but more or so the mechanisms controlling authority weren’t entirely clear besides growing my empire to be a big size and using the propaganda authority moments when they arrived in the council to be voted on. I got there in the end and won my second game with a domination victory. I actually lost my very first match I played and that was only on medium difficulty lol.

Currently, the learning curve is steep and the ""tutorials"" are very quickly and roughly written. The AI difficulty setting is there for decoration. The only thing it does is to shift how fast the AI expands.

Speaking of AI. Your flying units are just plain stupid. While the enemy (Harkonen) sent over 5 ornithopters (if memory serves me well per the name) scanning all over my area, my own 2 wouldn't even dare enter the Harkonen area on auto. I had to manually send them there. In short, the AI needs a massive amount of work.

To add to the pile.
The enemy appears to have infinite resources and an unreal number of armies that they can almost insta-deliver anywhere on the map at will. If you, as the player, tried to maintain so many units, you'd be bankrupt in a few clicks.

On generic mechanics.
The spice ""bribe"" is just awkward, so if the map doesn't favor you with a spice deposit nearby, you'll stack up on penalties early on. The costs are absurd and you have a resource cap, which is rather low if you consider the humongous costs later in the game. 

As per the vote system, etc, I kept on getting some sort of ""sanctions"" for ""interfering"" with another faction (Harkonen), when I hadn't even seen them on the map. In short, it's broken.
The spy system is broken as well, as you will find yourself losing villages from the ""far edge of the galaxy."" What I mean is that unlike the ""spy buildings"" that need to be close to the enemy, the ""operations"" are invisible and have infinite range. They are effective for the AI, but not for the player. I sent elite units to a Harkonen village, debuffed the crap out of it and the Harkonens kept on sending in ships loaded with more and more armies.

The game is a nice effort but it's very broken. There are no crashing bugs, but the engine behind the beautiful graphics is next to a wreck. 

I've already purchased three early releases thus far, and two of them have been bad. Only one was good. This one, however, is the lowest. I'm getting really tired of paying to be a beta tester. The AI/engine needs a lot and I mean a lot of work.

Absolutely, but I will have to up the difficulty rating! (It also didn’t take 55 hours to complete it was more like 2. This is the problem with leaving your computer on and the game running in the background – I didn’t find the music offensive) 
Are there things I wish were different? 
Of course, but this is life and we don't get everything we want! However, as this is early access, I am really hoping that they will be adding some extra features to really extend the gameplay and incorporate some elements that really immerses you into the world of Arrakis. 
I have been eagerly waiting for this game for ever! I used to play the earlier incarnations of Dune and loved the way you could completely smash opposing armies with some well-placed turrets and walls to funnel them into a death trap. 
I enjoyed amassing huge armies with no particular use and then overrunning the enemies’ bases. The evil laughs could be heard half way down the street, as my battalions would pummel the evil Harkonen into the ground. 
Yes, the graphics were awful by todays standards but there was a charm and a love that I will never forget.
Is Dune Spice Wars the same game? No, it isn’t and I will be honest I am glad that it isn’t. There is potential for a lot more depth to this game, you have to think things through and decisions made earlier on can have interesting consequences later. That being said, it still needs to learn what made games before it so iconic and well loved.
I think there was a tutorial, but it was a small button on the left and I missed it. You do get instructions on what things are when you first use them and it was useful but the gameplay is quite intuitive and it wasn’t that hard to get to grips with the main screen.
The Lansrad and Intrigue sections however were not exactly easy to understand and even as someone who knows of the books and previous games some of this was difficult. It really requires some greater explanation and maybe a simpler interface that develops as the player gets better acquainted with what the different parts are for. This could maybe be developed through research areas.
Research is another area that I really didn’t pay that much attention too. It was difficult to see what I was getting by researching anything at all. The tree is all labels with information when you hover over it. Sometimes I would spend a little time choosing one but usually I just clicked on one I liked the sound of. It didn’t seem to make much difference to my overall strategy but I am sure some experienced gamers would be able to use them for a quicker victory.
One of the interesting areas is trade, I never accepted a trade from another faction because you only get 60 seconds to decide if you like the deal. It always feels one sided and I would much rather play around and work out what I needed by initiating trade myself. You soon get an idea for what something is worth and different factions have different trade amounts. So, it is worth checking if you can trade cheaper with someone else. Did this cost mem in the long run? Maybe, but I still managed to complete the game with a political victory pretty easily. 
The spice tax is annoying at first. I have just harvested all that and now the emperor is going to take it all off me. But it is actually a really good way of ensuring players do not become super rich, too easily. In the older game if you controlled the spice fields then the game was already over. Here there is much more at stake. I generally just set my trade between coins and spice to just cover the tax each month. I have no idea what happens if you miss a payment as it seemed almost impossible to do in easy.
When harvesting, sandworms love to attack, but I only lost one harvester in the entire game and that was because someone had used gear infiltration and it broke down and was not airlifted out. I put the harvesters on auto recall on sandworms and then immediately deployed once they returned to base. The sand worms had left by this point. It didn’t really make a dent in my spice production so makes the whole idea a little pointless. I will be honest, I think the game could do with a few more of these amazing beasts, swallowing up entire armies in battle.
What else would I like?
Only one type of each building is allowed. This means that you cannot build multiple defence systems for your towns. This essentially leaves them open to attack while you then airlift in some forces from somewhere else and quell the attack. It was never difficult. I managed most attacks with 3 squadrons and one arial support vehicle. 
The battle scenes are messy. It is hard to see who is attacking who and at some points I did wish I was playing the older games. 
Personally, I would find it much more interesting if when I town is being attacked you were able to take a bird’s eye view to control troops and move them to places where they could attack or defend. At the moment it seems more like as long as your numbers are high you can win any battle. I was also unable to control the troops stationed in the town. I might have missed something in the tutorial but it seemed as though they just run-on auto pilot. Sadly, they didn’t have much sense and were always the first to die. As long as you have troops available then the battles are pointless in easy.
Placing new buildings is almost pointless. In the main city they just expand when you build something. This might as well be the case for the towns and villages as the only thing that seems to have any benefit form being spaced at a different point is the gun turret. This is so you can defend multiple areas at once if you position it correctly.
I am a city builder at heart and maybe that is why I want more of these sorts of elements but this is a game that is crying out for something a little more.
Cut scenes would be great. The characters are lazy and simple at the moment and need some soul adding to them.
All in all it was good, I will play it again but I might leave it a few weeks. That to me says everything, I didn’t put planet coaster down for 2 weeks. But it felt like there was so much more to discover there and I don’t quite get the same feeling here.
I will play it again but I really hope that there are a few updates to make this a game that I really don’t want to put down.

But I've also been an avid Northgard player over the last several years, which was also developed by Shiro. The games are similar in concept but have a different execution and feel. D:SW feels much slower-paced, with longer games, but so far I've really enjoyed it—for many of the same reasons I like Northgard.

Being an Early Access title that was only recently released, it has little more to it than its main game mode which you can only play in singleplayer at the moment, but what's there feels like a very solid foundation and I was quite surprised how well the gameplay is fleshed out. I've experienced very few bugs, and while it probably could use some balance passes, it's very playable (and re-playable). I've played plenty of non-Early Access titles that launched in much worse condition.

I've seen these games described as 4X/RTS hybrids, which is probably a fair assessment. There's plenty of exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating to do. For the latter, there's definitely plenty of fighting to do, but the combat is much slower than a traditional RTS (which makes micro very easy, even if there wasn't a pause feature), and you won't be running around with nearly as many units. But that allows you to focus more on macromanagement of your empire and diplomacy/politics, not to mention exploring. The game may be slow paced but I would say it's far from boring and there's usually always something to keep your attention.

In short, I'm definitely excited about the future of this product, and I hope it's supported for many years to come as Northgard has been, with plenty of additional features and factions (more than anything, I would really love to eventually see something similar to Northgard's Conquest mode).",1651367404,1651367437,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Note: Played through with Atreides.

Villages: First foray with the tutorial explained some basic concepts then let you go.  The limited development space in the villages drives a definite min max mindset and makes village development extremely repetitive.  You need a recruitment center, water trap, plasticrete then two more buildings likely dictated by the resources nearby.  

Your Capital: Your capital city is basically just a pretty set piece.  From the feel of it, the capital is supposed to be a major part of your strategy.  It isn't.  The game didn't last long enough to really build it up.  I built three military buildings in the capital.  They didn't really change the gameplay.  My units seemed just as squishy as ever and did not seem to kill anything any faster even with 20% boosts to combat power.

Resource Management:  Oh man, get ready to tear your hair out.  You can go from steady +100 solari to -45 in a heartbeat and never know why because it suddenly boosts right back up into the green.  All the other resources like plasticrete and water do the same.  Spice, influence and authority all stayed steady.  Manpower was also very troublesome.  The cost of a unit's manpower isn't uniform.  You might make a unit and not have a significant reduction.  You might make another of the same unit and then your manpower production drops into the negative.  Now, you might be thinking that the diplomatic resolutions might be to blame.  These fluctuations happened without any political resolutions for or against the faction in play.

The AI:  It's set to vengeful omniscient toddler.  It knows where your army is, where your militia is weak and will not hesitate to kick over your sandcastle at any opportunity.  The AI's units are also brutal.  Four basic units are able to overwhelm two missile launchers and 4 heavy militia.  

Diplomacy:  Essentially useless.  Didn't make treaties or trade.  The AI rarely offered anything worthwhile.  The council resolutions were a distraction, but not in a good way.  You never knew if you were going to get stuck with some increased water tax or some other equally annoying penalty.  

Espionage:  My god.  You can destroy a foe with rebellions.  To put down and reverse a rebellion you have to kill the rebels then sit on the city until it flips back over.  The AI will use these mercilessly.  

Winning:  I won the diplomatic victory by accident.  I don't really know what to say about that.

It has the same intriguing early game, and at least for me the same sluggish late game that seems to drag on forever.

The early game keeps you on your toes with your resource production always seeming to make you go negative on some, but the pace of expansion at least for me is almost always limited by the available “authority” required to capture a village.

There is no way to realistically control more than half of the villages before the game ends and the late game is mostly comprised of ferrying your army from village to village, only ever losing a unit if you forget to move as the espionage mechanics almost makes it too easy to keep your army alive.

The game is similar to Northgard, with all the good and the bad that comes with it.

1) The amount of spice you need to bribe the empire with always goes up. By a few hours into the game, you will have an extremely high spice tax rate that you will be forced to contribute. Failure to do so brings some really hefty consequences to one or more of your resources. And, it gets worse - it compounds each time the deadline is missed.
2) Given much more major battles exist in the end game, you would think there would be some way to offset the amount of spice you need to contribute; or a way to gain independence from them. There isn't.
3) REALLY SEVERE debufs exist in the game, and exacerbate further when other factions start messing with your manpower and health restore on your troops. I am TOTALLY against magic debufs, and this game has a LOT of them!
4) The periodic faction voting is meant to debuf another faction so you gain an upper hand on them. I hate it personally. It should be votes on actually meaningful things, not just everyone against me. I find myself putting all of my votes into stopping the worst of the consequences so I don't get debuffed to death! It's stupid and really pointless. It needs a serious overhaul!
5) The units. You have soldiers, but there's a MASSIVE penalty to having them... but you need them, or you'll die quickly. The more units you have the more manpower you don't have. You have to offset this with a bunch of recruitment stations all over the place by the time the game is well underway. Even then, if the enemy messes with the manpower or your health regen - you're cooked.
6) Units don't have any specialty skills or icons. They're just a unit with more or less number values than another. It would be nice to have the military line unlock special skills that a unit can perform, or a defensive or offensive boost. As it stands now, the game is more worried about unit consumption of manpower, power, and water; all of which is of no affect during a battle.
7) There is NO warning or visual affect for an NPC village that's about to start a riot and take back your village, even if you used the House Atreides and peacefully annexed the village (which IMO should sharply buff villager happiness as opposed to a hostile takeover). They just pop literally out of thin air and attack you for no reason, and with a LOT of force. You're lucky if you can get there on time to stop it unless you have a fast way to transport troops there in time. There really needs to be a warning or happiness icon for your villages that are just not happy.

It's early access, so I expect bugs, but I just don't find the game fun in its current state. Its design allows very few deviations from a few cut-and-dry methods of winning. And, you'd be best off getting the win quickly before the spice tax rises to a level you can't afford. Good luck with that if you try for any other victory type except hegemony. As such, its replayability will seriously diminish after you try out each faction.

It reminds me of the older Dune board game in how it plays, where you'll win or lose in a single fell swoop that you've been organizing and getting ready to deploy for the hours you've been playing.

It plays as a mix of 4X Empire builder and Real Time Strategy, similar in a vein to games like Stellaris or other Paradox games. 

ABSOLUTELY GET THIS GAME, IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

In one game I played as the Fremen, and organized a huge spy network against the entire world. I caused constant uprisings within the Smugglers so they'd be busy fighting themselves, held back the Harkonnen with my military, and made alliances and friends with the Atriedes. While I eliminated the Smugglers with my army, I assisted the Duke in killing the Harkonnen military and burning Carthag to the ground. I'm sure the Duke would have loved to see our victory, but my assassin finished up his operation only half a day later and slew him, leaving me the victory.

In another game, I played as the Baron Harkonnen, and took a more direct apporach. My army stormed across native villages, plundering spice reserves and taking points of interest, and killed the Smugglers and the Atriedes by brute force by first getting them to devastate each other, then sweeping up. The Fremen remained resolute by amassing a massive army to oppose me, but two staged uprisings caused by me crippled their spice mining and their economy, forcing them to march their entire army in to restore order ASAP. As the blinding light of my Family Atomics sterilized the rebellious region and any army that might have been there, my massive army supported by the Landsraad Guard marched into Sietch Tabr, unopposed.

It's so good. There's so many tricky things to do to pull out a W, and so many ways the AI actually surprise you, ecspecially on harder difficulties.

As a big Dune fan myself, I can certainly say that Dune: Spice wars is a love letter to the Dune franchise and is made by developers that are passionate about IP as much as the biggest Dune fans. In Dune: Spice wars you control one of the four available factions and try to take over the planet of Arrakis by either taking out your enemies, making political treaties, or having control over most of the planet. You will harvest Spice, send troops into battle, build military bases, and so much more. For an early access title I can say that Dune: Spice Wars has pretty solid first impressions to where I can justify the hefty 30 dollar asking price. But the game isn't perfect unfortunately, there is a very poor tutorial system to where most players are going to youtube to find more in depth tutorial videos, there are mixed performance issues like stuttering when troops start battling one another, and the UI can be clunky and confusing at times which doesn't coincide with there being a bad tutorial system. But like I said the game is in early access so hopefully with time these issues will be fixed. So as of now I can absolutely recommend this game for any fan of Dune or 4x and RTS games in general. 8/10",1650986779,1651357888,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,True

I'm glad to say that I haven't been disappointed.

Pros:
The Art style; it's fantastic and really helps bring this setting to life 
Unique faction playstyles; each faction has very unique playstyle and makes this game replayable
Different avenues to victory; to ability to win through the landsraad or through espionage as well as through conquest makes this game unique compared to its predecessors of the 2000s 
The Spice; I was able to beat the Harkonnes, who were on the cusp of winning, in my first play through by cutting off their spice production which turned the landsraad and the other factions against them, I guess controlling the spice does give you the universe
The Faction AI; each of the factions follow different paths to victory and are willing to engage in diplomacy but are willing to stab you in the back when there is an opening, this is something over games have struggled with in recent times as either the AI wants to get in bed with you or kill you, no matter what you do.

I'll take another look at Cons when the game exits early access 

What I would love to see (although some of it is quite a bit to do) would be:
More factions such as House Corrino, the Tleilaxu or the Bene Gesserit 
Unique stories for each of the player factions
Victory cutscenes
More unit diversity i.e a unit of Atredies Fremen lead by Duncun or Ex-Atredies lead by Halleck (if either the Fremen are beaten or if the Atredies are beaten)
Random events, speaks for itself 

If you're looking for a Dune game then this is a must buy
If you're looking for purely a strategy game then I'd hang on a little while until a bit more is added

If you were hoping for a more standard RTS like Dune II or Dune 2000, this might not be for you however.

NB: I won't criticise missing features, like multiplayer, as I'm writing this at the time of the initial Early Access release.
Pros
- It's a Dune game, and a fairly faithful one at that. More faithful than the old Westwood RTS games.
- A strong espionage system, when most 4Xs tend to have weak, ineffectual espionage systems.
- All the factions feel unique in terms of mechanics, with good asymmetry.
- The AI opponents are actually challenging on harder difficulties.
Cons
- While fairly faithful, some aspects of the game seems odd from a lore perspective (e.g. drone units)
- The combat side of things is very basic by RTS standards, and the unit variety is limited.
- The artstyle is a matter of taste. I'd say the environment looks lovely, but not everyone might like the character and unit designs.
- Some of the councillor choices for certain factions seem underpowered or too niche to be useful.

I do like the fact that you are thrown into the game with no tutorial and no back story, gives you the feel like you are alone in the sands of dune which is pretty much how you would feel in real life i suppose.  I have played Dune 2k when i was just a kid and it was awesome thought this would bring back those fond memories. 


Dislike
- there is a population Cap
-To much going on you. You  have to manage the upkeep of your city plus the upkeep of spice for the emperor, and don't forget the upkeep for your army which takes solaris which you use to get spice for your emperor oh and the upkeep for your buildings
-No tanks, NO trikes, No quads, No siege tanks, no missile tanks
- No Ordos ( my favorite faction in Dune 2k)
- a limit on the building you can have in one village which is 5 and each upgrade to construction slot in the city  is a cost of stone 
- you only have 4 choices of soldiers
 

Likes 
-Dune base game
-City builder 
- No tutorial and No back story ( i like this cause you are in charge of making your own city with its own story)
- political side of the game 
- nice graphics 

if this does not push you away from buying and playing the game then try your luck and have some fun just mind the upkeep, the upkeep is real and it is a killer.

It's a little more slow-paced compared to regular RTS. A great game for relaxing strategic gameplay, which is good for someone who is into RTS games, but does not want to torture oneself with delivering insane apm. Nevertheless, micro can save you big time and can be used for advantage even versus outnumbered blobs.

Combat looks simple, but in fact, has a lot of depth in addition to regular rock-paper-scissors.

Base building is mostly focused on giving you resources. It does not feel obnoxious or annoying. And there are a lot of resources, but their purpose is obvious and well thought out.

There is also a lot of political/world mechanics that add a nice vibe to the game. These require some micro-management and are what most of your apm would go into.

Factions are played completely differently as they are focused on different resources, have different mechanics to them, and have access to different in-game events and technologies. 
Units are different too but are used for similar purposes. Some are completely different, the other have parameter/cost/special effect deviation. Squads feel very DoW style, they feel precious and gain ranks. There are no vehicles, unfortunately (maybe in full release idk) except for some drones. I'd be glad to have access to devastators etc.

Balance opinion is currently non-existent since there is no multiplayer yet (but confirmed) and the game has been out for less than a week. However, some of the units feel like garbage to me.

There are fps drops and ui bugs, but those are being fixed as the game is still in EA.

Many of the negative reviews say that this is bad because it's not Dune 2000 or because it is a re-skin of Northgard. I did not play Northgard, so I can not tell you if it is. But I did play Dune 2000 a lot. As much as I like regular RTS games, the genre is quite dead at the moment, so I completely understand why the released game is not an RTS in its traditional form. Remember how fans of the DoW games massacared DoW3 because it was not something they expected, which did ruin an ok game. Moreover, this is not Dune 2022, but a completely different game made by a different studio, just in the same setting, so please relax. Some of the other reviews say that the factions are reskins of one another, which is definitely not true. 
As for my personal preference, I completely despise games like Civilization, but this game gave me a lot of hours of enjoyment despite having some similarities.

In conclusion, I did enjoy this game a lot in its current state. Do not let negative reviews saying ""that's not what I wanted"" ruin your perception of this wonderful game.",1651348543,1651348543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Spice Wars is a pared down real time strategy game. It's simple and reletively straight forward in the options it presents. If you've ever played Sins of Solar Empire, it reminded me a lot of that.

 You have four playable factions, you capture cities and build them up in a predictable way to juggle your resources. The most fun I had was figuring out that juggling act, because once you do, there aren't a lot of creative choices in how you set up your board. It feels like one of the things that could use some expansion as the game moves forward. 

You have research, military, and espionage. There's some wiggle room here, but it's all in service of a game play loop that is basically a more complicated version of risk. You move troops here and there and try to overtake enemy series. 

Complicated Risk really is the most apt description. Even though there are other win conditions, you're working towrds them by defending and expanding for resources. There's no multiplayer yet, but it feels more like a board game to play with friends than a video game often times.

The big down side I'm seeing as is is the lack of explanation or tutorial. If you like guides and don't like figuring things out, you'll have problems. Is it that complicated? No, not at all. But you should probably factor that in because some people clearly don't like the discovery process in a game. 

Is it fun? Yes. Is it a lot of fun? Not really. For a thirty dollar price tag it's fair, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they build this up.

This is a wonderful snack-sized take on the 4x genre. My first game took 4 hours to complete, which felt great considering I've never finished another 4x game at all. I'm excited for all the variations of advisors and agents, possibly win conditions or Landsraad events.

The RTS aspect is integral to the gameplay, but not overwhelming. I felt like I was making strategic choices instead of worrying about micromanagement during every engagement. 

The Tax vs Solari balance was fun to play with once I understood how to change it (a tutorial will be very appreciated in the future, but even a smooth brain like me figured out all the aspects of the game in under 30 minutes)

I'm hoping this is a game that will be fun to play with friends on a casual weekend instead of the usual ""play Civ 6 for 3 hours, someone has to leave, then the game is dead forever"" loop.

4.5/5, there were some performance issues and AI isn't the best (pathing of units was...rough) but those are understandably EA features and the core game is solid.",1651341857,1651341857,True,0,1,0.493147313594818115,0,True,False,True

This is game reminds me more of Endless Legends. Limited number of units, grid map and have an ability to call special commands on tiles. If you liked Endless Legends, then I recommend you get this game. Now lets talk about the game itself.

It is an Early Access so keep it in mind, this is not a final product. It has balancing issues, there is some stuttering even on RTX 3080ti and you will find yourself going from positive to negative rather quickly. Are all these issues game breaking ? No, they just make it a bit more challenging. Do no expect all factions to be the same. Their difference going beyond cosmetics or what leaders you pick, the units play different depending on the faction. And this is very fun expect which allows for alot of replayability. 

So if you like Dune and Endless Legends, than pick this up. And dont listen to the all the people that say Early Access is bad.

Dune: Spice Wars is an RTS, but not of the same sort of Dune 2, Dune 2000, or Emperor: Battle for Arrakis.

In those games, you gathered spice to earn credits to build a base on a small map constested by other factions that were doing the same, then proceeded to flood the map with units (infantry, tanks, and even mechs and other stuff unheard-of in the Dune lore) to overwhelm your opponents and destroy their base. Typical Starcraft-like game loop.
Instead, in Dune: Spice War, you are fighting for the whole northern hemisphere of the planet on every match. Your rivals start on opposite ends from your starting point, and you all slowly start conquering the regions, looking for the ones that offer you the greatest benefits and support the strategy that you decide to follow to take you to victory.
And strategy does matter here. You have to scout your surroundings and your opponents to determine what are your strength and your weaknesses, and those of your rivals. Do you have lots of money producing sources nearby? Spice fields? Strategically important special regions that give you a political, intelligence, economical, or militaristic perk?

Should you really go for an open war? Or is it most beneficial for you, your faction, and the nature of your regions to use subterfuge, influence on the Landsraad (the galactic senate in the Dune universe), or just turtle your way to an economical victory thru hegemony?

Indeed, in this game, you can defeat your opponents without ever going to war against them. For example, as Smugglers, you get most of your income from installing underworld headquarters on your rivals' cities, leeching off their economy. So, obviously, war is bad for business for you in this case. On my last game as them, I kept to myself, while the other factions were killing each other. I organized the assasination of Leto Atreides and the Fremen leader, then won in the end by the hegemony I had gathered from buying stocks of the CHOAM (Space Amazon in the Dune lore), pillaging neutral villages, and taking over the north pole.

That is just to illustrate how unique this game is among the pantheon of games based on the Dune lore. Which, if you know anything about, you'll agree that much better represents the Dune books and movies by allowing and encouraging the kind of things that happen in them. 

Another example, while playing as Atreides, I turtled on my regions, defending from Harkonnen attacks, and trading with Fremen and Smugglers for the resources I was lacking. I won, but I didn't militaristically defeat any of my rivals. Instead, I grew so popular on the Landsraad, that I got the Governor chapter that gave me the victory. (In the lore, the entire story starts precisely with the Emperor fearing that Leto Atreides is getting too popular on the Landsraad and becoming a threat, so he puts things in motion to get him killed).

If you want to go and win with an army, of course that is also an option. All factions can win this way, with some of them having more tricks than others.
Just, don't expect an endless catalogue of different units including tanks, bikes, trikes, mechs, etc. Dune 2/2k/Emperor really went a bit off rails with this. In the Dune lore, most of the battles are fought by infantry running on foot on the deserts of Dune, and this game fully keeps that that way.
There are just a few different units per faction, each with a very specific role. 
Also, your army will be composed by between 6 to 12 units tops, each of them representing a batallion or a division in an abstracted way. Do not expect the Dune 2/2k-style seas of tanks rolling down the desert to flood the opponent.

Espionage is also a great part of the game. Placing agents on the different areas (your rivals, Arrakis, and other galactic institutions like the Landsraad, the Spacing Guild, the CHOAM, etc) unlocks interesting ""Operations"" that you can acquire and use. 
Some give you influence on the Landsraad or hegemony for Hegemony victory. Some others give you buffs or nerfs in battle. And some others let you assassinate your rivals!
Do not underestimate the Espionage research tree, because this stuff is really powerful.

Finally, the pace of the game is slower than in the other RTS in the franchise. Here it matters more that you plan your actions very well, and you build a strong economy that can sustain your efforts. 
Expanding too fast, or building too many units will surely chock you with upkeeps. Take it easy, but with firm steps.

My veredict is that I love this game, already in Early Access. They will keep on adding stuff to it, so it can only get better.
If you are looking for a classic RTS game like Dune 2/2k, C&C, Starcraft, then this is not it.

So, disclaimer over and done with, lets get down to the nitty gritty. Are you a fan of Dune (Especially books)? Are you a fan of 4X? Then this game, even in it's current state is something you should give a try! Easily one of the most playable and polished early access titles I've had the pleasure of playing.

PROS:
1. Very polished for an early access game. (But still early access!) I have not had a single crash in about 40 hours.
2. It is unmistakingly a Dune game. The graphics, the systems and everything in it is true to the Dune legacy.
While not extremely large in scope for a 4X game (Stellaris, you've ruined us for 4X!) it has a solid foundation and room to grow, with active developers who really seems to listen and take on board what their players say.
3. Very active community and discord. Dev's are part of the discussion and so far are doing it the right way.
4. Graphics, sound are both quite decent. Can only improve as the game develops, so thumbs up.
5. Good and challenging even with some temporary systems in place that helps AI 'cheat'

CONS:
1. So far slightly limited with only  4 factions and 3 win conditions. Finding the easy path for a win is doable with little effort.
2. Systems and options a little unstable, loading saved games and a few other things can be buggy.
3. Early access for another 12 months or so.


So far, that's about it. Hope this helps someone! And if you try thing game out, do join the discord! Trust me, it's a great resource and a good feeling to be able to interact with the devs.",1651333606,1651333606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To me, Dune is what Star Wars is to many generations, not only shaped my taste in science fiction, but also strongly influenced the themes I'm interested in or the kind of person I've become in general. So yeah, Dune is a Huge factor in my life. I love Dune 1 (1992) passionately, (and I still think it needs a remaster ASAP) which brilliantly combined adventure elements with strategy. Also I'm a big fan of 4X games. If you add all this together, Dune: Spice Wars should be the game of my life, right? 

Well, my expectations were extremely high and I have to say... yes, the game blew me away! 

The art design is simply masterful, slick and smooth with amazing little details, the music is superb, the UI is clear and clean, the gameplay is already polished, so overall the game delivers (almost!) everything I expected. 

I've only had very little time to play it (I'm a game developer myself so I have almost no time to play... ever! :D ) but I'm sure I'll update the review later. In any case, I can already say that the atmosphere and gameplay are great, but I have a few observations: I missed the random events (which, by the way, Old World and the Crusaider Kings series were very good at). A lot of random events - to make the world come alive more and to ""spice things up"" a bit. (pun intended!) Also, the text-size adjustability in the menu would be important. The UI is nice and clean, but the fonts are terribly tiny, some might find this annoying.

Other than that, I have to say, yes, I recommend the game, because Early Access or not, it's already feels like a finished and complete product, and it will only get better with time and some care.

UPDATE: After 11 hours and one successful (total planetary dominance) win, I have to say, all my previous opinions have been confirmed. While the game could use a few extra (atmospheric) elements to add to the overall feel (more art, deeper diplomacy, random events, etc...) the base that the game already establishes at this stage is almost perfect. So this is a great foundation for an even more refined and complete experience.

After completing with all factions and obtaining 84% of the achievements I feel the value of the game is not there. It becomes far too simple in strategy, not enough happening. I like to be rewarded for my successes.
Useless trading propositions from other factions just makes that aspect pointless. I would have liked to see a weapons production strategy such as using spies to steal tech, diplomacy to trade fuel rods & dozens of other resources to create new equipment such as missiles, transport and even strategizing to obtain villages with unique resources for crafting of equipment or looting information to blackmail other factions in trade
At the moment it’s almost repetitive buildings in villages that only amplify the common resources such as manpower / water, plasticrete etc… With such a basic selection of troops that you don't even need to stratagize  with them. 
The assassination aspect is very slow & becomes a boring strategy it has potential though it’s just far to simple & not enough happening. It’s not rewarding for progression (the same with most aspects of the game)
The caps on Authority & everything else is ridiculous & slows the game to a crawl even with the sietch water trade & propaganda spread (some villages even exceed 500 Cap) After the exploring units have discovered everything, they become useless as it’s not even worth using them to scout locations or detect stealth units.
A lot of work needs to be done to the game, it’s not complicated enough for my liking & a simple game becomes boring in a strategic sense.

Not only making it really difficult it doesn't make sense, Why in the Dune world would it increase so much? just clearing a bit of sand and laying some foundation! The poor project manager must be scratching his head at the costs when he receives the bill.

""why is missile battery 3x the cost of that missile battery i built over there?""

""Because its the 5th building built in that location""

""still not making any sense, are you ripping me off because your the only building firm on the planet?""

""Yep, you've got it""

Not for those who are looking to relive the glory days of Dune 2000, it's more gradual and complex than that. Also, as I'll tell you below, combat's nowhere near as thrilling.

You must not fear Early Access, it is the mindkiller. What's already here is polished, functional, gorgeous and immersive, and I would absolutely recommend. That said, a few bits of critique for the devs:

[list]
[*]Although arranging troops in strategic points is good, combat itself is a little lacklustre. Even just having a variety of kill animations would be cool, and increasing all unit speeds would make combat feel more dynamic as right now everyone is very ploddy.
[*]The Landsraad Council feature is confusing, feels perfunctory and is *very* stacked against you when playing against AI (especially if you're the Fremen).
[*]Thumpers and sandworms for the Fremen aren't well explained: they can only be summoned outside of combat but don't appear to do anything, and I can't tell if it's a glitch or if I'm not desert-brained enough yet.
[*]It's not immediately clear how some resources (like Authority) are generated outside of home base buildings. Having explanations when you hover over them on the map screen would help.
[*]A marketplace to sell things like excess plascrete would be wonderful (trading it off to AI players is too much a roulette wheel).

There are a lot of reasons not to recommend this game, so I'll stick to the basics.
 
1.) The economy is pretty basic. You take a region, you place the factory that corresponds to the resources in said region, rinse and repeat.

2.) The tactics is bare bones. Your units are the classic A beats B, B beats C, C beats A style. There is nothing here that really sets this game apart. And the raids are more of an annoyance then anything.

3.) Devs couldn't stick to the lore; like at all. Sorry, but this is a big one. If you're going to slap a well known name on to your title, at least stick to the damned lore. Don't change things just to appease to the woke crowd.

There's more reasons why I wouldn't recommend this game, but in all honesty I'm not even willing to waste my time at this point on writing those reasons up when it's pretty obvious, just look at the discussions forum and you'll see all the reasons.

I'd rate this a 3 out of 10.",1651314384,1651314718,False,25,0,0.541923463344573975,0,True,False,True

The studio behind this game has previously made a game called Northgard, which I personally find a nice game as well. Dune spice wars is in many ways similar to Northgard, and yet better because it is like Northgard just in space.
But if to be seriously, it is possible to finish ""a round"" of this game in around 4-6 hours, and yet as for me it is fun to replay it as the map as far as I can tell generates new location each new game.
Also my advice for the new players, always go for the spice deposits and the plastic deposit thingy, if you have spice in this game, you have it all. And plastics are needed to build stuff. Even though the economics of this game are more complicated than that, as you have like 10 or maybe 10+ resources for different things like manpower, vehicles, water, ""credits/gold"",  intel points, influence points, etc.
The game also has a potential for development and the future DLC`s. In Northgard they had clans DLC policy, where each new DLC was a new factions with new game mechanics. I am not a huge Dune expert, but I do know that in the extended univerese there are multiple other houses which can be later added to this game as well.
Overall, if you like strategy games like Northgard, I would advise to check this game for sure, if you like Dune in general, you should also probably have a look at this game. It is in early access, and yet it already looks and feels better than some games in ""late access"". I did have some frame drops, and small freezes if I zoom in and out quickly, and sometimes if I pause the game I can see the units ""A-posing"" but I personally cannot consider them as serious bugs or glitches.
Also, just to make it clear, it is not like the old Dune games from 90th`s and early 2000, it is way less of that time RTS and more of the mix of economics+city building+diplomacy/espionage and combat mix. Again, just have a look at Northgard, it basically has similar mix and as for me it works perfect in the Dune setting.

This is a good early access game, but there's something that really really annoys me: The graphics and artwork are well done. The landscape design is amazing. Really polished work that creates immersion and lets you feel how it must be like on this planet. However, most of the game mechanics are not. 

There's lots of buffing and debuffing, meaningless micro management at times. Here, D:SW really needs more meaningful decisions and events, more content and storytelling to unfold this immersion. I keep thinking about Old World that does quite a good job on bringing story and immersion into 4X gameplay. If Shiro Games can add something similar to D:SW, this game will become amazing. Let's hope they will.

- LAANDSRAT: There are frequent votings on three arbitrary policies. Often, it's about random buffs of debuffs with limited impact. There should be less votings with policies proposed by factions on more meaningful topics. 
- EXCAVATIONS: They are quite boring, annoying micromanagement. There should be less, an actual unit should need to move there, doing them in enemy territory should be difficult, and there should be a pop-up window with some story content.
- AGENTS: Again, lots of small buffs and debuffs going on here when assigning agents. However, the connected spy mission system is interesting.
- UNITS: There are different types, but they are all infantry and many feel rather similar. Having maybe one non-infantry unit at the top tier level and bringing more differentiation to some of the infantry units would help a lot.
- ORNITHOPTERS: They are invincible, never need to refuel energy and are most likely used on automation mode, like a free scout or scanner, discovering the map for you. Somewhat boring.
- SPICE: It's called Spice Wars but spice is just one resource among several other resources. Spice should play a greater role. It should be limited, but it's a renewable resource. You should be able to attack enemy harvesters, but you can't. There should be more tension, but harvesting spice is quite relaxing.

- My first impression was: OH MY, I'm PLAYING the BOOK!!! ---> The developers have ""implemented"" the book into a game in a very faithful way. Then there's the topic of Liet as a woman, which I'll debate below.
- I think the balance between RTS and 4X is done very well and the game is incredibly fun!
- Fans of Westwood games will be disappointed, because this game is so much more than just ""pile tanks and throw them at the enemy"".
- 5 hours later, it's 4 AM, I'm fried and have to go to bed. But I still needed to post these few words.
- I'm almost sorry this is ""Early Access"" because this version is so awesome in its raw beauty. That being said, if this is ""Early Access"" then I can barely imagine what the future holds :).
- NO BUGS for the ENTIRE DURATION of a full play session (5 hours long map). I repeat. NO. BUGS. 
- That being said, there ARE some issues. One of the most glaring ones as Vagabond pointed out below is the fact that there are more villages than sietches on Dune. Read below for the full review, which I'm apparently regularly updating :D 
- Oh and a video review is coming :)

Full version:

An RTS where the actions you do behind the scenes influence the environment, the performance of your units and of the enemies. I don't have any problem with the combat being relatively simple for now: that's not the point, and whoever comes here for ""StarCraft on Dune"" will be sorely disappointed. Also, don't forget that tanks don't work that well in sand. Combat on Dune WAS mostly infantry-based ;). So in that respect the game is faithful.

I've heard this game called a ""reskin of Northgard"". That just makes me laugh. That's like saying that Deus Ex is a reskin of Unreal Tournament. Yes, they use the same engine, but a reskin? Come on :D. And while this game isn't a Deus Ex with the Unreal Engine yet (ahem with the Northgard engine), it is for sure on its way to be.

I've lost regions in this game to the AI because of a well placed espionage operation. These things change the environment of the game to an incredible degree. As a mechanic, I could link it to area of effect attacks, such as the ""psionic storm"" of Templars in StarCraft. But there's more to the mechanic than this and I'm sure it'll develop further.

And when it comes to the Landsraad and its resolution, JUST WOW how much these can change the game. Again, kudos to the SUPERB AI coding they did: an AI close to me won 3 Landsraad units via a resolution. I was SCREWED in 5 minutes. They sent them to me and leveled one of my villages. I loved that :D. I had to load game and take the units for myself to survive, spending all my Influence to conquer the vote. Reskin of Northgard, LOL :D

Now for the topic of changing Liet which was a man in the book, and putting him as a her, leader of the Fremen. Let's imagine a bit starting the game as a 21st century player (which may be a woman, yes? :D ) and seeing 4 male characters to choose from. Even OBJECTIVELY I would find this boring. Of course, they might as well chosen Chani as leader of the Fremen and move Liet as a male, to Councilor role. But I guess the movie peer-pressured the developers, and I can understand ""going with the times"". I'm not purist or obsessed with Dune to get angry with that, and as a player, neither should you. Treating any book with obsession isn't exactly healthy to intellectual development, and even less healthy to fun :).

The game shows AMAZING depth for an Early Access. I'm a veteran gamer and after crunching at it for 5 hours I still feel I'm barely half-way through what there is to offer here. I feel enormous replay potential here, simply by changing espionage and research tactics. 

I found the UI and UX very easy to understand. Got the hang of it rather quickly. The tutorial is simple and to the point. Amazing job on communicating a ""Dune"" feeling. The sound design is also very polished, snappy, futuristic, everything I expected it to be.

The only few things I'd improve: randomize time a worm spends on a spice field and nerf rebellions. It's kind of outrageous to be able to insta-click a village into a rebellion. At least the opposing player should have a chance to counter that. Instead, the rebellion should show up as an event in which the opposing player has a way to counter it in 7 days or something like that.

If I were to sum this game up in a single praising word, that word would be: ELEGANT. This is an elegant game, done in a stylish way. In a world full of brutish action, obsessed with DPS, clicks-per-minute and rabid action, this game is like ballet.",1651027946,1651309297,True,135,8,0.791157960891723633,18,True,False,True

Diplomacy is so lack luster and its even more annoying when you are going into pages, such as voting or diplomacy the game doesn't stop unless you pause it first (should set to default pause when you're clearly not able to make field decisions) - turns out to be a APS rush if the stars align. The AI is brutal, but stupid - most of the times it is anti-player biased, but they will all use a variety of rebellion actions turning 2-3 of your cities useless until dealt with and send a wave to attack another city - which militia doesn't fight rebels? Once the AI makes its attack its generally pretty simple to repel, but it basically back tracks all your hard work unless you have airfields to quickly move from rebel spawn to rebel spawn. Another note I could add is if there is an auto-recall button for harvesters it should also auto deploy back into the field it is an auto processes that really isn't automatic since you have to pay attention to when it can return to the field. Also with auto, the auto exploration is a really nice feature, but I would suggest that it includes actually ""tapping"" special locations - or just making the scouts have some other purpose as well - possibly some troop transports that you don't have to keep on buying for whatever reason? Another small gripe - the ""tutorial"" is pretty non-existent definitely needs a tutorial mode rather than some pop up boxes with very little information.

I tried 5 rounds in the game and couldn't make it past the first hour or so.
Even with difficulty set to low, no worm, no sand storms, no assassins and so on, I have no chance of beating  an opponent. If I look at the statistics, at some point I simply don't know how the opponents get that much ressources and money to buy basically everything. 
In my last play I was soo happy that I finally got up to 3.5k solari, just to find out the opponents already had 20k and a ton of spice. How did they get this much!? I had 3 spice fields!
Also I was NEVER able to be victorious against an opponents settlement.

The tutorial just has the title. In little text boxes it says ""build a spice refinery"", but you just have absolutely no clue on how to do so.

The RTS part is intentionally light so as not to overwhelm the exploring, building, espionage, trading, aspects. Combat is clearly meant as just one of many tools to achieve victory.   The game certainly does not have the depth of Civ. For example, you can't choose the position of your cities but you can develop existing villages in a way that fits your strategy. The game is somewhat opaque regarding the way the different bonuses help the player to make progress. Let's say it encourages experimentation. Understanding how to play each faction is therefore not obvious. I played as the Smugglers twice and did not manage to crack the code on how to win.  There are interesting ""area effects"" like in the old of Master of Magic which need to be leveraged to full advantage. There are only a few annoyances like having to remember to re-deploy a harvester after it automatically ducked an attack by enemies - otherwise it sits there waiting while your finances dwindle.

Even the smallest map is far too spread out to reasonably defend a decent sized territory consisting of about 8 zones at mid game. I had full militia units and missiles to defend a zone but you can not expand with a reasonably sized army and defend such a massive area at the same time as the unit speed is too slow to respond, even with the thumper and air fields to transport you around...for a fee.

currently there is only skirmish mode with 3 win conditions, all of which feel unique and obtainable. the many different resources all feel important giving you alot to think about during gameplay. The spice vs solari mechanic I find especially enjoyable as it creates intense moments as taxes become close to being due. the different factions and leaders you can choose from change the feel of the game, making each play-through different. I also greatly enjoy the airlifting mechanic for the troops to have them to travel fast to areas of the map that you have built the proper infrastructure in. I also enjoy how sandworms and sandstorms are integrated into the game the way it disrupts your troop movements or supply production adds an extra layer to the game. (I do think a tip that makes it clear how to save troops from the sandworms could be useful as it took me quite some time to figure out where to move units to keep my troops safe) this leaves me excited for my future play-throughs with the other factions and leaders. it also leaves me excited for upcoming additions mainly multiplayer and a campaign. 

I think the game really shines in the early game, as all the factions scramble to get there production up and expand. This brings me to the downsides that I would like to see addressed. Once the midgame is entered the pace of the game slows down, I found that when a resource issue came up I would spend alot of time waiting for my buildings to construct or waiting for the next vote to come up before I could progress. This kind of slow pace does not fit into an RTS game very well and I would like to see some mid game changes to keep things interesting and keep the pace up. additionally the combat could be more complex. all abilities on units are passive and I would like to see some active abilities to make the combat more engaging, rather then just watching the units fight and maybe moving them around a little. There are also small lag and loading issues but that is too be expected from an early access game.

Overall a great start for a week 1 early access game, im excited to see where the game goes and see them address the current issues.",1651278657,1651278657,True,0,0,0.497986584901809692,0,True,False,True

The gameplay system is a hybrid, a sort of amalgamation between grand strategy, real-time strategy, and 4x turn based games. I have never experienced anything quite like it but damn is it a treat.

For now, I will reserve further, in-depth comments until I accrue more time played but for now enjoy a sort of pros & cons list.

The Long and Short of It
------------------------

The Good:

	+ Authenticity - It really feels like you're playing as one of the various factions/houses wresting control of Arrakis.
	
	+ Performance - The game runs almost flawlessly. I experienced only one minor hitch during gameplay that I can recall but that i 

	+ Linux Compatibility - While the game lacks a native Linux client, the experience on Linux with Proton has been so pristine it felt as though the game was running on a native version!

    + Game Feel - In the same vein as Authenticity, the game feels great to play in most instances. Every battle carries weight, sandworms can be terrifying if they catch your units in the middle of the desert, 

The Bad:

	- Polish/Balance - Some mechanics and values feel a little half baked overall but I won't give this a major hit because it is Early Access. Major candidates for improvement are the diplomacy and trade functions, lack of hotkeys, voting, etc.

    - Direction - Some parts of the game feel cheap or biased against the player. e.g. Sietches attacking the exact moment another faction does or sandworms devouring my units the moment I receive the notification they are nearby at the most inopportune times. Perhaps this is a consequence of my novice status at the game but that remains to be seen.

    - Pathing/Control - Unit pathing can be a bit poor at times. Units can get stuck on each . With their slow movement overall a couple of slowdowns here or there can easily mean winning or losing the defense of a village. Related, there needs to be a way to tell units to either avoid deep desert or, more importantly, allow shift queueing move actions. The number of units I have lost to supply loss because they crossed over a small portion of deep desert is deeply disappointing.


The Neutral:

	/ UI - The UI is pretty good most things considered; however, some important information can be hidden behind unneccessary menus. Also certain elements belie their importance. I cant tell you how embarassingly long it took me to discover how to access the voting, espionage, and . Also, the random, time-limited missions require you to manually collect the reward if completed. This has led to me completing quite a few missions but lose out on the rewards through forgetfulness. At least give me a pop-up when conditions are met!


Conclusion:

Overall the game is a delight to play, especially for the moderate price. I am excited to see what future updates bring!",1651274764,1651274764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

yes...and it works surprisingly well.

Dune: Spice Wars is nothing like any Dune game you've played before. This doesn't take place during the book or even the movie universe. It actually looks like a Prequel as House Atredes and the Freman aren't already outright allied with each other and are their own separate factions. In this game you can choose from up to 4 factions, The three we all know and love; Harkonnen, Atreides and the Fremen. The ther faction being the ""Traiders"" which i assume are like the Ordos in the sense that they are an empire of cut-throats that ride to power through trading goods and weapons and smuggling illegal contraband. each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as special units, structures and abilities that can be utilized in the game world. 

Like many civilization-styled games you have several ways of winning the game; through domination, espionage or political power to name a few. You've also got many resources to manage for building and unit upkeep as well as managing your Spice Reserves for Money Making and Spice Taxes. And Territory control it key to expanding your borders and gathering more resources for whatever form of victory you choose to pursue. To take control of more territory you must capture the local towns in that area. once you've cleared out the local militia and annexed the town into your ranks you can then extract whatever resources you need from said territory as well as resupply your units.

while expanding your borders you must be wary of Arrakis' dangers. Aside from the dry desert that will slowly kill your soldiers if they stay out of your borders for too long, the ever Nostalgic ""Worms"" can come out of nowhere and devour your unsuspecting units in an instant, to keep an eye for tremors in the sand. There are also beautiful yet deadly sand storms you have to watch out for as they will kill anyone foolish enough to attempt to navigate through them or refuse to move out of its path. Then there are the locals who will fight against your efforts to control their territories and even attempt to raid your already annexed cities and towns.

This game has already impressed me to no end and i'm looking forward to what else they' ll add to the game as it progresses through its early access stages. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes long, methodical RTS games that focus on more than just the ""military conquest"" aspect of the game/experience. if you liked Civ games and wished at some point that they could be played in Real-time instead of turn-based, this might be the game for you.",1651274132,1651274132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That said, these guys are doing something entirely different with logistics, diplomacy, strategic moves, and resource management, so that isnt a negative. Some things will be familiar, like tech specific to certain factions and units. On the whole, I feel good enough to recommend it as early access. Im very hesitant to do so and have only been satisfied with 3 such purchases to date (Dying Light, High Fleet and now this) It just might not be what you're looking for or expecting, here depending on what you want.

Ill say if they *DONT* add content and polish further, I would take it back, but Im not refunding and giving these guys the benefit of the doubt, because so far, whats promised looks like its being delivered on, so far.

Civ meets Dune with slightly more restrictive soft caps with resource obligation The above reservations mentioned; I want to see MORE voice acting appropriate to the different diplomatic stances (if they hate or love you) as well as in the things they ask for, and should have not just one insult , but many; so I dont hear repetition. If you're going to do it, the difference between one dialogue and 40 is nothing if you put it in all at once. The background is beautiful, but if you show us the stars and sky we should be able to look up, too. I want to see more units that everyone can deploy + vehicles AND more of those specific to factions. I want to see a space carrier dropping off the Emporers' Sardukar to kick Atredies butts. I want to see Smugglers use poison gas. I want to see Atredies sonic tanks. I want to see Harkonnen mini gun lasers on the infantry, mammoth tanks and a generic tank and buggy everyone can buy and I want to see worms eat them all when you run out of parking spots. I know not all of that might get in there, but there should be an honest effort to deliver it steadily over time. (things that are part of the story in both novel and movie). At least an honest try.

Multiplayer is rumored planned but not there, yet. *REALLY* looking forward to playing this with (and against) my friends, in particular.

I might come off a bit needy, but I think thats reasonable, considering at $36 CAD per game you are going to get insanely rich. This should pass the first million sales in no time or gaming has died off considerably in the new world.

Im a big fan. Im already enjoying whats' here, and Im hoping more is added to keep this from getting boring in less than a few days is all. Best of luck to the devs to pull it off. The evidence is there so far that they are trying.

What I did like?
Espionage in this game is brilliant in most games is boring or barely useful, here thanks to operations, it adds a new layer of the game.
- AI did that to me - they crated revolt in my village, deep in my territory I moved most of my troops there and then they attacked my bordering region. 
I want more of that fun spy stuff.
I like how combat is slow and you need to plan thanks to supply more than just - more units and crush enemy base.
Diplomacy is fine

Ranged units need more love they seem easily counter by melee and after some time I stopped making them (the heavy weapon or the demolition are better but still...

The map generation allows for 'lanes' of attack and defense, though due to the procedural nature of the map those lanes are never the same.  The game pauses for you to issue commands or manage your assets, agents and armies...but it all unfolds without a turn-based system.  The 4X exists in the exploration of the map and your expansion across it, though that is not necessary if you decide to win in a different way.  Exploitation and extermination are there...you can assassinate the leaders of enemy factions or you can just destroy their stronghold, neither path ia easy or short.

Fans of the books/movies will appreciate the lore that exists while people who are not can easily pick up the setting and who the people/factions are.  Each faction plays differently and those playstyles mimic the themes and philosophies of the factions present.

Personally, I've enjoyed losing repeatedly.  Arrakis has made me stronger as I have learned the ways of the desert.  Pay your tax to the Emperor or lose standing in the Landsraad.  Fend off or dominate the planet and your neighbors.

The game is eh.. souless. It's balancing statistics at it's core. It's Northgard with a paint of sand.
Sectors like in Northgard. Check.
Limited buildings in sectors like in Northgard. Check.
Scouts to well..scout sectors. Check.
A few units with lackluster combat. Check.
""Invasions"" of neutral enemies from neighboring sectors. Check
Research, gold and influence producing buildings for winning conditions. Check.
Basically you go around capturing sectors and balancing resource statistics like in Northguard. Check.
Come on guys.. is innovation really dead?

You're Atreides, the sworn enemy of the Harkonnen and they just trade with you like you're best friends. Factions are just there so you have slightly different play stiles (turtle, economy, zerg etc.) lore does not matter in the slightest.

The ""politics"" are a joke. Basically every few days you can vote on 3 buffs or debuffs factions have for another few days.
Spice is there just to be a countdown timer for the game as you need to fill a quota every few days.

No campaign or story.

They gender/raceswapped Liet Kynes into a black woman because ""reasons"" (""he was an advocate for climate change and because we want to modernize the lore"" I think their reason was basically... like being a woman and black has anything to do with climate change.. why not an asian woman? There aren't any asian looking characters in the game) which is disrespectful to both the author and the lore. If you want to fanfic just call it something else but Dune.

If you want to play a 4x there are better choices out there. I suppose if you enjoy managing statistics you could derive some fun out of this one. As for the setting and lore...

And despite being a real time game it moves at a steady pace as opposed to the lightning fast paced like an rts, a positive for me.

As for the gameplay, I see this being a fun game for anyone who likes more real time 4x/rts games. It plays very similar to Northgard with it's building, map exploration, fighting, and it's pace. If you've played northgard and liked it, you'll be in a good spot with this game. The combat is very simplified and limited compared to many other rts games and 4x games, while not a bad thing, it's not very deep. There are only around 5-6 types of soldiers per faction you can recruit but they all have there own unique benefits and models. Overall I have enjoyed the scope and complexity of the combat. 

Building has been good but also not incredibly deep. I wish they will focus more on building/city management since it becomes less involved and there arent many impactful choices with your buildings. You only have 5 total slots for buildings and many will have special resources that boxes out one build slot. 

Single player is missing currently so you really only have skirmish to play the game alone. The factions are all unique and varied, happy with the flavor each one brings and none feel terribly unbalanced imo. They give more replayability and variance with factions with the ability to choose 2 advisors (I forgot there actual name) that give unique bonuses, cool idea and love the implementation, but could use more. 

Overall, I think i'll be beating a couple more skirmish games with the other factions I haven't beaten, but overall seems like a great deal if more content comes relatively soon.

The ultra-widescreen support is beautiful and the graphics are smooth, the sounds and music are totally ""space-operish"" and almost eerie. Love it!

The gameplay, being a hybrid between 4x and RTS, is a surprisingly good combination. It functions a bit like Baldur's Gate-style games, in that you can pause at any time to issue commands to combat units or manage your colony, then un-pause to see your commands play out. Or, you can NOT use pause and just treat the game like a full-blown RTS. It's entirely up to you!

The research tree, with four different areas of focus, seems well thought out to enhance or break your gameplay depending on how well you synergize your choices. The four factions are very different from each other, especially in the way they affect early strategy and time investment choices. Additionally, your relationships with other factions will be very different depending on who you play, as each has distinct bonuses that drive diplomacy and trade.

Lastly, the combat is fun, intuitive and very satisfying, especially for a game that is bent on being a hybrid. You get notifications whenever a raid is approaching your village(s), but it's not always enough time depending on how close your defending armies are and what kind of defenses have been established. You can easily defend a village with a rocket tower and three units, or you can lose it in the blink of an eye. It means that despite all the time and attention being paid to your economy, you really can't neglect your military presence. Very cool!

All-in-all, I would call this early release a wonderful success. I have encountered no bugs other than spelling and grammatical errors, and the lack of multiplayer support, the latter of which I hope they implement very soon.

This is a strategy, 4X and RTS game, with a few features from the the Dune Board game *(affect cards and bonuses)*

The combat has elements from Dune2, Dune2000, C&C and the following series in base building and units. 
But note this is not a build massive forces and roll over your enemy. Combat is more realistic with supply limitations and environmental survival factory.

Combat is supplemented with agent/spy actions in the background.

The 4X side of things involves voting on affects that effect all factions or a specific faction, both positive or negative.
There is TAXs to pay and resources required to maintain your advancement.

You have sand storms and worms *(like in the Dune RTS games)* randomly in affect that cause issues to production and combat.

If you're looking for C&C or Dune series RTS, this may not be the game for you, but if you like a challenge this could be the game for you. 

You don't need to know anything about the Dune series of novels or movies to play the game, though after playing for a bit I know of a number of players that have had their interest sparked about Dune and watched the latest movie release.

So yes the game is themed around the Dune universe, but that could have been replaced with any other possible SciFi theme, but Dune has elements that suits this game more than others could offer.

The design is lazy and hollow.

Harvesting spice was always the back bone of Dune (it's even in the title) and yet, it plays such a small part... You build a refinery, send your harvester off, automate pick up and then that's it... Harvesters can't be attacked, you never need to worry about spice fields running out. Spice isn't your main currency, it just doesn't do anything. You collect enough to keep your debtors happy and then forget about it.

Ornithopters are useless, send them off to scan new areas, they can't be attacked, they can't attack. They don't provide anything, it's just an immortal scout... The scanning missions they can do are repetitive, not engaging and you can play an entire game never needing to do one.

Infantry (your only military in this game), They are slow, lack diversity and as soon as you realise you can rotate them in and out of combat you will seldom lose a unit (unless a worm appears and eats your entire army).

The content is a little bare bones for the price they're asking (it [i]is[/i] early access after all) but aside from that it's worth the price for probably the most thematically faithful Dune game made so far. Though, uh, the Westwood games were about as far from the canon as you could get so that may be faint praise.

What the game excels at:
 - It makes treachery, a cornerstone of Dune, a fundamental part of the game that you routinely engage with even if you don't invest heavily in it
 - It makes the Landsraad and politics, including the ""never quite allying"" politics of Dune, where you might hate someone but you'll still trade with them in a pinch, also a significant element that you will engage in - even if you're the Fremen.
 - Fremen are OP combatants as demanded by the fluff, yet are not overwhelming enough to the point where any military conflicts with them are a foregone conclusion. Fedaykin are about as strong - or stronger - than even the Landsraad elites and it shows in a really satisfying way
 - The map and mechanics are often evocative of the old iconic board game, one of the best depictions of the setting outside of the books period
 - It focuses on the medieval-style infantry-based warfare of the novels. I think there's still some room to expand it, militarily, but at the moment pretty much everything makes sense to some extent. 
 - The factions are reasonably asymmetric despite filling the same roles. Atreides focus on large organized armies, Harkonnen focus on nearly guaranteeing a victory at a pivotal moment, Smugglers try to keep out of everyone's way while making a profit and Fremen are just like ""naw get off our lawn"" and then murder you, either solo or as a mob.
 - The game is set up in a way that several of the existing mechanics can be easily expanded to be more complex or offer more choice in the future, which is a good sign for a game that is going to be expanding its content significantly in the future

What the game doesn't excel at:
 - Combat, at the moment, feels a bit lackluster. This could just be an issue with the animations, like showing units physically dying one at a time rather than all at once, but either way I suspect it will be improved over time
 - Liet Kynes. Specifically, they came up with a fairly unsatisfying justification and changed Liet - a half-Caucasian, half-Arab man into a Black Woman. I don't really like to get into this sort of stuff, but it felt like a bit of a betrayal from the developers who had otherwise gone out of their way to draw inspiration from the novels, only to then say that one of the notable characters wasn't good enough as-is - particularly when so little thought was put into it that Chani, Liet's daughter, is weirdly pale (the Fremen don't resemble their Arabic roots) and so Liet sticks out like a sore thumb. Is it the apocalypse? Hardly - but it's a distracting reminder that for whatever reason they let an ideological whim hijack an otherwise faithful game.
 - It's not based on the Westwood games. Please stop asking why it's not based on the Westwood games. Westwood owns/owned that IP and, no, they can't just port Ordos over without permission. Pls stahp.
 - Red Spice. This is because in the novels it's described as violet and blue in its typical form, and when an aerosol mix of other gasses it looks reddish-orange. I know it's a bit of a culture shock, especially after literally every other film and game ""got it wrong"" - but honestly the writer himself didn't care much about the appearance of the spice (it took like four books for him to actually tell us the colour FFS) so it's not the end of the world.
 - Multiplayer - in that it doesn't exist in this game. They're considering adding it throughout development (as happened with their previous game, I think) but I also know from prior experience that adding multiplayer can be an exhausting slog that consumes a ton of resources that could otherwise be used to improve the gameplay.

Overall I'd recommend the game for people who are fans of the novels, fans of 4X games (realtime or turn-based) and for people who just want something a bit unusual to scratch that strategy itch.

If you come in looking for a sequel to Dune: Battle for Arrakis, though, you're going to be disappointed. It's not that kind of game - it's doing it's own thing. Please understand that. If you want more games in that style, some old Westwood devs are still working on games sort of similar to that over with Petroglyph.

A Dune rts game brings with it all kinds of baggage.  For myself, the original Dune rts games were some amazing and formative games from my childhood.  That was Westwood Studios at its finest.  Those games were so formative, that as I played Dune Spice Wars, killing blue guys, I just assume Im killing Atredies.  Only half way through the match did I realize I was destroying the smugglers.  This game is not as good as the old Westwood games, but it is something else--it should be evaluated as something distinct.

Poor faction color choice for the Atredies aside, the AI is extremely competent.  Its able to use its military units well, maneuver around the map logically, use agents and strategies appropriately, and exploit the different areas of the map effectively with its build choice.

Heres the problem--it feels barren (no pun intended).  The reason the AI is so competent is because theres very few units.  Building cities is easy, theres very few buildings.  Although theres multiple ways to victory, all factions essentially try to do the same things, just some are more specialized.  All armies have an infantry unit, a ranged infantry unit, and some specialization infantry units.  The unit cap serves to hinder the player and keeps them inline with the AI.  You both are limited to the same strategies.  Battles feel a bit empty as theres no ground vehicles or punchy machinery like you would expect in an rts-especially sci-fi.  And with a unit cap that grows for all factions as the game progresses, you are expected to be constantly managing your army around the world-capturing or raiding towns around the clock.  Theres no time to drink in what you are doing which makes the pace of battles and using armies feel like a moba game, not an rts.  Theres really no army management other than microing your units to maximize effectiveness.

With so few buildings to choose from, as some buildings can only be built if the zone has the required resource, theres no aspect that lets you enjoy building your faction up.  Even your biggest towns all have the same structures.  This is not a civilization growing game.  The moba aspect kicks in when from the moment you ""capture"" a town, to put down some basic structures and moving on with the game, killing the 4x aspect.

Yet for all these faults, the game is still fun.  The music is passable, the art is nice, (but change the colors please), the combat is simple and enjoyable, the ""civ building"" is simple and enjoyable, you just cant become attached to any specific location.  The AI is great at using all these elements.  Once you understand all the resources, you'll realize that its actually very streamlined.

Its a good game.  But when I heard a Dune game was being made, I immediately thought of the great Westwood games and was certainly not expecting the playstyle to mimic a moba game.  I hope when the story and campaign is released we can get some fun Dune story telling.",1651204688,1651204688,True,1,0,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,True

Its core mechanics are good, but it is also very much an early release title seriously lacking in variety. The factions need to be more different, ideally there would be more of them, maps need to be strategically interesting, and the pacing needs work. This game could be very good, but it still needs a lot of work. I CURRENTLY ONLY RECOMMEND FOR BIG DUNE FANS. Mainly I would want to see factions be more unique, have noticeable differences in play. The Dune boardgame would be an amazing template for how to build a Dune strategy game. In the boardgame, each game you play as a different faction feels entirely different. And even though the map is always exactly the same every time in the boardgame, it feels a lot more interesting because of the placement of rocks and the randomness of the spice. The boardgame also manages to make spice feel far more important than this game does. In this game, spice really just feels like a way to get solaris and meet the bribe you have to every once in a while. It should feel like a massive relief every time you find spice and devastating every time you lose it.

Only get if you're a massive Dune fan, otherwise wait until full release and see what it is like then. Core gameplay is promising, but needs more variety between factions and in the map. Spice should at least feel more important.",1651204232,1651204232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One of the main down sides is the lack of a tutorial currently.

I very much enjoyed Northgard from this same developer, and picked up all the DLC. In a way, Dune is very similar to Northgard in aesthetic and the idea of land grid acquisition, and unique resources being tied to the same. Kind of like an RTS version of Settlers of Catan, but with different clans offering sharp or subtle distinctions from each other.

However, in Dune: Spice Wars, there are only four distinct clans, which will be familiar to people that have enjoyed the Dune films, or the books. Their distinctions differ more strongly than those of the dozen plus of Northgard, and as a result, are more distinctly felt in gameplay. There are four different tech trees, with distinct perks in each catergory that are relevant to each of the four clans. 

What I also appreciate is that the games feel like they take a lot longer. Epic gameplay in the worldbuilding and the pitch. This is no Starcraft or Ashes of the Singularity. Things move at the pace of Dune, and I think it captures the mood of the fictional universe quite well. There's not really a shortcut to victory, no ion cannon rush. You're going to spend a long time trying to earn just a single dub, measured in hours, not minutes. However, when you lose, it still makes for several hours of fun.

One thing I do not like is that the tutorial is very lacking. Incomplete, would be the word. Also, there isn't a encyclopedia like there is with a Civ game, and the only way to find out what a buff or a feature does is to try it. Sometimes certain strategies are complimentary, and other times they don't really work that well together, yielding an early L. It's play by trial and error, but if you can sit through it for an hour, you learn the basic mechanics well enough. If you decide to go for it, make sure to join the discord to discuss strategy and finer points with other players.

This is a game for people with patience. Adrenaline junkies are probably gonna get bored, but if you've had enough headshots for a while, maybe learn how to use your head for something besides target practice. I could see this game being an acquired taste. Most of RTS as a genre isn't known for patience and long-term strategy, but about deft reaction. Dune: Spice Wars is about long-term planning and the particular joys of seeing your plans work or the horrors of seeing them thwarted. If it's still fun when you lose, it's going to be fun no matter what.

No multiplayer yet, but I look forward to seeing how that is implemented. Great work, looking forward to seeing how it gets polished.",1651199975,1651199975,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

Devs claim they made a game from ground up and didn't copy anything from Northgard, but it's simply not true.

They use the same engine and you can see the same mechanics, maybe slightly tweaked so that it's not exact copy from Northgard.

The game is rather boring. Combat, military units, tech tree, economy is just lazy done and uninspired.

They tried to add some depth to the game like diplomacy, espionage, tax rates, global political event, I guess they took that inspiration from Endless Space 2, which implements those features in a great way.
But Dune SW fails miserably in this area. It doesn't matter what you do there is almost no effect in short or long term, no strategy involved at all.


I might revisit it later, but I do not have high hopes, knowing how Northgard was ""finished"" after leaving early access.

PROS:
- Looks and feels like Dune
- Good variety of strategy, map is big and packed with exciting zones to explore.
- Very polished and mostly bug-free for EA
- Micro is not really needed. This is very much a macro / worker placement game
- Factions and their starting ""heroes"" allow for a variety of meaningful ways to go for victory although in my experience, just wiping out the enemy faction homebase has been the easiest.

CONS:
- Some balance / performance issues. Occasional stuttering despite good performance otherwise.
- I can't see how they would be able to add many more factions to add diversity to the game like they did with Northgard.

VERDICT: 
- If you're a fan of Northgard, this feels like Northgard 2.0 in the Dune setting. It's more sophisticated than Northgard in most aspects.

The AI is not very smart, which is very common in the 4x genre, but it still hurts the game. I feel like the mid-late game feels a little stagnant as it starts to feel like you are just waiting for someone to win. The tech tree really slows down towards the end too, so if you aren't actively fighting you are just kinda waiting around a lot in the end game. I wish there would be more of a reason for head on battles between players. You are either attacking a player's village or defending your own village and there isn't really any reason at all just to take on someone's army in battle. Plus, armies can be recreated so quick it doesn't feel rewarding at all to wipe an army out, unless you are going for a base kill to take that player out the game. And unless you get lucky with a specific law passing, you are probably not gonna destroy a base early in the game, so an army wipe just feels pointless.  Most of the time, you get a single village before they can rebuild, that's it. Another issue, its that it is so annoying that spice harvesters don't redeploy automatically if you have auto-recall on. When you have a ton of spice fields, you'll have to constantly redeploy harvesters due to worms, and its just annoying. It is an easy fix though. The last big issue with the game right now, is that airfields are very overpowered. You shouldn't be able to move your entire army across the map so quickly and easily. Taking advantage of an enemy armies' bad position is impossible, because they will just fly from super away to defend whatever you are attacking. It really needs a way longer cooldown, 30 seconds is waaaay to short. It also should probably have a higher cost, as it is pretty cheap for the amount of movement you get.  Despite all these negatives, the game is pretty fun. The early-mid portion of games is really solid, and I have little complaints. All of the 4x elements of the game are extremely fun. The resource management is solid, and does not feel overwhelming nor unfair.

For those who are interested in playing a starcraft reskinned uplifted version of Dune 2000, you are in the wrong place.

(I have played Dune 2000)

It is not an easy game, it is not designed for beginners in RTS, Spice Wars has a wide variety of resources, buildings, upgrades, research, espionage, there is much to learn and discover, part of the fun is finding out what you like to specialize in.

The game looks really nice and it runs well. I could not find any noteworthy bugs which is pretty good for such an early version, but damn, it does get boring fast.

[h2]So what's the basic game?[/h2]
You start with your HQ and one Ornithopter on a big map, which is divided into sectors. 
Most sectors contain a village. Some sectors offer a bonus on some resource or other. Very few sectors are empty desserts. Even fewer are special sector with some bonus or a win condition for holding.

How is it played?
- [b]Scout[/b] the map with your invincible scout Copter (or click auto scout and watch it play the game for you)
- [b]Claim[/b] the sectors with your 2 or 3 combat units (3 melee boys can cover pretty much anything, build them at the start and that is that)
- [b]Build[/b] stuff on the captured sectors to get resources (spice is just a special resource on some sectors)
- [b]Repeat[/b]
That is basically it. All the rest of the game just gives you various bonuses to do just that.
Random raids can get annoying since they uncapture your sectors. Fortunately you can build defense stuffs and forget about it.

Sad thing is, that the various systems added to the base game (worms, sandstorms, spying, research) end up being a ton of tedious and annoying stuff you have to grind.

[h2]Base Building and Resource management:[/h2]
- it has a lot of different resources, but it ends up being very simple since you can exploit any resource in any sector with various minor bonuses
- you can build 5 different buildings on each sector
- some sectors offer a 50% bonus on a specific resource, on rare occasions even 100%!
- water extraction depends on wind speeds which a random values for sectors. I still spam on water house pretty much everywhere and care little about the winds
- it ends up being a spam all the things and just build the thing you are currently low on

[h2]Diplomacy:[/h2]
- You can offer and receive trade deals for resources and the AI will make offers as well
- I found the the mood of the AI will not be changed in any meaningful way by trading with it
- There might be other diplomatic options. There is a lot of menus to explore
- there is a spying system that lets you get various minor bonuses and unlock 'operations' that allow you to mildly annoy your opponets every now and then

[h2]Combat:[/h2]
- Combat is super simple. I found out that the melee units beat everything (especially the first Fremen units) since you can use them to force range units into melee combat (no kiting since all move at the same speed). Just spam melee and don't forget to click one on each enemy ranged unit in a fight
- fights usually involve around 2-5 units each so managing them is very easy and kinda boring
- units have supply. Supply is lost when moving outside of your own terrain (it's like every unit has a stamina bar - I hate stamina bars!) which means you have a limit to how far out you can attack. Most of the time the supply thing can be completely ignored.
- killing an enemy is just throwing 5-10 units at their starting sector and kill their very tanky HQ, which I found to be very simple to do in the later game
- the AI can be beat with easy by clicking their ranged units with your melee. You won't lose a fight. If you pull back damaged units for a second and send them back in, you won't even lose a unit.

[h2]Various other systems and features:[/h2]
- [b]Sand Worms:[/b] 
Your spice harvesters (those get spawned by a building you construct in a village) get bullied by Sandworms which ends up being super tedious. You a warning and then you got a few seconds to click the harvester to save it, then wait a few seconds and click it again so it resumes working (you will forget it eventually and it will annoy the F out of you, I promise). After doing this the 250th time during a game it gets tedious and is just annoying and offers not much in gameplay.
When there is a fight a worm warning might pop up and you got to move your units onto a rocky area. Since fights tend to happen at the villages and the villages are situated on rock there usually isn't even that much movement needed. If you miss one of the warnings you get punished.
- [b]Sandstorms[/b]
Sandstorms roam various districts and can be ignored 99% of the time. If you get unlucky the will wipe your entire army and once you realize it is going to happen it is too late, since they move at random and move faster than army units. Very annoying and no fun.
Sandstorms also randomly reduce production by some % wherever they are. But since it is random there is nothing to do but ignore it, the impact on economy is minimal anyways
- [b]Random Encounters[/b]
The map offers various random encounters which offer two choices. One is doing clicking a research button and then getting a little advancement on your tech tree or get some resource. Your copter will reveal endless amounts of those and you will be very busy clicking them one at a time after one another.

The game tries to do so many things it ends up doing nothing well. Since this is still a very early version, I do have hopes that things might improve.

It's accurate to the book, and takes the good of the Villeneuve movie, obviously being the character portraits.

Now, I'm assuming there's a tutorial coming at release.  As it is now, it's a trial-by-fire experience.  It's not an easy game, and I'm still learning what I can over multiple restarts.

Essentially, you (Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, or Smugglers) have to train troops take over towns - each town controls a territory.  These territories have benefits and you can build different structures to make use of these benefits, and/or defenses, and gain resources.  There are many resources such as spice, manpower, or authority.  You need all resources in balance to continue to grow your faction.  Most structures and troops have ongoing resource requirements.

[edit]
There are 3 win conditions:
""Domination"", or destruction of the other factions' main base.  You can not build around these at the start (confusing to begin with).  You begin by training troops and taking territories.
""Hegemony"", or to become the most powerful faction by gaining a certain amount of this.
""Political"", which seems to be the Laandsraad win condition.

In a Landsraad Council (very important) you will use two resources to vote on 3 benefits and/or negative affects.  These can be either a simple agree or disagree, or you can vote for yours or another faction to be the recipient, then use your influence on decisions.  After some time the Council will be closed and the results will be shown.  These affects last until the next Council.
[edit] It seems like you should be using as many points as you can in these councils because you need to spend more for some of the larger perks (shown at the top of the council). Don't forget - you are still gaining points while the voting period is open.

It's very tricky trying to balance your resources and your buildings, defenses, upgrades, expansion, etc.
Let me just say - you don't need a Military all the time as they do take up a lot of resources to maintain.  Use them for their purpose, then release them if you do not need them.",1651105080,1651173764,True,2,0,0.513812124729156494,0,True,False,True

However it really fails to capture any of the Dune feel or vibes. As many have pointed out, the Spice (which should be a major focus of the game) is in reality just a minor player and is barely even a part of the game. I can tell you that Plascrete is way more precious than spice.


Overall the game is decent, but it's not Dune

I'm going to give it a barely thumbs up, but it's really borderline.",1651173367,1651173367,True,2,1,0.481615573167800903,0,True,False,True

+++Gameplay that keeps moving. There is a pause button, but playing through while using it sparingly lets you experience the chaos of maintaining control over all resources and military action. 4x games have always been very slow and dull for me, so this strikes a good balance of action and patience.

++The espionage system. This is definitely a standout to me from similar games I've played. It's an added layer of intrigue that is ongoing while you manage you colony, and they provide incredibly strong ability that can help or hurt your opponents. I would like to see Intel having more early game purposes, maybe providing incentives for allies.

+Arrakis is threatening. You have to monitor troops at all times to be sure they have enough supplies to get through the desert, defeat the enemy, and take the spoils. Taking risks by making enemies must be calculated. I've seen people say that sandworms aren't threatening, but in my experience, they've at times greatly affected the flow of combat. For example, you could be engaged in a battle, and inevitably wormsign begins. I could choose to push the incentive, and risk being out of position with my ranged fighters, or flee and try to line up the opponent to get devoured. 

Cons:
---Tutorial and information. As someone who's familiar with the world from the novels and movies, I had an easier time just being knowledgeable of certain terms and organizations. To someone who is completely new to it, or only had exposure via the new movie, they might be overwhelmed at first. Even then, I found myself lost at certain points knowing what to do with the number of systems at play.

The ""tutorial"" is only told through the quests and a few popups on your first game, and that's it. Having more hoverable explanations would really help, such as terms and cooldowns/timings. Also, being able to adjust notifications for important abilities like the Landsraad reroll, while reducing useless ones would be very helpful.

--Factions are a little same-y. The unique abilities that each faction holds is really cool. The Smuggler ability especially felt unique and intriguing to explore. However, after those abilities are explored, the strategy remains largely the same. Each faction is capable of producing units with unique abilities to others, but at its core, ranged, melee, demo triangle is what you work with. There are a few special classes like drones, so I would like to see this expanded upon.

-Communication between opponents. This is rather lacking compared to some other games of this genre. Every 20 minutes or so you'll get an NPC shittalking you for next to reason, and that's the extent of it. I think expanding the options for treaties and bartering may help this, and it would certainly be remedied by multiplayer. 

Conclusion:
I had only encountered a few frame drops, and a bug involving the warning that I'm combat when I wasn't happened a few times. Other than that, the game feels ""close"" to ready. The price point is awesome, with most games releasing at $60+ these days with DLC, $30 is reasonable to me. 

I'm not going to bother to mention the lore issues this game presents, particularly with the use of guns, because it's clearly meant to be a divergent series. Are there things that suck to see not in line with the source material? Sure, but if it's at the cost of being a more fun video game, I'm fine overlooking that.

Playing this with multiplayer when it releases should be a lot of fun. The voting and espionage systems can lead to tons of fun interactions that will make you hate each other, or be happy to work together. Hopefully the devs take this and run, because they've got the makings of something awesome.

I'm a big fan of the Dune titles, with my first game being Dune II, followed by Dune 2000 and Emperor. This game is NOT a Westwood Studios title, and it does not play like the prior games. The music (At least for Fremen, haven't played the other races) Is good, though doesn't have that upbeat classic sound the older games did. But it IS more atmospheric now.

One of my favorite things to do in the older titles was to build  a base and kinda hold it for as long as I can without directly defeating the AI in custom skirmishes. This game has that style of gameplay by default, being a longer running 4x hybrid. You capture neutral villages which have their own territory, and from there you build structures that benefit the territory. Got a mining node? Build a mining factory there. Spice fields? Harvester team. 

As you expand you need to manage your resources and also defend yourself against raiders attempting to reclaim their villages, and the other factions. There are also sandworms, sandstorms, and even rebellions to worry about, so it's never just an upward climb.

The combat is fun, you build little squads of a unit at a time, like a demolition  team, warrior squad, etc. Like any RTS making sure your tanky boys are in front is important because your ranged units die FAST in melee and may require micromanagement. No vehicles are in the game yet besides your scout copters, but it IS early access. 

So far I'm having a lot of fun and will surely update this review the more I play and the game  itself is updated. Hell, game already had a big patch yesterday and another small one day. They're rapidly updating the title and as a lifelong fan, I'm quite enjoying it so far.

You play as one of four factions, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, The Fremen, and The Smugglers, with an overall goal of controlling the planet. This is done by taking over villages as your own, mining spice, creating buildings to generate resources, combat, trading and diplomacy, research, etc.

The game (currently) has 3 victory conditions. Domination (kill everybody else, either by unit combat or spy assassinations), Governorship (Become the Governor of Dune by holding a certain amount of territories and winning the vote), or Hegemony Victory. (Earn 25,000 Hegemony points, which you get from doing basically anything)

If you've played similar games, I don't really think Dune does anything crazy different. I don't think this is a bad thing, it's familiar enough but all the mechanics really fit for the Dune universe. It's worth noting that when I said ""RTS-lite"" I mean that controlling military units is very easy, and although the game is in real time, you can pause it whenever you like and issue commands while paused.

Graphically, I really enjoy the style. I'm not the biggest fan of the ""cartoony"" aesthetic, but it works very well here, and the best part is everything on the map is very readable and easy to understand at a glance. Even for a barren desert the game is pretty to look at.

For audio, I actually do like the music.

[b] THOUGHTS ON EARLY ACCESS AND GAME ISSUES: [/b]

This is a strange game and genre for early access. However, it seems to be working. The devs are taking an approach of ""we'll work on whatever the players want most first"", which I enjoy. But we'll have to see how that works. The devs are pretty active in discord which I really enjoy seeing.

The game has some issues for sure. Performance isn't horrible, but there's some strange stuttering that happens when pop ups appear, you select units, combat starts, etc. Some ""core mechanics"" I think are missing, such as queuing commands for units and control groups. (I'd really like to bind my scouts to 1, 2, and 3 for easier access)

The tutorial is lacking, there's a lot of resources and mechanics, and not all are properly explained and require asking for help or a few playthroughs to really figure it out.

The biggest thing missing is probably multiplayer, which they are working on. I'd also like to see a few more factions, victory conditions, modding support, etc. However, they've released a bug fix patch already (a day after release) which is promising.

[b] OVERALL IMPRESSION: [/b]

Overall, it's good! I would recommend this game if you're a fan of the genre, or the Dune universe. However, it's also a game that seems like it'll get more stuff each month, so waiting until a 1.0 release or a feature you really want (like multiplayer) seems like a good idea as well. $30 might be a bit steep right now.

Could also be worth waiting for a roadmap, which should be coming soon once they gather enough feedback from the players.

+ Good audio *though would love more impactful music
+ Overall good design choices
+ Good basis for EA on Steam, it is in a good state now and will most likely only become better.
+* A lot of the negative I will now say is by no means killers, the game is in a good place, and I expect it only to imrpove drastically from now on.

- FPS stutters, mostly when animations kicks off, like guns firing or millitia spawning.
- Too one sided in what you do, if you don't do x and x thing at the start asap, you will lock yourself in a spiral you cannot take yourself out from.
- Lacking in true difference, smugglers doesn't feel that different from playing any other faction, I was expecting a lot more on the economical side, but I ended up playing just as I did with everybody else in the end.

But this is no reason to believe that this is a bad game.

In no particular order, pros and cons:

Pro: The atmosphere and feeling of the game and the planet Dune are there. The planet is kinda nasty, the systems in place dont allow you do be uber op. 

Pro: The factions have well rounded pros and cons and they feel decently close to the inlore factions. Harconnens are tankier and offer some combat spells while the fremen for example have very strong units but expensive and lack ways to make fast money.

Con: Balance is all over the place. This is a very MINOR con since I know the game will hopefully be balanced as time goes on. Right now, certain stuff is insanely OP. Fremen have an advisor which lets you start with a building that was supposed to be earned last in terms of economy. This results in you being insanely rich even in the midgame.

Con: The combat requires a lot of micro but for not much visual impact really. The units movement is kinda slow and janky and micro feels like either a chore or something you don't care about because you outnumber your opponent. 

Pro: The AI can actually harrass. Yes. The AI has a brain slightly better than your average red party enjoyer. Decent at harrassing in the mid and early game but obviously falls flat in the late game when they decide to split their army and you catch them offguard and kill half their army while the other half is on the way. From then on, you can probably just finish that entire faction completely.

Con: Cities require too much micromanagement for what it is. There is no list of cities or something, so you often find that you simply forgot to mouse over a city to realise it still needs buildings. At least a notification when zoomed out would be helpful to show you which cities still have stuff to do.

Con: Defense is too strong. Building 2 rocket pods and a functioning militia can almost always either kill your opponents raiding party or just delay them long enough for your army to reach and defend. There are no real ways of ""sneaking"" past a zone. Fremen for example have invisible units but the turrets detect them as soon as they enter the area so what is the point of being invisible?

Slight-Con: There is too much vision on the map. You can simply see too much. Your scout copters allow you to see too much with very little effort and this usually results and making the AI fights easier. A lot of time the AI was sending a decent force to take my city but I simply saw them 2 zones away and when they reached me, I was simply prepared to step on them.


All in all, a very promising start. With a proper campaign mode and some balancing for multiplayer as well as mod support (PLEASE ADD MOD SUPPORT IT WILL LITERALLY MAKE THE GAME SURVIVE 10 TIMES LONGER) it can be a really good game.

Not too micro heavy, not too micro heavy, just a right amount of fun. I suspect multiplayer can be extremely fun with all the ways the game offers you to fuck wiht your opponents using spies.

First of all, I like this game. It does justice to Dune, the gameplay feels for the most part very polished, and as far as I can tell against the AI, it is pretty well balanced for a game with asymmetric factions. I like the sleek settlement building and small armies, making choices actually matter. It feels very well-rounded already, and I've been really fascinated by the Fremen playstyle in particular. With that out of the way, lets get to what I'd like/hope to see change going forward...

My main must-have change is a better UX and UI. Game concepts should be explained way more to allow beginners an easier start, and expose necessary information to more advanced players. My holy grail in that category has been CK3, where everything has tooltips and the tooltips have tooltips if you need them. I understand this project may be smaller in scope, but for example I shouldn't have to click a button to find out when the next Spice/Solaris price will be set exactly. Just let me hover over stuff and I'd be happy. Additionally, events are barely noticeable in their current implementation as a quiet little pixel at the side of my screen, and I often don't even notice them until it's too late. Give me a pop-up that stops the time until I acknowledge the quest if I want that, maybe as a toggleable option between the old state and the new one. The same should apply to points of interest, let me actually read the flavour-texts that are almost hidden away in their current implementation. I'd also like a map filter that shows where exactly worms can spawn and were I'm safe, so I don't have to guess whether that rock in the desert will save me on my way to my target or is just eye candy. Doesn't even have to be a map filter, a tooltip telling me whether the ground I'm pointing at is sand or rock would also do.Even though I'm already beyond that stage now, a more comprehensive tutorial for beginners concerning thinks like ""Why it is smart to store spice until prices are good"" would surely be appreciated, but I assume you are already on that. An overview about all the ways to win would also be cool.


Now for the stuff I'd like to see beyond the necessary: The factions feel distinct, mainly through their unit roster and some of their special abilities. Nonetheless, I'd like even more differentiation, especially in the tech tree, the operations and the building roster. I think narratively the biggest benefit would be unique events though, giving smugglers a different flair than Harkonnens when they play instead of everyone and their mother having guests from Ix. Give me more narrative events related to what I do. If I'm friends with a sietch, let them ask me to sponsor a raid on my opponents! If I liberate a village, let me get standing with the natives! The other big thing I hope for is the multiplayer and the new faction to keep up the longtime motivation. Especially a new faction capable to mess with Landsraat politics would be most welcome, as at the moment Atreides basically steamrolls everyone on that front.

Lastly, for stuff that's more of the cherry-on-top kind: The presentation is solid, but especially the animations could use some work in my opinion. Particularly the close-quarters fights could use a tad more dynamic moves and less wooden arm shaking, and the worm riding looks almost comical as my units get drained down the sandy toilet. I like the sound-design in general, just the thumper could use a bit more THUMP in my opinion and the guns sound a bit too cartoonish sometimes. If I win the game and continue to play, I'd like some kind of gameplay reward for having won. Maybe let me annex enemy settlements like the Atreides. Or let me call in Sardaukar to wipe the slate clean. I know it's probably more DLC-territory than core game, but I'd like even more than five factions.

In conclusion, I'm overall very happy with the core gameplay and am willing to put faith into the future development of the project. This is a more than solid foundation, and I'm looking forward to see this game grow.",1651155768,1651155768,True,21,4,0.688344717025756836,0,True,False,True

Its absolutely not going to be everyone's cup of tea - Dune is quite harsh/punishing. Too quickly expand and you'll run out of  Water or not have enough military support to protect it. You'll find yourself strapped or boxed in, in so many ways. Suddenly the spice to solari exchange rate will change and you'll be strapped for cash. Or a new Landstraad vote will come up which will affect your military units. Or because you're fighting for some territory you lose a harvester to a sandworm. Or fuel cells shortage. Or plascrete. Or manpower. Management of each resource is critical to your success and while I've only played Atreides it already feels like each faction has different strengths/weaknesses in relation to each. 

There's so much depth here honestly and I think if you give it a try you'll quickly fall in love (like for example I think I'm like 3hrs in) 

I honestly can't believe how well they seem to have captured what I read on the pages of a book years ago. You've got the recent movie + my imagination has had years to run wild with Dune so I kinda expected a ton from the game but WOW so far it really delivers. 

There's political intrigue and voting and spying and infiltration missions, exploration with your Ornithopters - even the Sandworm mechanics are honestly just brilliantly executed. This game somehow captures all of that magic and brings it to life in a palatable, strategic way.

I'm a huge Northguard fan (670 hours), Dune fan (the gender swap thing, and the use of guns irks me... but it’s ok) and a tabletop game designer IRL. So I'm a sucker for this kind of game.

With Northguard (the developers previous big title) it started out as an average game IMO, but was polished over multiple years into something really special. So I expect the same thing with this title, Dune: Spice Wars is starting out as just ok and then if it can find a dedicated following Shiro Games will polish it into something great. I think I understand what Shiro is going for with this title. At its core it appears to be an economic game with a light smattering of other 4x elements.

(+) Art style, sense of space, atmosphere, etc…
(+) Combat, managing troop supply, dodging worms/storms with my troops, etc...
(+) Expanding feels fun. It was enjoyable to carefully consider where to expand my territory and what buildings to place down.
(+) Spying/Agents felt off during my first game, but then I started to learn how it worked and it ended up feeling good.
(-) Way too many Resources to keep track of… and the “Spice” actually feels unimportant and dull.
(-) Diplomacy, Voting on events, etc… all feels really bad and awkward.
(-) Scouting is boring as each tile is mechanically dull. Northguard nailed this area, as I was SUPER excited to see what each title held so that I could start to formulate my plans and adapt my strategies.
(-) To many time-based events. PLEASE stop trying to get me to watch clocks and numbers, I want to be watching the map/units/etc... not numbers ticking down.
(-) Harvesting automation: This entire game mechanic feels odd... they auto dodge worms (so them being attacked by worms has 0 effect on the game) and frustratingly don't auto redeploy, etc...

By controlling areas, you get building spaces. there you can chose from different buildings according to your playstyle and / or your faction. 
Economy: everybody needs it
Military: Better units? more units? defensive towers?
Politics / Science / Spycraft: Aim for controlling the ""council"", or try to research better stuff to make less count more? Or want to throw a wrench into your enemies´ economy with your spies by inciting rebellions or even assassinate their leaders?

There is NO economic victory afaik, but all relies on it.
Military victory is achieved by destroying the enemy factions main cities.
Council control victory is achieved by having more influence than the other factions combined so you can vote for yourself when the ""council leader"" is elected. Get re-elected two times and the game is won.
There is NO science victory afaik, but science makes everything easier.
Spycraft: assassinate all the enemies leaders and thus forcing them to give up. Have not finished it myself, but that should also work.

I found all ways at least a bit tedious in the end. Fighting the main fortress of the enemy faction takes ages; assassination and inciting rebellions does not ""feel"" that powerful at first and controlling the council takes eons, but seems to be the easiest way if everything else is already going your way. 

Stuff I found annoying:
The need to set the spice collectors to ""auto return"" AND to re-deploy them after they´ve been saved from a Sandworm. 
Some notifications won´t reach you until it´s almost too late. If some of your backwater areas are rebelling.. honestly, I didn´t realize it half of the time.

Amount of issues is almost infinite. 
Combat is boring and blunt. No real way to outplay your opponent other than just bring more forces, unit roster is ultra small, no vehicles, units are to damn expensive when your income is about 80 solari and cheapest unit costs around 300 plus upkeep and just to be clear this 1 unit alone wont be doing shit on map because again it is not AOE or SC where you can use a small amount of units to harras opponent. Your army will be doing nothing and just standing inside of a villages for like 99% of the time.

Oh boy economy is something even worse in this game for a lot reasons but mainly RNG.
Random events, random spawns, random loot cashes, random spice price changes etc.
You see again in games like AOE for example you start with 1 or 2 spot for every resource but here you have to pray to get a good spawn with a good resources nearby, Scouts are scouting super slowly and you cant really afford 2nd and without proper vision you just dont know what is in the region and if it is even worth your time. Cost to income ratio is just a joke and feels like numbers were done in some random generator.
Military units are ultra expensive but can be lost 1 second if you fail to micromanage them from the worm.
Imagine wasting like 1k solari on 3 units just to lose them in couple of seconds. Main city costs are absolute absurd, everything besides military building seems like pointless money waste. 1,5k solari just to build 1 district that gives harvester more hp, 1+ knowledge and harvester refresh rate(even though it is almost impossible to lose it if you have auto evac on), And ofc almost every building takes solari upkeep to slow this game down even more.

Now a little bit about worms, they are probably second biggest issue in this game, mainly because they are pure RNG and have ro rules.When does worm attack?Where does it strike? I mean yes you get warning like 3 seconds before the attack but that just to little for army and again doesn't impact harvesters because they have auto evac. Not even amount of troops have any real impact on worms tracking. Multiple times i have this strange situation where i send 2 squads to recover sth or cap a small village and i instantly trigger worm but when i attack enemy base with like 6 squads worm does nothing.
And again worm attacks are just to strong because you can use multiple units to 1 worm.

Now besides of all that game also lacks replayability.
Factions feel same, units have small difference in buffs.
No real different playstyle, advisors dont really offer something really new for each playthrough.

And for the last but not least asking price and what you get for it.
For 30$ currently you get a game with almost everything broken, no singleplayer, no multiplayer, no replayability, so for 30$ you just get to fight bots on same map(yes there is only 1 map with random spawns).
But ofc i already see people defending it because IT IS EARLY ACCESS and inhaling critical amount of Copium  thinking that ""oh just give game more time and it will have everything"" but no sorry if they are already asking for 30 bucks while game lacks basing things that game will have quality content in the future.
There were talks about some campaign which is funny, if you launched game at least once you realize campaign wont work here.
Sure,forget that 30$ is kinda a big sum considering that you can buy almost any RTS that was made before and it will have more polished content, singleplayer plus multiplayer.
30 for nothing, lets be real it is nothing, if any other studio would ask you to pay same price  for a game with 1 map and dumb AI with absolute broken core, you wouldn't even consider it, but slap famous Dune name on it and suddenly it is justified.

Spice Wars is actually a polished experience, and I would dare say a good game even, but I expected not to be in a ""mixed"" situation about this. It could still sort this out, especially if it ends up being moddable. (moddability was mentioned as a possibility)


It is really tough to recommend Dune Spice Wars and it's not because of EA.


(+)
The game is really neat and polished, on this part the studio always does an amazing job. Congratulations to them for this polished work. UI and camera are nice, however they do not help a big lot on the level of micro.

(+)
The multiple events and landsraad system makes me think it could use some moddability, and that would help the game immensely. (and I would remove my non recommendation in that case)

(-)
The game lacks some of the trademarks of previous Dune titles, and I don't speak here of the RTS-combat-style (that part is obvious and they have a right to try something different) but for instance it lacks the awesome soundtrack we had in Dune 1/2 or even 2000. There is a soundtrack but more absent and with less identity. Even the factions lack some identity because of how they are summarized and the components they share with each other.

I would have liked more identity in troops among factions.
I will test it further to check that. Maybe other factions have other soundtracks as well.

(-)
It also does not have the same ""story"" shared at the moment, but this part may evolve at release!

All that does not make the entire game I guess, because I feel this title has more potential in multiplayer.

(+)
The rest is closer to Sins of a Solar Empire or Hegemony III Clash of the ancients, in terms of ""strategic engine"", multiple cities (planets in Sins), decisions etc. I liked how neat was Sins engine, I find some of it here.

(-)
The game has a lot of micromanagement vs risks , which is closer to Northgard in my experience (when you have to fight mercenary raids, you have some micro in Northgard).I did not appreciate the quantity of realtime micro in Northgard to be honest, especially because combat lacked detail but still needed a lot of micro so I did not know what exactly was my ""player input"" or what I was here for, considering my military details was weak and my economical input was rather generic. I have some of this here. I put that into being ""a newbie"" in Northgard and maybe it's so in Spice Wars.

(++)
The most ""dune"" aspect Spice Wars has, and it succeeds at this really well, is the feeling that there is a lot of space, dunes, and risks to being in the desert. The supply system works really well with that, and the sandworm adds to this nicely. Of course, the graphics are nice as well to represent this.

(-)
What I feel was ""extra micromanagement"" is more because of the multiple mini-events that require attention, and the difference of momentum between picking a technology now, choosing a building, ""oh but I need to go there now that's an emergency"", etc. This means you'll use active pause all the time and still hardly feel ""in control"". It looks ok in the beginning, it's tough in the middle, and then oddly repetitive in endgame.

It is also hard at the moment to feel in control of all the resources and outcomes but that's because it needs more game time to feel it. For instance, the difference between factions and unit stats seems more important and more interesting the more you play.

Right now I feel I have already seen what the game engine is about, the kind of contents we play with and the level of micromanagement (and active pause) we have. I have also seen the atmosphere/immersion and music quality.

As mentioned, Spice Wars music is actually good, but far from the level of excellency we had in previous Dunes imo.

The game has a hard time beating Dune 1 or 2 in immersion and the cartoony art style does not help here. For now I feel this game is ""under"" Dune 1 & 2 first impressions and I am sad about it.

I would be thinking about not recommending this, but on the other hand, the developer is really clean and adding several factions later could still be interesting. I am torn.

Really, I am not satisified by picking recommended, or not recommended. So you can consider it a ""mixed opinion, but I have some interest in this game and looking at how it will evolve"".

For these reasons, I am sending this feedback - so that other players can decide for themselves - and am still keeping the game, in case it evolves in directions I would find great.",1651046025,1651131918,False,427,10,0.766745090484619141,0,True,False,True

Underwhelming so far. It would work far better as a board game. In fact it plays like a board game Clash of Cultures of Civilisation Through Ages but on PC. The ""RTS"" part could be easily changed into Turn-based and game would only benefit out of it because the RTS part that caters to nostalgia is completely bland.

So let's start with RTS mechanics - you get only handful of infantry for every faction and end up with groups of couple of them roaming the desert not fearing the Sandworms. Because Sandworms appear only to eat harvesters on when you fight for a long time - then you just go during fight into rocks. And that's it - for the whole game I've never seen Sandworm eat anyone. My infantry and enemy infantry was roaming desserts and eventually dying because lack of supplies not because of sandworms.
So going back to RTS - you produce infantry only in the main city, so when you loose some of them you have to supply from the main base or build transportation in conquered bases. So when we go to the buildings - it is typical economical building, I have no idea why anyone gave us the possibility to put building on the map instead of attaching it to the city, when buildings do completely nothing apart from missle towers which have range. You cannot capture them, sabotage them etc. In fact there are no buldings in the game apart from cities. What is called buildings should be called upgrades of cities. Even the areas with resources do not build buildings on resource fields. They are just there and add bonuses to your buildings even when field is long and resource field is on the other side of the field.

So in the end the RTS part of the game is completely underwhelming, boring and bland.

What are we left with? Eceonomy and politics. 
So let's start with economy - the whole Dune universe is circling around Spice. But the game isn't. The Spice is just a mean of making world vs player mechanic with taxes. And that's it. The rest of the resources can be gathered without even touching Spice. And if we go for resources - there are plenty of them. I'd say even too many for what we have available to build and do. Each aprt of the game uses their own resources - spying uses intel, landsraad uses seats and influence, building uses solari, plasticit, water, manpower, fuel cells, authority and we have additional hegemony. That's a lot of things to gather for 5 units and couple of buildings. Half of these could have been deleted and game wouldn't lose any bit of appeal.
But you gather them and gather them and you want to trade eventually? You cannot trade with CHOAM - only with other factions. Why? Why would I want to support my adversaries instead of selling stuff on other market? Bad design.

Politics and espionage are the most interesting part of the game, but overall most of the time politics happens too fast and have low impact on the game itself (though they look like they would have made a lot with 30% margins). Apart of acquiring Dune Governance - which wins you the game, because right now there is probably no way to claim it back.

Espionage is a fun little addition of ""commander powers"" from other popular RTS games used on regions. And that's it.

Oh and we have fun little game being core of the Spice Wars - which is flying with Ornithopter and gathering stuff around the map because it gives more resources than producing them and ornithopters are invincible...

Overall the game in actual state feels bland, underwhelming and started in bad design direction. So probably I will not change my mind about it later.",1651131198,1651131198,False,22,0,0.502546548843383789,0,True,False,True

============================

The real title of the game is ""Civilization VI: Dune - Spice Wars""

============================
============================



I absolutely ADORE the Dune universe, but this game is not worthy of the name Dune.


- Faction leaders don't really talk (same as in Civilization. Why?)
- Faction leaders randomly ask to talk only to say some random things...
- ...I.e. like: ""You are brave to be here"" (so, you summoned me here to ramble?)
- Clone of Civilization, with a reskin of Dune. Ergo, this game is just as bland. 
- If I want to play Civ., I would play Civ.
- There are spies... again, Civilization
- Replaced House Ordos with The Smugglers
- Interchanged the colours of House Atreides and [house normally known as] House Ordos
- Barely any units to create
- No tanks... Why?
- This should have been an RTS, not a 4X game...
- Trailer is misleading imo in terms of what I expected the game to be like
- Random bouts of lag

==================================

+ Some of the options are sorta cool to have
+ Nice graphics for what it's worth
+ Has Dune in the title

==================================


+ / - Game has a voting system (just like Civ *sigh*), at least here it's mildly cool, since you have ACTUAL houses. THAT makes sense, just poorly executed. It could have been way cooler and much more meaningful than it is right now.

+ / - You have advisors, people you can pick like Duncan Idaho among others. However, you can't really use them at all for advice, so this is bitter sweet. Not sure why they're called advisors then. They have passive skills, so that's the reason they're there. If they could be part of actual ingame politics like, ""Leto, I would suggest XYZ. I fear that House Harkonnen might try to out maneuver us here. ETC."" THAT would be cool, otherwise, there are no real characters honestly.

Any hardcore fans or people who are more familiar with the series take it with a grain of salt as this is more of a review done by someone who's play countless RTS, 4X and management sims. 

[u] Positives [/u]

- Great polish for an Early Access game in terms of gameplay and graphics

- Units are pretty diverse in passives/actives as well as design look and how they play (very impressed by that)

- The environment is beautiful (I challenge you not to zoom directly in, look at the sky at night and not be in awe)

- Its punishing but not in a ""i'll uninstall"" way but more it'll test your skills every single time and if you get too greedy it'll definitely show

- The city management is very simple and easy to pick up though hard to master when it comes to resource management which brings a very welcomed challenge

- Sand worms and storms are easily dodged but also very punishing if you don't pay attention

- The option to auto-recall your harvesters but at the cost of spice (Very good for learning to micro or if you don't care and just want to play a bit more chill) 

[u] Negatives [/u]

- No story mode (so far if there will be one)

- No multiplayer on release (Definitely will come later)

- Very micro heavy 

[b] Honestly besides these three I don't have many negative things to say about this game. [/b]

I genuinely believe this game is going to great as long as the devs listen to feedback and keep working hard because this looks and feels amazing already.

As I said in the title, I have never seen the movies or read the books but as a avid RTS lover I feel this game is great and as a competitive player it feels as though this could be good like that too!",1651123722,1651123722,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

Dune was the first SciFi series I ever read and I got tons of enjoyment out of the old Westwood games. Enjoying my few hours in so far I am alright giving a thumbs up to this game.

I would hold off on purchasing this title if you are not a fan of Dune. There is no story at all in its current state, no tutorials beyond a bare bones breadcrumb task to start getting spice... No shit its Dune. You will need to read tool tips to learn about the resources. The individual factions feel very similar to one another. You pick councilors from the books that adjust a minor modifier and then have no impact or voice in the game. I could see some enjoyment as a multiplayer game however the frequent need to attend multiple catastrophes at once necessitates the active pause. Its fine for a Single player game but would never work for MP.

Very limited unit counts and a lack of variety across the types, from the bog standard RTS infantry assortment, really slows down the action.

This is a very solid foundation for an early access title! It's remarkably stable -- a full campaign and I encountered no bugs, visual or gameplay, that I could see. The structure is a bit bare right now, with one game mode, four factions that play a bit differently, and no tutorial or story campaign or multiplayer skirmish implemented as of writing. If you're looking for bang for your buck, thirty bucks is a bit steep for this content right now.

Visually, the game has a look to it, and it does feel like Dune (a bit of a cross-section of the movies and the books) but it's also a bit... bland. It does the job, and it doesn't look bad, but it's missing something. It doesn't have the hyperdetailed production value of a Total War or one of the latter-day C&C games, aiming for something more exaggerated, but it also doesn't hit the stylistic highs of something with a similar art direction like Endless Legend. I'd like the visuals to grow alongside the game, but what's here, while a bit bland, is easy enough to vibe with.

But the game itself is fun! It's a real-time 4X, reminds me a bit of early-days Stellaris. The ability to pause and the slow speed of combat and alerts keeps things relaxing for those of us who don't have the best APM, but the real-time nature means that you feel like you are constantly having to make small but meaningful decisions moment to moment. The constant juggling of resources so that you're never running a deficit, using those resources to build structures or units or engage in espionage, is a fun bit of plate-spinning, and while the early game starts quite slow, by the end something's always happening and keeping you engaged.

There's balancing that needs to be done -- why does a plascrete factory have a plascrete maintenance cost? why isn'not make it free but provide less plascrete? -- but nothing felt particularly broken, and the stuff that did was situational, temporary, and costly. The AI could use some tweaking too, though I found it a breezy challenge. I was on the receiving end of some nasty schemes and incited rebellions more than once, and past the midgame the AI's got enough troops to take a few villages and make some real trouble for you. But after a certain point I didn't really feel in danger, and while I enjoy the taut relationships between the factions, there should be a few more diplomatic options to go with the politicking and espionage. For example: the Landsraad is a very important and interesting little thing that the noble houses get to do, but the Fremen are completely removed from it. Couldn't they have a similar system, but with the various sietchs? I have to imagine that's on the feature docket.

Still, I've had quite a bit of fun in my first campaign, enough to write this review! If you're way into Dune and strategy games, and you don't mind dropping thirty bucks, you'll have quite a bit of fun! If you're just way into strategy games... maybe wait until there's a few more features or the price drops a bit.",1651113295,1651113295,True,2,0,0.511600732803344727,0,True,False,True

And then, Dune came out.

As a big fan of the novels, movies, and board game.  I had to give this one a shot.  It does not disappoint and its currently only in early access.  4 factions, political intrigue, combat, random storms and worms.  I'm not sure if the current play mode is equal to Conquest in Northgard, or if its just a medium map with all the ais, but I've just played 4 hours of it and finished with a diplomatic victory and been secured as Duke.  

And what the AI did when I was ahead, was what I wish I could convince players to do when someone gains a lead in the board game. ALLIANCES.  Work together to hit the same guy, and I was having rebellions and supply shortages all over the place.  I was constantly putting out fires while trying to sustain my pending victory condition.

What works:
- Graphics: at first i was worried about more comicbook style and all the colors but after playing it I find gorgeous and pleasing on the eye. Definitly will not get boring after a while like realistic desert and rocks could.
- Audio and atmosphere: Jesper Kyd again nails it completely with his soundtrack, but what I was surprised about were ambient noises, unit voices, sounds of cities and other things. Ornithopters wings are especially pleasing on the ear, I love zooming in on them. This feels and sound like Dune media should.
- A lot of deep and interlocking systems: while there is probably quite a lot of balancing to be done (to tell exactly where will require more time to play, will come back to this in another post) I absolutely love how thematic all the mechanics are. Of course there were liberties taken, like the interaction between shields and lasers, but that doesnt stop Dune:Spice Wars to feel like its the first game that properly adapts most of the aspects that Dune books are known for - backstabbing, meddling with Landsraad, politics. Low count of units (thank god there is no armored vehicles everywhere but will come back to that later on) really adds to this - its not a combat game. You really need to plan your moves and use your strengths and weaknessess.
- Different factions: just like mechanics they feel like they should. And finally Atreides are green and Harkonnen black. I've been waiting for years to see that. Lower unit rooster and count even in late game doesnt stop the game to tactical - positioning, planning couple of ""moves"" ahead and recon (&espionage) is key here. While there are only infantry units for each faction (with specialized drones for two factions instead of one human unit) they are specialized between each faction even in the steps you unlock them. Different factions have different strenght and playstyles, for example Fremen have to rely on missions since their connection to Landsraad (and according buffs) is limited and instead of paying the Emperor they pay the Spacing Guild, nice touch.
- UI: nice, clean and simple to read. Simple as that but needs ability to resize. I would have problems on a bigger screen and higher resolution than 1920x1080.
- No overblown tutorial, that holds your hand: I love how you need to click to explore things yourself and how the devs doesnt treat us like idiots, but its not exactly without failts, more below.

Whats could be changed or added:
- Tutorial: tiny bit more early events and more clear ""tutorial UI"". I only noticed that buttons flash during tutorials when the council screen one came up, because they were flashing literally above it. More clear markings or small screen shot showing it and short description where to find it would be enough to make tutorial better.
- Encyclopedia: every 4X game has it, we all love those and they are a great help for players. When learning all info is easier to see and its fun to plan your moves while paused there. Models for things in game, like worms, buildings, units etc woould be cool addition as well as some additional info and/or more flavour text to scratch that itch in players that doesnt know the universe. Frank Herbet already made his, that nicely written so inspiration is there.
- Spacing Guild mechanic: why not add different elite unites, maybe even just one military and one agent for each faction. Those are expensive and you can even add some vehicles here. They of course have to restricted - bigger worm attraction, not possible to transport them and only one available to be active. This way player will need to make a choice when to summon it and where. It cant travel far on sand (sandworm goes nom nom) so positioning and timing would be key.
- Bene Tleilax mechanic: why not get a ghola of third councillor from those with political bonuses or hero units from military ones? (using Duncan Idaho on the field?). Other option would be cool buff, maybe different for each faction. This of course, like Spacing Guild options, would be expensive and for late game.
- Soundtrack to buy or listen on Spotify or YouTube ;)
- Fremen units visible while riding the worm (tiny ones are enough)

All in all Im extremely surprised by Dune: Spice Wars. Wasnt expecting it to be this good, complex and content rich at the beginning of early access. There is a ton of value here for 30 bucks (70zlotych) and even more will come - story campaign (different from the books), multiplayer, map editor, mod support, more factions and functions based on our feedback.
If that wasnt enough Dune: Spice Wars is the Dune strategy game I always wanted after playind Dune Mod for Civilization 4 but in real time like Sins of the Solar Empire. Dont get me wrong, I love and still play Dune 2 with higher resolution mod and quality of life improvements but that game is just one aspect of Dune universe, this has most of it.

For fans of Dune story this is essential, even now in ea. For fans of old Dune games - please read the description and genre footnotes, it clearly says what it is. Watch gameplay videos, guides (there will be many) and maybe try it. Strategy fans that want to wait - take note, there is something really special cooking here and multiplayer might be amazing with all the systems and faction diversity.

Really big kudos to the whole team, their love for the universe oozes from this game in bucketloas. It still needs some work of course, be it balancing, new functions, campaign etc. but by now its already my second favourite game of this year after Elden Ring.

Dune is back in gaming world, with a bang and Im happy. Now if Funcom wont make a poopoo out of their Dune survival game I will be in Dune heaven.

What a year to be a fan of oldschool fantasy and scifi. And there is still Stalker 2 on the horizon. Oh boy... :)

PROS
Don't get me wrong - this is extremely polished for an early access game. Beautiful art\graphics, well polished interface, very stable build, and the elements in the game that are there work well. Just for capture of the look and feel of the Dune Universe it would get a 10/10 from me.

CONS
However, beneath that beautiful facade, the lack of variety and depth in the gameplay and baffling choices in game design let it down for me. The most disappointing aspect of this is the factions in the game and how they play - the factions could be more radically different play-style wise, and I feel like the whole game as a whole could just lean into the amazing depth of the lore (random special events that really shake it up - the whole war of assassins, fremen uprisings, spacing guild interventions etc.). 

I was somewhat disappointed that the Fremen and smugglers have the same goals and play like the other two noble Houses - the developers could really learn from the asymmetrical play-styles of the factions in games like Endless Legends. If they change the design of the former two factions to be closer to the books I'd really reconsider coming back to this. 

Because of this, there ultimately isn't much depth in the game, and little to no replay value, especially since there's little to no story or worldbuilding\lore in the game, which is sad because of how rich the universe is. 

SCORE
For this, my ultimate score for the game would be more like a 6 or at most 7 out of 10. The gameplay really lets it down. I understand that this is early access and if the developers really put in the work to flesh out the differences between the various factions and introduce more setting elements into the game I'd gladly revisit it.",1651002336,1651105454,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Balancing economy and resources determine 90% of the game, with combat being a little too simplistic. You really only need to right click to send your army to fight - the winner is the stack with the best bonuses, so you don't do too much here. Combat could be improved, by making it a little slower paced and more tactical (also please, stop units auto attacking and chasing enemies into their village). I like the idea that wars are determined by macro factors such as economy and strategy, but the game still encourages micro due to melee/ranged control and overzealous unit auto attacks. If you want me to pay attention to combat, make it slightly more interesting. 

Issues aside, it has great overall visual/audio presentation. Mastering the economy feels amazing. Each faction has just enough flavor to make them have their own style while still being familiar, though I would prefer perhaps a bit more work to make each faction play a bit more different. The game is addictive, and feels like it honours the source material. Arrakis feels dangerous, as it should, and not respecting the desert can get you killed.

You build up your empire on the planet of Arrakis, juggling all the different resources like spice, water, manpower and metals. By building different troops, like swordsmen and gunners, you conquer territory. In each territory you can build different buildings to bring in resources. However, as you expand you have to defend as well, against both raiders and computer players. In the meantime all kinds of events can happen that have impact on your resources. You could quickly start running a deficit and that could make part of your empire collapse. By exploring with your ornithopters you can find new villages, spice fields and resources to collect. Diplomatically you can enter agreements, trade and enact all kinds of bonuses (or detriments) through the Landsraad, a political council which includes the other computer players. Agents can be used to run all kinds of covert operations, like sabotage.

Pretty complex game, thats is thematically very well done. Arrakis is a desert planet, but each territory is different and looks great. You see the sands glistening and hear the winds howling. When there is a worm sign you need to move your troops or retrieve your harvesters. Sandstorms move about and can really screw up your invasion plans.

It's a resource management game with light focus on combat and an even lighter focus on political ties to the other houses. That being said, it's fun for what it is if you're a fan of the lore, but other than that it's pretty mid-ranged. 

However, even while keeping in mind that this is still in Early Access, 4X veterans should probably stay away regardless because this game is not as deep as what you're used to. 

Pros:
[list]
[*] Translates Dune lore into game mechanics pretty decently
[*] Good entry point into 4X genre
[*] Tons of resources to keep an eye on
[*] Voice acted house leaders is good to have
[*] Each house has a distinct means to victory 
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Sandworm barely presents any danger and can be avoided entirely.
[*] Buildings and units cannot be upgraded
[*] There's maybe about 8 or 9 combat units total not counting the local AI controlled Militia units.  On that note, combat itself is very barebones and there's no combat strategy whatsoever (no terrain benefits, no special unit functions, and no grouped unit benefits).
[*] Spice has no function other than upkeep costs or trade fodder. For example: you cannot donate more spice to The Emperor to gain any benefits/favors whatsoever.
[*] That being said, the higher powers themselves have no function other than to collect upkeep costs. Voting sessions are held exclusively between the active houses. The Emperor sends no decrees or passives that are outside of the Houses' control that affect the game whatsoever.
[*] A lot of the mechanics aren't explained to you properly such as the Infiltration/Spying functions which are arguably one of the strongest things in the game.
[*] Spycraft seems to be REALLY REALLY broken right now with seemingly no way to stop any active functions that Agents started in an area (FYI, Counterintelligence simply gives a percent chance to help [i]prevent[/i] incoming assaults, but if something is active there's no way whatsoever to quell it). For example - if I run a [b]Ghost Market[/b] function on an opponent's town, there's no way for that opponent to counter it once it's active. They MIGHT have a chance to prevent it from starting if they invested into Counterintelligence, but once something is live it's unstoppable until it has run its course. Initially it may seem like this is intentional and it's fine, but the problem is this gets out of hand when you get the Uprising ability with your Agents. Once you get that function, you can literally just remove an opponent from the game by repeating it on all of their towns and there is no way for the opponent to retaliate.
[*] Alliances with other Houses amount to nothing other than trading for resources - which normally would be linked to a relationship meter, but here, even acting aggressive to another House can result in that House sending you trade requests for random resources WHILE one of their territories is being demolished by your troops.
[/list]

Overall: I do recommend for newcomers to the 4X genre and the hardcore [b]Dune[/b] fans, but for 4X veterans, you will get really bored really fast. If there was a middle option for recommending between yes and no, this would fall under that category for sure.

First off: I love the graphics, they are spot on and ""feel"" (yeah. I wrote that) great. Now comes the BUT... it is a good game, but it feels like somebody who throws the ball and instead of throwing it over the whole field, it just flies short. I really would kike to have more things to do instead a do an awful lot of rescource management (numbers) and waiting for things to come. Some ideas are really good (morale, that soldiers die in the desert, but it always feels like an afterthought). I would like to have a game were I have to plan how to get through the desert, instead it is a nuisance. Wrong focus un my opinion. Less numbers, more things to do on the map I would say. I really don't like click fests and mostly play turn based, but this is even for me too slow.

And I understand that combat has to be simplified, but at least a little bit more than Blob against Blob? I mean I can see that they tried, but I would love to see more trickery with different weaponry so that you can play ""your style"". 

Espionage? It is a numbers game in the end. I don't know how I feel about this. Because we already have a gazillion rescources for nearly everything. Spice is not as important as I thought it would.

It is a great start, the graphics are beautiful and playing is fun, but I don't know if I want to spend that much time with it, it seems to be rather shallow (regarding the gameplay loops). I won't refund, because I want to see the devs flesh out this game.

Pretty relaxing strategy game that focus on macro rather then micro.
Perhaps abit to relaxing, even on a small map it can take nearly an hour before you start fighting other factions. Once another faction is introduced then the map might be about the right size for 30 minute first contact.

I will just focus on the bad stuff that if devs make changes will make it 9/10.

Game needs improving on notifications, i have had so many military troops eaten by sandworms as i'm looking at the intel or research screen its embarrassing. So far you get tiny pop ups in the corner of screen but it could improve with it being bigger and making noises. This is also a issue when enemies attack your villages, if your not paying attention then those notifications ain't gonna be helpful and by time you notice they are halfway converting your village.

Enemy Cities are near invincible, i had 10 minutes left before enemy faction had Landsraad victory by time my 60 command army came. By the end of the 10 minutes i had only taken the city to half health.. wtf? Cities need reducing of hp or a siege unit is required in this game that has massive bonus damage to buildings. 

Next i find Landsraad victory to hard to undo, how fuck do i get them off the council position? do i just have pray it comes up so i can dump my influence in it or does it mean the game will come to end and i better make sure i send 60 command of units to their capital instantly as the timer starts or its a auto lose? devs change this and also put the victory timer on the main screen, first time i noticed this i had hover over the art to find i only had 15 minutes left to lose.

More units are required, i had mentioned a siege unit but maybe some other vehicles would be nice like artillery, balancing would be that sandworms are literally triggered by their movements and gives armor cracking units better stuff to shoot at. There also slots just for scout Ornithopters, Ornithopters in the Dune universe had many variants and so it be nice to see these.

Lastly we have carry alls that lift spice miners from sandworms but i don't see anything about causing terrorism against the carry alls so they are delayed/destroyed from lifting spice miners which will result in their destruction. It be nice if carry alls were actually a real unit and had base location(maybe the capital) and had slots like the ornithopter. Then through military and intel they can be disrupted and destroyed resulting in spice mining production being disrupted.",1651085609,1651085609,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

I had good vibes about the project from the moment I heard it was Shiro games behind it - and also was very heartened by the source material they were using (the whole cannon of Dune board games and computer games and both films etc). 

It is not (and was obviously never meant to be) a modern version of Westwood Associates Dune RTS. 

Instead its closer to a computer 4X boardgame - with some systems resembling Northgard or Offworld Trading company - but hugely rooted in the Dune universe and having learned a lot of lessons from what's great about the multiplayer table top games. 

Graphically its a little bit cartoony, but very attractive and absolutely suiting the theme. Its a lot more complex than I was expecting and has a very large number of moving parts. 

The four factions provided at early access are nicely asymmetric and provide great variety and actually winning this thing is quite a challenge. 

All in all I'm hugely impressed by what I've played already and am massively looking forwards to multiplayer. 

If there's any mark of caution to be made its know what you are getting into to: 

This is a 3-4 hr game that is like the computer equiv of a fairly complicated multiplayer boardgame. Its not the kind of RTS where you play a match to completion against the AI or your friends in 60 mins. 

I say this is a strong recommendation for anyone who has wanted an excellently themed Dune strategy game and to anyone who loves the kind of long Paradox strategy games (Stellaris/EU/ etc) but wishes that the game could be done in an evening rather than taking weeks!

This deserves to be a massive hit.

Multiplayer isn't released yet, but I'm eagerly anticipating it to play a few rounds with friends.

As with a lot of these games, it's hard to know where to focus to succeed. I think the 'quest' system where you get some short term objectives and a reward (or to stave off a penalty) is really cool, but I missed a few of them because the UI element was small and far away from the other notifications.

There are a couple of 'missing' keyboard shortcuts. I'd really like to iterate through the list of each village I control because micromanaging the buildings in each is important.

1) DEEPER MILITARY: My number #1 complaint (granted as a Emperor: Battle for Dune fan) is that MILITARY limitation to ONLY effectively INFANTRY troops only. I'd like to see some TANKS, ARTILLERY and AIRCRAFT incorporated and added onto the military roster. 

For example: Similar to the Missile Turret site positioning that can sometimes cover 2 villages, then with a slow but long-range Artillery military unit placement can strike or defend 2 villages and has to be placed on rock outcroppings.

Tanks and Artillery would need larger battle-spaces so rock outcroppings need to increase in the map generation. More on that later in the MAP and REGION generation points #5 and #6.

Also, units to cost less command and there to be much higher command.

I don't like that most of my villages are only defended my milita. Very tough to have a defensive and an offensive force. All ends up being is one big ball of infantry moving across the map slowly, with no meta way currently to have ACTUAL multiple fronts... it's just one slow-moving boring front... and any other front where other factions are pushing you, you auto-lose because militia suck. This problem would exacerbate especially if there are more factions added down the line, adding more venues/theaters/regions to be raided and invaded from.

2) FIX airports.
I dunno, currently with how small the radius is (even with upgrades), these do NOT justify their costs.
Either significantly increase the default and upgraded ranges.
Or
Change how they operate.
By reading the tooltips, I thought that any regions with an Airport would be able to instantly travel via its shuttles.
This way, I could be strategic and put one airport by a village closest to my ORIGIN CITY and then another Airport to the eastern frontline. Then, any new troops could (for fee and cooldown) use this airport to travel to my eastern front village.
However, this was not possible to do in the current build. The most my unit could travel is just really just a SINGLE village away... 
Airports should allow you to move 3-5 villages/regions away. Fine, maybe not 10 or more. But 1-3 villages distance is WAY too little.

3) EXPANDED BUILDINGS META
At 500, all 5 slots filled, a village should be able to upgrade to a City, with at least half the districts as the ORIGIN city.
Reward for developing a village fully.
In special regions, for example where a Sietch would provide 100% maintenance for all buildings and where there is a unique resource (spice, metals, rare minerals), then that region would take priority over a region with no sietch or unique resources.
Limit the # of cities and cap them fine.
However, the current ONLY single ORIGIN or starting City with development/districts feels VERY not 4X to me.

4) MORE FACTIONS! Just 4 is waay too limiting. Either for free or via DLC, I'd LOVE to see the following: House Corrino, House Ix, Bene Tleilax, Bene Gesserit, Sardaukar.

And even though the following factions are already included in the Espionage screen, I'd still be excited to play the following: The Spacing Guild, CHOAM, and Landsraad.

5) MORE MAP GENERATION toggles/settings. 
For example: What if I want an almost sand-less but craggy, more Sahara-like Arrakis? This way, the worms are almost not a threat, but instead storms and earthquakes or lava are.
Also, this rock-outcropping 90% map or High on ""buildable"" and ""worm-safe"" terrain would open up more epic battles with heavier MILITARY like vehicles/tanks and artillery.

Or opposite: Make the sand most of the world and really punish the players, almost survival game mode type.

6) MORE UNIQUE REGIONAL effects
All games so far has this POLAR ICE CAP right in the MIDDLE of the map ALL THE TIME which basically the ownership of takes care of ALL of your water problems for the playthrough and gives you 1K hegemony. 

Compared to other regions, this region is too powerful. I think it needs to be scaled back, like to something 25-33% of itself but have 3-4 more of these sprinkled throughout the map. So yes, a single faction may eventually control ALL 3-4 of such polar caps but not just ONE single faction steamrolls then hard.

That's it for now. I'll add to this review, as I play more and patches come in.

Oh, I don't think there are too many resources to manage. I just want more control/settings/deeper gameplay, especially for end-game.

Over 'n out!

Great, easy to understand diplomacy involving you casting your votes and influence to decide benefits and losses upon each election for various roles.

Simplistic yet meaningful army production and upgrades, including the leveling of surviving units, deadly environments, and supply limitations keeping you from venturing too far from your own territory.

Generous worker placement in the form of Agents that gain your resources and allow you to create active schemes to use to sabotage, steal, encourage or negate conflicts.

Authority / Water / Influence system is straight from Northgard, although the game is much more generous in your production of these resources, allowing for a much larger area of influence across all factions.

Scouts are safe from attack, allowing them to simply survey the map at an upkeep cost.

Trade is also very simple and easy to navigate. I just wish we could enter a numerical value rather than move left or right as if it were a slider to finely tune amounts traded.

The four factions feel unique, yet similar. Some favor political warfare, others espionage or even military might. But each faction can attain any victory in their own way upon the tech trees and district building choices.

District Buildings also provide a incredible system that allows a faction to go all in on one style of play, or to broaden their horizons and become a jack of all trades.

Multiplayer is not currently in this build, so for those looking to play alongside their friends, I would hold off for now.

Framerate dips quite significantly below 60fps by the end game, with significant stutters upon switching between the overview (fully zoomed out) map, and the isometric camera view.

Overall, Dune: Spice Wars Early Access (April 27, 2022) is engaging, incredibly re-playable and offers a unique experience that feels different enough from Northgard and unique enough in the 4X / Real Time Strategy hybrid genre that it stands on it's own as a great foundation for what's to come.

For example, spying is now essential a magic-power research tree that provides special abilities for more spies slotted into 1 of 8 areas. Diplomacy is a combination of trade, which works much the same as any Civilization or other 4X game, and a vote that pops up every few days that allows players and AI to trigger global or singular buffs and debuffs. You can trade just about any resource, including a currency used in voting, so it's clear trade and voting are part of the same diplomatic system.

Spice Wars, as described, is clearly a step back from the freedom of the 1979 board game. However, the mentioned board game has alot of problems and is not single player. Given how later Dune strategy board games have stripped out the spying and diplomacy layer almost entirely, I think what Spice Wars has come up with for these systems is very nice even if it feels like a paltry riff on existing 4X systems.

There's no real story at the moment, so you'll want to wait for content updates if you're looking for scenario setups or plot missions of any kind. There's always the possibility that we won't get more, after all.

Combat is expanded from what the board games provide, as each faction has access to more than 2 unit types, but it's currently also limited in ways RTS or 4X gamers might not expect. Most normal units die very easily in open desert, for example, and each faction only has a handful of different unit types: a recon, a melee, a ranged, a unit that can weaken armor, and a few others with faction-specific skills. Acquiring large armies is extremely expensive, so you're typically managing a small tactical force while defending captured towns with militia units that cannot be moved between towns. Most early-game combat, then, occurs between players and raiding parties of unaligned units who appear only to try and destroy your hold on your towns. Raiders are alot like the barbarians from the Civilization series, only I haven't found a way to totally destroy or capture their strongholds yet.

The factions available feel very distinct from what I've played. The constant economic pressure to mine enough spice for tribute and for income, to balance your income, and to keep enough materials generally forces me to lean into what appears to be the dominant strategy for a given faction. For example, the Harkonnen can squeeze the towns they capture for great benefit, but must be alert for insurrection. The smugglers, by contrast, must often choose between capturing a town for short-term loss and long term gains or looting it for better short term gains but potentially long term economic impact. And the Atreides, being propaganda specialists and generally decent rulers, can convince towns to join them without bloodshed and potentially lost troops.

If you're looking for a bag of solid 4X game design with Dune flavoring, Dune: Spice Wars is probably for you. Same goes if you own any of the board games.

But this game is a really Dune in name only.  Almost as if someone took Sid Mier's Civilization and gave it a fresh coat of Dune. 

The key to the game is micromanagement.  Gather your resources whether it is Spice, Solaris (money,) Political Influence, etc, etc.  Use them all to move towards a win.  There may be too many resources to manage.  The longer the game goes, the more you have to pay from all of these resources.  If you're not in to that kind of game mechanics, this probably is not the game for you.  Especially if you're looking more of the previous Dune titles.

For me, it's an ""OK"" game.  Nothing amazing.  Nothing really ""Dune-ish.""  There really is no story here which was something I always enjoyed in previous games.  I also found the soundtrack a little disappointing.  Aside from the graphics, which are quite good, there was a lack of Dune atmosphere.  This game could have been set in other eras from the Old West, to ancient Rome, to just being set in Iceland, and still been the same game.  

Depending on the type of games you like to play, I may or may not recommend this to you.  For what it is, it's strategy game for sure.  But if you're looking for the Dune experience, this isn't the game for you.

(All appreciation is based on standard difficulty)

*Combat*
- Enemy primary base defense and health feels unbalanced, you can charge it with 6 units (Demolition - Warrior - Range) and still lose without any other defend units left on the enemy side.
- Sand attrition (health damage) also feels quite unbalanced, units cannot travel between territories without losing all protection and some health. This makes really hard to recover or defend territories outside of your Region.

*Diplomacy*
- Haven't seen any good options on diplomacy really other than trading. No temporal alliance attempt, no de-escalation of war. Could use more AI in that regard I believe.

*Economy*
- Spice/Solaris rate feels doable, not precisely easy to balance but doable and enjoyable. Spice spots should be bigger and red I believe though xD (Lore Wise)
- Tax is waaaay unbalanced in my opinion.... why is it always increasing? Is it village based, is it time based, is it inflation based lol? I don't really understand the forever rising tax.
- Wind spots per region is a brilliant idea.

It's just too bland at the moment. There's only 4 factions, no storyline, mechanic is too repetitive, it only scales up later and quickly. So it's very linear and too basic.

I really like how they combined a lot of game play features like battles, economic, politic and managment part of the game.

Each fraction feels very  unique in gameplay that make game balance more asymmetrical and interesting.
(My favorite fraction is The Smugglers because they allow you to deploy a underground market in enemy city and earn passive money)

The graphic style of game is really fantastic and very pleasure to watch it .

Right now im experienced some optimization issues when new VFX is appear on screen while battle happening ( Maybe this VFX is spawning from memory without pre-pulling it to map) cause a FPS drop.

Looking forward for co-op / multiplayer experience where are i will spend several hours with friends to play one round.

Five hours in so far. I've played two games:

1. First game in and there were some very basic guiding missions that helped get me started understanding the interface and various different resources. After about an hour, I felt significantly overwhelmed as there were so many various resources, icons, and events happening that I couldn't keep up. Another hour in and I was leading a Hegemony victory, but another faction attacked a village I controlled and I was unable to annex it back because of a small bug. I reported the bug and started a new game.

2. Second game I knew the resources, understood most of the interface, and set a few goals for myself. I told myself I wouldn't pause except to handle trades and votes and I played at the fastest speed. It took me three hours to secure a Hegemony win at the fastest speed, on the easiest difficulty, with worms/storms/etc. turned to the lowest spawn.

I'm absolutely terrible at this game and will be for a while, but it's beautifully designed, has an awesome interface, and is straightforward to pick up. The scrolling to go from 3D, to Isometric, to an overhead tactical map is smooth and incredible. For Early Access Day 1, I'm shocked that the game feels as polished as it does. Are there some performance blips, weird bugs, and lack of features? Absolutely, but that's exactly what I expected when I bought it.

First up I like this game.  Now for a bunch of things I didn't like or didn't understand.
My first game as Harkonnen I only found 1 spice node, and there was no more so I ran out of spice.  If you want to build structures and have some military, economy etc., that will cost you upkeep from your spice resource.  No spice means you can't get spice.  (It's harder to produce when you have none, have to scale back on certain buildings)
My second game as Atreides I ran out of plascrete and couldn't get anymore, even though I found a plascrete node.  You need 50 plascrete to be able to build a plascrete refinery.  No plascrete means you can't build a plascrete refinery to harvest plascrete.  
The game works on a basic exploration of zones, similar to Northgard.  It seems to be totally random what you find in each new zone as you explore, so it seems common to run into this problem where you simply run out of resources.  And once you're out of those resources, you can't get more if you've been unable to find said resources through exploration.  
Has great ""Look and Feel"" of Dune.   The Sandworm for example, is really cool looking.  That's one thing to keep me coming back.
There are likely numerous game mechanics I am missing, however it seems a little strict with the random aspect, and you just hope you find what you need, water, spice, plascrete, etc.  So careful management of your resources is important, just in a way different from what I thought I was doing.",1651045910,1651048320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Games would sometimes be over before you even finished ya coffee. 

I needed something a little more diverse, something to stimulate more parts of my brain that grew tired of a genre which repeated its self for so many years.

I spammed the shit out of Northgard and realized that I loved this fresh new pace. Instead of doing things as fast as you can like an asian on crack, you can ease into the game, slowly scout out areas of interest, seek which towns are more important to take for your resource gain etc. 

I love that I have to think about managing multiple resources instead of build a refinery and let the harvester mine spice and ill just spam units until the cows come home.  
There are real consequences to miss managing your economy. If you try to use brute force, you may be punished if you can't keep that army supplied - Even worse when you don't pay your imperial spice taxes. 

I had all my resources in the green, had a well built army, only to have lost the whole crew to a sand worm that I didn't see coming. That set me back HUGELY. In dune 2000, a worm comes eats a unit, cool story bro ill just build another 20 in 5 seconds. 

As the game goes on, in the 2nd hour it just ramps up and gets more difficult and intense to manage depending on how well you did in the first hour, what towns you took, what buildings you built and where you placed your points in. 

if you slip up, you will pay greatly. The skill is in learning how to manage every aspect of your empire from beginning to end. On top of that, you have your enemy empires, pulling shiftiness on you through espionage and political gain which adds more heat to the frying pan. When they begin to bleed you dry of resources then send strong experienced troops to your borders, you are in trouble. 

I tell ya, if you can't handle this kind of heat, stay out of the kitchen and go back to pump and dump. As much as I loved that style of game play, I find this much more alluring as I've gotten older. It seems like because of the many aspects to winning and influence the systems have on this game, each game will be unique.

Everything has weight, and depth, and complexity, yet not to a point where it is waayy to much information and my brain is completely overwhelmed like in TOTAL WAR or something. There are multiple ways to win rather than just SPAM LE ZERG. I love the new parts of my brain this is working. 

If you suffer from ADHD don't play it, you'll probably get so bored that you'll write a review 20 minutes after playing a single game to tell us all you don't like it and that it's boring without even having experienced it. 

I love the potential here, and I love this fresh new feel of a strategy game this is.  With community feedback, I feel this game is only going to get better.

I like that you have to fend off raiders every now and then, but homies, add in the Sardukar that appear randomly and do some serious damage to your empire,  A couple more destructive environmental weather scenarios and possibly some more KEY points to take over which influence resources and unit production or unique weapons or shields or even HERO units, where instead of say Duncan Idaho being a Councillor and used as a passive bonus, he is a unit that you can use  on the battlefield. 

A couple of changes and further developments to this solid game and in my opinion we got a banger. Good Job, Shiro, Keep the spice flowing.

I've picked it up because I do find the Dune universe intriguing (will read and watch everything in due time) and I love 4x games. This version of 4X in real time is like a breath of fresh air and I find it super entertaining. I'm loving the game and can't wait to see how it develops and what kind of a campaign we will get.

- Some stuttering is possible (no crashes here) - Otherwise runs well
Stutter is mostly happening as a 'one-time' event 90% of the time the game runs just good.

Is it worth 30EUR? For me yes, it was worth the price. In today's market 30 is totally acceptable, especially if we get a full blown campaign later. --> For now definitely not enough content for the price tag though.

Conclusion: There are still some kinks to work out (some political/resource balancing is still needed, bug fixes, etc.), but from the price point of $30, I really think this is a fun time - especially if you're a Dune or Civ fan.

My Ramblings: 
This being early access, there are some very minor bugs I've found so far (t-posed units, inconsistent framerate drops, misspellings) but nothing game-breaking, yet. There's also a very limited tutorial, so best for those who are coming from at least a 4x strategy background. I think newcomers to the genre will be quite lost.

That said, I played this already for over 10 hours. It was exactly what I was hoping for. You won't get the complexity of Total War here, if that's what you're looking for. I think this is much closer to the Civilization series, in that it's pretty easy to pick up/approachable to incoming players (but smaller in scope than that, obviously). The RTS elements, at least in single player, are more about management for whatever Arrakis throws at you and comabt. Think real-time Risk + Civ city building.",1651039741,1651039741,True,3,0,0.52895432710647583,0,True,False,True

Many people recommending seem in my regard kind of biased due to their love for the serie, just look at the reviews full of the Dune references and little about the game itself.

The tutorial barely helps to grasp the game at all but it doesn't bother that much because the game is so shallow and has nothing to offer as content.
In less than 2 hours, you could say you've seen pretty much already most of its mechanism.

Multiple resources fail to be any relevant in a perhaps poor attempt to give a feeling that it has a little more than it really does because they do pretty much nothing. It's actually more annoying as it is just there so you are forced to play tiny in your little map.

The largest map is still smaller than absolute most of RTS or turn-based strategy games I have played except those on mobile.
Does it have any awesomeness of massive battles? No.
Does it have any complex or deep game system? No.
Does it have any interesting diplomacy? No.

It feels just like an arcade.
Or a game that was intended to be a mobile game.

If you want a light game, go ahead. It might entertain you.

Really good pacing for a 4x strategy game, and it feels like the politics and economy of Dune was effectively replicated, as well as the military. The Landsraad system is awesome and  feels true to lore.

 My suggestions would be to add an airforce - dog fighting, paratroop drops (expensive and dangerous but offensive deep strikes and extractions), airstrikes which would naturally expand the thopter variety. The scouting ability of the thopters without danger of being shot down also feels overpowered.  Another suggestion I have is to add more of the esoteric stuff from Dune such as the religious dogma, and I would be really happy to see more from the bene gesserit than just strong infiltrators.  The Dune universe is full of overpowered legions of soldiers, perhaps getting access to warrior fanaticism buffs (or the weirding way or the voice) under certain conditions (such as bene gesserit 'holy war/preparing the way' victory condition? And finally perhaps fighting vehicles or suspensor frigates would add depth to late game and city cracking ability.  Oh, and House Corrino with sarduakar! Perhaps as a pathway to victory condition?

You start off as one of 4 very different factions, which is a lot like the different tribes in Northgard. From there, you need to play to your strengths, protect your weaknesses, and exploit every advantage as you fight the three other factions, and the planet itself.

Gameplay is a lot like Northgard mixed with Civ 5 and a really well-balanced political system, which is always the biggest issue with DUNE games. They really nail the turmoil and backstabbing with tons of options to use spies and other resources to fight without soldiers. 

A lot of the game is spent resource managing. You are always at war with the other factions, and improving relationships through trade just means less frequent attacks, there is no peace. Hitting the other factions spice mines while protecting your own is key, and the loss of one could collapse your entire economy in a few minutes. There is a pause button that lets you issue commands and choose the speed of the game, much like Paradox games, and this is a really nice bonus when learning.

When you first start, I HIGHLY recommend bumping the difficulty to easy and the sandworm attacks to low. This will help you wrap your head around the various systems and make sure you can breathe a little while figuring out how to survive and thrive. A typical game is around 2 ish hours (on easy or normal I found), and with four different factions and different ways to win, you can easily spend a lot of time just trying new things.

Any technical issues are minor, and will no doubt be fixed soon (certainly before v1.0).

Great streamlined RTS with simple 4x elements.
Takes a couple games to fully grasp, but relatively easy to learn for the genre.

Multiplayer, campaign, and new factions are on the way.
It'll continue to get better throughout early access, but already worth $30.
Buy it now and support the developers.

If you are a fan of Civilization, Crusader Kings, Stellaris, Command & Conquer, Warcraft III, or Dune II, then you're going to thoroughly enjoy Dune: Spice Wars. The gameplay is intuitive and performance is great even on a GTX 970. There is a slight learning curve but if you're a 4X/RTS enjoyer, then you'll catch on quickly.

As far as the a e s t h e t i c of the game goes, it really feels like you're on Arrakis. The lore is genuine and hardly diverts from Frank Herbert's original vision. The music is also great, and different situations/interactions are enhanced because of the music. 

The developers are very active in listening to the community, but so far the only bug I have experienced has been dead units not disappearing upon death, but they did eventually after some time had passed. The gameplay is very solid and the UI is smooth and efficient. Sandworm interaction uses more resources, so I had some framerate drops when that occurred. As noted, performance is great on a GTX 970, so you'll have a great time even on older hardware, and an even better time on newer hardware.

Buy this game. Shai-Hulud expects you.",1651007904,1651032469,True,3,2,0.570990800857543945,0,True,False,True

I know I saw this a lot but it is so true for those of us that want to give an honest review and don't feel right giving  a game an outright Yes or No review but would like to give a early  thoughts on a game, even more so when it is at the price point that Dune: Spice Wars released at into Early Access.

I am a huge fan of Dune.  I have read all of the Frank Herbert books multiple times since I was a teenager and Dune first came out.  I even have read the majority of his son's continuation along with Kevin J. Anderson up until the Caladean Trilogy which I haven't ever gotten around to.   I know I will take heat for saying it but I even like the Lynch Movie, parts of the SyFy Miniseries and really like the 2021 Villeneue film.    I played the early 90s Dune games, and the late 90s Emperor: Battle of Dune Strategy Game.   So bottom line is I am a big fan of Dune.   

So it pains me to play just under an hour of Spice Wars and try to figure out other than using House names, some of the technology like Ornitophers, Freman, Arkasis, Spice, and the various Houses what the game honestly has to do with Dune other than borrow bits and pieces of Dune IP here and there.   Maybe a future campaign will pull it together but at this point as much as I am a fan boy I think it is too far into Early Access for me to trust that the game is going to be what I had hoped it would be.   

As far as a straight up RTS.  There really isn't anything majorly wrong with it.  But I just don't really feel like I am playing a Dune RTS with four factions all flying Orintophers all over and occasionally a Spice Worm poking it's head up.   I hate to be a negative Nancy on this one but in lieu of there not being a <meh> button I am going to give it a No for recommend at the moment.    If you are just looking for a new RTS to play and have $30 to burn then maybe it will be for you.   But if you are hoping on spending $30 (at least now) to get a real Dune RTS experience then you may want to wait.  

I am sure the price may rise, and if they change things up I will come back and buy it if it ends up looking like it becomes what I am hoping but for now I am going to go on the side of caution and refund this on because $40 is high price to pay on an EA game just because it's based on an I.P. that so far looks like it is not really being used in a way that , at least I, would like to see it used.",1651032251,1651032371,False,34,0,0.672749757766723633,0,True,False,True
