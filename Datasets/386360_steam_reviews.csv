SMITE is a pretty damn good MOBA.

It has a very high production value with its skins, its maps, and items. None of its visuals are bad. There's a significant amount of player choice when it comes to what you want equipped, from your music to your skin, to your loading frames and announcer. 

The god balance is...alright. New gods are always power crept, and take a patch or two to mellow out. But overall I feel most of the roster is viable if you know how to play them.

The community is a little more toxic than I'd like, people will often take it WAAAAYYY too seriously. Assault (the all random mode where you cannot pick your character) has a significant amount of people that will flame you for not knowing how to play a god you've never seen before, but you can just mute them. 

Overall I'd give the game about a 8/10, score can dip up or down a point given the patch. But it has King Arthur so it can't' go below a 7.",1486420137,1684540049,True,1,0,0.498481273651123047,0,True,False,False

Spent waaaay too many hours playing it and i think i have a pretty good understanding of the game and how i feel about it so knowing this i shall now go and list everything in the pros and cons of the game. Tl;dr at the bottom (he he he bottom)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROS:
-The game itself: Mobas have a very strict formula. Top down, 3 lanes and 2 jungles. BUT WHAT IF WE SHIFTED THE CAMERA BEHIND THE ACTUAL PLAYABLE CHARACTERS? It might sound stupid but it makes the game soo much more fun. Theres something here for everybody.

-Always a mode ready to go: Smite has 6 maps + a daily changed ""Mode of the day"" The maps and their game modes are: 
Joust - 3v3 map with a single lane some jungle camps and a miniboss thats actualy easier too beat then the camps.
Arena - 5v5 map with no lane just a big fucking circle that you punch eachother in the face in until your tickets get sold out.
Conquest - The most basic 5v5 match there is.(cant thing of anything to add here)
Clash - Like joust but with 2 lanes and 5v5.
Assault - 1 lane, 5v5, no base healing, no backing, no buying items unless you die. Win only by killing the enemy team until they come back with every item in the game and destroy your ass.
Siege - SIEGE MAINS WHERE YOU AT?! like clash but 4v4. Most underplayed game mode out there.
MOTD-s - Not gonna write every single one fuck even i dont remember all of them and i have no life!

-The best community out there: A major factor in any online game is the people who play it. Usualy its never good but smite has some of the best, most helpful people i have met in an online game.

-The VGS system: Voice communication in videogames has always only been 2 things: Horrible and ""your mom"" jokes. Now imagine instead of voice communication you have a set of commands that YELL AT YOU AND MAKE YOUR MOM JOKES.

-The fact that you are literaly playing gods: Makes you live your fantasy of being the prettiest girl out there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONS: 
-The stability and servers: Oh boy my favorite part here goes. The game runs like shit if you dont meet the recommended requirements and/or have it installed on an ssd. Some freezes here and there, crashes and the servers my god the servers. They havent changed in 4 years. Do they hinder the game itself? Yes and no, sometimes just a random freeze can really ruin your play and make you regret living in the first place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its one of the best games i have played and makes me glad that I found it in the first place. Fully recommend it too anybody I meet.

I have spent upwards of 400 hrs across 3 platforms playing this madness. I have come across every type of player, you'll be lucky to find someone cooperative in any capacity per 100 games. I have witnessed Low-Rez studios constant blunders with updates and characters leaving the game unbalanced for long periods before making any type of patch. I also have a large gripe with the matchmaking system. If you are new to the game and just learning mechanics and characters you may face a wall like so many others have with the matchmaking system. You and several other bambi's will be placed in a queue with some people who have upwards of 5,000 hours of gameplay under their belt. This will leave you feeling hopeless and frustrated for the duration of your game. If that weren't bad enough there are also plenty of smurf accounts waiting in low ELO's to crush you and your team for fun. Low-Rez has done not one thing to actively discourage this or stop it at all, in fact they encourage it. Its a decent game but the ships captain for this gameplay adventure is asleep at the helm.

I wish good luck to any unfortunate soul climbing aboard this ship. If you don't uninstall in two weeks, I'll see you on the other side.

I have continually updated my review of this game as it continues to develop into the worst conglomeration of every annoying aspect of all MOBAs. HOTS and League have plenty of varied abilities and utilities. Smite has 2 main categories of abilities, large nearly unavoidable circle or global /line. There isn't anything quite as fun as damage you can't avoid with skill or anything other than wasting actives. The snowball in this game is far worse than other MOBAs. I hate this game and I seethe nearly every time I play. However I have already sold my soul so I must continue.",1556574533,1619808225,False,3,3,0.482801377773284912,1,True,False,False

[i]I was very bored when typing this.[/i]
tl;dr - Idk, the game sucks but it's still so much fun if you like MOBAs and its different from LoL and Dota2 cause of the 3rd person and WASD movement. Much fun. Lots of good game. Sometimes.


[b]FIRST THOUGHTS [/b]
Firstable I like it. I started it as my first MOBA. I prefer it to other MOBAs (LoL and Dota) which i've tried enough to tell. Smite is better IMO because of the 3rd person view and WASD+mouse movement. Also started with this so how the fuck should i be able to adapt to only mouse movement and other strange stupid things. 

[b] MY PLAYING [/b]
I have played this game ~1500 hours(?), been in platinum conquest ranked in the early season(s) when the nowadays pros were only plat-diamond. (Only 234hrs in steam cause I started way earlier before it came on steam for those wondering) {Closed beta}. 
Also good to know i had a 1 year on-off break from playing very soon when beta ended.
Since then played mostly casually normal/ranked with m8s. 
(I believe i have 8(?) gods with rank X. Not sure but atleast 8, all from different roles. Many close to X)

[b] (BAD) RANDOM FACTS ABOUT THE GAME [/b]
""""Some"""" things in this game are very lazy made, 1 quick example is Assault gamemode which is a full ripoff from LoL's aram. Including random character, WINTER THEME (WHY?), 1 lane and not being able to buy items or go to B if not dead. 
((That is actually not strange at all when we are talking about Hi-Rez Studios)))

[b] (BAD) THINGS ABOUT THE CHARACTERS IN THIS GAME [/b]
Many gods in this game feel like they are forced into the game. Cool character with a cool lore comes up, players wait it to be epic like they used to be. WE expect the lore of the upcoming god to match the gameplay of the character. 
Well thats not the case at all because devs only manage to make the characters abilities like this for example: 
1 movement ability, 1 cone damage ability or silence, 1 area heal ability plus ULT which gives buff for itself or someone else. Passive = Any time someone dies give +1 att or +1 protections to itself. Okay thats very nice and usual but the point is that effects or gameplay doesn't match the lore or personality of the GOD at all. 
Yes I know thats how MOBAs are (fucking shit) and characters need to be as smart and as nonbroken as possible but since when did they lose all their imagination when designing abilities or characters? [spoiler]from the beginning? LUL [/spoiler]
HOW FUCKING boring.
Also some of the characters never get fixed even though everyone knows how OpieOP they are. They are always banned in ranked. Always.

[b] (BAD) THINGS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY OF THIS GAME [/b]
I feel like that the community, (with the game) died when Beta ended. This game used to have pretty small amount of players but everyone played like an average, everyone talked a lot, etc. With the bad marketing of the game release all players vanished and only the random 9 yrs old players remain. No one talks in normal OR RANKED gamemode, everyone disconnects, toxictalk, or surrenders the game immediately 
cause they dont care. Also it takes 5-10 minutes to find a match nowadays. In normal. Ranked even more.
Back in my days if you didn't instantly spam that you want to go to jungle (for example) then you took the spot what was left. Now everyone locks whatever they fucking want and play wherever they want :D. Fucking kids. 

Probably forgot a lot of things but took me way too long to do something like this.

The 'gems' (which is the premium/paid currency) can be obtain via daily logins and you can use them for cosmetics or obtaining other characters (although I strongly do not recommend spending gems on characters since you can obtain the free currency called favour when playing the game). I have personally spent 7 years of my life playing this game and honestly speaking the main things I dislike about this game are: Matchmaking, the servers, the reporting system, and lastly the amount of toxicity in casual games. 

Matchmaking:
It is utter garbage since you can either get lower skilled players or highly skilled ones on your team whilst the enemy team is just as bad as your teammates or them being a lot better then your entire team making the game feel like garbage. 

The Servers:
They can be consistent at times but on other days they are ghetto since it would be either you lagging or your opponents lagging. 

The reporting system: 
As of the moment they are now ""taking action"" but there are so many that abuse this (especially in ranked).

Toxicity in casuals:
Too many people are toxic for no reason and honestly it's casuals so if you don't want to get 'tilted' over some casual games just do ranked. Since casuals isn't fun due to the matchmaking being pretty bad.",1485115170,1593062455,True,7,0,0.572444319725036621,0,True,False,False

The last few weeks of grinding out the battle pass has been full of just hate, racism, and just poor attitudes. The toxic community on smite is why this game is slowly dying off, not even going into the poor balancing with champions like King Arthur being able to 1v5.  It's wild that no matter if you do good or bad you do in a match there's always 1-2 people in a match that flame and bad mouth all match. Plus, the group's that abuse the report button because they don't like you. This will be my last battle pass and afterwards will no longer be on this game. 

I would only recommend this game if you hide your chat UI and have thick skin.

It does enough to set itself apart from the other MOBAs, and what I have seen of the roster seemed fairly interesting.  My issue with Smite sadly isn't the game itself at all, its the playerbase.  After playing several games vs AI and getting familiar with the feel of the game, I jump into a pvp match, where I am then berated for 20 minutes because my character was in the 'wrong lane'.  I explained that this was my first game, and I was unaware of any laning metas, but was then told that doesn't matter, and is no excuse.  To my knowledge, Smite does not tell you which lane to play which character.  Initially, I wrote this off as a disgruntled player, but quickly I realized that all the players I was being matched up with were far more seasoned than myself.  Instead of matching me with other new players or players of similar skill level, it was putting me with players who far outreached my skill level.  This left me in an awkward position, where I could either slowly attempt to learn, and drag down everyone's game who got matched with me, or I could just stop playing, and I feel it would be selfish to keep playing.",1542946824,1542946824,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SUMMARY- Between the community being one of the worst a person could ever be a part of, and the administration at hirez studios being ran by what seems to be childish adult idiots which in my opinion seems to be the equivalent of the first person who thought ''hey im going to go tug and suck on this cows nipple and see where that takes me'' the horrible ban policy, the horribly implemented cheat system, and the fact they just ban for even false reports or even running things like mod organizer for skyrim or overclocking your hardware (cpu for example) and in some cases people only playing for one day and just being banned with no explanation, others playing for months or over a year and randomly being banned (losing 100s of dollars invested and a lot of time) with no reasons given, this will get a thumbs down from me. for a more in depth review, see below-

GRAPHICS-graphics are decent at best, and the integration is just horrible. it pushes your cpu and gpu much harder than it should for what it is. meaning this is a very poorly made game on the inside, wrapped up with decent graphics. 

COMMUNITY- On to the community. it is by FAR one of the worst communities to exist online (and yes i am in cs:go, call of duty, and battlefield) this community IS FULL of the most ignorant, violent, angry people i have ever seen. from people placing death threats, harassing you, Doxing you, and acting like children over bad matches. EXPECT- racism, sexism, trolling, people getting upset and leaving ALL the time, harassment, and yes, sadly even hacking. does hirez do anything about it most of the time? NOPE! they allow all of the above despite the suspension and ban policy, and its usually the innocent ones who get banned because trolls harassing them, and reporting them on multiple accounts or some other stupid reason. 

SUPPORT- Support is horrible, hirez is ran by adult children who seem to pick and choose who they like, then ban or suspend others. in many cases for no reason and they rarely respond to tickets. the system they use called hipatchservice.exe runs on your pc constantly, It is suppose to check if you are cheating or running cheating software, it has been known to ban people for using skyrim mod manager, or even simply overclocking your CPU as they consider it a form of speed hacking. they can, and will ban over even the smallest thing and despite what they say, do NOT investigate reports. they simply go on what is reported, so if you play a game and have a bad game, your team reports you. you will most likely be banned for ''feeding'' or something stupid. in turn losing any money you have spent in this game.  They care nothing about the community and make the most stupid choices on patch updates, They spent a whole year perfecting smite to the point of patch updates needing to fix minor things, everything was perfect and balanced, and in one single patch, someone in hirez thought ''hey lets mess it up for us and everyone'' and changed many items stats and abilities. changed cost, ruining builds for many gods, causing HUGE imbalances again, nerfing gods they spent a year getting balanced while buffing others. in turn ruining the game for many. 

IN CLOSING- i still play every now and then, but only because i have invested so much time and money into it over the years. whenever i give it another chance, within the first 3 games, at least 1 person ruins the gaming mood then im done again. If you choose not to believe me, that is fine but i urge you to take a hard look at the overwhelming proof as seen in photos and video links below

I played a very little bit of leauge, but besides that, not many MOBA's. I heard all kinds of things like ""oh it's just a knock off leauge, the have the same characters and its the same game league is better""

Blah blah blah. Let me tell you something, get a few hours on this game, it's not like that at all. The unique perspective is amazing. My first game I went 20-4 with Neith, and I was like shit, maybe this is a game I could get into. And I did, eventually paying for the founder's pack, which is only the really thing you would have to pay for to play the game. However, I have got to the point where I'll buy cosmetic skins and stuff too. The micro transaction stuff can be a bit shitty but none of it's required at all.

This game has some very intense moments and some moments where you'll get angry at trolls. It's really best to start playing the game by playing the Joust game mode to learn the positions and abilities, and I'm just now getting into Ranked with, atm, 475 hours. 

Once you really, really,  REALLY get into the game like I have, things will look a bit more stupid. Thoth's stun was stupid. Terra's heal nerf was stupid. Taking Fatalis from Sol's 3 was obnoxious. You see things like that, and keeping up with the current meta is important. But that's all for people who REALLY care about the game, such as I. 

Anyways, it's lots and lots of fun and a game I continuisly come back to, and I highly recommend at least trying it, cause jesus it's free like why not? Play Thor for a few matches and I'm sure youll like it. Don't pick Loki and don't autolock thats it. VVGL VVGF",1487975549,1487975549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You got the classic MOBA set up, interesting mechanics and Gods. But the overall design feels like...feels cartoony and childish. Even the community at times, is really cringey. Like REALLY annoying, foolish and sometimes aggresive. But thats not really a SMITE problem, its more of a MOBA problem. 

Beta smite felt more authentic, more serious of a tone, more graphic too. Now its sorta restricted (Due to partnerships and whatnot) but overall its still doing okay. The Gods are fun, overall gamemodes are entertaining and its replayable. 

If you wanna play a MOBA without the clickies, without the million Gods or Items, without insanely broken characters (SMITE has its moments though), then this game is probably for you.

If you wanna play a MOBA that is stress free, community friendly and overall a uniquely fresh take on a old format (MOBA) then this might not be for you.


Overall, game is fun but man does it really blow chunks sometimes. It has the CSGO syndrome (Gambling and most gods have rare, limited edition skins.).

New gods are released with horrible balance, frequently overpowered so that people are inclined to spend money to dominate games with that god early in the release. Following by patches that nerf the god so that they either become balanced or underpowered. With so many new gods coming out nowadays, it is clear that the smite team can't balance them all.

I'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other MOBA'S and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. 

Smite is a 3rd person MOBA unlike most MOBA's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of MOBA and the way i prefer to play a MOBA.

I've only played around 3 matches of LoL, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other MOBA's

Now. to get to the basics, you have your Guardians,Mages,Warriors,Hunters and Assassins, All of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.

Hunters- Hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy Tank.

Mages- All around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.

Guardians- Guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.

Warriors- Warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.

Assassins- Assassins are very crucial to your Conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being Overpowered, They're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.

Now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.

Pro's- Visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.

3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, Top down just isnt my cup of tea.

Community- All in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other Moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other Moba's too me.

Updates-Smite is regularly updated with new content Very Often, in the last year It's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, Gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but High-Rez stays on top of it.

Gods-All of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and ANY of them can be good if they are in the right hands.

Cons-Unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.

Hunters- Hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play Neith,Ah Muzen Cab, Xblanque and many others, BUT they need to be nerfed unlike League (going by word of mouth) Yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, I'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, They make being a guardian not fun.

Guardians- There are alot of fun guardians in the game BUT, as ive said in the previous statement Hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. Although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.

Now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.

I've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, I like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, Being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, You're not playing Ranked-Conquest. Stop acting like it, Thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of Dota 2, or LoL.

Last thing is the server downtime, I want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, But, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in The last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. I've read many articles stating that it's Because of DDOS from other developers, I would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. My problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. So High-Rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, Please, try and fix this problem.

Thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game Hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.

I'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me.

I started playing because of a friend, I wasn't interested in this game at all back in the day, Smite is a great game if you want to play with a party of 2 or 3 because of the competitive aspects of the game, if you're more of a casual player you can play with up to 5 people. If you're someone that doesn't like to deal with a bunch of stuff in the game (game mechanics, items, buffs, debuffs, passives, etc) then this isn't a game for you, if you're into strategic-well coordinated games, then I think you'll enjoy this. Sadly if you're a solo player you can have a really hard time in ranked, eventually you'll meet people in-game that can help you rank up. I would recommend this game, tbh most of the times I forget it's a FTP game, it's really well done and the devs love to keep the game updated with game balance and skins.",1487468211,1487468211,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

in all the MOBA's in general.. they have a learning curve which is a bit unrewarding and long to master... not the same with smite in my opinion.. you use ""W A S D"" to move the characters instead of that mouse cursor, which in my opinion is more comfortable... and its goddamn 3rd-person.. itstead of top-down MOBA... it provides much more immersion. trust me a must play ... #LOVESMITE",1487222265,1487222265,True,7,2,0.577280700206756592,0,True,False,False

Smite has a simillar layout to the game Leauge of legends in that it's main gamemode is a three lane layout leading to the other teams base. All the lanes play a role in team composition and are chosen when you select the roles as follows

1. Jungler, (this is primarily and assassin god) Junglers main focus are the buff camps that spawn in the space between lanes and infiltrating (Ganking) the back line to eliminate the squishier gods (squishy=low hp, defense) *keep note that as of season four any god is playable in any role*

2. Middle lane/ Mid. (this is primarilly a mage god. As a Mid. laner your objective is to take down the towers, pheonix and titan all accessable by the middle lane. After you build the proper items for your playstyle you will most often become your teams backiline using high damage abilities to take out the opposing teams frontline (try and avoid the enemy jungler as they will most likey build to counter you) *keep note that as of season four any god is playable in any role*

3. Attack. Damage. Carry./ ADC (this is most often the hunter class of gods. As the carry you will be placed in the longer of the two lanes ( the side switches depending on if you are on the order team or chaos team ) you will most often be assisted by the teams support. Your high damage basic attacks keep you in the frontline as the teams main damage source but it makes you an easy target in teamfights so always be aware of your posistion while engaging a fight. 

4. Solo lane/ solo ( most often the warrior class of god) as the solo lane you will head to the smaller lane on the left or right ( the side switches depending on if you are on the order team or chaos team ) this is the lane that the jungler will assist most often when clearing buff camps. Most of the time spent here will be a one VS. one with the enemy solo laner. Late game ( after the average god level is around 15+ you should rotate to other lanes and assist as a secondary support becoming a frontliner for your team. 

5. Support ( this is most often the guardian class of god ) you are your teams imovable sheild keep them alive at the cost of your own and let your team get the kills. (a good support can bring almost any team to victory ) you will move around to lanes that need help or you will follow the enemy support.

*Keep in note these tips are for the Conquest gamemode for smite not the other avalible options*

In general I prefer this game to league in my mind it provides more of a challange considering everything in the game is a skillshot ( with a few exceptions ) and has a much less toxic community my ingame name is Professorslick and ill offer advice on builds for gods if needed ( more often than not the recomended build is viable ) I hope you find this review and tip helpful.",1487212609,1487212609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a gate way drug that led me to the other titans and minions of the genre. I played a variety of Moba's such as League of Legends, Dota 2, SuperNova, Strife, Infinite Crisis, Paragon and Gigantic. Believe me when I say, I've tried them all. But no matter how much time and money I spent in the others, I always came back, because SMITE offered a genuine expierence that gamers of all skill levels could enjoy.  The 3rd person camera and fast paced gameplay is what truly makes SMITE feel different from the others. Besides the wonderful gameplay, SMITE offers an array of charaters that are amazing in all facets of design, the use of different mythological pantheons is the most interesting and is what initially brought me to playing the game in the first place.

It's stress-relieving when you're used to play stressful/frustration-based games (Dark Souls III, Dota 2 on [strike] russian [/strike] european servers). I just enjoy this as a badass mythological Street Fighter look alike with tons of dad jokes inside, even though it's full of more or less complex mechanics and the gameplay evolves constantly over the seasons. I just don't play competitive matchmaking for that reason. I WANT TO HAVE FUN FUN FUN FUN FUUUUN. Also this MOBA is rather fast-paced compared to LoL or Dota (which I played both). XP goes fast, items are more diverse, but it's the only thing that seem to matter to players. ITEM BUIlDS ARE KEY.

Ich kann das Spiel empfehlen, habe nun ca, 300 Stunden, also insgesamt, 
dochder Entwickler HiRez verkackt das Spielt immer mehr.

Smite, Lol und ich.

Das Spiel SMITE  ist, wenn man es sich grob vorstellt,
ein LoL in Ego-Perspektive. Dank meinem Kumpel weiß ich auch,
dass ein paar Charakter mit Lol Champs ähnlichkeit haben und 
somit relativ gleich sind. Ich selber mag mein Leauge of Legends, 
dies liegt wohl 
1. an meiner mangelten Erfahrung 
2. An meinem (fast) 
nie staatgefundenen Erfolgsmomentan .
3. Man bekommt auf die Fresse, ich noob zumindest.

SMITE an sich.

So, hier kommt der eigendliche Grund wieso ich SMITE nicht umbedingt
empfehlen kann: Die Faulheit der Entwickler und die Balance des Spiels.
Fangen wir mit Göttern (Charakteren) wie Anubis an seine Ultimative
Fähichkeit ist ein Strahl aus seinen Augen zu schießen, dieser macht auf max. level 
ca. 6000 Damage. Zum vergleich: Nicht-Beschützer haben im Durchschnitt 2000 Leben.
So kann man mit diesem Charakter bspw. sehr einfach die Bosse auf der Karte töten
um sich diese Boni zu erhachen. 

Als nächstes kommt mein lieblingsspruch.
Was ist ein Krieger (Klasse)?: ADC (Damage) + Beschützer (Typ-Der-Viel-Aushält)
Was ist ein Beschützer (Klasse)?:  ADC (Damage) + Beschützer+ (Typ-Der-Sehr-Viel-Aushält)
Dies, und der Fakt, dass jeder Charakter überall, irgendwie rauskommt, stören mich.
Ein Beschützer (bspw. Bacchus) mit 45 Magischer Kraft (Damage) SOLL KEINE 500 DAMAGE
MIT SEINER ULTI MACHEN! 
Charakter die, und davon gibt es nicht viele, Skill brauchen bspw. Silvanus (Tank),
werden generft / verschlechtert. Er ist einer der Tank's die nicht OP sind
und Schaden verteilen wie ein aufgekoster Typ an ner Minigun.

Zitat von seinen letzten Nerfs:
4.1: ""Decreased Base Healing from 25/30/35/40/45 → 15/20/25/30/35 per tick""
4.2: ""Sylvanus: Base damage on Autos reduced from 38 to 35""
Aber OP Charakter werden schön gebufft.

Entwicklung.

Ich verstehe, dass Entwickler Fehler machen, finde ich aber auch völlig inordung,
wenn diese auch bald behoben wurden.
Bei der Patch 4.1 wurde ein neuer Gott eingefügt, namens Morrigan, sie hat eine
Ultimative Fähichkeit sich in jeden belieben Gott zu verwandeln der im Match ist und deren
Items zu übernehmen, diesen Gott kaufte ich mir. Der Bugs sind:
- Nach der Verwandlung kann man max. 2 Sekunden lang keine Fähichkeiten benutzen
- In Scharmützel (3 gegen 3) sind es manchmal 4 Leute in einem Team (bspw. ich übernehe Neith: 
2. Neiths)
Seit ein paar Wochen immernoch nicht behoben.

Was ich aber nicht verstehe ist, wenn Entwickler zu FAUL sind Übersetzungen zu machen,
nicht mal es per Google Translater versuchen. So stehen meistens in der Deutschen Version
bei neuen Features undefinierte Variablen (textXYZ = textXYZ, nicht bspw. ""Text geil"")

Das Spiel macht im ganzen Spaß, vorallem mit Freunden, ich raste aber auch dabei oft aus.
Wünsche euch viel Glück beim gegen Anubis spielen, amk.

I believe ratatoskr was introduced for xbox at that time, Smite is the reason I switched to PC and boy and I glad I did, but we shall leave that for another time.

Pros
Great game, sucks you in worse then a bad case of the flu
Great Graphics
Can play on just about any cruddy ol laptop you spent $100 on at the supermarket. (No I have a good rig but as explaining my friend has a crappy PC lols)

Cons
Honestly dont know where to start... sadly
The potential for the next HUGE game is here... however they have a few things to enhance

The servers... oh the servers... those are the worst, always having issues 

Matchmaking is sketchy (but thats with almost every game you buy)

Balancing ... kinda rough

Support, ya ... the support could use alot of work as well.... and I understand there are ALOT of players ... but put some consideration in your players maybe? cmon HiRez get with it!

and the worst part of the game...


SKINS

I have spent too damn much on this game for me to quit... honestly im still trying to figure out why I put more money into it .... its a dang curse... 

Overall when the game is in working order and you have an actual team of friends its not bad its actually a great game that I enjoy and get wrapped up in so bad I get frustrated with the game and periodically have to take breaks.... and I mean a day or 2 away from it.

Would I recommend Smite to any of my friends... YES! if you can handle your bank account being empty!

Thats it, case closed!

SMITE is an incredibly fun and addicting 3rd person MOBA that is perfect for those who are looking for a change from your typical MOBA. 

Smite's unique camera angle alone is enough to set it apart from other MOBAs, and developer Hi-Rez didn't stop there. Each map is polished, every God looks and sounds great, and exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety.

The powers are also SUPER interesting, since they are all different. Who ever made this game is a complete....GENIUS! This game isn't just a game, it's also a master piece! But you know what would make Smite even better? More modes or worlds (Conquest, Joust, Arena, ect.). Maybe even more gods! I LOOOVE how each god has a story, a victory and failure dance or act. My fave character is Jing Wei, but there are only 5 skins for her, I would REAAALLLYYYY like more! I hope that this game becomes more popular.

The free to play vs what you can purchase is well balanced and doesnt give unfair advantages to players with more cashola. The rewards system if you work your way up playing free IS rewarding, not AGONIZINGLY slow but fair. 
 One thing I really like is the difficulty level assigned to the Gods. Sure its an ego thing but it adds incentive to get good at difficult Gods while allowing new players or more casual players to get a feel for how to play without getting frustratingly wiped out. Usually :p 
The lore on each God is surpringly extensive and accurate. The fact the feature even exists makes me happy as does the entire premise of the game: Many Gods from many pantheons facing off against eachother in battle.

Its pretty good, it has ups and downs so imma list em because this is a review or somthing.
Ups;
Is free to play and the DLC content are mostly cosmetic.
It's a well supported game with patches every few weeks constantly tweaking and improving the game.
It's colourful and vibrant.
They include some nice lore from the various mythologies.
The game rewards out of the box thinking, skill shots and teamwork.

Downs;
It's free to play so there is no barrier to entry making trolls a common issue.

Hi rez kinda suck at balancing games, I get its difficult but their style is to make something and then nerf it into the ground. The recently released roman goddess Terra is a good example, Terra is only useful in competitive team games because playing her properly requires a lot of team coordination, if you don't have that team then terra is a waste of a player. They nerfed her 4 times since she was released and didnt touch what made her worth getting in competitive, only made everything else worse, all they needed to do was reduce the amount of cooldown and mana refund her ult offered the team, that was it and she was balanced but they took literally everything else and drove it into the ground. Now she cant do any damage, her crowd control isnt that good (yeah there is a root and a stun but they are too short for anything other than pro teams to make use of), her heal isnt potent enough and lasts too long as well as scaling poorly with power, the monolith that causes the heal can be destroyed far too easily.

Matchmaking, its not the worst system in the world but it really punishes playing alone as you can get put in situations where its 5 solo guys Vs a clan which is more or less a gauranteed loss if the clan are even remotely capable of playing as a team. The game balances based on your win-loss ratio or something with special consideration for kills, this system favours assasins and kill stealing more than playing the game well, it can also force you into teams where the other players are way better than you and you become the weak link in a chain and teams where you are the only good player and cannot drag your team to the win and theres nothing worse than being stuck in one of those situations where you are way out of your league because despite the average skill level of each team being the same one guy on one team is responsible for most of the skill (or lack thereof).

The community, its a free to play game where you can chat via keyboard. This always results in an insufferable community that will do ridiculous things like send death threats for not following the pro leagues meta in a casual game, it doesnt matter if the meta is right or not or even how well you perform, you will still get called a peice of shit for it, theres no real consequence for quitting out mid game and because of this people will quit for being beat ONCE, ONCE FFS these people cannot handle being beat despite it being a part of the game. People will also shit on you for choosing items that they arent familiar with, actively discrouraging creative thinking and counter building. You can even get shit on for being focussed, a good strategy for handling high skill players is focussing them and forcing them to be useless early on and if that happens to you your team are MORE LIKELY to call you shit than to take a second to realise the other team are throwing everything they have at you and not eveyone else. They won't adapt to the situation or take advantage of the fact the other team blew their load on you or anything useful they will just bitch and often times quit, and then theres instalocking, you get people who actively refuse to play with the team in a team game, 1 isnt too bad but you get 2-4 instalocking players and its a recipe for disaster, they will also blame you for their failures despite them being the ones doing nothing for the team and they throw games because of these fucking hissy fits. The community also has trouble adapting to changing situations and many players are quite predictable, if you can adapt to how others play and spot the patterns its easy to do shit like approximate where players with invisibility abilities will go while cloaked (I am very good at that and its always hilarious owning some guy who thinks no one knows where they are), its easy to tell who will become the assasins number one target and its easy to tell when the other team will make a move to try and surprise you.

It's inpenetrable to new players, between the poor balancing, constant tweaking, high skill ceiling and awful community its pretty hard to get into the game and enjoy yourself.

In summary I more or less just went off at how fucking awful the issues this game has can get. It's worth playing if you can get some mates together and form a clan but if not skip it entirely.",1485923260,1485923260,True,7,2,0.611639916896820068,0,True,False,False

Sadly that was then and this is now, with every single update the game becomes more broken, the lag increases, weird crap happens because your client and the server can't agree on whether or not you've used your abilities and every new god released is just a much stronger pick than your old favorites that you love to play.

I may not be a good Moba or team player in general but in Smite the point of view and intense fighting helped me to adapt on the way i should be playing raising my skills from a filthy unint feeding casual into an above average (lucky) . the graphics in this game are awsome and not heavy, the controls are easy to use. The price (the ultimate god pack) is totaly worth it. The only down side in this game is some community members who'll think everyone is a professional. And will curse at you for stealimg their kill ..which doesnt make sense :P.  And the amount of disconnecters is either 1 or 2 per match. Its rare to have a full team vs team fight in this game , but i would stil highly recommend it.

Pros
Unique gameplay
Intense fights
Amazing nonheavy graphics
Newbie friendly
Good tutorial
Low prices

Cons

The overall game play was nice even for someone not interested in MOBA and/or PVP in general. But that is about as far as it goes with saying positive things about this game.

No game out there has a balanced setup of characters, but this game has some characters so balanced that they are really ineffective unless you make custom builds for them. However, the recommended items for this are never listed on the inventory buying area for the character you have to do all items, in order to find the effective ones...

Oh, and don't think you can do your weekly quests or even event quests by doing Co-Op vs AI game play like a friend of mine on there thought. It don't work that way... The Hi-Rez people make sure you have to play Normal mode to be able to clear those quests... :( One other reason I don't recommend it. 

The community is as toxic as it gets, especially when you either play with or encounter ""Ranked"" players and the group is getting had by other ""Ranked"" players... And in many cases those ""Ranked"" players will see either a starter god (one of the 5 like Neith) or a ""balanced"" god like Medusa and/or Freya and single them out even if they are grouped tight with their group trying to protect them. What rubish that is when as a game it supposed to be fun and a nice time waster.

And there is the other issue, it is none of these really. You spend a lot of gems on things like costumes for the gods or limited edition costumes... You spend time trying to get Favor for other items, maybe you even brought a few boosters too for all that. In the end, its really not helpful for anything. Boosters may help you get to Level 30 player level fast and get Favor fast, but thats all... Good Will does nothing but add at the most 10 favor to your reward, so leaving a match before time isn't hurtful at all to the player other than a lock out that scales from 30 mins, 60 mins, 2 hours, to 4 hours in duration.

The game really isn't that interesting to play beyond an hour here and there... No storyline, no cool graphics, no upgrading gods to be better unlike League of Legends, no supportive community, no real anything... It is just a CS:GO without the FPS shooter aspect, and you play as a third person character with limited MMORPG like abilities that fall within the MMORPG trinity... :( 

I don't recommend this game, because it leaves a lot to be desired. I do recommend it to the few that  enjoy MOBAs and CSGO game playstyles. But as a MMORPG'er and MOBA player, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone except for a quick battle here and there.",1485486419,1485486419,False,3,1,0.478260844945907593,1,True,False,False

I have over 1K hours (Before Steam) on this amazing, addictive game. It has the perfect mix of strategy and just playing around. There's so many different Gods with different play styles, you'll find someone you like. I also recommended playing with friends, it makes the experience more fun for the sake of communication. Only negative thing to say about this game is, the matchmaking at times. You can get paired up with awful teammates or really good enemies with OP gods
