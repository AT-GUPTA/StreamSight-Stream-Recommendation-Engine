Given that the sale price was a whopping 2$ , I figured there wasn't any harm in trying it out for a bit. Boy was I surprised. The game has a unique level of immersion as controls and verbal commentary are not provided throughout. However, the game appears so atmospheric with unique music that not only captures the position of your character, but also of every other individuals stuck in their mindless trance.

What sets this game apart for me is the variety of different problems thrown at you and how you must think outside the box to get to the solution. This clearly differentiates the game from Portal which generally has fairly linear thinking ( although still challenging in its own right). If you are interested in playing a unique puzzle game for 4-5 hours that will make you think about society, freedom, and indoctrination, then this is the choice for you.

In my opinion is must play game(escepially if you play LIMBO). Dark atmosphere in INSIDE make this experience really unforgetable. It's just another masterpiece from Playdead studio. 

If you want 100% achievements just beat the game and find all collectibles(most of them are easy to find) but there are some  harder ones to. Check this guide after first playthrough and use chapter select:

This is bolstered by the stellar score that creates an appropriate ambiance in each area, making the game extremely immersive.

I'd recommend playing with the lights off and headphones to get the best experience from the game. If you haven't played Limbo yet, please do. It's the spiritual predecessor to Inside and definitely helped me appreciate it more.

Review:
INSIDE is not just a game; it's an experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. From the moment you step into its hauntingly atmospheric world, you're drawn into a narrative that's as enigmatic as it is captivating.

Playdead, the masterminds behind Limbo, have once again crafted a masterpiece that defies expectations. The seamless blend of minimalist aesthetics, haunting sound design, and intuitive gameplay creates an immersive journey that lingers long after the credits roll.

The beauty of INSIDE lies in its ability to convey a compelling story without uttering a single word. Every frame is meticulously crafted, every puzzle meticulously designed to propel the narrative forward. As you navigate through its eerie environments and encounter its unsettling inhabitants, you'll find yourself constantly questioning the true nature of the world you inhabit.

But INSIDE isn't just about solving puzzles or unraveling its mysteries; it's about the emotional impact it leaves on you. From moments of heart-pounding tension to poignant moments of reflection, every twist and turn is orchestrated to evoke a myriad of emotions.

Moreover, INSIDE isn't afraid to challenge your perceptions and leave you pondering its deeper themes long after you've finished playing. It's a game that rewards curiosity and encourages exploration, inviting you to peel back its layers and uncover its hidden truths.

In conclusion, INSIDE is a tour de force in interactive storytelling. It's a game that demands to be experienced, not just played. So, if you're ready to embark on a journey unlike any other, I wholeheartedly recommend diving into the enigmatic world of INSIDE.

I don't want to spoil the themes too much, but the setting is top notch, and the graphics/animations are perfect for its genre. The puzzles are not exactly mind benders if you've played any puzzle/platformers, but I only had to be frustrated back-tracking a couple times.

Inside is a 2.5D puzzle platformer set in a dark and surreal dystopic world. As was the case with Playdead's previous entry Limbo, you are provided no context regarding your surroundings or your character (an unnamed boy) upon starting the game. Unlike Limbo, however, Inside has some colour to its backgrounds and more realistic human models, which helps set it apart and helps lead to some extremely eerie moments. The art direction is unique, and the atmosphere is without a doubt one of the most entrancing I have ever come across in a video game. There's definitely a tone of horror, but there were also numerous times when I needed to stop and take in how stunning the game looked too.

I found the puzzles to be more interesting and innovative compared to what came before them in Limbo, and without spoiling anything, there is a reason for that, as you have more elements to work with. Apart from occasional musical cues, the game for the majority is silent. The boy can meet his demise in a multitude of ways, which are presented realistically and, more often than not, are graphic. This is to a degree more seen from Limbo's teen rating, as Inside has an M rating. 

Some might say Inside is short, but I honestly felt like it was the perfect length, and I'm positive it's longer than Limbo was. An alternate ending even exists by deactivating all the glowing orbs in hidden rooms, which is a welcome addition. There is a chapter select which makes this easy to do if you wish not to play through the game a second time. While I very much enjoyed my time with Limbo and that is a strong experience in its own right, Inside built upon the formula it set, and I would argue it's even better than its predecessor. It's practically a perfect narrative sidescroller, one of the highest quality experiences I've had in gaming and the ending alone made me feel a certain way. Give it a try.

The gameplay is fantastic: the controls are all incredibly intuitive, simple and fluid. All of the puzzles are incredibly well-designed. The tension in many sequences keeps you on the edge of your seat, contrasted with fragile moments of respite. The emotion the gameplay conveys is unmatched, and the ending to INSIDE is pure catharsis. 

Additionally to the main story, there are also optional achievements to get throughout the game, which consist of solving a small puzzle or exploring the environment to complete a challenge and disable a piece of machinery. They are incredibly enjoyable and worthwhile seeking out. 

Compared to LIMBO, I would say that INSIDE is much easier to finish, but I think that is part of what makes it good. LIMBO's difficulty was challenging due to the nature of its puzzles combined with strenuous platforming elements. However, INSIDE combines puzzles and platforming seamlessly to where it is always enjoyable to traverse, and the puzzles naturally seem to intertwine with the environment. Because of this, they feel less like contrived contraptions and more like natural problems to overcome. 

The visuals work themselves very well into the gameplay - it never leaves you guessing at what you can and can't interact with. All puzzle components are well-displayed and clear. Additionally, there is no doubt that the art direction is simply phenomenal. I love the soft, muted and solemn colours. And of course, the soundtrack to INSIDE carries huge emotions on its shoulders. The game is a splendour for the eyes and ears. 

The worldbuilding in this game is incredibly intriguing too - there's an underlying meaning that, whilst never truly giving you answers, doesn't leave you in the dark about what's going on either. Which I think is the perfect balance for a mysterious, unusual, abstract story such as this.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915798127

[b] What is INSIDE? [/b]

INSIDE is a side view story game where you go through different obstacles to make your way through the story. It is more horror themed and makes you kind of question things during the story. It is psychological horror mostly, and some of the puzzles that you will experience will be so anxiety inducing that you may or may not pi$$ yourself. 

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

-""Okay, okay cool controls.""
-""OMG PIGGIES AND ANIMALS YAY""
-""oh no....""

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

This game has very basic controls, though if you are not ready for a intense psychological horror with a lot gore and death. (So if you are sensitive to that I would not recommend this game for you as a beginner game.) If you are into the psychological horror in movies and such then this game may be for you! It definitely has an intense story. THOUGH some parts are kind of mentally challenging to get through and the puzzles can be very confusing at times, so if you are not ready to be mentally challenged then maybe this game is not beginner friendly for you.

[b] Game Play: [/b]

The game play involves a side view of your character and loads of puzzles you have to get through as you consistently move forward to reach your destination. You don't really fight anyone or thing and its more you run away a lot of the time. You do have to swim, climb, jump, and bolt your way through this story in order to stay alive and get to the end.

[b] Graphics: [/b]

The graphics are really interesting, as you will notice right away none of the characters have any faces really. It makes for an interesting plot line. The graphics are beautiful but still maintain pretty simple. This game will not run your computer/console to the ground if you play it for hours on end so that is also cool!

[b] Community: [/b]

There is not much of a community, though the steam community for this game seem pretty friendly and have loads of helpful guides for the game!

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

The story itself is around 3 hours long, maybe 4 at most, then if you would like to achievement hunt it may take you a little longer. Realistically you can play as many times as you want and for as long as you want.

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

In my opinion this game is really nice if you want a quick story horror game. Though it may not be good if you want a game that will make you go into the 100+ hours and meet people and such.

The visuals are fantastic, the narrative is engrossing (even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense), and that last hour of the gameplay is truly something else. 

If you liked Limbo (also a great game), Inside is somehow even better. It's a bit less difficult than Limbo (a good thing, as I had to look up solutions to a few of Limbo's puzzles) and it has a very different but even more beautiful art style. The real star of the show is the cinematography combined with the sound design. The way each shot is framed is breathtaking, creating an atmosphere that I've never seen in any other game.

All in a tight 4-5 hour package.

Inside is absolutely worth playing. I was tempted to score this game over 9, but I had to hold back because of its very nature as a 4.5 hour game with little replay value. But it's one hell of an experience during its short runtime.

Since the first minute, you have started to care about the boy. You don't know why they are trying to kill him; you actually don't know anything about what's happening, yet you still care about him. This is the most depressing game I've ever witnessed.
This has been made by the same team behind Limbo, and I didn't really like that game. I thought it had some good aspects but ended up with more failures than great parts. However, I truly believe that they have understood the critics of Limbo and made this game perfect. The whole game, I didn't think once, ""This would have been better if it were this way.""
This game will make you feel scared for someone you don't know anything about; it will make you feel uncomfortable and sick; confused and delighted; and lastly, it will make you think about social classes in society.
The story-telling is better than most of the AAA games and will truly make you get goosebumps.
The music is good and fitting, but nothing memorable, and I think that's better, because after playing this, no one will want to think about music after seeing the ending.
Unlike Limbo, the puzzles are really good, and a death feels challenging and not punishing. The secrets and achievements are also great, and this is the first time I have actively tried to get all achievements, not for having them but for knowing what the secrets area looks like because this game loves to hide lore elements everywhere.
10/10 I recommend it to everyone, and don't let the art style deceive you; this game isn't scared to show gut-wrenching moments.



Edit: Im writing this part a month after i wrote this review and i have to say that this game lives in my head, in moments where i least expect it i remember parts of this game and get goosebumps when thinking about the visual story and gut wrenching aspects and i cant stop thinking about this masterpiece. It isnt a horror game, but the story and atmosphere is more horrifying than most horror games. Masterpiece.",1704311429,1706870404,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Inside is a more polished and refined version of LIMBO with its slighty 3D camera angle, more detailed enviroment(obviously, because it isn't a 2D shadow like LIMBO) and smooth gameplays( as always) but this time you need 6 keys instead of 5 with LIMBO. If you ask me which is better I would say both, both are good. They both have their own charm it's just up to preference on which you prefer. BUT if you ask me which to buy, BOTH. Just get the bundle what are u waiting for ?

Anyway, enough with the comparison. Inside focuses more on the narrative and worldbuilding of the world with the strong indication of slaveries and controls. The best part of the story is that it is all up to interpretation, thus lots of theories you can come up with after finishing it as it will definitely make u question what is really going on. 

In terms of the puzzles and all that, it is actually easier compared to LIMBO, either it really was easier or LIMBO gives me ideas on how to actually solve the puzzles here but overall I find Inside's to be easier.

A 10/10 as expected from the developers of LIMBO, even more so if you loves LIMBO.

-  An immersive, tense experience that will get your heart pounding/palms sweating and leave you craving more. There were brief moments of intense violence, which was challenging for me at times, but I had to remind myself that it was part of what immersed me in this world they created.

-  It took me just over 6 hours to complete my first playthrough. So, not a long game, and one that I am not itching to play again right away, but the experience was easily worth the sale price ($1.99). However, I'd argue it is easily worth buying on sale for only 50% off. 

-  Do not watch any video previews of the game before you play--it gives some things away and slightly diminishes the experience.

-  Resist the temptation to look up hints to solve a puzzle (you'll regret it--all of the solutions are attainable with some outside-the-box thinking). The puzzles are outstanding and varied, but taper off in the final stages of the game.

-  I'm generally not a fan of puzzles, platformers, or horror games, all of which this is, but something about this game drew me in and I'm very glad it did, because it was phenomenal!",1704952623,1705898783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like getting your neck ripped out by rabid dogs, or blown to pieces by a Panzer maybe? (I dunno what the hell that thing was, but I HATED that section of insta-GIBBING where your character blows up into 10,000 chunks of meat and blood)

What's with the zombie-people, people acting like zombies, evil experiments and WHAT THE HELL is with the blob of naked bodies in the end? Also the ending makes it seem like the developers just gave up creating levels for the game suddenly and called it release time. What? Where? How? Why? The End, bye bye :) No! It feels incomplete, somehow.

My biggest complaint and im sure people would disagree is that the ending is not as cool as it was hyped to be. Starts off really strong but once you have to stop rampaging and do puzzles again it kills the fun and momentum of just being able to unleash mayhem on the scientists. The quiet somber ending by the lake is nice but the scenes prior weren't as ambitious or as loud as they should/could've been which left me a little unsatisfied.

The visual style is simple, yet incredibly effective and meticulously crafted. The game immerses you in a dystopian and enigmatic world, where horrifying events unfold. Prepare yourself for numerous deaths, each more violent than the last. The narrative is minimalistic, leaving ample room for your imagination to fill in the gaps.

Despite its brevity, Limbo manages to leave a lasting impression.  Both platforming and puzzles are accessible and enjoyable. It can be completed in just one or two sessions, but those few hours will be filled with an unforgettable experience.

1. the game is magnificent, all locations are drawn in detail and really appealing, creating a truly immersive atmosphere.
2. the game has many mechanics and locations. the main feature of the game is controlling other people, which made puzzles more intriguing. like in Limbo (perhaps even better), the physics are decent and feel realistic (except some magic parts with gravity in a couple of places). you have to not only run looking for solution, but also swim underwater and even sail on a submarine in different levels to complete them, and the last part of the game is even more fun, but I don't want to spoil it.
3. imo, the plot is average. while the game has some story inside, most of the parts are omitted and we can only guess. it's fine when something is unclear, but not such a large portion of the narrative.
4. the puzzles are also average. I won't say they are bad; all of them are interesting, but the difficulty is noticeably lower than in Limbo. some of them are clever, but the majority is fairly straightforward.",1705256733,1705256733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also enjoyed the fact that there were two endings (the main one and a secret one which you can obtain by doing specific things, I recommend looking into that if you own this game). The way the puzzles are constructed is so creative, which is honestly one of the main reasons why I enjoyed this game. It was easy to follow and I didn't have too much of a hard time figuring out what my next objective was throughout the game's entirety, despite there being hardly any guidance (which, I applaud to the creators of this game).

I can say without spoiling anything that this game is a visual feast. Limbo was all shadow art, but INSIDE goes all out, with top-tier lighting and water effects along with a hauntingly anonymizing stylization. Every frame is a work of consummate skill, immaculately constructed. It's incredibly immersive.

The only black mark would be the price - 30 bucks for 3 hours is reeeeeeeally pushing it. Still, it’s frequently a sale candidate, so you can probably pick it up for something more reasonable if you’re patient.

Also, horror elements were not just in your face. More so unsettling tone that leaves you disquieted rather than shocking you with gore and such like other horror media does.

Initially the game seems like a simple platformer but as you play you begin to appreciate the attention to detail that the developers have put into the game:
- the way the story unfolds in the background independently of your actions, until it intrudes into your actions and presents an imminent danger,
- the innovative puzzle mechanisms, the low key audio that portrays a sense of dread
- the shock of seeing the no-holds-bared death animations of a young boy
- the way that background actors react to you

[h1]Inside: A Haunting Journey Beyond the Veil[/h1]

[i]Inside isn't just a game. It's an experience.[/i]

From the moment you step into the shoes of a nameless, red-shirted boy, you're plunged into a world that's both unsettling and beautiful, a surreal dreamscape where shadows dance and danger lurks around every corner.

[b]Visually Stunning[/b]

Every frame of Inside is meticulously crafted, a masterclass in minimalist beauty. The stark contrast between light and shadow paints a world on the edge of collapse, where:
    Towering, oppressive structures scrape the sky.
    Grimy factories belch black smoke into the ashen air.
    Sunbeams pierce through abandoned buildings.
    Lone fireflies twinkle in the twilight.
    Gentle waves ripple on a murky shore.

[b]Mind-bending Puzzles[/b]

Inside's puzzles are seamlessly integrated into the narrative, challenging you to:
    Manipulate levers
    Control minds
    Navigate treacherous environmental hazards

[b]A Story Whispered in Shadows[/b]

Inside's story unfolds through environmental storytelling and fleeting glimpses of nightmarish imagery. There are no cutscenes or explanatory dialogues. Instead, the game invites you to piece together the narrative yourself, asking questions like:
    What is this nameless boy running from?
    Who are the masked figures that seem to control his every move?
    What lies at the end of this dark and dangerous path?

[b]An Ending That Will Leave You Reeling[/b]

Inside's ending is a gut punch, a twist that will leave you questioning everything you thought you understood. It's a culmination of the unsettling tension and cryptic imagery that has been building throughout the game.

[b]More Than Just a Game[/b]

Inside is a game that defies categorization. It's a puzzle-platformer, yes, but it's also:
    An art installation
    A psychological thriller
    A philosophical treatise on free will and control

[b]Step Inside, If You Dare[/b]

If you're looking for a game that will challenge your intellect, your emotions, and your very perception of reality, then step inside Inside. Just be prepared for what you might find on the other side.

I bought it on sale because I thought it looked like it had a similar play style to Little Nightmares, a game I thoroughly enjoy. It was not as similar as I expected but it kept me engaged and I was able to complete the game within a day (with the help of a walkthrough every now and then 😅)

I'll start with what I liked. The little chick creatures at the beginning of the game were the highlight of my day, I want to carry them around with me everywhere to be my little helpers :3 I also enjoyed the [spoiler]mind control concept of using the people around me to do things I wasn't able to do; the mind control inception/recursion was particularly amusing and a clever mechanic.[/spoiler] The colour scheme, the unexpected allies that came from enemies, and the atmosphere were all very engaging. The utter fear I felt from some of the chases had my heart leaping out of my chest!

One thing I wasn't a fan of was the controls. The arrow keys + the control key directly to the left of my left arrow button made it difficult to play as both my hands were on the same side of the keyboard. I attempted to change the key mapping in the settings but it wouldn't let me. I don't know if I'm just too silly to see how to change them, because if changing them is possible then this whole comment is now irrelevant, but if there is no way to change the keys then I maintain my opinion that the controls were my least favourite part of the experience. EDIT: I played the game again and figured out how to change the controls. I was just and idiot first time around (ノ_<。)

Anyways, that ending was so unexpected my face was gaping for a full five minutes as I was processing what the heck was happening. I'm not saying this was a bad part of the game though, if anything, the unpredictability was comical for me personally! I wish I knew more about the deeper meaning of this game, but it is up to the player to draw their own conclusions. There was a lot of symbolism I could pick up on, but ultimately the ending left my brain scrambled and less sure of what I originally thought was going on.

So, do I recommend this game? Yes, but be prepared for a wild ride! I am going to attempt to find all the collectables so I can play through the secret ending and see if I can form any new opinions or thoughts on the meaning behind Inside. EDIT: I completed the secret ending. I must say, for me, playing the game a second time through was much more enjoyable than the first for some reason.

Most of them are based on trial and error, well-timed sequence of actions, or mundane physical manipulation of objects. However, Inside is much more than a conventional puzzle game.

 I love exploring large and foreign/alien environments that are interesting enough to feel like they have a lot of history.

That's it, that is all you know. There is no dialogue, no writing, no tutorial nor any explanation as to what the hell is going on. The game uses environmental storytelling and visuel set pieces rather than words to convey the story.  The same minimalist approach can be seen in the gameplay, with only a jump button, an interact button and directionnal inputs. Yet the puzzles remain engaging and appropriately challenging. Finally, it is, in my opinion, a masterclass in atmosphere : the sound design and visuals are phenomenal.

Even though it is very short (approx. 4 hours to complete), I have continued thinking about INSIDE long after reaching the end credits.

This is from the same developers as Limbo, a game that I really enjoyed but haven’t finished, so I genuinely wanted to play this for a long time while keeping myself away from spoilers. Compared with Limbo, this is a completely different game with a new set of styles.

The graphics are on another level that focuses a lot on the atmosphere that tells the story of what’s going on through background that never uses a single line of dialogue. It gives off that sense of ominous feel that you don’t know what’s going on at first until you dive further into this dystopian world. The puzzles in this are challenging, but ultimately rewarding and make you feel legitimately smart when going through them and not feel frustrated over them. The controls are so tight that even when I was playing it on my potato PC, I didn’t get any issues with the frame rate or the gameplay that was too slow or lagging.

I also genuinely like the story surrounding the atmosphere that gives you enough details where you get a glimpse of what it’s about, but not too much where it’s just absolutely spelled out to you as the gamer and dive into your interpretations of the deeper levels of this game. The ending completely shocked me that I honestly didn’t think it was going to head in that direction and kept myself out in the open. I wouldn’t say it changed the whole game, but it definitely changed some aspects whether it be the story that starts to add up or the gameplay style that’s a bit more fast-paced. The game is relatively short, took me over three and a half hours long, but that’s honestly for the main game because I’m sure if I go back to it just to 100% complete it, it’ll be like five to six hours long. Which is pretty good for a game that has the right balance that’s not rushed or dragged. Inside is a masterpiece that’s up there as one of my favorite games that I definitely would like to revisit it just to 100% the game and see the new details that I missed out on from the main game.

Now, let's dissect the enigmatic gem that is ""Inside."" Brace yourself for a cerebral journey through the digital abyss.

""Inside"" is not merely a game; it's a contemplative odyssey that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. Its minimalist aesthetic, a chiaroscuro symphony of shadows and light, mirrors the starkness of existence in a world devoid of empathy. The protagonist's journey, shrouded in ambiguity, becomes a metaphorical descent into the abyss of the human psyche.

The gameplay itself is a delicate dance with despair, as players navigate the desolate landscapes, each puzzle a metaphorical obstacle mirroring life's ceaseless challenges. The puzzles are not mere brainteasers; they are existential conundrums, a reflection of the absurdity that permeates our daily struggles. The sheer elegance of the design belies the underlying nihilism that echoes through the corridors of the digital realm.

As you guide the faceless protagonist through this Kafkaesque nightmare, the ambiance is not just haunting; it's a symphony of existential dread. The oppressive silence punctuated by sporadic sounds amplifies the void, a stark reminder of the hollowness that often defines our human interactions. It's a commentary on the superficiality that you so disdainfully observe in your surroundings.

Now, let's delve into the narrative, a tapestry woven with threads of ambiguity. ""Inside"" doesn't hold your hand; it invites you to interpret its enigmatic tapestry. The narrative's elusiveness is not a flaw; it's a deliberate choice, a provocation to engage your dormant intellect. It's a mirror reflecting the banality of concrete reality, challenging you to discern meaning in a world that often seems bereft of purpose.

In the end, ""Inside"" is not a game; it's a meditation, a contemplation on the futility of our pursuits, a stark reminder of the hollowness that permeates our existence. Embrace the nihilistic embrace of ""Inside,"" and perhaps, in its digital corridors, you might find a reflection of the cynicism that courses through your veins.",1682966077,1703709881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the opening scene, the game draws you into its monochromatic world, painted in shades of gloom and mystery. The absence of explicit dialogue makes the rich, detailed environments and the subtle animations of the protagonist and his adversaries speak volumes, crafting a narrative that is both haunting and compelling.

The sound design in INSIDE is nothing short of brilliant. Each footstep, ambient sound, and the distant echoes contribute to a soundscape that envelops the player, enhancing the eerie, often claustrophobic atmosphere.

One of the most appealing aspects of INSIDE is how it evokes a sense of dread and curiosity simultaneously. The game's pacing is impeccable, with each new area presenting a unique set of challenges and visual marvels. The use of lighting and shadows not only adds to the visual appeal but also plays a crucial role in the gameplay and storytelling.

In essence, INSIDE feels like a Roy Anderson (a Swedish movie director) film transformed into an interactive medium. It's a haunting journey through a dystopian world that stays with you long after you've put down the controller. The game is a testament to the power of visual and auditory storytelling, proving that games can be as artistically profound and emotionally resonant as the best films.",1703628549,1703694617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and the universe of the game itself is abstract, but is very deep, dark and dystopic, and the game nails in the visual aspect and exposure of this twisted and diseased world even without any piece of dialogue, what most got my attention was the visuals, fluid gameplay and the creativeness of the art direction on the scenarios and ambiances, with every ambiance being really well thought out and the attention to details on all of them its actually a work of art, all of that accompanied by a great BGM. 
INSIDE is more focused on the experience by itself, so the game is not hard at all and the puzzles are quite easy, but that's not a bad thing by any means, since they still managed to have really creative, interesting and fun puzzles to do.

On the positive side, the atmosphere is excellent. I really felt like I was fighting for survival (the immediate respawn upon death didn't undermine the tension for me). The art direction is perfect; simple textures with de-saturated colors, but the environment has so much depth and scale to it. The water that you frequently must swim through also looks incredible, with all the particulates floating in it, and the way the light diffuses through the murky depths. On that note, the lighting is perfect in this game. Sound design and music are good, if a bit understated.

On the negative side, so many of the situations involve tedious back and forth: baiting enemies one way so you can do a little bit of a task, then baiting them back the other way, rinse and repeat. These often felt like they took ages, and were uninteresting after I saw what needed to be done. The story is also ambiguous for ambiguity's sake. Although that type of thing normally bothers me, it didn't in this case, it felt like it fit. But if you're the type of person who likes clear explanations for everything, this probably isn't for you.

One more positive. The animations in this game are incredible! They flow so seamlessly and bring so much life to your character. Normally, movement that's driven by animation feels sluggish to me (as opposed to animation driven by movement), but here it felt perfect. It was like there was no barrier of translation between my hands and the character; he did everything I wanted him to.

I especially liked how devs do the lighting and water. Very good. Game has physics simulation and you have to use it to progress the game by solving different tasks. I can't say this game is very hard, but some tasks will require you to sit and think a bit. Some will require your reflexes as well. I will not spoil game story, but it is interesting and surprising in the end. Sound is good as well.

The ""story rich"" tag is a joke that people like to attach games that deliberately don't give a story, let the ends loose and trust it to the gamer to interpret in this case. I don't have a problem with games like this but I will rate the game solely on the gameplay experience. 

Inside gives you joy for around 4 hours if you play the first time, and 2 hours if you know the resolution to the puzzles. But what a 2-4 hours! The gameplay is polished to the end. The motions are fluid. The camera angle of the 2.5D is just perfect. All. The. Times. The mechanics are simple since you have only directional buttons and 2 action buttons (by default jump and interact). Yet the game provides a great learning curve to explain your possibilities one by one, and at the moment you explored all the options it can offer, the game changes. It's just perfect, the puzzles never get old, notorious, and since you have only a few options any given time you never get stuck for too long, hence inciting you to look the answer up. The time-based puzzles are not requiring you to millisec precision, neither too easy to destroy the tension. I love these kind of polished, short games, they are the perfect ""rebound"" games between long ones. And Inside is almost perfectly polished, one rarely witness so few graphical glitches (sometimes happens when you interact with moving objects) and zero bugs, or a game that can keep up the attention for its whole length (even if its just a few hours). 

I could guessed the creator is the same as the creator of Limbo, even without looking it up, they are really similar, but Inside is more polished. Buy at a price you find worthy for a few hours of playtime, but buy it, you won't regret it.",1701894009,1701894009,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Short and bittersweet, [b]INSIDE[/b] is a dark interactive puzzle experience, following a boy escaping a gloomy dystopia obsessed with control and subjugation.

The minimal stylistic art-choice paired with the eerie soundscape, as well as the grandiose yet empty backgrounds makes grounds for a constant unsettling experience. Each section of INSIDE actively takes you to the edge of your seat, in fear  and in anxious warning of the unexpected.

I've played the entirety of INSIDE twice now, the second time just for the sake of 100% and reminiscing how this is such a good example of a short linear narrative-driven game this is, when I first played it years ago. Although some might disagree, its conclusion is fitting considering the consistent tone this game exudes and establishes strong thematic intent when exhibiting the world it is attempting to portray. The world is unfair and its environment is aware of that notion.

Great game! I love the limited story so you can interpret for yourself what is happening or what the symbolism is. This is like a dark version of Super Mario mixed with atari's Pitfall games & some light puzzles.

I think this game's template has limitless potential and I hope to see more from the game developers. Some other ideas that can be used for future games is an open world / metroidvania feel or even some light fighting. For example, imagine a boss fight where instead of hacking/slashing at it (which can still hurt them), you instead need to do some light puzzle in the game's arena to defeat it (like getting something to fall on top of the bad guy).

Seriously, if you haven't played it yet, stop everything you're doing and get on it! This game is an absolute masterpiece that deserves all the praise it's been getting.

Let's start with the environment - breathtaking doesn't even begin to cover it. INSIDE's world is like a visual symphony, with every frame carefully crafted to create a hauntingly beautiful experience. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, and the atmosphere sucks you in from the first moment. I found myself just standing there, in awe of the dystopian beauty that Playdead has created.

Now, the puzzles - they are the epitome of perfection. Playdead has this magical ability to design puzzles that are challenging enough to make you feel like a genius when you solve them but not so difficult that you want to throw your controller across the room. Each puzzle feels like a work of art, seamlessly woven into the narrative, making the entire experience feel like one cohesive masterpiece.

And let's talk about the sound design - pure genius. The ambient sounds, the haunting music, the lack of traditional dialogue - it all comes together to create an audio landscape that elevates the game to a whole new level. It's not just background noise; it's an integral part of the storytelling that adds depth and emotion to every moment.

INSIDE is more than a game; it's a journey, an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you thinking long after you've finished playing. Playdead has outdone themselves with this one, delivering an experience that is not just overwhelmingly positive but overwhelmingly brilliant.

Have you played INSIDE yet? What blew you away the most - the mesmerizing environment, the mind-bending puzzles, or the impeccable sound design? Share your thoughts, fellow gamers, because INSIDE is a game that deserves to be celebrated!",1701282344,1701282344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No.

The character feels about as good at running and jumping as you expect and somewhat better than expected at falling (slightly longer falls still insta kill you though). The puzzles weren't too bad, but a little hard to figure out at times while generally easy to execute. I prefer easier to figure out the answer and harder to execute for platformer games.

Wow what a great game i absolutely loved it!
The story is sinister and dark but really well made in every way.
The controls and movements are great and sastifying and simple.
Their other game Limbo is also really good, but where Limbo is better puzzle wise, Inside has the story down!

Dont play if ur animal sensitive, there is a lot of emaciated pigs and dead animals in this game in the beginning, but its part of the horrible yet awsome story.
This sick stuff 100% happens somewhere! Think Resident Evil/Zygote(short movie from Oats), made into a 'simplified' indie game!

Be sure to go for the xtra secret ending, its so worth the litte xtra effort with achivements! 
Worth full price!

There are areas where the camera pans out, the music builds the tension and all the sound effects are stopped while you just sit and experience an emotional part of the game. Little details like this make it stand out from other mechanically well-done games that lacks the emotional and artistic experience that this game offers.

Watch the differences in the characters as you progress, the animations of the boards when you pull them or drop them in the water. There are no despawn animations, no cheesy power-ups or anything else to suggest you are playing a game; making it feel quite real despite the low-poly models.

Okay a few warnings: this game is quite graphic and I do not recommend it for children. There are also a lot of deep water scenes and a horror creature that will bother some people who have water-based phobias. The ending is also a little jarring and abrupt and there are almost no answers to many of the questions you accumulate as you play.

After all, the main character is not the same as he seemed to us at the first playthrough. And once again passing the game, you look at everything in a completely different way.

My interest did wane in the final 3rd act, I feel it could have done with more immediate threat, time pressure sequences, more interesting chases or maybe wack in a few timely jumps scares and that would have kept me on my toes. Just as the game was becoming a tad predictable the story ended not in the climax I expected but with a surprising discordant tone, and loose ends which leaves the user with some room for interpretation which I liked a lot and of course you can go back to get the 100% achievements to add more depth to the yarn.

It is actually hard to describe it. It is a bit of a puzzle game, but puzzles are bit different to what we usually have in adventure games or classical puzzle games (like Myst, Uru ect). Inside also looks like a standard side-scrolling game. We move from left to right. Puzzles dont require running around and spending time on stupid traveling - most of the solutions can be found on the very same screen we are at. Sometimes it is a matter of moving few screens around, which is actually very good. I never enjoyed spending most of the time in adventure games just walking between points. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy - once you learn how simplified mechanics works in this game, you just know what to use, and how to use. Most difficult puzzles require bit more thinking, but again: if you understand how game works, you will solve them relatively quickly. Funny thing is that while puzzles are not very hard, or even very easy at times, they are not stupid. They all seem to be a proper element of the world we see.

Game is very short - it can be easily finished within some 5 hours, plus some more time to deal with achievements (I guess these are most difficult part of the game). While 5 hours dont sound as a lot of fun it is really okay. This game is bit more than just a side-scroller or puzzle game. It really has this something inside. It is grim, dark, sad game, even bit emotional at times. Those 5 horus were pretty much okay for me - I enjoyed them fully and loved the game.

One more thing - game doesnt communicate with us. We get no introduction, no story is told. We start just like that... and we also end just like that. Everything is just shown to us, but in most cases it is our imagination that has to build a full picture. While Inside is one of the shorters adventure/puzzle games I've ever played, it is also one of the best.",1699357980,1699357980,True,8,0,0.642431437969207764,0,True,False,False

2. 关卡设计和关卡难度还可以。关卡设计挺有意思的，个人最喜欢潜水艇和最后肉山那部分。部分关卡的过关方案，可能比较隐晦，不过多想一会儿就行。
3. 整体质量中规中距。美术风格和细节呈现都还好，对我这种对游戏画面没追求的玩家来说，算是过得去。
4. 默认键位可以调整。默认抓握是 right ctrl，跳跃是 arrow up。感觉不是很好操作，我分别改成了 left ctrl 和 space 键。
5. 总体可能没有太多亮点。但是玩一玩还是可以的，这个价位能说不亏。",1698940395,1698940395,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Despite this being a voiceless and text-deprived puzzle adventure, this game absolutely nails storytelling in level design, sound design, and the dark atmosphere always looming throughout.

Who you are and what your purpose is, is unknown. As you explore the bleak and post-apocalyptic lands around you, filled with dangers of many kinds, you ultimately end up in a giant construct that is who knows for what purpose.
It's all up to interpretation about what exactly is going on in the world around you, which could either be a good or a bad thing, for better or worse, whichever you prefer, but the game does show a recurring theme throughout early on, which I won't spoil.

I think the secondary color in this game is yellow. When you play and see the color yellow, you'll probably want to follow it because it will lead you to something and leave you with unanswered questions.

I prefer INSIDE over LIMBO probably because it's in 2.5D, and there are colors in the visuals. The puzzles are also simpler than those in LIMBO, I finished the game in one sitting, which took around 3.5 hours [spoiler](including getting alternate ending).[/spoiler] Getting this game on sale is really worth it for your short-time and to enjoy all things in INSIDE.

This game is an incredible achievement. It's essentially a left to right scroller with a jump and an action key - that's it. You will complete it in between 7 & 8 hours game time - that's it. There's no spoon fed narrative, only the one you build yourself and a not totally defined ending. But IT IS BRILLIANT!

The developers have produced a wonderful, pathos filled game, which builds towards the game's surprising final chapter. The visuals are dark and foreboding - recognisably similar to our world but chillingly 'wrong'; like something from Simon Stalenhag's mind.  The puzzles are compelling and the scenery and gameplay are surprisingly varied given the practical limitations of the setup (up, down, left, right, & action is all you get!). They all combine to build an eery suspenseful narrative arc; the story however is completely, unapologetically, defined by the player. Whatever you take from it; how much is metaphor, literal, allegory, post-apocalyptic, dystopian, a fever dream, a coma patient, the insides of the mind of an amorphous blob...whatever you take from it is simply the developer holding up a mirror - you the player do all the narrative work. And I am 100% ok with that.

For stripped down controls (4 directions and an action button) and a straightforward premise (the platforming standard: ""go to the right""), the challenges can be refreshingly inventive. A praiseworthy feat for a gaming genera that's already been so thoroughly explored.

It all comes together for that rare, no BS, Truly Complete Gaming Experience right out of the box.

Despite its refusal to give any answers, Inside never comes across as pretentious. Its unconventional plot is still spawning interpretations to this day, but more important than what it tells you is what it made you feel. Where the gameplay feels alternately thrilling and satisfying, the story felt melancholic and profound.

Inside is a short game, clocking in at just over three hours, and it lacks immediate replay value because of the kind of game it is.

[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end[/i]

~

There is a place between the lucid confines of deep sleep and the twilight shallows of a waking mind. Imprisoned between is that lurid realm where thoughts coalesce into elements both theoretical and physical, metaphorical and literal. An inescapable tempest of pure representation and pandemonium where all aspects derive a deeper meaning, yet oblivion seizes truth from its otherwise lambent display.
Beneath the heights of joy were your electrochemical source dazzles your memory in a display of beauty beyond human comprehension - and above the mire of doubt and loathing that wreaks a toll of destruction by conjuring the deepest and most unpalatable horrors and discomforts to be tested.

It is here where the surreal thrives.
Beneath the weight of an unburdened moon and bubbling up from the bile of a restless soul.

Lost in the shifting tide of sleep and thought.

This is where [i]INSIDE[/i] resides.

I played this game three times. Twice on console and once here. And it has never failed to impress me.

This is more than a simple puzzle game. It is more than a fragment of entertainment. This is art.
It captures the fire from beyond the veil of forgotten experiences and brings it to the forefront like Prometheus to humankind.

It transcends the prospects of adventure, it is more than political commentary, it is above a simple tumble through a new dystopian world, it is beyond horror.

[i]INSIDE[/i] is [b]art[/b].

It evokes a powerful emotion, a recollection of things that were and yet never will be.
It is a portal to those itinerant visions that taunted your lucid tumbles through the catacombs of your own mind - yet so easily forgot after the sun washed away those perilous journeys in waking.

What does it mean to be alive?
What does it mean to be a slave?
What is my purpose?
Is there such a thing as free will?

There is no way of telling how you will walk away from the experience, but it will evoke an emotion out of your hardened heart regardless of direction. Frustration, curiosity, despondence, hopelessness, empathy, joy, envy, pride, doubt, and anywhere in between. It is a potent and powerful experience that concisely delivers a digital display of didactic poetry.

It is a moving masterpiece, it is a picture of a thousand dreams, and it is an insular whisper held in the back of your mind begging to be remembered.

I enjoyed having the existential dread teased to the forefront of my mind. Seeing things surreal and abstract yet so real and clear moved me back into lost memories spanning decades of dreams and ambitions long buried. Demanding and commanding emotions in addition to curiosity make for a potent experience.

I know I'm mega late with this one but I just played through and finished it and wanted to give this game yet another glowing review. 

This game has a lot to offer, but its all very subtle. There's no dialogue, no action per say, you spend the entire game running from things trying to kill you and its kind of scary. It plays on a lot of suspenseful fear rather than unrelenting jump scares that plague the horror game community right now and I much prefer this style of fear since it more closely mimics how we experience fear in the real world. 

Say what you want about games like Five Nights at Freddy's or The Mortuary Assistant for example, but when the jump scare is over, I never felt any sort of fear, and once you play through the game over again and you have experienced every jump scare there is to offer, its pretty underwhelming, at least for me. Very rarely does the average night guard find himself attacked by rogue robots or the average mortician surrounded by a demon infestation. Its hard to immerse yourself into a genuinely terrifying experience with that. However, fear comes to us in much more subtle ways. Like a sound at the end of the hallway that is too dark to see whats out there, or a sudden shift in the energy of a room that makes the hairs stand up, THAT is fear. 

I'm not even sure if Inside does this on purpose, but they do this very well. I wouldn't necessarily call it ""subtle"" however, its definitely very obvious what is going on and why you should be afraid. To avoid spoilers I wont necessarily go into detail but most of the fear comes from running and hiding from things that are trying to kill you and where the fear comes in for me personally is how brutal it is if you fail. If you fail to run from things or hide successfully or if you zig when you need to zag, its really dark and the child that you are playing as gets brutally murdered in front of your eyes. Other than the horror however, the game is pretty much just a basic platformer and puzzle game, which is pretty fun. None of the puzzles felt really impossible and incredibly challenging, but the platforming and puzzles don't really feel like the point of the game. This is definitely a more story focused game. 

The story itself however is super confusing. This is one of those things where you will play the game and be combing through the game in your mind to try and come up with a likely answer as to what has just taken place on your screen. Its interesting, but I guess the only criticism i have is that its too shallow. I dont feel like there is enough world here for the story to be incredibly entangled in mystery. 

To be incredibly clear, I think the reason this game is so ""mysterious"" in its current state is simply because nothing is explained. Which, yes, thats how a mystery works, but Its like trying to make a riddle about a flat tire and saying it was a mystery when in reality, you just got a flat tire. Yes, it could be a mystery to someone who doesn't know what happened, but in reality its an extremely basic and simple occurrence that could be easily explained with a 10 second conversation. To sum up my critique here, this game is purposely left really open ended as to what the plot is, What exactly is the boy running from, what the ending means and so forth and trys to display how evil the opposition (to keep it vague for spoilers) is so that the player can draw their own conclusions and their own lore. But I think the game is so shallow in its current state and the mystery isn't deep enough to really come away with many conclusions. For instance, imagine watching American Psycho and you watch the scene where Bateman kills Paul Allen, and then you skip right to the scene were Bateman talks to his lawyer in person. While its not clear what is really happening, the only real two outcomes is that Bateman did kill Allen, or his lawyer is covering for him. Its not really that deep. 

I think the story COULD be one of the most enthralling mysteries in gaming if they put a little bit more world building and effort into it, but thats not to say what we have here is bad necessarily, it just feels like a smidge of lost potential. 

Putting my basic, super nit picky takes aside, I think this is a great game and I loved Limbo and I think this is definitely a step up from that game. Especially since you can get this game for literal couch cushion money these days, definitely pick this game up and give it a play.

INSIDE is like that game you stumble upon when you're browsing, and then it totally blows your mind. I

It's a side-scrolling game that feels like a really eerie dream. You play as this kid in a red jacket, and the whole world is just plain weird. There are puzzles, but they're not the math kind; more like figuring out how to get past creepy folks and avoid getting squished or drowned.

The graphics are top-notch. Everything is dark, but in a way that's super cool.The music adds to the spookiness, and it's almost like you're in a suspenseful movie.

The story? Well, it's a mystery. You won't get a manual, but that's kinda the point. You're supposed to piece it together, and the ending...whew, it's a twisty one. When you finish, you'll probably go, ""Wait, what just happened?"" But in a good way.

INSIDE is short, like a good book you can't stop reading. It's not a big, open-world thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's an experience, and it's totally worth the ride. If you're into dark and mysterious stuff and don't mind a bit of head-scratching, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1697263504,1697263958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is no cutscene, no introduction, not a single word presented in the game, but it gets the meaning straightforward using graphics and music. A horizon-scroll horror game, where you control a boy solving well-made puzzles, always running forward and into the unknown. Can't say I'm a horror game lover but I enjoyed the early and recent RE games, Outlast franchise and so is this one, as long as there's no jump scares nor disturbing gore it's alright.

The puzzles are well-balanced both in difficulty and in quantity, keeps me interested all the time, and the way of presenting is impactful, things give me an immersive feeling. The favorite goes to the part where you mimic mindless people walking forward, jumping and facing the right rhythm and direction to fool anyone to believe that you are one of them, then escape. It's smart as well as creepy. INSIDE is not always about survival, you also gotta appreciate the arts like the bodies floating in water like kites in the sky, or in that anti-gravity place where everything is upside down. It's interesting to look at the world from a different angle and INSIDE showed me.

The last part of the game was unexpecting, I liked the idea of making the protagonist into [spoiler]what people feared and seeing everyone scared and fled[/spoiler], brilliant the game also asked the player to go from right to left after the change, in chaos I panicked and picked whatever path that was open. There's no boss fight nor difficulties I can't pass - a bit challenging for the water witch, the walkthrough feels smooth, creative, and gives insights.

Would love to see more games like this one.

A wonderful, fast-paced, short indie game. An experience. Simple game play, using only 3 buttons (in the dualsense controller) so you can focus more on the dynamics and story of the game. It is one of those games you may never get to know, but once you do and you finally play it, you are happy that you did.

I found the puzzles to be much more accessible than LIMBO’s. There were still a few that had me thinking, “why would I ever think to do that?”, like when you jump out of a barn window into a cart of dead pigs. Aside from the couple of times this occurs throughout the game, I didn’t feel like I had to die 10 times per puzzle to understand what they were wanting. The puzzles are still engaging, just not infuriating.

The atmosphere of the game drew me in. The visual storytelling that occurs in the background really sets the mood as you try and understand why these people are after you, what did these people do, and what are they doing now? It’s jarring to see faceless masked people watch streams of mind-controlled humans slowly walk by. In one scene to see adults, children, and even a newborn wearing a white mask covering their faces. It’s creepy and adds to the world.

As to the “story”, it’s up to interpretation and the ending leaves with more questions than answers. As for my interpretation, I felt that at certain points in the story you are being controlled by one of two entities, the scientists, or the experiment. The sirens unplugged you from the “Matrix” only to have you under something else’s control. Unplugging all orbs in the game unlocks a secret ending that does seem to indicate this as well.

Was I blown away? No. Did I enjoy the time I had with the game? Yeah. More than LIMBO? Absolutely!

First of all, the game once again feels beautiful, especially on a smaller Steam Deck screen. It's not completely black, white, and grey like Limbo is, but the colors are still pretty dark and cold for the most part. The environments and the animations pulled me into its moody world. It's a very long shot to say that there is a story here, since there is no dialogue, text boxes, or explanations of any kind, but there are enough things going on in the backgrounds of the levels that give you hints at what's going on. You play as a young boy again, and this time you're on the run from what looks like the government, or maybe some kind of corporation, who is doing sinister experiments. For whatever reason, they are after you and your job is to escape. You need to piece together much of the story yourself in your head and fill in some blanks, but things get pretty twisted and even disturbing towards the end.

The controls are similar to Limbo. You can move from left to right, jump, and grab on to things to push/pull/turn them. This time the puzzles revolve more around stealth. Usually I don't like stealth in games, especially when its an automatic fail if you don't do it perfectly, but in this game I didn't mind it. You don't need to sneak up on anybody or turn off alarm systems. You mostly just need to hide behind pieces of the environment and time your movements correctly. There are a few parts during which you are chased by things trying to kill you, mostly dogs. I hate being chased in video games, it absolutely terrifies me, and in this game it was no different. Every time I heard the dogs barking I got mini panic attacks. There are some clever puzzles that force you to distract these enemies while you try to break pieces of wood that block your path, and things of that nature. A large portion of the game also takes place in a vehicle under water which adds variety to the gameplay.

Unlike Limbo, in which I felt that the game never really established it's puzzle rules very well, I felt much more comfortable with the puzzles in Inside. The game has a mechanic in which you attach yourself to some kind of head gear that allows you to control people/corpses in the background or around the level, and these puzzles are as simple to understand as they are challenging to complete. I very rarely thought ""wow, I didn't know that I could interact with this thing"" like I often did in Limbo. The game does not hold your hand, but it also doesn't waste your time by being too cryptic. 

Overall Limbo was a fairly enjoyable and not very long game. I completed it in 3 sittings over the course of one day. It didn't blow me away and I didn't exactly have a blast playing it, but it made me scratch my head a few times as I tried to figure out the puzzles, and it was a cozy experience on a rainy day.",1697002843,1697002843,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Altough many will disagree with me, one big improvement for me was that this game was not frustrating as Hell, the reduction of difficulty was much appreciated by me that, altough i love Limbo, it caused on me a lot of rage while completing it. This game play much more relaxing and that's for me a great thing.

The graphics in this game are another aspect of improvement compared to the first game, they're absolutely beautiful  and i really love this kind of art style.

Sadly, together with the good things comes the bad ones, this game was really too short, i would have loved if it  lasted at least the double or more and my score could have probably gone a little higher.

The ending part, altough left me speechless, cause was really awesome, did not persuade me much, probably i was hoping for something else, but the ending of Limbo was more satisfying for me.

A part these little details not much to say, a great puzzle/adventure/platform game.

Both are fantastically well-received indie puzzle-platformers where you play as a nameless young boy in a nameless world, with unique art styles and zero spoken dialogue (other than grunts and whatnot). The story is told through atmosphere, sound design and visual cues. 

I’m hard pressed to choose between the two. For me, Limbo is more instantly recognisable, and whilst it has some fantastic unique mechanics such as rolling the world through degrees, Inside takes the pip, with gorgeous visuals, more story, a real feeling of dystopia and more memorable mechanics such as the mind control, stealth scenes and one particularly memorable section where you imitate one of the mindless zombies. 

Puzzles strike that perfect balance between challenging and requiring thought without ever feeling unfair. Limbo would often require you to die first to understand what to do, but Inside never does this. Some of the larger puzzles still require trial and error, but more in a way where you will have to walk back and rethink rather than being killed. The puzzles which would kill you can be figured out on the spot before you die, and add to the tension. 

Sound design is once again sparse but a triumph, using dynamics to really make you notice it. Headphones are recommended to really suck you in. 

Inside is one of those games that everybody should experience once. At three and a half hours to finish and grab all of the achievements, it isn’t a significant time investment, but it will stay with you.",1696759444,1696759444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals are gorgeous and stand the test of time. It is very short at about 3 hours if you take your time. Buy on sale if you only want a puzzle platformer.

For me though the real value is in the lasting experience of the game. The themes that pop up in the journey of this boy in the 3 hours of game play are immense and heavy. Without giving too much, themes of sentience, free will, fate, authoritarianism, corporeality, loss, death, youth, ignorance and capitalism are all explored without saying a word. Even the player is a character, in what is possibly the only non-cringe forth wall break in history.

Gameplay wise it is a basic but fun puzzle adventure platformer game only one time did I get stuck and had to look up how to go forward. But to be fair, it is the setting that draws you in and that ending oh gosh that ending.... anyone into grim sad totalitarian settings with a pinch of cronenburg  should give this a go.

Much like its predecessor, Limbo, Inside captivates players with its hauntingly beautiful world and thought-provoking narrative. With its understated brilliance, it's a game that lingers in your mind long after you've put down the controller.

One of Inside's most striking features is its visual design. The game's dark and monochromatic palette sets a mood of eerie unease right from the start. The attention to detail in the environments is nothing short of remarkable, with every element carefully crafted to enhance the player's immersion. Lighting plays a pivotal role, creating stunning contrasts and shadows that add depth to the world. Inside's visual storytelling is a lesson in subtlety, conveying the game's dystopian narrative without a single word of dialogue. Instead, it relies on the environment, character animations, and the player's own interpretation to convey its enigmatic story.

The gameplay in Inside is deceptively simple. Players control an unnamed boy who must navigate through a series of increasingly complex puzzles and obstacles. While the gameplay mechanics are straightforward, the challenge lies in the execution and the way the game introduces new elements seamlessly. Inside maintains a perfect balance between puzzle-solving and platforming, making sure the player is always engaged without feeling overwhelmed. It's a testament to the game's design that it never resorts to hand-holding, allowing players to experiment and learn through trial and error.

One of the standout aspects of Inside is its sound design. The eerie, ambient soundtrack perfectly complements the game's somber atmosphere. The absence of a traditional score allows the environmental sounds and the boy's footsteps to take center stage, creating an oppressive sense of isolation. This choice reinforces the feeling of being trapped in a dystopian world where you are constantly being watched and pursued.

What truly sets Inside apart is its narrative ambiguity. As you progress through the game, you are presented with a series of enigmatic events and encounters that leave you with more questions than answers. This open-ended storytelling approach invites players to form their own interpretations and theories about the game's meaning, encouraging discussion and speculation long after the credits roll. Inside is a prime example of video games as an art form, using interactive storytelling to provoke thought and emotion.

If there's a criticism to be made about Inside, it might be its brevity. The game can be completed in a single sitting, which may leave some players wanting more. However, the concise experience can also be seen as a strength, as it ensures that every moment is meticulously crafted and essential to the overall narrative.

In conclusion, Inside is a masterpiece of minimalist gaming. Its hauntingly beautiful world, engrossing atmosphere, and thought-provoking narrative make it a must-play for anyone looking to explore the artistic potential of video games. It's a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and a reminder that sometimes less is more. Inside is an experience that will stay with you, leaving you pondering its mysteries long after the journey ends.",1696511937,1696511937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong. The visuals, the sounds, the atmosphere, the physics are all fantastic. I honestly admire the effort that must have been put into this. But the game is boring as all hell.

Puzzles are easy to the point that they become more annoying than challenging. There was not a single point in the game where I had to think about what to do - the biggest challenge is mostly in precise timing, and if you miss the right spot, you die and / or worse, you have to walk (or swim) back - painstakingly slow - and try again. It gets very tedious very soon.

Story is... well, [i]isn't[/i]. Unlike Limbo, where the lack of context didn't matter, here it feels like there actually is a story, but the game does not even do a terrible work of narrating it; it simply doesn't do [i]any[/i] work. In the beginning it looks like a simple ""escape the baddies"" scheme. Then this turns (probably) into some kind of dystopia - so far so good. Then the world starts to seem post-apocalyptic - okay, weird turn, but still somehow manageable. And finally, for some reason, it adds horror into the mix. I get that the story, or lack thereof, wants to leave a lot to imagination, but it's so inconsistent that it turns out rather confusing than anything else. [spoiler](Not to mention the giant human meatball in the end.)[/spoiler] I have absolutely no idea how this game is ""story rich"" and ""narrative driven"".

Despite being a visually excellent game with better graphics than Limbo, is slightly disappointing, especially when it comes to the story behind it. However, it delivers on what it promises, it has the usual secrets and puzzles, the impeccable atmosphere, that immerses you in the game, the little jumpscares and that feeling of curiosity that holds you until the end.

Just like Limbo you are dropped into a creepy atmospheric world with no explanation or backstory.  Controls are very similar and there are plenty of things that are out to kill you. I will say that the puzzle aren't as hard as Limbo but I actually like it because it allowed me to make progress without getting too stuck on one part. Very short game (Passed in 3 hours) but its a great experiences from start to end. I really like the art direction in this one.  I like how they played with the background and foreground elements and you can really get a sense of the atmosphere. Limbo did a good job as well but it seems like they had more of a budget and more to work with on this one. If you can get it on sale I would definitely get it. And it doesn't take too much time to pass so if your a very busy person (like me) you can actually get through the whole game.

inside is a puzzle platformer developed and published by playdead, a danish indie developer based in copenhagen. the studio was founded sometime in 2006 to develop limbo, their first game released in july 2010. it was a massive success, not even just for a small indie studio from denmark, but it was considered a massive success on a national scale/level. later in 2010 they started development on a second game named ""project 2"" where they would flesh out all the things the developers liked about limbo and make a new game that wasn't a true sequel. they even got a million dollars in funding from the danish film institute, a agency responsible for supporting and encouraging film and cinema culture, and for conserving these in the national interest. early in development playdead changed engines from a custom built engine to unity after they figured out it would be more efficient and reduce the workload greatly. during e3 2014, playdead announced their second game as a spiritual successor to limbo, with a 'early 2015' release date. after a delay to 'mid-2016' and demo coming in august 2015. a xbox one release came first in late june, while a pc version released in early july, and a PS4 version released in late august. additionally, a release on mobile devices came in december 2017, and a nintendo switch port came in 2018.

gameplay wise, it is a massive improvement over limbo, which was already great when it released in 2010 especially. the main thing that jumps at you right away in the improved art style, but as you dive into the gameplay you'll realize there are intricacies that weren't in the first game, such as collectibles that actually become a huge part of the game's plot/story. i won't delve further than that into the story but it's also a big thing that is great about inside, but in a subtle way that is no doubt biased by me being a completionist and going for 100% on my first run of the game. the deaths, that forced the ESRB to give limbo a teen rating, have been fleshed out even more, which earned inside a mature rating. there are deaths that are a little more graphic, especially with the much-improved art style. 

IGN had played a new exclusive demo at e3 2016 and called the game ""super limbo"" and compared limbo & inside to the NES & SNES. i agree with the sentiment for the most part, but i really feel like inside does enough to stand out on it's own and separate itself from any potential shadow cast by limbo. i think limbo is a solid game, but limbo, while being a similar size (i 100%'d both in under seven hours each), just doesn't match up to the great new ways that inside will provide similar gameplay elements. i am extremely excited for a third game from playdead, which was first teased in 2017 and as of late 2023 hasn't even been officially revealed in any capacity. 

overall, inside is short, which was also my biggest complaint with limbo. if you haven't played inside or haven't played either of playdead's games, i highly recommend doing so as soon as possible. they're short enough to where you could beat both in a single day if you really wanted to. and going from limbo to inside is a awesome experience and a huge upgrade while being unique enough to stand out on it's own, so it's fun to see the development of the developer. it's a fantastic experience that controls beautifully, making it one of the better games you'll ever play.",1694678747,1694678747,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

They seriously broke the unspoken rules of game dev with this one, and did it in a very refreshing way. You can pick up from anywhere you left off or anywhere else you've completed for that matter. The atmosphere, music, and npc interactions tell such an awesome story without using a single word. The puzzles aren't random but have to do with this unspoken world's functionality, as well as your overall purpose in the game, and I've never seen that concept executed better anywhere else.

From the outset, ""Inside"" draws you into a hauntingly beautiful and enigmatic world. The absence of dialogue encourages players to interpret the narrative, making it a deeply immersive experience.

But what truly sets ""Inside"" apart is its depth. Beneath the surface of a platformer lies a narrative that challenges players to contemplate profound themes. Its atmospheric soundtrack adds to the immersion.

""Inside"" is more than a game; it's an exploration of human nature and control. With mesmerizing visuals and intricate puzzles, it's an unforgettable journey that will leave you pondering its mysteries long after you've finished.

In short, ""Inside"" is a must-play, offering a rare level of depth and emotional resonance in the world of gaming. It's a reminder that the most profound adventures often take you inside yourself.",1694276008,1694276008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Inside looks like a really simple game but it's really deep and entertaining. Loved challenging puzzles and idea behind the game. To me this game represents the ""rat race"" people are in nowadays. Time by time society acts like programmed machines, doing same things day by day and slowly all the emotions and happiness we felt back in the days fade away. Fortunately there are still people left who try to stay away from society's standards and they prefer to live their life in their own way.

Inside is a Incredible Indie Game Developed by Playdead, the Studio behind Limbo. Released in 2016 for Xbox, PC and PS4, 2017 For iPhone, 2018 for Nintendo Switch and 2020 For Mac-OS. It was Nominated for Game of the Year at the 2016 Game Awards But lost (Fuck you Overwatch). 

The Game Revolves Around a Young Boy Who is Unnamed and his journey through a rather Dystopian World filled with harrowing and weird sights. 

Let's Start with the good: 

- EXCELLENT Ambience, Truly One of the Shining Parts. + 3 Points
- Great Art, Simplistic Yet it works. Reminds me of Superliminal or Untitled Goose Game. +1 Point
- Tells a Tale without a Single Word, Which is Hard to do. the story is portrayed by the Environments and the Surroundings. +1 Point
- The Puzzles Are Really Clever and Intricate, Took me a while to do it.  + 2 Points
- The Subtle yet Somehow Prominent Score Makes this game so much better. + 3 Points 
- Complex and Thought out Story, Even though it's a silent story. + 0.5 Points. 

And now the Bad: 

- The Ending Kind of Dragged. it was rather anticlimactic. - 1 Point
 - it feels like a walking simulator at some points, but it gives me time Admire the Well Crafted Scenery, So 
 i'm Only Deducting Half a Point. - 0.5 Points 
- Can be Frustrating, But that's a Skill issue on my Half. No Points Deducted. 


This Game is a Great Experience with an Interesting Story. Highly Recommended. 

9/10.

The atmosphere is FUCKING PERFECT. Just like the way i like it. The meaning behind the game is something kind of abstract, interpret it your way.

""INSIDE"" is a game that doesn't just leave an impression; it etches itself into your memory. Developed by Playdead, the same minds behind ""Limbo,"" this puzzle platformer exudes a unique and haunting charm that keeps players talking long after the credits roll.

Much like its predecessor, ""INSIDE"" boasts a distinct art style, shrouded in darkness both in tone and color. The characters are faceless, and the narrative is deliberately enigmatic. This ambiguity sparks conversations and keeps players engaged throughout its three-hour journey.

The puzzles in ""INSIDE"" aren't mind-bendingly difficult, but that doesn't matter. They strike a balance that keeps players intrigued, eager to uncover the mysteries of the game's world and their character's purpose.

However, it's impossible to ignore the discomforting theme running through Playdead's games. ""INSIDE"" continues the trend of portraying a young protagonist enduring brutal deaths, which can be unsettling. This discomfort serves to heighten the emotional impact of the game.

""INSIDE"" excels at creating a haunting atmosphere. The game raises questions at every turn, immersing players in its eerie world and its enigmatic narrative. The dark and moody visuals, combined with a haunting soundtrack, deliver an atmospheric experience that few games can match.

Despite its simplicity in terms of gameplay mechanics, ""INSIDE"" is a polished masterpiece. With only two buttons for controls, it relies on visual hints and experimentation to guide players, eschewing tutorials and explanations.

Visually, the game is unsettling yet beautiful, with every animation conveying a poetic quality. From stumbling over obstacles to frantic swimming during chases, each movement feels deliberate and adds to the overall experience.

In summary, ""INSIDE"" is more than a game; it's an experience. While its puzzles may be straightforward, its story is outlandish and confusing in all the right ways. It's the kind of game that begs discussion, leaving players eager to share their ""WTF just happened"" moments. ""INSIDE"" is an unforgettable journey that deserves to be played and talked about.",1693858162,1693858162,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Certainly understandable, and I view this game as being closer to a work of art than simply a video game. 

However, it makes me all the more glad I got it on sale, because $20, although modestly priced for such an amazing game, is steep for the length. I don't really see myself playing this game again anytime soon. I believe I replayed Limbo, but there was so much less choice in games back when I was young. I'm sure the game has little secrets to find (I found a couple), but I'm not the ""maximal achievement"" kind of guy.  It took me less than 4 hours to complete the first play-through. It certainly doesn't outstay its welcome, which, for this kind of game, is possible. But I think another two hours would have been more satisfying.

When Inside presents the player with obstacles it slows down and the feel is very gamey. Whether that’s because there’s trail and error involved, and you’re repeatedly dying or because there’s a puzzle that you must resolve before proceeding. None of this is bad just average. I think Inside’s strength is when it flows like a scene in a film that’s shot in a single take. The Sam Mendes’ film 1917 came to mind. Not because of the setting but because of this flow. The camera goes on a journey with the main character as he traverses battlefields, countrysides, cities, and more. There’s a momentum and energy that this technique evokes that can be found throughout Inside. With video games that energy can be even more tactile as you can really engage with the aforementioned _little things_. Brushing aside cornstalks, sliding down roofs, careening through office complexes shattering windows and upturning all furniture in your path… it’s never felt more engaging.

5/5

INSIDE (which will be referred to as 'Inside' from now on) is one of my favorite games.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is one of my top 5 games of all time.  I consider this game to be a masterpiece, and a must-play if you like atmospheric or story driven games.  It is one of the few games that I have gotten all of the achievements for.  Also, it is the only game that I have seriously attempted to speed run, because I enjoy replaying it so much.


More:

Inside is fantastic.  It is thrilling and captivating.  From the very beginning, the game grabs your attention and never loosens its grip for even a second.  The audio, the visuals, the character design, the aesthetic... everything is perfect.  Of all the games that I have played in the past 30 years or so, it stands out as something truly special.  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  If you do, make sure that you are alone with no distractions, in a dark room with headphones on.  Fully immerse yourself into this game to get the most out of it.

You take on the role of a young boy who is traversing a strange and mysterious environment.  When you begin the game, you do not know what is going on or why.  There is no dialogue or text-crawl to explain what is happening.  You simply figure everything out as you go.  The player is left to use their imagination and observations to explain the world of Inside.  And what a world it is.

It is gloomy and dark.  The world is threatening and unsettling.  There is a sense of unease during the entire play-through that never lets up.  I was eager to see what was just beyond the screen horizon the entire time that I was playing.  Fully immersed in this world, I believed that I was the young boy in this game through and through.  

Most of the time spent playing is spent solving puzzles and platforming.  The technical design of the game is fantastic.  It is so much fun discovering how to solve the puzzles in the game and progress.  They are very well done, interesting, and not overly difficult.  Truly there is joy in figuring something out that was right in front of you the entire time, and not obscured needlessly to artificially increase the difficulty.  You will have that 'aha!' moment multiple times while playing this game.  The proverbial light bulb in your head will turn on over and over, while you probably smile and eagerly finish the task at hand.

Earlier, I described the world as unsettling.  The music plays a very large role in eliciting this feeling.  There are mostly quiet moments, peppered with ambient noise and sound effects of things happening in the background.  You hear every footstep that you take echo through empty halls and dark forests, as well as machinery clanging and churning within buildings.  When something truly noteworthy happens, the music kicks in, and it is glorious.  It is subtle and expertly composed.

Inside has a minimalist and almost low-poly art style.  For the most part, the game is very dark, and not well lit, so you can't actually see any topology on the meshes.  You won't notice individual faces on character models as they move about, or anything like that.  The boy, and all the other inhabitants of this world appear almost featureless in their faces, and only given enough detail to discern their job, their age, and their gender.  There is a pretty wide view of the entire world while you are playing, so this makes sense visually as well as thematically.  You wouldn't get a very good look at any characters face even if they were highly detailed, because they appear to be far away... and you don't really need to know much about them... and you probably don't want to.

When I think about the time I spent playing this game, I feel like I watched an entire series of a TV show.  There is so much that happens in such a short time on this young boys journey, and so much is learned and revealed.  This is a game that I want more of, but also want to remain exactly what it is.  I would love nothing more than to have more 'Inside' content, but this game was so well done, and my memories of it are so precious that I wouldn't want anything to even come close to changing that.  Inside is as close to perfect as a game can get in my opinion, and I can't imagine any way to make it better outside of making more of it, exactly as it already is.  

I consider this to be one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and I hope that as many people as possible experience it, and hopefully, feel the same way that I felt while playing it.",1693268031,1693268031,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I was disappointed with the later parts of the game, everything is turned on its head like for example you were running and afraid but then last areas of the game you're casually murdering people without any real effort. Can't go into details because it is a spoiler, a large one I guess.. but it didn't fit with the game in my opinion and the ambiguous ending could have been achieved without it, from my perspective using the enemies tech and busting out.

After finishing this I went and played Limbo, same developers and similar concept but different goals maybe. There are definitely parallels between both games, this one is noticeably more polished as should be expected as it released after Limbo did, similar to a sequel.

Great job developers, I recommend the game and the experience, the world with everything in it. Many people should try it, I commend what you've done but I don't like your plot device, it feels lazy and if it was just there for a segment or a few I'd let it pass but as it is right now I feel like it overrides a lot of what the MC wanted to do, not how he'd have done it too.

It is worth full price but not in regards to 1 playthrough content. Go for extra, do more, experiment more. Playing it for story or to see what happens next will take under 5 hours, maybe even under 4 so I encourage anybody trying to take your time, there is more to do.

INSIDE is really a great puzzle related adventure game. I really doesn't understand the story of the game ( Don't know there is one !!). But the game gives you a marvelous experience better than what Limbo gives you. The game is so easy to control and the puzzles in it are not like that easy.

From the makers of LIMBO, INSIDE sees you control a nameless boy in a bid to escape from... something. Having no dialogue, cutscenes, lore or any exposition whatsoever, you are left largely to draw your own conclusions as you progress through the game on the way to your objective.

While not as eerie or haunting as LIMBO (which wins out in that category due to the stark use of black/white and no colours), it has a menace all of its own, especially the dogs. The environment also does not feel quite as lethal as the world of LIMBO, but in reality there are still plenty ways to die. There is still a strong puzzle element here, just a lack of obviously deadly obstacles such as buzzsaws, electricity, etc. Instead, these are replaced by sentient beings, such as dogs and humans - some of which are hostile, and some of which are indifferent.

The game raises philosophical questions about the nature of self, agency, and morality. What does it mean to be human in a society that strips away individuality and autonomy? How far would you go to escape from such a system? What are the ethical implications of manipulating others for your own survival or curiosity? Due to the ""clean"" nature of the game (very limited information input as mentioned earlier), it seems probable that most players will come to their own, unique conclusions based on their experience playing through the game. Then again, it may also raise the question of whether there is even a point in the first place.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for an adventure, story or something more introspective. Much like LIMBO, this is more than a game and comes closer to art or a thought exercise and deserves to be experienced.

2. The gameplay is next to none. I do not understand why it is labelled as a puzzle platformer, in reality this is a 2D walking simulator. All you do is walk (and sometimes swim). The puzzles do not require any mental effort

4. On the other hand, there is no storytelling, it is not explained at all what is the reason for all the stuff that is happening, and you have to speculate. I do not mind it at all personally, but why would the devs call this game ""narrative driven""? There is literally zero narration.

A mystery is a promise:  Patient and observant players will be rewarded with story and meaning.  This promise is undermined when the creator forces the player to create the story and meaning themselves.  If you're looking for a few hours of solid puzzles and platforming, great art and an intriguing setting, this will work for you.  If you're looking for your curiosity to be rewarded with a satisfying conclusion, keep looking.

The puzzles are good, neither too sinister nor too trivial, broken up nicely by tight platforming.  The atmosphere is sometimes tense and foreboding, sometimes wild and dangerous.  The art is beautiful, with curious and interesting sights from start to finish.

The game respects players' time.  Failure results in the ability to quickly reset and try again.  The ""load"" system allows players to go back and search for missed side areas without having to replay the whole game.  There's no unnecessary backtracking, and no scene, setting, or challenge wears out its welcome.

Most every aspect of this game works well, so the way you feel about this game story will boil down to:  Do you want a mystery with a solution?  Or would you prefer to speculate on possibilities?  If you like to look up and/or make fan theories (that can never really be proved one way or the other), this game will give you something to work with.  If the idea of getting to the end and going ""that's it?"" frustrates you, skip this one.",1691431376,1691431376,False,9,0,0.589794278144836426,0,True,False,False

304430,142678664,76561197982485999,0,13,447,0,447,1690158867,"I'm torn about this game. It oozes with mood and style. For that alone, I would recommend it. It has incredible visuals (especially the dynamic lighting) and animation. The simplistic shapes and textures/colors give it an artful style, and it offers a very interesting world... 

...but you don't get to explore that world, and there are no answers at the end for anything you've seen and wondered about while playing. It's not a bad ending, per se, it's just... ""That's it? We're done now? Why did ANY of that happen?? What was ANY of this for?? Why did anyone do anything they did?? What are the motivations of ANY characters?""

This side-scroller looks incredible due to being executed in a 3D space... but that leads to me wanting to escape the 2D plane the player character is trapped on. I did not feel that in Playdead's prior game because it rarely, if ever, implied any space to move into other than forward and back (with occasional up and down). Bringing depth into a 2D scrolling game concept made the game look beautiful and the simplistic environments believable, but it also teased of places you cannot go. This makes invisible walls worse than ever: the puzzle framing is so much more artificial and obvious, and irritating in several cases. I felt myself asking ""why would I go THERE, instead of going anywhere else?"" Oh, right, because there's only a 2D plane for this character to move in and all puzzles are carried out (and demanded) via an inevitable left or right movement (and sometimes up & down) on a mostly linear path.

Some of the puzzles, if you can call them that, became repetitious, and that resulted in frustration. There were moments that I just wanted a certain type of action/activity to stop repeating (like the underwater monster pursuits, though that ended satisfactorily, despite only adding more questions and answering nothing... making prior action seemingly senseless, also therefore making it look more like puzzles than narrative). The game was a better experience while the activities required of the player were diverse. Speaking of... change...

The twist near the end was... something. I understand why people are bothered by it, but I would've been fine with the twist had ANYTHING AT ALL been explained by the end. I am NOT a fan of ""anything goes because it's sci-fi"" type of plotting. It has to make some kind of sense within its own context. In this game, nothing makes any sense at all. There's no suggestion as to the motivation of ANY characters or factions, nor what they even are. There's not even a sense that the ending fits into what's been given so far, other than ""outside is better/safer"", which was already explicitly made clearly NOT the case at the very beginning of the game. So, maybe it's ""outside... over THERE is better, because... reasons...""

I am not a fan of ""it's so open ended by the end that you can come up with whatever meaning or story you want"". That's not a plot or a story; it's meaningless performance art. I'm not here to create someone else's world for them. Tell me a story inside a world that you've already decided on. I hate doing other people's work for them and watching people excuse it with ""it's open to interpretation"". Yeah, a blank sheet of paper is also open to interpretation. Ultimately, we are given apocalypse/""dangers of science"" tropes as magnetic poetry to throw at a wall. There's a little of this, a little of that... none of it forms a coherent world or plot, ""but it looks cool!""

A story doesn't need to be easy/simple, or spoon-fed to me, but it DOES have to be EXTANT. I can always tell when writers have no idea what they've created. Throwing random weird and suggestive content at the audience works up until it stops being possible to make sense of it as a coherent work, and then you realize you're just being fed random stuff because someone thought ""hey, cool mystery"". You really do have to figure it out as a writer, even if you don't spell it out to the audience. ""MYSTERIOUS!!"" is not more important than ""it makes some kind of sense, and is internally consistent"".

I don't regret the experience of playing this game, but I don't feel strongly motivated to replay it in order to find several secrets I missed, or try to get the ""alternate ending"" everyone keeps talking about. Some of the game was too tedious to replay for what's likely to be more ""no answers mystery"", and likely just create more questions.

If none of this story/plot criticism matters to you in your entertainment experience, then I guess you'll be fine with what this game presents.

As for difficulty: It's sometimes frustrating, but I got through it fairly rapidly, and I'm not a hard-core gamer, nor a puzzle person. That said, it's not so easy as to be able to dash through it without any effort or thought. It's actually a pretty good balance, and, for me, as challenging as I can tolerate a game to be when playing it as one solid block of 7 hours.

In several ways (visual style and structure), this game reminded me of ""Out of This World"", but I felt zero connection to any characters here. There's barely a character to speak of, other than ""the boy"". The end of OOTW was emotional and it has stuck with me for decades. The end of ""Inside"" is... well, as I said above: it just ends, and I sat here asking ""Is that it? Really??"" The only thing that will stick with me here is the rendering tech... and the blob.",1690164329,1690164329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
- The gameplay. Simple and intuitive
- The ambiance. We feel the oppression, and that the boy is scared (with reason).
- The variety of the puzzles.
- The thriller. This game is the proof we don't need gore and violence to be afraid and tensed.
- The variation between tension and calm.
- The possibility to do the chapters again.
- No dialogue. And yet, the developpers managed to tell a beautiful story.
- No downloads or breaks. It's linear... litteraly.
- This game doesn not have a rich colour palette. Do not expect a side-scrolling game as colourful as mario. It's not. Some even consider the art style as monochromous. But it's actually a strength of this game, as it contributes significantly to the feeling of oppresion and dystopy.

Limits
- ?

Depends of your tastes
- There is a plotwist at the end. Some people thought it was genious. Because of the reviews and comments, my expectations were high. But once I got there, I told myself it was overrated. The plotwist changes indeed the tone, but it becomes absurb and does not fit with the rest of the game (in my opinion). However the plotwist was satisfaying and made sense with the story!
- Open ending.
- Short game. Less than 6 hours.
- No hints. 
- Some puzzles are hard. Be prepared to be stuck and to tell yourself often ''why did not I think about that earlier?''. And to do some trials-errors. And to fail. And to die often. But it's easier than Limbo.",1689914168,1689914168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

INSIDE is a great and coherent game with lots of well-designed puzzles and, let's call them, ""action segments.""

The difficulty is just right for this type of game. Sometimes it can be challenging and make you pause for a moment, but usually, the solutions are easy (and fun!) to find.

The movement of the main character is well-executed and really comfortable.

The world-building deserves separate praise. It has everything you need to fully immerse yourself in the game. Amazing ambiance? Yes. Almost seamless transitions between locations? You got it! Things happening in the background? Absolutely!

Honestly, I don't know if I can say anything negative about it.

Puzzles are noticeably easier than in Limbo - this is a good choice for the type of game this is.  It is story driven and visually gorgeous more than anything else. The puzzles are still clever and use physics in an interesting way. Only this time, unlike in Limbo, you won't be wasting too much time figuring them out.

The gameplay is perfect for what someone may expect from a game of the genre, a 2d platform sidescroller seems quite an accurate description for this piece. I had quite a lot of fun trying to figure out the solutions to the problems and obstacles found along the way. It is not a frenetic experiencie, it is not a guns blazin' experience, it is a puzzle game with some platorming and sidcrolling within it. [u]If you are looking for an assasins creed or a call of duty, this may not be your game.[/u]

[h1]Controls:[/h1]
This game has the simplest control configuration I have had the pleasure to deal with in a very long time. Only 6 buttons are required to play this game, up down left right and 'A' for grabbing or interacting and 'B' for jumping, almost reminds of the old NES and Gameboy games. This sentence alone should let readers know about the implicit simplicity of the mechanics you shall encounter in this game. Although do not be missguided into thinking that the game is boring.

[h1]Atmosphere:[/h1]
This is one of the strong points of the game, the atmosphere is well developed and established although probably not the main focus of the game as it would be in a horror title. It sets the mood rather well for the environment it all happens in and is a piece of added flavour to the game.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
This game is for the kind of player that likes to observe, theorize and reflect upon what is seen, constantly, because nothing will ever be said nor directly implied. The lore of the game seems to be a big question mark and that may be a very good choice for this game, although I like to have my anwsers figured out, this game does a marvelous job in delivering a story masked as 'almost nothing really'. It does that in a way that creates questions, constantly, that drives the player forward for answers that only bring more questions.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
The graphics are one of the positives aspects of the game. Although in many parts of the game the graphics and scene become extremely dark and you may want to increase your brightness against that. I loved the artistic style, it is very nicely executed, but it is quite a saddening thing that it was not more extensively explored within vivid colours. One may argue that for the sake of the atmosphere there could not be many vibrant tones, but being almost monocromatic, at times, may risk being repetitive, Nontheless, I truly enjoyed the graphics, the 'flaw' I mentioned, seemes to have had a purpose.

[h1]replayability[/h1]
Close to zero to be completely honest.
I only mention this because of the alternate ending. To find it, it had me go through the game again, and look for the pieces of the game that i had missed the first run. Otherwise there is no replayability whatsoever,
unless you want to figure out the story for yourself and theorize about what happened within the game universe. Also, good F***ing luck finding those collectibles you need for the alternate ending, there is one specific piece that had me sweat for a big while, then jump to google due to my frustration. Also, there is one specific puzzle, always within the replayability context, that i would have never figured out on my own, my low IQ may be showing here, but a little hint may be good for players. Feels like they expected people to google stuff out [spoiler] Me being salty [/spoiler].

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
I truly enjoyed the game. Bought it for 2€ and got 30 hours worth of fun. Passing around the controller when getting stuck was a nice experience with my wife. The type of gameplay, rather relaxing and head-scratch inducing, sometimes, turned up the speed and had you go in some sort of more action-like gameplay moments at others. Alltogether, the story, the atmosphere, the gameplay, simpliciy and pace resulted in a well developet product that deserves praise.

I honestly don't have much negative to say about this game. It's roughly the appropriate length for a game like this, though I've yet to compare it to this dev's other titles. And it checks out on about every other metric I'd measure its success on.

I liked the atmosphere, the well-suited graphics, and it had some pretty cool ideas in this game which I must give this an upvote, but that is where it ends. Below are the common things you see in reviews that are misinformation and you need to ignore:



>>> Atmosphere is oppressive

No it's not. It is dark and ambient, but I never felt oppressed. If you want to feel oppressed, go play Amnesia, Outlast, etc.



>>> The less you know before, the better

No for the vast majority of gamers. If you are in the small subset of people who particularly enjoy playing games that explain nothing and spending a lot of your own free time trying to derive meaning from something, then this probably will appeal to you. Such people are in a small minority in my experience, so the odds are pretty high that going in knowing some spoilers would arguably help make sense of things you won't understand anyways.



>>> You will feel yourself inside the game

No.



>>> This is a puzzle game
>>> Challenging puzzles
>>> ...

No damn way.

If you consider puzzles something that takes you anywhere between 0 - 15 seconds at most of thinking, yeah. If you are someone who has played what would be unanimously called a puzzle game (such as The Talos Principle, among many) then you will be STRONGLY disappointed if you are expecting any kind of puzzles. If anyone thinks this is a puzzle game, then they've blurred the word so much that it means nothing and you should ignore them.

If this is your first puzzle game ever, and you stopped thinking after grade 3, sure, it may feel like a puzzle game to you. 



>>> This is ... the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had

I don't know how. If this person isn't flat out lying, then if you made them play Amnesia: The Dark Descent then I assume they would go into cardiac arrest. This game is a walk through the park with effectively zero intensity.

The enemies are predictable and easy to thwart. Where exactly is this intensity...? I am pretty sure the developers chose to make this game not be intense.



>>> The cinematography is stunning -- literally every frame is a painting

These kinds of people who have such low standards that they are immediately impressed by anything that has shadows and reflections. Pay them no heed. I would further posit these people play a lot of indie games where the graphics are ""indie quality"" (as expected!) so anything that has reflections in water is the second coming of Christ.

The graphics are nice and smooth and better than your average indie game, but calling everything a painting is way too far, the graphics aren't THAT good. Just because this game nails a dark ambient vibe really well and made solid smooth graphics doesn't mean it's a visual masterpiece.



>>> Playing at night in darkness with headphones extremely recommended

No it will barely do anything. This is not a horror game. This game is not scary at all to warrant being in the dark. At best it would augment the atmosphere, but nothing more. The sounds are decent and would benefit from using headphones, but there were only a handful of sounds that I thought were worth headphones. Certain lifts had great sounds that capitalized on headphones, but a lot of sounds did not.



>>> A lonely and terrifying journey that will disturb you to the core

Lonely? Maybe. Terrifying? No. Disturbing? Maybe if you're the kind of person who freaks out over novels like 1984 and have never played a dark ambient game like this before.



>>> It's hard for movies, much less video games to say so much without having any dialogue. If done wrong, the whole thing is a mess. If done right, you have a masterpiece. That's what this game is: a masterpiece.

I am unconvinced, and this game does that but it is not a masterpiece.



>>> This is a game that when you complete it, you truly feel like you've accomplished something, not just beaten it.

No it does not.



>>> Loved the problem solving and soundtrack.

There was no problem solving (as seen earlier)... and... soundtrack!? Was my game busted? There was no soundtrack... unless you consider ambient sounds in the background a soundtrack, but I would disagree with that definition.

We're we playing the same game!?



>>> It tells a story with a deceptive amount of depth

Due to the purposeful ambiguity by the developers, I disagree with saying this game has ""depth."" You can say this about anything and get away with it because art is subjective. I don't think there is much here and it's left up to interpretation, which means if you imagine there to be depth due to a good imagination, it will have it. However you can say that about anything, and therefore I don't find this claim to be useful.



If you read through all of this, the key takeaway is that is a decent looking game with decent physics and a well done dark ambient atmosphere. If you aren't 12 years old, this will be a decent game that you can complete in about 2 hours or so, or if you're like me you wander off trying odd things and maybe add on an extra half hour. I think the developers achieved their vision, and I think they did it well, so I give this a thumbs up.

However, the reviews here are ridiculous and misleading. The reviews are proof that one needs extreme skepticism whenever something has ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" on Steam. Plus if you check out the profiles of some of these people, they've got tons of anime spam on their profile and have a full work's week of gaming, which tells you everything you need to know, and maybe I should have led with this because you'd understand the clientele just from this alone.

I've seen worse misleading reviews on other games, but they're pretty bad here.",1664658236,1688950664,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As the creators of Limbo, similarities can be found: a sinister/disturbing story, satisfying hidden achievements, great puzzles, many ways of dying, good response and controls. Simple yet great.

As with its predecessor Limbo by the same studio it contains ingenious puzzles, traps, and dangerous encounters against the backdrop of an even more beautiful scenery than Limbo. While I love Limbo in all its aspects, this game has an added depth that Limbo's missing. The atmosphere and ambience, the minimalist and suggestive brutalistic architectural world the player moves around in is sublime, the art direction is quite awesome and perfect, making this one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen and played. Many times I just walked back and forth just to admire the world around me. It's the weirdest thing too; as I progressed in the game I felt that although the world is quite the scary place to walk around in I at the same time felt a longing to go there, like I had some kind of connection to it. It felt very northen and seeing as I'm a swede I found many things eerily familiar, and the reason for this as it turned out in the end when the credits rolled I found that the studio behind the game, Playdead, is danish. No wonder I seemed to feel at home in certain aspects when playing this game; they've perfectly incorporated the visual sense of the northen scenery and then added their magic to it. They really managed to bring about the atmospheric melancholy of the northen people and I absolutely loved everything about it. The world is indeed cold and oppressively scary but it is really beautiful. Many times I just sat and looked at the visuals in complete fascination.

The story of Limbo and Inside have similarities and differences. In both games, we play a silent and nameless protagonist who we do not know much about even after we have completed the games. Both games use environmental storytelling to allow the player to experience the game and the story that they intend to convey without the use of any spoken language. Both games provoke more questions than answers. In both games, we start off in the forest. In Inside, we get chased by both dogs and human beings who want to capture the player character. We are left wondering why did other humans want to capture the player character. Who are we playing as and what are we doing in the game? Where are we? As the game progresses, we observe strange happenings in the game world as we can see mind controlled animals such as pigs and other human beings which our player character can mind control using a cap that he wears on his head. [spoiler] Later, after a strange incident where our player character is drowned by a mermaid creature, our player character gains the ability to breathe underwater permanently and also can mind control other human beings effortlessly without the use of a mind control cap. [/spoiler] Why is our player character able to mind control other creatures and human beings? What does this mind control ability symbolize? What are those other human beings who move like zombies in the game world and who do they symbolize or represent? I feel that Inside is less disturbing than Limbo though because there is more ""humanity"" in the other humanoid creatures found in the game world. In Limbo most of the other human like creatures want to kill the player character except for one - the female character whom the player character gets to meet at the end of the game. In Inside, the player character can get many other humanoids to help him progress the game by mind controlling them. In Limbo, the player character is very much on his own, which exacerbates the feeling of loneliness when we, the player controls him to overcome the puzzles and challenges in the game world. In Inside, we can feel that our player character gets more powerful as the game progresses due to the abilities he gains while playing the game but in Limbo, the player character practically remains very much the same throughout the game, which gives us the perception that Limbo is a much more difficult game than Inside. Both games also have an open-ended ending which leaves the players wondering what happened at the end of the game. In fact, there is no closure.",1688397091,1688397638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The constant simplistic, yet ominous view of what's on screen, the phenomenal sound design that really did not have to be this good and the ambiguity of the story are what easily makes this game for me a 10/10. Unlike other games like Little Nightmares, the controls never felt overbearing and the puzzles weren't hard enough for things to get frustrating, nor were they simple to the point that completing them wouldn't feel satisfying.

Visually, it's a bit boring. The story leaves a lot of gaps in a way that feels more pretentious than clever. The puzzles are fine, but do not feel especially satisfying to solve. Definitely not worthy of the many 10/10s that I've seen it get.

That being said, this game excels at evoking a feeling of dread, and even anxiety at times. The way that the story is delivered through purely levels (no dialogue, lore items, etc.) was great, which made it a lot smoother to play through. It's also short and sells for about $2 during a sale, making it absolutely worth checking out.

Limbo was also a major 2D game to be honest and a nostalgic one. the only reason i gave it 4.5 instead of 5, is the ending; ""Spoiler Ahead"". the ending shows clearly that the story was on an island, after the main character controlled that monster, but sadly he committed suicide, it was kinda vague, i believe it was on intention for a part 2 hopefully. in the end, from an innocent game at the start, to a monster in the end.

The game follows a boy who finds himself drawn into the center of a dark project, and the narrative-driven platformer combines intense action with thought-provoking puzzles.

One of the standout features of INSIDE is its incredible sound design. As someone who works in game audio, I was blown away by the attention to detail and the way that sound was used to create an immersive and unsettling atmosphere. The use of ambient sounds and carefully crafted sound effects added to the overall mood of the game and helped to create a truly unforgettable experience.

The level design is also expertly crafted, with each level offering a new challenge and a unique aesthetic. The puzzles are thought-provoking and require a combination of logic and strategy to solve. The game's art style is moody and evocative, with a dark and unsettling atmosphere that permeates every aspect of the game.

A short but very enjoyable, imaginative, atmospheric 2.5D puzzle-platformer.

INSIDE is a title with a very dark and somber atmospheric feel - CONTROL-like even. It takes place in an enormous secret government facility of unknown purpose that almost seems to consume you as you progress. The game has an overall unsettling theme throughout and uses dramatic lighting and audio to fantastic effect. And it only gets better and more imaginative as you progress further into the story.

INSIDE starts a little on the slow side, but quickly gains traction. The game has a simple, pleasant art-style with a very high level of attention to detail especially where it comes to environmental interactions. The animations are supremely smooth and thought-out overall.

It's a little on the short side overall, and not very challenging. But it is quite a trip and a worthwhile playthrough.",1687644895,1687644943,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The Good: 
- Core Design: The puzzles are excellent. With a decent, diegetic tutorial of the mechanics you're expected to use and the removal of objects that should follow patterns, but do not, the puzzles themselves are practically flawless.
- Difficulty: Difficulty in games comes from them being 1 or a combination of 3 things: challenging, punishing, and bad. Inside is not hugely challenging, and not punishing at all. It's more or less about the difficulty a game like this should be. 

The Bad:
- Tutorialisation: Inside lacks tutorials, which is mostly not a real problem because there aren't too many mechanics but does get frustrating. The designers need to learn the difference between ""not holding the player's hand"" and ""not telling the player what the world is capable of or what is expected of them"". There is no tutorial, there is mostly no demonstration of mechanics (you're just expected to already know what they are and how to use them). It's the difference between tough-love and parental neglect. You are put into puzzles that I'm sure the solutions of are obvious to the designers, but are obtuse and arbitrary to a player. 
- Gameplay: The movement is not good. No, it's not an action combat game or a tight platformer where the ability to control the minute movements of your character is essential to being any good at the game, but the kid is awful to control. He's simultaneously floaty and heavy, it's like controlling a balloon filled half-and-half with water and air. Most of this problem could be fixed by just making him stop more quickly, but maybe that's a stylistic decision, maybe they really wanted to make you so irritated with this child that you aren't even disappointed when he gets eaten by dogs, who knows? But there is also several sections where you could really stand to benefit from being able to control him more precisely: there's some sections where the timing is quite tight, and making a small mistake risks an immediate death, but he doesn't control well enough to so you WILL die until you can do it perfectly, which just takes you out of the game's world and frustrates you (I'm talking about that last mermaid section).

The Rest:
I don't really think there's a 'story', per se, because there is never any explanation as to why the things that are happening are happening, nor much environmental storytelling to explain what's going on, why, or how. Absolutely nothing about the scenario is explained, and that's a weakness for someone like me because I quite like games with a plot, and it's a great shame because the plot could have been fantastic if they'd put as much effort into it as they put into the jiggle physics of the blob at the end of the game.

Conclusion:
Yeah, it's pretty good. Worth a play, but don't expect it to play very well.",1687464042,1687464042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You know what I did enjoy, back in 2010? A little indie game called Limbo. It was a simplistic, shorter game in which you played a scared little child running left to right in foreboding, shadow-silhouetted environments. It had a control scheme that only used a few buttons,  a minimalist soundtrack, and a pretty much non-existent story sprinkled with hints of pretentiousness.  You spent the first thirty or so minutes fleeing a giant demon-spider, followed by two hours of traipsing through dull, boring, insipid, ruined warehouses and factories. Honestly, if you stopped after the demon-spider died, you did yourself a favor. Oh, and every death animation was brutal and cruel. Said animations shocked you the first couple of times, but then lost all meaning as desensitization kicked in. 

Limbo pretty much kicked off the ""scared child in spooky nightmare land"" indie genre. A seemingly endless litany of similar indie games followed in its wake, each slightly more tedious than the last. Almost none reached the lofty heights that Limbo did with its freaky-deaky giant demon-spider. 

So what did Limbo's developers do to follow up their success? This game, which would have been more aptly titled Limbo 1.5. You're still a little kid, running left to right in a big, bad world. Only, there's no demon spider hunting you through a big pine forest for thirty minutes. Instead, you run from some blokes and their dogs as they chase you across a small patch of forest and some corn fields. Then, the obligatory two plus hours of run-down, dimly lit, gray-colored warehouses, factories, and research facilities kick in. It's dull. Exceedingly dull, and the muted sounds and minimalist soundtrack DO NOT HELP MATTERS. On the plus side, the last ten minutes of the game veer wildly into a psychotic, non-sequitur blob sequence that makes no sense whatsoever, but feels like a generous reprieve from the afore-mentioned tedium. 

It just did not work for me. The deaths lost all impact ten minutes in. The level variety left a lot to be desired. The story was non-existent and abysmally shallow (though that hasn't stopped hardcore fans from filling in the massive blanks with their empty conjectures and pseudo-theories). I was checking my timer 20 minutes in and praying that the game would end soon. Never crashed, ran fine, and seemed polished. Just not my cup of tea. This genre is clearly not for me. 

But... if you're a fan of this genre, here's another one of them. It's made by the people who put this genre on the map, so you're going to get what you're looking for. If you're not a fan, I might recommend Limbo instead. Same developers, same ambiance, similar control scheme, and same general polish. It sells for a fairly low price nowadays and the first thirty minutes with the giant demon-spider are wonderful. Tense, freaky, and off-putting. Again, just make sure to stop immediately after you have bested the eight legged terror.  You'll have seen the best this genre has to offer and can move on.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

INSIDE, the enigmatic puzzle-platformer developed by Playdead, is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling and immersive gameplay. With its haunting visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thought-provoking narrative, INSIDE delivers a captivating and unforgettable experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre.

One of the most striking aspects of INSIDE is its visual design. The game's dark and atmospheric environments, rendered in minimalist yet highly detailed graphics, create a sense of unease and mystery. The use of light and shadow, combined with subtle animations and seamless transitions, adds depth and immersion to every scene. The visuals work in perfect harmony with the game's narrative, unraveling its dark secrets and unveiling a dystopian world filled with sinister undertones.

The sound design in INSIDE is equally remarkable. The haunting ambient sounds, eerie melodies, and atmospheric effects contribute to the game's oppressive atmosphere, heightening the sense of tension and unease. The lack of traditional dialogue or exposition allows the player to immerse themselves fully in the experience, interpreting the story through visual and auditory cues, deepening the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The gameplay mechanics of INSIDE are simple yet ingeniously designed. As the protagonist, players navigate through a series of challenging puzzles and platforming sequences, utilizing the environment and manipulating objects to progress. The puzzles gradually increase in complexity, requiring keen observation and experimentation to overcome. The fluid controls and intuitive mechanics make for a smooth and satisfying gameplay experience, ensuring that the focus remains on the exploration and the unraveling of the narrative.

The narrative of INSIDE is a masterpiece in subtlety and ambiguity. It slowly unveils a thought-provoking and metaphorical tale, inviting players to interpret its meaning and symbolism. The game's deliberate pacing and meticulously crafted set pieces create an unsettling and mesmerizing narrative arc that leaves a lasting impact. The lack of explicit exposition allows for personal interpretation, making each playthrough a unique and introspective experience.

INSIDE's concise but profound storytelling is complemented by its impeccable pacing. The game masterfully balances moments of tension and quiet introspection, providing a captivating rhythm that keeps players engaged from start to finish. The gradual reveal of the world's secrets and the protagonist's journey through various environments create a sense of wonder and curiosity, propelling the player forward.

While INSIDE's brevity may be seen as a drawback by some, the game's concise length is a testament to its focus and artistic integrity. It is a tightly woven experience, leaving a lasting impact in its relatively short playtime.

In conclusion, INSIDE is an atmospheric and thought-provoking masterpiece. With its haunting visuals, immersive sound design, and enigmatic narrative, the game invites players on a deeply introspective and emotionally charged journey. It's a testament to the power of minimalist storytelling and atmospheric gameplay. INSIDE is an experience that lingers long after the credits roll, leaving players contemplating its profound themes and imagery. For those seeking a unique and evocative gaming experience, INSIDE is an absolute must-play.",1685708125,1685708125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world is like a subway tunnel, too cramped to explore in any direction but one, and the ‘story’ is just a collection of creepy vibes linked by nothing but blank spaces that the player can choose to fill with whatever they want. Still, for most of its ~3hr run time it had me at the edge of my seat eagerly awaiting the next unholy crime against nature that was going to try and kill me.

Is atmosphere enough to make a game?

Inside, developed by Playdead and released on Steam, is an unequivocal triumph in the world of video games. A spiritual successor to the acclaimed Limbo, Inside continues the tradition of crafting a haunting, atmospheric puzzle platformer that leaves an indelible mark on the player.

The beauty of Inside lies in its seamless blending of the visual and auditory aspects to craft a narrative without uttering a single word. The stark, oppressive world is rendered in a way that the minimalist art style paradoxically teems with detail and story. The muted color palette and meticulously crafted visuals convey a depth of emotion that few games manage to capture.

The atmospheric sound design deserves equal praise, reinforcing the narrative elements with the ebb and flow of ambient sounds that pull players deeper into the game's universe. The music is not just a complement to the visuals, but an equal partner in storytelling.


The game's greatest strength, however, lies in its ambiguous narrative. It refuses to spoon-feed the player, instead opting for a cryptic story that inspires discussions and theories. It's a brave choice that enhances the game's lasting appeal and reinforces the unsettling, dystopian world the game depicts.

Excited to see Playdead's next game and take all the time you need to develop the next game!",1511400931,1685252362,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

a general note about interpreting reviews: games on steam which offer demos will have boosted ratings for two reasons. 1) only steam users who own a game can review it. 2) if a demo is offered for the game then there is a higher proportion of people buying the game who *already know* they like it, as well as a higher proportion of people who don't like the game that the demo filters *out* from buying the game (and therefore filters out from the review process). this shouldn't bother you since you can simply ignore the reviews and play the demo for yourself, but it's worth pointing out.",1684720466,1684720466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A short, dark, mysterious, side scrolling puzzle platformer, with a really good story line, amazing art style and sound effects. It's storyline is horror/sci-fi/thriller/suspense .

There's no dialogue, back story or any lead in to the game, it just starts and your alone stumbling down a dark forest. You run, and you keep running, not knowing who or what you are running from, who you are or why you are running. You just know you can't let anyone catch and kill you!

You hide out of sight briefly when you can't run and there are a few cases where timing is important to avoid enemies, and the use of moving objects is required to solve small puzzles and navigate around enemies or progress further in the story. The game always keeps moving and can be completed in 3 and half hours.

Although you don't know anything about the story, the intrigue is there and mystery of what has happened in this world - dead pigs, a derelict world, civilians marching as if controlled, and you, just a boy running - is this a war, a plague, a famine, some sort of invasion? 

You'll speculate what it all means, who you are and where you are running to, what's going to happen next, and right up until the end couldn't wait to see how the story was going to unfold.
Played it through in one sitting. It was that good!

I could even see this being a comic book or cartoon, the style and story was amazing that it didn't even bother me that there was no dialogue from the characters.

Would play it again, and again.

I do recommend this game but I can't put a thumbs up on my review because I played the whole game and didn't unlock a single achievement, no big deal but I mostly play games with achievements Idk why. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled, rebooted whatever and nothing worked still no achievement, not a single one. So I tried loading chapters after doing a full reinstall of the game but nothing worked so it left me a very sour note when I finished it. 

If you ever get to play this game, it is a 3-5 hours game so i'd strongly suggest to do it in one sitting but on my part I couldn't even stop. Why? Because the game isn't like other games, it feels more like a movie than checkpoints .. I know what I mean lmao

The mystery in which it drops us  achieve to keep it up for the whole game. No scene in this game is similar, nothing is repetitive. The physics of our character is AMAZING, when he fears you see it, when he fall or tumble over something there's some falls that are unique it's hard to explain but it feels like the character we're playing has a life of it's own makes you drawn into the story even more. 

The Artwork on this game coupled with fluid and amazing physics makes it one of the games.   LOL

The ending reminded me of a couple of sci-fi movie that goes from 1 to a 100 in minutes. It wasn't a bad ending at all on my part just REALLY unexpected

GOOD STUFF:
+ Art style and graphics are great to look at and really convey a mood. Could maybe have used a TOUCH more color.
+ Most puzzles are tough enough to be satisfying, but even a tard like me didn't need a walkthrough. They all make sense and while they're very unique and diverse, they will probably be approachable if you apply logic from other video games.
+ There's a real relishable weight to the movement and momentum. The player character has so many subtle little twitches and animations to interact with what's currently going on, and he usually feels good to control. The way your lobotomized followers bumble and crash around is fun to watch.
+ Gameplay keeps changing itself to give you fresh new interactions. There's a submarine section that was particularly fun.
+ Soundwork is great. Very minimal score, which suits the game. Foley work is very creepy, visceral, and great.
+ The death/failure animations don't hold back. When the protagonist dies, he gets f*cking killed.
+ A reasonably interesting story is told purely through the environment. I could have used maybe 20% less vagueness about some parts though.
+ There seemed to be sort of a hackneyed dystopia element to the narrative at first especially being a vulnerable little boy in red running away from the industrialized, scary world... but that's revealed not to entirely be the case, and the final 1/4 of the game comes out of absolute nowhere and I feel cements this game's high reputation. It's not just a narrative reveal, it affects the rest of the gameplay too.

BAD STUFF:
- I really don't like to rate games by ""dollars per hour,"" but $20 is just way too much. It's one linear campaign that took me 3 hours, and nothing else besides some achievements. I think I got this for like $6 or something. Wait for a sale.
- A couple puzzles were pretty oblique in their methodology, wherein a couple I got lucky from guesses and a couple more I tried the correct solution 2 or 3 times before it actually went through. 
- The complex physics and momentum don't always follow your inputs as well as they should. I screwed up the puzzles and died a handful of times because of this. This can be extra finicky in the otherwise great ending segment.

Great game. I've played these critically lauded 2D platformers before like Limbo and Braid, and didn't really find them super fun or impressive for someone not that into the genre. For a few bucks, it's worth your time for sure.",1684237010,1684237010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to enjoy this game. I started the game at 9pm and had completed it by midnight, so there wasn't much to enjoy. Limbo took me multiple sittings and it was difficult to find the easter-eggs. This game was simple, short, and the ending was terrible. I won't ruin it, in case anyone reading this still attempts to play this game, but it was like they got to a place in the story and didn't know how to end... so they just ended it and said, F-it.

I loved playing this game by Playdead, this beautifully crafted masterpiece is a tense, thought provoking ride from start to finish. From being chased by rabid dogs, to mysterious evil people to the charming puzzles, this is something I feel everyone should experience. 

The art style is highly affective, the use of lighting and colour are some of the game’s strongest points, helping build up this Inside world. A dark grey, world awaits you little red shirt and you must go boldly into the darkness to break out. 

Sound scape of the game is dynamic and immersive, with some fantastic tense stings and crescendos during the chase sequences. There were many moments in this game that got my heart pounding. 

I would highly recommend picking up this game and playing it through, if time spent vs cost is of your concern, then wait till it is on sale. It is so worth your time and money. 

Additionally, this game ran like an absolute dream on the Steam Deck, which I played a majority of this game on. 
Hope you found this useful!

The game uses many dark, depressive themes, which it demonstrates through graphic violence throughout the story (I promise you I flinched quite a lot at the brutality), and often scenes with poor lighting.

As an FPS player, I've never been much a fan of campaign/story games, but INSIDE compelled me to keep playing and playing, until I check my phone and see that it's 2 am. I can really appreciate the platformer style of INSIDE and must highlight the immense amount of detail employed in the interactions between all characters in the game and all the detail even in the parts of the map that are hidden away. I also like the realistic colour palette used in this game and I was unable to find a part of the map that looked plain or dull.

This game left me satisfied with it's conclusion, although this is to no surprise as I loved INSIDE's predecessor Limbo when I was younger. I absolutely don't regret trying INSIDE, and I look forward to any future works by Playdead studios.

You play as a boy who is hunted by government agents. After running through dystopian streets filled with mindless people and empty fields, he would have to cross a mysterious research facility. It does raise the question, is this facility simply on the way, or does he have a greater mission? 

Story plays an important part, in fact this game is more story-based and less puzzle-platformer than its predecessor Limbo. The puzzles here feel natural, like how you must use the items around you to progress, instead of being puzzles for the sake of puzzles. For example, in some parts you can gather mindless people to progress. You can lead them and with their help, move heavy objects or reach higher ledges. There's no annoying precision platforming such as ""jump down the slide at the right time to reach next platform and avoid these unnaturally large saws"". And while timing-reliant stuff still exists, the timing is a lot more forgiving.

The level variation is another good thing, there are many, but they also feel real and natural. There are forests, farms, flooded labs, mines, etc. The enemy encounters, which are my favorite parts of Limbo, are also more common here and are fun to dealt with, like hiding from guards and running from dogs. It reminds me more of Little Nightmares, another great puzzle-platformer with a creepy atmosphere. There are also collectibles, don't forget to seek these mysterious orbs out for achievements and an alternate ending that might make things a bit clearer... even though its still confusing.

Overall, I think Inside is a major improvement from Limbo, which to be honest I don't really like. The most important thing is that its easier and more story-based rather than puzzle-platforming, I never felt frustrated during my whole run. If you enjoy puzzle-platformers and story-based games you will have a great time with this title.

This, alone, is a huge reason as to why I like this game so much. INSIDE is clever with its puzzles, has fantastic escape sequences, it's unapologetic and gruesome. Even the narrative alone is this depressing, dark, wicked, incredibly-interesting yet terrifically-done tale on Class and Human Testing. (Of which, sadly I will not go into due to spoilers.) In summary - it's incredibly well made.

In large, the world-building is phenomenal - every scene means something and Playdead makes anything you may go through count. Watching the sleepwalkers mark in unison, realising what is happening in the factories and other places alike. It's disturbing but once again, so, so interesting. Especially on your first play-through. The puzzles are also fantastic. (As you would expect from a puzzle game.) They fit the world perfectly and it even 1-ups Playdeads previous game, LIMBO. INSIDE does what LIMBO did but just better; the lack of UI. Though, with INSIDE, it's cleaner and polished. The intricate use of colour design makes the experience as a whole even better. It clues you in better - it's straightforward as to what you can interact with but by no means does it give the puzzle away entirely. Plus, it's worth noting, how that when you mess up a puzzle, you can tell where you went wrong. Did I just get torn to shreds by one of the dogs? Okay, maybe I should've been more patient. Stuff like that.

Another large aspect I like about this game is just how well it flows. Going smoothly from one environment to another - gives you a large range of puzzles without it seeming abrupt or forced. It's honestly great. And, it's in this regard, that INSIDE's visual style and design are just on another level entirely. The enemies appear and you deal with them, and even how they progress and change throughout the game too is beyond amazing. It's such a simple concept when put like that but something INSIDE nails. Something I will quickly mention though (it's a part of the trailer so no spoilers here) - the sequence where you have to blend in with the sleepwalkers felt fantastic with the game's flow. It was unexpected but you just have to go with it knowing that one wrong move and you're a goner again. It happens but it's not abrupt. Again, something this game nails. Even despite it being one of the most straightforward parts of the game it's incredibly nerve-wracking. 

Something I feel isn't mentioned enough though is this game's sound design. Every noise and crack and bang is finely tuned to immerse you further into the experience. The dogs barking, the jostling of a chain fence, it's silent when it needs to be, loud bangs fit, the no dialogue - all uninterrupted. 

In conclusion, there are no UI prompts, no minimaps, no score, no timer, and no health or stamina bar - it's immersive and incredibly interesting. As much as I love the narrative of INSIDE and as much as I would love to see it more - it's something that shouldn't be replicated or copied. I'm glad INSIDE has its own, unique story and especially in the way it's presented to you. I just wish other video games learnt from this sort of storytelling.

There is an ongoing theme of escape throughout the game and it has a good storyline that gives away just enough for you to understand the general plot, but leaves enough ambiguity for you to question certain things and fill in the blanks using your own imagination.

through minimalistic worldbuilding that always leaves the player guessing as to what's actually going on, the game creates a somber and threatening atmosphere. this feeling is enhanced by death animations that are quite gruesome, even in the simplistic art style.

as a little boy being chased through a lovecraft-inspired world, you have to solve small puzzles that are relatively simple. the gameplay and controls are also minimalistic, and mechanics are only implicitly explained. 

overall, it's a great experience and makes for a good night's entertainment at 2-4 hours in length. Price might seem a bit over the top, but you should definitely get it on sale.

Great artistic direction, very good aesthetic, photography and ambiance.
Gameplay & puzzles aren't the most blowing or innovative, mostly relies on timing and observation. But the discounted price is absolutely nuts and the overall tone of the game is well worth the coins, sort of a metaphorical dream serving as a critic of modernism and dehumanization. 

Good art piece !

Animation and design wise this is an upgrade from LIMBO. I love how the protagonist is animated here, he feels real despite having no dialogue, he look around when needed and when idle sometimes he'll catch his breath or wipe himself off.
Above all else the animation breathes and I loved that about it.

Puzzles where taxing but fair, there where a couple of gotcha moments that took me right out it at a few points tho.
The ""mermaid"" enemies about 3/4 of the way through where extremely annoying, though those where the only exceptions I can think of.

The story could be interpreted several ways and leave you thinking about it for some time, I have my own ideas on how it's a metaphor for capitalism treating their workers as disposable resources brought to a post apocalyptic extreme.

Not sure if it was intentional but the last segment of the game was extremely funny and cathartic

I wish that I could get that ""first play through"" experience again... also, it left me with questions. many, many questions.. O.o

the sheer depth of every single scene is astounding. nothing ever feels ""flat"".. and yes, I know the game is actually fully 3D. but to capture that feeling this well in a side scroller? that's just beautiful.

top that off with super fluid camera movement, and everything comes together so very well.. not once did I ever think ""oh that's a crappy camera angle"", as one does with so many other games.. it just makes you want to explore every corner, just to see it.

not gonna lie, that got my character killed... many, many, many times. in many, many gruesome ways. but the sights to see along the way, well now, that's the best part! (: oh, yes, and always follow the yellow cables...

honestly though, it made me laugh, it made me jump, it made me ask WTAF (many times).. all with no introductions, no explanations, no dialogue, and yet every moment spoke volumes. I cannot wait to play through this again, and see things I missed before, just like any good book... :)

I can't believe I didn't play it sooner - I didn't enjoy their previous game so I had reservations. At the same time I am in love with Little Nightmares and this game is much more similar to it. I believe it is a must-play for fans of the horror genre, especially at a discount. That being said, it is best to experience this game first while knowing as little about it as possible.[/h1]

Please excuse the poeticism that will follow in this review, but as much as I don't like this style for the most part, there is really no other way to think about this game without losing a key part of the whole.

The game is presented in a carefully modelled and directed 3D environment, but you move only in two dimensions, disregarding depth, for the sake of focus one could assume.

The controls are simple and so are the puzzles, but it doesn't take away from the experience in any way. To the contrary - it seems to ground the game mechanics within it's theme, unlike many other similar games where your protagonist pauses to interact with an overly convoluted immersion-breaking minigame for 20 minutes.

The game doesn't feature any text or dialogue to explain it's story, instead relying on visuals and soundscapes. It makes no effort to ensure that it's plot is coherent. This is probably the most important factor deciding whether someone will enjoy it or not. I did - immensely.

Games are often being called art for completely arbitrary and sometimes even insincere reasons. I think this isn't one of those cases, this title fully deserves to be called a piece of high art. Not even because how painstakingly crafted, planned and directed the experience is or how hauntingly beautiful it looks and sounds. After all, the graphics seem simple, possibly relatively easy to be replicated by others, and the core gameplay is nothing to write home about. But the way this game made me think about it and obsess over it surely deserves recognition. And I'm not alone in this, as there are many people looking for clues, explanations to the mysteries, crafting fan theories and being driven to write long and winded paragraphs about them. While it's interesting and fun to read up on all of these, most of them are purely headcanon, conjecture, unnecessary overanalysis and guess work.

Usually I hate this kind of stuff. I guess the method of hyping people with mysteries was popularized by the TV series Lost, which was probably just a method of covering up for a cheap writing process where the showrunners thought about the plot of the next episode only after finishing the previous one without any overarching plan in mind. I don't think this is the case here, though, as there's no contradictions with some disappointing canon, no lazy writers to steal fans' ideas and no real answers to be found in the first place.

To me, INSIDE is simply a nightmare. Terrifying in it's beauty and hypnotizing it's witnesses, planting seeds in their minds with it's many mysteries. That's how nightmares work - they consume us completely while we are inside them, make us question even the most obvious things and shudder at the thought of the secrets they tease. But when we wake up, we realize the answers will never be found as the whole thing was probably just nonsense, a fever dream and with each waking hour the once fascinating details get blurry and fade into oblivion. Most of them we will forget completely, but the most powerful nightmares will stay with us for years or longer. Even if only as slivers of meaning, strange feelings and alien images ingrained into our minds. Even if not because they touched us on some fundamental level, but simply because of how bizarre they are and unlike anything else we experienced.

And in this strange way, even though it only took a couple of hours, I believe INSIDE will stay with me and haunt my thoughts for a really long time. And despite it being unsettling and scary, I am grateful for that outcome.",1682513710,1682513825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

304430,137299482,76561198049329148,756,82,181,0,181,1681779723,"Lot to say about this game.

I think the first thing I have to note though is the brutality. Because while the game is gorgeous, the world building is spectacular (with no dialogue! Show, don't tell), the puzzles are clever, and the escape sequences are so tightly timed that I tensed up [i]every single time[/i], I HAVE to warn you that it's unapologetic in its gruesome story telling.

INSIDE is not a happy story. It's depressing, dark, and twisted, but most importantly: It's terrifically done. INSIDE had my skin crawling like few games dared to try. But that meant going through with the graphic content to back up the stakes.

I'm going to list a one of the death animations and describe it, but under a spoiler tag. That way if you need the extra info to decide, it's there, but I'm not spoiling anything for somebody just scrolling by. But to note: Some of these wouldn't be as bad if you weren't a [i]child[/i] being killed.

[spoiler] When a dog catches you, there's a full death sequence. It bites you, some tear at you, others snap your neck. And you watch for a couple seconds after you die, so it's just dogs eating your body, or your now limp body hanging from the dog's mouth. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] If adults catch you, you get a couple different ones as well. Strangulation seemed to be the most popular, but I was also beaten with a stick/bat once. Again, disturbing to see an adult beat a child like that. [/spoiler]

ALL THAT SAID:

It's [i]incredibly[/i] well made. The world-crafting is terrifically done, as they make every scene you go through count. Watching the people march along, realizing what this factory does to people here, all through phenomenal visual storytelling.

And the puzzles fit the world perfectly. INSIDE does what LIMBO did, where you create a gorgeous puzzle game with no UI, except INSIDE did it cleaner. I loved LIMBO, but some of it was tough with it being all black. Through INSIDE, they're able to take full control of color design to make the entire puzzle even better. It's easier to tell what you can interact with and what you can't, the context clues are more fleshed out, and the whole experience flows better for it. Mess up a puzzle and you'll be able to catch what went wrong from your first death. It's great that I only have to mess up once, and the death again gives you clues on what went wrong. I stood somewhere too long, I should've let go sooner, whatever it is.

The flow of the whole game feels terrific. I didn't realize how jarring it was to go from a desert to the sewers to ice capped mountains, when suddenly I ran into a puzzle game that flowed the whole way through. There were varied environments to work through, giving you a diverse array of puzzles, but it wasn't just abruptly changing scenery all the time. INSIDE's visual design is on a whole separate level in this regard. The enemies that appear, how you dealt with them, and how that progressed the game were [i]beyond[/i] brilliant as well. I'm going to talk about a part from the trailer, so no spoiler tag here: The part where you have to lock-step with other people was AMAZING mid-game. It happens, you have to go through with it, and eventually you make your way out the other side. But I wasn't ready for it, and it felt like such a fun part of the puzzle to do and experience. It's nerve racking, despite being one of the simplest parts of the game!

Every facet of this game is finely tuned and crafted to make the most of a video game that you can. The dogs barking, the chain link fence jostling, the silence, the loud bangs, all entirely uninterrupted by flimsy stories to justify you changing from the sewers to Paris france even though you were on a mountain. No UI prompts, no minimaps, no score, no timer, no health bar, to bring you that much closer to the piece of art and not the ""video game"" portion of the format.

Sincerely recommend, it sets a ridiculous bar for video game story telling as a format. Other games would do well to learn from INSIDE. Not copy it, but learn from it.",1682465892,1682465892,True,38,0,0.807365298271179199,0,True,False,False

The controls are smooth and the visuals gorgeous, but the game play is lacking. Which would be okay, if the story made up for it, but it doesn't. The story utilizes striking imagery to tell us themes we all already know and agree with. It is not saying anything unique, and doesn't tell its message in any particularly interesting way through game play. Is more of a series of paintings you walk through and by the end I felt like it would work better as a picture book. There are moments of beauty, wonder and horror that almost feel like they are adding up to something worthwhile, unfortunately it never really feels whole.

It has a dark industrial atmosphere, great music and sfx, the gameplay is superb, there are no big glitches or ""smart"" ways to go on, all the things you must do are straight forward and you just have to figure them out.

But what really sets Inside apart is its sense of mystery and intrigue. The game raises more questions than it answers, and the story is open to interpretation. You'll be left wondering what it all means long after you've finished the game.

Overall, Inside is a haunting and immersive experience that will stay with you long after you've played it. If you're a fan of atmospheric games, thought-provoking storytelling, and mind-bending puzzles, then this game is a must-play. Just make sure you have some time set aside, because you won't want to stop playing until you've uncovered all the game's secrets.",1669944514,1681502972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed the blending simplicity or the controls and the game design.

Although the theme of the game was pretty dark, in other ways I truly admired its beautiful & artsy looks/ moments.

It isn't one of those games that you play and you feel great afterwards as it has a gloomy story and head scratching ending, but that's great too!

The puzzles were not very difficult but still mostly felt rewarding to complete them.

I won't play the game again (lasted 2-3 hours) but do not regret playing it at all, and would definitely recommend it.

I was first introduced to this game after watching playthroughs — and I still bought the game myself. Being someone who absolutely loves ambient and puzzle platformer games, this is one of my favourite games of all time. The entire environment is dreary and mysterious while also having the element of puzzles you have to solve. I like games where it makes me think a bit more, so I enjoy that aspect of it. Gameplay is very straightforward — just consists of moving, jumping, and interacting with stuff. Harder parts are the puzzles. Sound and music add a lot to the atmosphere as well — I highly recommend having your volume on for this.

The storyline is somewhat fuzzy as the ending gives way for various interpretations but it generally goes like this: A young boy wakes up in a forest, ventures his way through a town and eventually through a sort of factory where people are being experimented on. I won't spoil the details for the ones who haven't played the game and still would like to. 

Overall amazing game if you are looking for an ambient puzzle platformer!",1681138007,1681138007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Go and check it out. It's a little hard to find ourselves, but you can watch it.

The game has an incredibly clever level flow. That's why this game has managed to become one of my top favorite games. You just dive into the game and the game progresses without interrupting you, just like reading a book.
This puzzle game gives even the basic first steps like jumping or pulling something as a puzzle. It made me think like a complete problem solver. You are exploring on your own.

In general, the story is good, the flow is good, the level system is good (you can start from the beginning of the chapter you want), the mechanics are good (mind control mechanics for example); the ending is unsatisfied (so what happened now, what has that boy become?), there are some questions that need answers but didn't answered (the girl under the sea was trying to kill at first, then why did she save us later?, where did the kid come from at the beginning, what's the system inside, what is that object?)

I went in completely blind with absolutely no prior knowledge of what to expect, and that honestly made the experience that much more fascinating to me. It went from a spontaneous ""well, it's cheap, why not?"" to 5 and a half hours of enjoyment completing the game and finding all the little secrets hidden throughout.

Firstly, the visuals are fantastic. Pretty dark at times, but it never felt like a bad thing. It added to the mystery of ""what in the world is going on here?"" The sound design was also impressive and, as other reviews have said, playing this game with headphones on really gets you immersed in the world.

The concept alone is also captivating. No dialogue is presented or needed, all of your information coming from visuals alone and allowing you to draw your own conclusions. Where is this place? Who's behind it? What's the purpose of these experiments? What is the boy's goal? Normally I'm not one for open-ended plots, but this one truly grabbed onto me and did not let go. I never quite knew what would happen next and it surprised me throughout as the world became more and more bizarre and intriguing.

And lastly is the length and difficulty of the game. I honestly found it to be just right. Not so short that I was disappointed when it was over, but also not so long that it feels impossible to complete in one sitting or like it dragged out. Right when I felt like the perfect time for an ending was approaching, there it was. The difficulty level also felt just right. The puzzles were never so easy that it felt boring or so difficult that it felt frustrating. You do have to think (harder on some levels than others) but it wasn't overdone at all.

Overall, if your kind of game is awesome visuals and sound design with a captivating open-ended story to theorize over and twists that keep you on the edge of your seat, this one is absolutely worth it.",1680522156,1680522156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles were challenging yet satisfying to solve, and the atmosphere was absolutely haunting. I completed the game and unlocked all of the achievements in just three hours, but the experience was so engrossing that I was left wanting more.

What sets ""Inside"" apart from other puzzle games is its thought-provoking storytelling and stunning visuals. The developers have truly created a world that is both beautiful and disturbing, and the soundtrack only adds to the overall immersive experience.

I was also impressed with the incredible value for money that I got with this game - thanks to the spring sale, I was able to purchase the ""Inside and Limbo"" combo pack for such a low price. I can't wait to dive into ""Limbo"" and see what other incredible worlds the developers have created.

Warnings + more detailed review: 

If you have cynophobia, thalassophobia or fear of being chased, only play this game if you don't mind your fears being triggered. The end can be disturbing if you don't like body horror. It's more cartoonish, so I personally managed.
Still, there's a lot of being chased involved in this game, which I don't like, by humans, dogs and creatures I won't spoil. There's much more chasing than in Limbo, which focused on puzzles. Limbo's spiders were cute in comparison.

I also thought the puzzles in Limbo were more elaborate and not as easy. But maybe my memory tricks me. There were some good puzzles here, too, but a lot were easy to grasp for me. With the graphic the game is definitely atmospheric though and I still enjoyed playing it.

It combines puzzle elements with platformer design, and the design is so tight that there are many ""nick of time"" moments which have you on edge that you can pass only by a hair's breadth. Solving each puzzle is very rewarding. If you like games where you explore, combine elements, and solve mysteries, you'll love this one.

The game gets more and more bizarre as it progresses, and builds up to an insane ending. I played the game twice – once to just run through, and the second time, to collect all achievements.

Puzzles are clearly conveyed and satisfying with many feeling like actual devices diegetic to the game world than random contraptions a la Myst.

Game-play wise, this is a relaxing game, with easy puzzles and obstacles, it starts exiting, then it gets a little slow in the middle part (the underwater part) and then it shines again at the end. 
The graphics is average, you have only a few colours since it's always dark and gloomy. 
The music is non-existent, you only hear the sound from the boy running or interacting with the environment. 

This game is all about the story. No doubt this game has a very special, complex story. 
But, what is incredible is the following. While reading the game description, when you see a few pictures of the game, and while playing the game untill the ending, you get a feeling that it's about a boy being chased from a sci-fi high-tech dictatorial regime, being one of the few remaining free individuals that hasn't been enslaved and assimilated. I thought the story is very similar to the matrix movie, with the goal to enter the core of the system to unplug your body and mind from the matrix. 
But, at the end you have a shocking revelation, and you understand that it's NOT about the boy, and the story is not similar to the Matrix. The player is not the boy at all, but something else. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will just say that I really didn't like the twist in the end, and the fact that the story is completely different from what I thought it would be. I thought: ""why on earth did they shift the paradigm from something that is exiting and easy to relate to ( especially if you are interested in conspiracy theories ) to THAT. It doesn't make sense.""
It turns out that the game doesn't even describe the story properly, because most of the things are vague, superficially put out and left to the imagination of the gamer. On the forums players have many discussions about trying to explain the story and there are many theories about it. 
I would wholeheardedly recommend this game if it was about the things I described, but since it's not, I really can't. Too bad, because it's otherwise relaxing and engaging.",1679310425,1679311201,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A young Michael Jackson impersonator ends up in the woods, makes his way to becoming Aquaman and in the end really lets himself go. Probably not the story they were going for but I paid good money so I get to be pretentious with my story telling as well.

This is a beautiful game to experience, but I can't help thinking that it doesn't know what it wants to be.

There are parts that are casual and thoughtful where you can take time with puzzles and enjoy the atmosphere and those parts I enjoyed.

Then there are parts where split second timing is required, with no obvious way to tell what is required until you have died several times. Sections which I struggle with due to age/health and find intensely frustrating and not the slightest bit fulfilling when I finally do manage to do exactly what I should.

Working out what needed to be done was much more interesting than trying to actually do it, when mostly the actions are fairly mundane, but require precision.

It would have been immeasurably better had there been a 'casual' mode with walking/puzzle solving, and an 'action' mode with the platforming and split second guesswork for those who enjoy that, rather than an odd combination that probably doesn't quite satisfy either camp.

Because of some of those sections, there is no chance I would ever want to replay this, but for under £2 I can't complain about that - if I'd paid the original price I would have felt short changed though.

Also note that it is not a long game - 4-5 hours maximum will get you through it, but Steam seems to think all the times I left it running and went and did something else because of frustration at the design count as playing hours!",1679101292,1679101671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is really well made and a very polished and fluent experience, no loading screens, super thick atmosphere with tense/scary parts here and there, fascinating physics and animation system that gives everything momentum and weight, as well as superb set design and lighting. All in a weird, frightening, fascist/brutalism/postapocalyptic world in which you are thrown as this little innocent child.

I don't like puzzle games in general, but fortunately they keep it on the easier side of things here so it's not frustrating, probably comparable to Portal and of course Limbo. It is quite short (took me around 3 hours), but worth it.

I finished the game in about 5h playtime. It is a side scrolling puzzle game with a very minimalistic steering. Just arrowbuttons and the spacebar.

But OH BOY the athmosphere of it! The storytelling. The nifty effects, the visuals... every screenshot is an art nouveau painting. You get immediately drawn in. 

You start out as a boy running in the forest,  you seem to be running/hiding from shady company men and their guard dogs. The further you run the trickier the puzzles get to hide/escape/advance. As you advance you find out more and more about the weird experiments that seem to go on in this company and you will need to use their tech to get ahead. 

All in all the puzzles are quite doable, avid puzzlers might even be a bit underchallenged. But the execution of them and simplicity of handling complex mechanics is just baffling. There are hidden secrets so do consider replay and check every nook and cranny and the end will have you go WTF!

As someone who loved LIMBO, I found that INSIDE takes the concept to a whole new level. While the puzzles weren't the most challenging, they were still enjoyable and kept me engaged throughout the game.

Despite its brevity, INSIDE manages to pack an emotional punch with its incredible storytelling and unforgettable visuals. The platforming is tight, and the overall experience is simply unforgettable. I found myself getting lost in the game's incredible world and didn't want the journey to end.

In conclusion, INSIDE is a must-play for anyone who appreciates a game with incredible atmosphere, stunning visuals, and an engaging story. While the puzzles may not be the most challenging, the game more than makes up for it with its other strengths. If you're looking for a game that will leave you with a sense of wonder and amazement, then INSIDE is definitely worth checking out!

Mechanically, the game is full of relatively simplistic puzzles. Unlike what one might expect, these puzzles don't gradually teach the player things or culminate in a final challenge that calls on the player to demonstrate what they've learned. There's little to say about the game mechanically.

There's also--and this is the more unfortunate and serious criticism--little to nothing to say about the game thematically. Inside clearly wants to say or suggest something about despotic governments, oppression, the devaluation of life by huge systems and so on, but never actually does. One doesn't even get the catharsis of 'revenge' on their pursuers if that's what one was looking toward. 

It's like if you were to watch a wordless Twilight Zone episode which ultimately had no point at all, nothing to say (something anathema to Rod Sterling). There is a twist, and you can try to intuit what that twist means, but beyond plot curiosities, there is nothing there. You move from inside a system of oppression to, at least in a literal sense, outside of a containment building. 

I have to consider this a major criticism because with all this beautiful art and evocative imagery and sound, there is so much opportunity left on the table to actually take the time to try and *say* or even simply *show* anything at all about its subject matter. It's another in a long trend of indie works that thinks that ambiguity is a stand-in for actual courage and intellect in one's art, for the willingness to take a stand on something. 

And, while ambiguity and mystery can be a powerful force in a work, those works still need to have said something along the way before you leave viewers to ponder, not unlike David Lynch's works. Inside makes no such effort. It never works up to anything, either a big, grand puzzle or a punctuating emotional moment. It settles for the kind of low-effort 'storytelling' that people mistake for depth.

So while I can recommend it as a walking simulator with light puzzle/horror elements and an intriguing world (which admittedly cribs a lot from Valve's work on Half-Life 2), I can't recommend it as a thematic experience, story, or really anything that might create a lasting impression on someone beyond its largely neutral imagery.",1678743208,1678743388,False,18,0,0.606550216674804688,2,True,False,False

I liked Limbo a lot, but this in many ways, is very much an improvement on the original. Almost 7 years after its release and this is still a really nice looking game. It also controls incredibly smoothly. The sound and atmosphere created by this game is basically unparalleled. At least, in my experience. If more horror games were like this, rather than resorting to jump scares, I would like the genre so much more.

It's hard to really discuss much about this one without spoiling anything. In fact, my favourite part of this game is a complete spoiler. Though, anyone that's played it will know what I'm talking about. I think the only way that this could be considered inferior to Limbo is the fact that the puzzles were overall easier. In my experience anyway, as I never looked up any solutions for Inside. Though, I liked that there was less trial and error deaths during Inside. I'm not sure how much harder or easier the hidden collectibles could be, because that's never my focus when playing a game.

I urge anyone that can stand a little creep factor and is not completely averse to puzzles to give this one a try. Wait for a sale if you must, but this 4-hour experience was worth the full price of admission.",1678584400,1678584400,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

INSIDE is one of those gems every one should put on their radar (and this comes from a person who disliked Little Nightmares). I’m not a fan of puzzle-platform games with trial and error gameplay but this one is quite forgiving and easy, making room for lesser frustration. Briefly, INSIDE’s strongest points are its linearity, simple controls and delightfully spooky atmosphere as well as the creativeness of the puzzles.

The gameplay is more focused on puzzle-solving than survival so instead of introducing ”sh*t your pants” type of scares, you’ll be immersed into a creepy, atmospheric world with artistic graphics and ideas that will chill you to the bone. That is to say, there is still a bit of sneaking and escaping, and you must have an understanding of the perfect timing to make a successful getaway, otherwise you’ll end up like mushed potatoes. 

Also, the way the game’s narrative conveys itself without words is mind-blowing. Despite the main character’s silence, I sympathized with him very much – there’s no need for words when you see the world around him. So I recommend INSIDE for basically everyone out there. It’s short and while it gets a bit repetitive towards the end, it’s worth every cent.

The gameplay consists of solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles by manipulating the environment and interacting with various objects and creatures.

One of the standout features of ""Inside"" is its stunning visual design. The game's art style is simplistic yet incredibly effective, using a dark and moody color palette to create a sense of unease and tension. The attention to detail in the environment is also impressive, with every area of the game feeling meticulously crafted and full of hidden secrets.

The game's sound design is equally impressive, with an eerie and unsettling soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's visuals and atmosphere. The game also uses sound cues to great effect, helping to guide the player through puzzles and alerting them to potential danger.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of ""Inside"" is its storytelling. The game tells a captivating and mysterious story without ever relying on exposition or dialogue. Instead, the story is told through the environment and the player's interactions with it, leaving much of the interpretation up to the player.

Overall, ""Inside"" is an outstanding game that successfully combines innovative gameplay, striking visuals, and a captivating story to create an experience that is both thrilling and thought-provoking.

Due to the nature of the game and its short play time I would only recommend this game at a steep discount and only to those who do not being killed time and time again before getting a puzzle right. Inside might not be for those wanting closure at the end of a game too.

More Details: The game's controls are a little too fluid and imprecise. With some of the tight spots some of the puzzles put you in, it can get annoying to be killed by controls that are subpar. The 'story' of the game is left open to interpretation. While that is not a huge detractor to me, a little more explanation of what is going on in the game would have been nice. 

The art and music of this game carries it. Though a somber palette of colors is used through the game, there were scenes that amazed me. The music is minimalistic, but is skillfully used and matched to each section of the game to give them much more impact. The puzzles of the game take a little thinking, but none of them were unfair. I cannot say the same for some of the early chase sequences. The abundant save points kept some parts of the game from becoming frustrating.

I would recommend Inside only to people who like this style of game.",1670724838,1677806655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was worried that this game would frustrate me like Limbo did, but my friends suggested I give this a shot anyways and man I wasnt disappointed!

Other disclaimer - doing some game design homework and publishing it here as a sign of completion, dont expect this to be too coherent.

#SPOILERISH OF COURSE!

Boy this game really sets the tone fast with a close-up, dark, intimate view of watching a child (you) being suffocated. You really feel them too, whether you are being harpooned or torn apart by dogs, they are very visceral in a way that most other games dont manage.

Not only is it (imo) prettier than Limbo, the sound design has also improved. It is mostly ambient, environmental noises that still manage to sound menacing. You as a character are very quiet, you only hear your own footsteps and breathing. All of the other sounds are the environment, which can be read as: things that can definitely kill you. Speaking of, because of the visuals and the sound, it is extremely tense when you are being chased by someone/something. I cant remember the last time I held my breath because I was so unsure if I was going to escape my pursuer.

So indeed there is still some Limbo-esque ""youll have to die to figure out what to do"" due to lack of hints visible before dying once or twice. However, the clues feel way less obtuse, and the clever use of light and sound to gently guide you in the correct direction, since this game gives you a bit more freedom in movement than Limbo (several floors of a building, for example). One more little Limbo-like complaint - near misses when jumping still happen, still set you back progress-wise, and are still annoying.

After dying a few times, it really began to feel like death (more specifically how you were killed) was a feature, not a bug. They actually use the way in which you die as a storytelling mechanism. Getting impaled by some weird surveillance robot with an electric cable as a harpoon made me think of this. They use it to color in the world with details you would otherwise miss if you never died throughout the game.

So to talk briefly about the story: I have no clue. This game is super mysterious, and it does such a good job of teasing you, getting your interest, and then never actually revealing the thing that got you so curious. In most games that would just be frustrating, but here, it adds to the sense of mystery even more, making you even more eager to plunge deeper. Once I finished the game, I still had no clue what occurred. I had a million hypotheses, but no strong sense of what happened, and I actually think that is desirable for this game. Everything hinged on your curiosity as a player, and the mystery of the game world. It left me thinking about it, as opposed to how I feel with most other games, which is more along the lines of “done, whats next?”

Even though I watched the last third, I still feel like this game has made quite an impression on me, and most likely a more enduring one than any other games I will play in the near future. Highly recommended.

# **Discuss a meaningful moment of gameplay**
When the game opened up and it felt unbelievably vast and intimidating, moreso than any other game that I can think of in recent memory, maybe ever (even games with technically larger physical scales). It felt so lonely and empty and ominous, it was excellent. You felt like you were completely naked in front of a crowd of your worst enemies and they'll surely tear you to pieces. 

### What did I think? What did I feel?
I felt so small and vulnerable, like I was helpless in such a large, demanding environment. I felt possibly the most vulnerable I have felt in a game before. It just seems so bleak and impossible for you to resist in a place like that, after so many gruesome deaths, after barely being able to open doors myself. This vast space also added to the mystery - am I still underground? Where the hell am I anyways? Always more questions.

### What are the underlying mechanics that made this work?
Deliberate vulnerability on the part of the player-character. Throughout the whole game, we are made to run away from hunters, dogs, mermaids, scientists, environmental hazards, etc. You are a small child, in a world that is almost always bigger than you, but they take that 

### The dramatic aspects?
There is danger everywhere. Everything is a threat. Even in the sound design - our character is silent, the only sounds are the machines we manipulate and alllll of the various things trying to kill us. Our character is a child, the perfect example of innocence and vulnerability. 


[hr][/hr]
# Dig deeply into the choices I made, and what I thought and felt during those choices.
Does the player have any agency in this game? I never felt once like I actually had any choices in the game. It was always: solve puzzle, move up, rinse and repeat. 

### What game mechanics support those choices?
You don't have a choice by design - this fits the narrative since it deals with free will. 

### Why do certain mechanics exist in this game?
Minimal mechanics exist for the character, they have to augment themselves with machines and mind control devices just to navigate and survive in this world. Who did that blob of flesh control? My character is limited to increase perceived vulnerability. The ways in which we survive/grow stronger further the narrative.",1677656160,1677656160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One thing they could do to make the game bette rto be is to add commentary or a little more action because it would be a hit if they did. It would be like Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, if they added commentary/words etc!

Regarding the game, I found the main story line and the puzzles fairly straightforward.

After that, I started to pay more attention, and I found about half of the remaining ones. On my second play-through, I got the others ones, but there is no way that I would have found some of them without guided help.

This is even better than Limbo, imo. The dark, weird and creepy atmosphere within the game keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.
The best thing however about the game is it's story. Much like Limbo, the story is can be interpreted in anyway we want it to make sense. Without going into any spoilers, my understanding is Inside has two stories. The literal story of a boy solving puzzles to try to escape (or get into) a secret facility, and a philosophical story about the society (how we're all just puppets in someone else's story). 
The ending is confusing at first. But if you have no problem with spending another 30 minutes to get the secret ending (you can get it by going back to previous levels and collecting all the orbs), the story will start to make sense a lot more.
The game can be completed in less than 5 hours, and I loved everything I experienced during that time. The art style, background score, well thought-out puzzles... it's clear that the developers put so much effort into this game and I'm glad it got the recognition it deserved.

A couple of bad points; I can say that it is relatively short and leaves a lot of question marks in the head. While the game doesn't answer the questions ""who are we, where are we and why are we running from"" at the beginning, it also doesn't answer them when it's finished. The obscurity, the mystery is nice, but I wish they could at least answer a few things that need explaining.

I didn't like Limbo that much. It was a decent Puzzle platformer in it's first half and then, when I had seen enough of the art style after an hour or so, the game slowly became boring and ultimately even frustratingly annoying towards the end. So I had very reserved expectations towards Inside and at first I thought it would be even worse than Limbo. After a super-tense and serious start in a forest, I came to a farm after 5 minutes and got stuck in a barn. [spoiler]It turned out that I had to lure some fluffy baby chickens that were following me around to a machine that would violently suck them in and shoot them at a box higher up, so it would fall down and i could use it to climb over a wall. I was speechless. All I could think was ""Am I playing Inside or some f*cked-up version of Angry Birds?"" [/spoiler]. The game started super-tense and serious, you are running through a dark forest, chased by mysterious people, who shoot you on sight or drown you in puddles if they get to you, and then: ANGRY BIRDS! Sometimes those comical moments, wether they are intentional or unintentional, do make you chuckle a bit, but they also stand in harsh contrast to the super-serious and dark tone of the game.

Fortunately, moments like that are very rare in Inside, but nevertheless they make the game involuntarily funny at some points. It's weird. But after this initial frustrating face-palm moment, the game got gradually better and actually wasn't that annoying at all. In contrast to Limbo, where the artstyle gets old after no more than 15 minutes, Inside's visuals are actually  varied enough to stay interesting for the whole game. It's overall art style and design is even creepier than Limbo's and it has some stunning scenery here or there. A huge additional plus is the rest of the presentation: The animations are very detailed and life-like, the sound and ambient music are sparse but good and the controls are smoother, too.

However, what made Inside so much better than Limbo is it's general leveldesign. Contrary to Limbo, Inside really makes you want to know what all this weird sh*t is about in the end. The world of Inside is so much more interesting, captivating, creative and fun to explore and the difficulty curve is much more consistent all the way through to the end. Limbo's puzzles devolved more and more into annoying reflex-tests and frustrating, overly-precise platforming towards the end, but in Inside there is none of that sh*t. Sure, you won't solve some of the puzzles without a basic sense of timing and at least rudimentary platforming skills, but it never gets frustrating. Inside is all about just using your brain properly, like every good puzzle game should. Instead of just getting increasingly harder, the game is more about it's atmosphere. Actually, the puzzle that took me the longest time, was the one I mentioned above, right at the start of the game. It stays at this level of difficulty and once you know what the game wants you to do, every puzzle and platforming section in the game are perfectly solvable. If you push through all the way, you'll get rewarded with one of the craziest, weirdest and also kind of funniest endings I have ever seen in a videogame.

In the end I'd say: Limbo is overrated, Inside is art. Of course, Inside too is definitely not a game for everybody. You have to be somewhat open-minded to its style and willing to use your brain and think about stuff. If that doesn't sound deterrent to you, then I'd say try it out. Even if you didn't like Limbo, Inside could nevertheless turn out at least decent for you. However, despite it's very short playtime of about 3.5 to 4 hours and minimal replay value, Inside currently sells for 20 Euros at full price, which is just an insult. 50% discount is definitely the way to go here!

[h3] 📑 Description: [/h3] 
 
Inside is an adventure side-scrolling puzzle game where your objective is to survive, solve puzzles and explore a beautiful mysterious world.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★☆☆
 
I'd honestly not rate this a three-star, by simply the fact that walking, jumping, and solving puzzles is the main thing about this game. The world feels unique and well-designed, offering you challenging, but not impossible levels that have an incredible flow.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★ 
 
I've enjoyed this game from beginning to end. I think it's an incredible game in all aspects and for being a short adventure as this one anybody can pick up, enjoy and put down in a few hours.
 
[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
This game has an incredible presentation, with beautiful settings, lighting and shadow effects, and beautiful minimalist art direction.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
Sound in this game is incredible and well thought out. From moment to moment, you are engulfed in eargasmic sounds going from footsteps, thumps, underwater sounds, and sounds of engines that describe so well each area. It was an incredible experience and I really wish the music would sip in more in some areas because it was incredible.
 
[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
Despite not being a single bit narrated, this game has an incredible short story where you play as a little boy trying to escape from what looks to be a facility that indoctrinates people. Your journey takes you through some incredible moments with an incredible finally that has unexpectedly made me want more.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3] 
 
☑️  Short (1-8h)
🔲 Medium (8-15h)
🔲 Long  (15-25h)
🔲 Very Long  (25h+)
🔲 Unlimited 
 
In between my session, I took a few couples of minutes' break and the game idled. But in general, from what I know the game should take no more than 4-5 hours.
 
[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3] 
 
🔲 Easy 
☑️ Normal 
🔲 Hard 
🔲 Brutally Hard 
🔲 Impossible 
 
The game offers here and there challenging, but not too difficult puzzles, but in some areas you're required to think carefully for your actions. Anybody could and should pick this game.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3] 
Inside has been an incredible short adventure that left me incredibly sad after finishing it. Not because of the story, but because it wasn't long enough for how incredible this game is. The presentation, to sound and beautiful ragdoll effects make this for the perfect short, but incredible story that forever will be up there in terms of adventure games. Developers have worked hard and deserve every credit for such an well presented game worth every penny.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

you have to own the nazi. become one, practically. no, wait ... never mind. the game is about ownage! it is about control!

Music and sound effects are all very well done. There is a section in the game where the music meets the pulsing sound effects in the background and it is just perfectly done. One of my favorite moments in gaming.

The story is a mystery from the beginning. You may find yourself searching message boards for the answer to some story elements. I would have prefered the story to be a little less convoluted. Really the only weak link to this otherwise great game.

This game is the first example I offer up not just in support of the ‘Video Games as Art’ argument but also of the notion that great art doesn’t need to also be inapproachable. The mechanics of INSIDE are simple enough that they allow for even beginners to pick it up and have an enjoyable experience. Its game length is not overly long that people short on time may never see that ending. Yet its themes – should you choose to ponder and speculate about them -  are so universal and completely open to interpretation that no two people could have the exact same experience. 

If anything, the greatest testament to this game’s brilliance is that even six years later, I still find myself thinking about it now and then.

I have this feeling that when this game was mapped out, the devs had this one really cool scene in mind - if you've played it, you know the one I mean - and were having a real head scratcher trying to figure out how to justify charging $20.00 for that, so they slapped another 3.5 hours of content together, had their 5th graders take a crack at some puzzles, and congratulated themselves on a job very well done.

I paid $2.00 for this game, and while I cannot say that this is a lot of money, what I will say is that I could probably buy 6 McNuggets for that same price. While McNuggets are not always good, based on my past experiences with them and my past experiences with Inside, I think that I probably would have had a better time overall with them. So if we consider that maybe 15-20 minutes of this game is (from my perspective) worth your time, we're looking at a ratio of 2 dollars to 15-20 minutes. If I told you that you could watch MOST of an episode of Community if you gave me two bucks, you probably wouldn't take me up on that offer, so why would you take up Inside?

The moody, dystopian environments are such an incredible balance of fantasy and brutal realism. It didn't take me long to lose myself in the world. Not a single word of dialog is spoken, and yet a story unfolds with such a great sense of pace and nuance. 

The art direction in this game is absolutely top-notch. Carefully crafted environments breath unsettling life into the world. The desaturated world around your young male avatar does a fantastic job of painting with light, shape and silhouette. I also found the animation, particularly the character animations, to be wonderfully fluid, with weight and friction. Pushing and pulling objects in the world, jumping, climbing, all had a great tactile feel to them. The platforming and puzzle solving isn't going to challenge you beyond your patience, but it's just challenging enough to keep you interested and involved in the subtle story being told around you. 

The sound design is another aspect that should be taught in a master class. The minute differences between footsteps as you run on mud or loose gravel to the soft pitter-patter of footsteps on wet concrete, all have a natural realistic feel. Every sound is as it should be. And the way the environments play with the acoustics of each sound element is chilling and immersive. 

Inside is a short game, but it is definitely worth the purchase. It's creepy and disturbing, and leaves you with eerie imagery that stick with you forever.  

It's hard to put into words how a game like Inside goes above and beyond. Implementing such care and attention to detail, and it simply must be played to understand the meaning of the game, as an art piece, or a day-in-the-life of a  young protagonist trying to survive this parallel dystopian universe. It's all so damn beautiful and carefully crafted. Definite Orwellian 1984 vibes play-out in the environments and the mood.

In my opinion, Inside should be placed in the Video Game Hall of Fame for it's beautiful attention to detail and silky smooth execution.

Don't watch playthroughs. Just go play.

304430,129322020,76561197983290992,0,68,248,0,248,1672042538,"""Inside"" makes no bones about what it seeks to be: an evolution of the ideas first presented in ""Limbo"". Playdead took the notions from their debut and further expanded upon them, making an output that feels more polished and actually much more enjoyable. It's an economical game that is eerie, surreal and immersive, if also not perfect.

Like its predecessor, ""Inside"" is a side-scroller, and you move to the right for most of the time. The world however is now rendered in 3D, which conveys better the places you're at. Environments can also directly interact with the player, in that some characters in the world may break from the background and come after you. The game is minimalist in almost every aspect: the music, the faceless models, the visuals, the plot, and most importantly, the controls: you only use the arrow keys to move, and right control to grab objects. There are some underwater sections, as well as a couple of vehicles, and this game pulls all of that nicely.

You encounter different kinds of obstacles - some of them will obligate you to further explore your surroundings. But the game has the same issue of ""Limbo"", which is to punish players for doing something wrong, except that we may not even know what we're doing wrong. You walk into a place, die, and then you have to observe what you did, so you won't die again. If this trial-and-error was something that would happen sometimes, that would be tolerable, but it's a core element of the gameplay: so often, I would die again and again, until I learned what I would have to do. And it would get to the point of frustration.

Let's compare this to a more successful example of puzzle design: ""Half-Life"". In that game, players would come across these situations in which they would have to read the room to figure what to do, and where to go. Sometimes, players would have to do some experiments with the environments and the tools at their disposal, but very rarely those would be situations that would outright kill the players if they did something wrong. The game would also sometimes give players a visual hint of what to do or what to avoid.

On the other hand, ""Inside"" has these puzzles that, even after I figured them out, I would often feel bummed out with the way the game treated me, instead of feeling triumphant. Of course that many puzzles are clear at first: if you're sneaking in the woods and there are some guards walking by, you wait for them to clear off. If a massive door opens and people start walking in, you have to wait behind a crate instead of dragging it. If there are massive shock waves that can destroy things, you seek shelter from them. But at one point, there were these sirens that followed me underwater, and dealing with them was very annoying, for I had to die to learn what to do.

The game has this unbroken progression of events, and the places seamlessly lead to one another - it reminded me of ""Far: Lone Sails"". There are these moments when I had long walks in large ambients, without much happening, which I guess were these moments of ma for players to absorb the scenarios and try to put together what's going on. The game escalates into the final stretch, which is at the same time disturbing, absurd, grotesque and even a bit funny, almost as if it belonged to a David Lynch movie. I don't mean to spoil anything, but I'll say this much: at the closing chapters, I felt the puzzles were much more well designed, ditching the punitive nature of previous puzzles.

At one point, you'll see these zombie-like humans that can be controlled with mind-controlling helmets, and at some points, these zombies will even follow you, stumbling around and helping you to jump longer and higher, breaking your falls by grabbing you (and I have to say: those guys are so wholesome).

Like in ""Limbo"", it has secrets for players to uncover, which are these hidden orbs that need to be unplugged - in fact, all the achievements in this game are about them, the 14 of them. Some are actually fairly easy to find if you don't mind going the other way, but as you move forward, these secrets become harder to find. In the end, if you unplug all the orbs, you'll have an alternative ending, which you get by returning to a level.

The game is visually superb: right from the get-go, you can see it's an Unity game. The visuals are simple and greyed out, and the world is bleak and truly dystopian. Because these are not the silhouettes of ""Limbo"" anymore, the portrayal of deaths is more violent, but not quite distasteful. Which is good, since you may die a lot playing the game - the shock wave death even made me chuckle a little. And speaking of which, the sound design and soundtrack are absolutely spectacular, at tense or calmer moments.

In the end, for all the frustrations I had with ""Inside"", I really enjoyed my short time playing it - a little over four hours. It is a casual game, but casual games aren't often this deep and unnerving while being so quiet and understated. It really made me feel interested in Playdead's next game, how they'll improve this formula even further, or if they'll try something new altogether. But I learned that their next game will be published by Epic Games, and it most certainly will be an Epic Store exclusive forever.

So have a nice life, Playdead.",1672047639,1673016327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1672975849,1672975849,True,1,0,0.393939405679702759,0,True,False,False

The puzzles are not so easy as to be boring but not too difficult to be frustrating. I loved the mystery and suspense in the story, while at the same time I found it a very relaxing game. It was just what I was looking for - a self-contained short-ish game that I could take a few hours out to relax with. I actually enjoyed it so much I played it twice for the secret ending, even though you don't have to play it all the way through to get it.

My only criticism would be that I found the ending(s) a bit lackluster, but it seems to be the type of game that's meant to make you think about its message/meaning rather than be overly showy. Overall, if you like 'Little Nightmares', I think you'll enjoy this game. (Also, I recommend playing it without finding out much about it. It's more fun to watch it all unfold.)",1672418094,1672418153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1st  - I bought this game initially on IOS/iPhone 5C (around 3€) back in 2017 and got 100% completion.

2nd - I bought the game (again) ""Limbo/Inside game pack"" (11€) back in 2019 on Xbox One and got 100% completion.

3rd  - I bought the game (again) on Playstation4 (5€) back in 2020 and got 100% completion (and found out/did the hidden ending).

4th  - I bought the game (again) on PC/Steam this year (5€) and got 100% completion (and did the hidden ending again).

5th  - I bought the game (again) on Nintendo Switch (2€) recently and ... (still haven´t played it...yet. But I will).

- - - - - - - - 

I hope we get more games like this instead of ""Assassins´s Creed´s"" and ""Cyberpunk 2077´s"" and ""Call of Duty´s""  (...) On sale it´s a must on any gamer´s library.

The actual world building on the other hand is. Far more tragically the gameplay/puzzle design isn't just amateurish, it's objectively really horrible. Most of the time the puzzles are mundane and failure comes from trying to do something too fast and then you'll have to just be slow about it to get it through. But puzzles where death is required for the game to even explain the puzzle you're trying to solve FOR THE FIRST time is bad game design, just REALLY BAD. That's not learning from your mistakes, that's having shown something for the first time after you've ""failed"". At the end of my play I looked at a walkthrough just to figure out what the designers had thought of at a couple puzzles that were badly designed in a different way.

[b]Context[/b] Inside is an atmospheric puzzle platformer. At first sight, it looks and feels very similar to its spiritual predecessor [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/48000/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Limbo[/url] (and any review will necessarily drawn comparisons). But as the game progresses it’s clear that he devs took a considerably different approach. 

[b]Writing[/b] The game follows a boy in a post-apocalyptic world trying to break into some kind of facility where biological experiments are performed. The storytelling is purely visual, as was the case with Limbo, but here much more context is provided in the background events, allowing the player to piece together some kind of narrative. There are tons of different interpretations online, but I don’t think the game was designed to have answers to everything, and it is better for it.

[b]Aesthetics[/b] The game looks and sounds amazing, working together to build an incredibly tense atmosphere. The design is less abstract than Limbo, but still minimalistic and bleak.

[b]Gameplay[/b] In essence, the mechanics are rather simple, it’s a physics-based platformer, but very smoothly implemented. It is similar to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/48000/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Limbo[/url] in that regard, but with less action sequences and precision jumps, which also makes it slightly less challenging. However, these simple mechanics are used in more creative ways and result in some memorable chapters. [spoiler]By mid-game there’s an amazing sequence chapters (the submarine, the horde of zombies, the blast zone).[/spoiler] Finding the secret areas is harder and requires more out-of-the-box solutions.

You can, and will, die a lot and in varied ways, but you’ll just respawn in a close checkpoint. The game autosaves in each checkpoint. There is no undo but you can restart chapters (although as far as I can tell there are no deadends).

[b]Value[/b] It took me about 5h to complete the game and the achievements [spoiler](including the secret ending)[/spoiler], which is kind of short. There is a single progress slot, but you can revisit previous chapters from the menu. There is an alternative, secret ending. Achievements are related to finding secret areas which involve more challenging puzzles and interesting areas that add to the story. They add up if you revisit chapters, so there is no need for multiple playthroughs. The game is linear, but to me it is replayable just for the experience.

It has an amazing feel to it and the visual + literal themes are very compelling. Besides the striking beauty and clear intention of every object and color from the foreground to the background, the puzzles are comprehensive and do not feel repetitive - they are meant to teach you a technique that you then expand on, which is fascinating and adds to the buildup of the actual story, which is rich in and of itself. No dialogue means you have to pay a lot of attention to what is going on around you, making the game very immersive. Even though the main character doesn't speak, you start to get a feel for who he is and a sort of connection with him throughout the game. My only complaint I could think of was that the main ending is very open-ended and does kind of feel like the game was cut short - I was actually spamming every key in the small repertoire of keys you CAN use because I thought my game had frozen or glitched and it was just a cutscene. As far as open-ended up-for-interpretation endings go, it's a pretty good one - I'm not going to say anything, but it is pretty poetic to look at and think about. I just wish the game was longer, it took about 3 hours for me to get through the actual game and probably another hour and a half at most for the extra content.

Graphics are excellent, sound design is also great. Puzzles are really creative, most are pretty easy but some will have you scratching your head for the solution. Playthrough takes about 5 hours.

The graphics are top-notch and silky smooth but felt a little bit too foggy and repetitive. The minimalist soundtrack is atmospheric, low-key and ambient which is quite befitting, but it could have done with a bit more oomph in my opinion because it just made the game feel even more boring.

Or you might be a childlike representation of your own innocence, trapped in a literal nightmare world fashioned from the soulless guts of corporate capitalism. Or it's something about the ephemeral and delicate nature of friendship.... honestly, I have no idea. But it is fun!

Good:
 - Atmosphere, dark and broody may it be, is an absolute delight, Very pretty even in all the gloom, and has excellent attention to detail.
 - The controls are nice and weighty (reminds me of OG Prince of Persia) and the puzzles are fun and rewarding (though not very difficult at times). Physics touches are neat too, especially in later stages.
 - A game to be sipped from, not ran through at top speed. Soak in the world, and the game will find ways to tug at your emotions.

Meh:
- It's short. I finished in 4 hours.
- If you have strong phobias about dogs or drowning this might not be your jam.
- Sometimes the challenges are just traps, so you'll die to them once and then know to avoid it next time.

Bad:
- Expensive, considering the length of the game.
- Zero doggos who want to be your friend! They are all mean. Not one is a goodest boy or girl. Would be unplayable except you can make other friends that are not-doggos.

I recommend it as an entry game or as a new experience, either way.

The game's atmosphere is paradoxically comforting and agonizing. The mysterious air that haunts you throughout the gameplay (and that makes you continue to have doubts even after finishing the game) allows us to dive into our own imagination, to try to understand what is happening and, above all, what will come next.. For sure, a very unique experience =)

Regarding the technical details, the game has an excellent performance, with a simple optimization. I believe that the price is fair and that it is a good option for lovers of games with mysterious theories, puzzles and a certain air of minimalism.

The title isn't very long, but it's one of the best 2D adventure/horror games I've ever played. It is very detailed and every second of the game shows how much care they put into making it. The gameplay is NEVER repetitive. Each section of the game features unique gameplay stages that will never repeat again, making it very diverse. There are unique animations that are used once, and this shows the keen attention to detail this game has!

304430,127732084,76561198049715525,144,6,186,0,186,1669949208,"The devs thought of some FANTASTIC concept art. They came up with an excellent aesthetic for a game. Apparently they considered that enough, because the gameplay is tedious and the plot is nonexistent. The start of the game is so compelling. You play a mysterious boy running through picturesque moody environments with minimal color, as guards attempt to hunt you down. Who is this boy? Why is he being chased? What happened to him before, and what is his goal? No answers.

And I mean it. No answers. There's the popular trend of games that give only vague hints for a story, requiring you to piece together what happened through anything from item descriptions to environmental storytelling. Some of those games are pretty great, and some consider the experience of piecing it together rewarding. Some hate it, because they think there's no real lore and fantheories aren't a substitute for plot. Turns out, INSIDE is what you get when there's ACTUALLY no lore behind things and it's fully left up to fan theories.

The problem isn't that it's vague. The problem is that a game's ideas should tie together elegantly, and this is true regardless of whether it uses detailed text or vague imagery. If the game stuck with its early ideas and provided a compelling conclusion, then it would have been satisfying. Instead, it introduces idea after idea, until they start to feel like non-sequiturs, complete with an ending so utterly ridiculous that it was hilarious. You can make up explanations for all of it, but that makes you impressive, not the game.

If you look at the wikipedia pages for Dark Souls or Hollow Knight, the plot sections will tell you the actual lore. Lore that might not be obvious to the casual player; a taste of what those fanbases have uncovered. On the other hand, INSIDE's wikipedia page lists a literal play by play of what you do in the game. Because there really isn't anything else to say. The problem here is that the ideas themselves, at least the ones shown early on, are compelling enough to make you WANT to see more. It doesn't have to be a text dump of explanations, but just something that ties back in to the game ideas.

When a game like this gets criticized, the response is often ""you just have to be able to appreciate abstract ideas, to piece it together yourself, to take in the worldbuilding rather than need a narrative."" I think that's an absolute copout. There are excellent games that fit that description, and those who dislike INSIDE can dislike the execution of that approach, not the fact that it went for it. Having several separate ideas that don't connect or even allude to each other in interesting ways isn't how you make an interesting world, it's how you fail to make one. Being inexplicable is not a virtue; being interesting is, and INSIDE fails to be the latter because it doesn't even treat its own ideas with enough respect to say anything about them, much less treat the player with respect.

You can think of a genius theory that explains everything for, well, anything. I've seen insane fan theories that made Sonic Adventure 2 sound amazing (honestly, look it up, the video is by Khonjin). Of course, no one, much less me, can be an objective judge of what you can or should interpret from a game. But that also means that just because you have a great theory that makes you personally like the game better, doesn't mean it has to be compelling to anyone else. If you love INSIDE and part of the reason you do it because of how much it made you use your imagination, I'm happy for you. But the game itself should be judged on what's there in the game, not what isn't there.

In addition to thinking of art but not a story, they also didn't think of much gameplay. The puzzles aren't awful, but it doesn't develop any of the mechanics far enough to give you real brain benders. I spent more time wandering around not realizing there was a thing I had to interact with, or not realizing where I even had to go, than I actually spent trying to understand the mechanical logic of any puzzles. Deduction and lateral thinking aren't absent, but you wouldn't play this game for them, and they don't offer enough to make the slow running around not annoying.

You know when someone learns a new word and uses it way too much and it annoys everyone? I'm being that bish right now. I watched that new-ish Matthewmatosis video about Context Sensitivity recently and it blew my mind on how much it actually defines the feel of a game. Everyone know the general idea but when you really break down the difference between games that rely on it hard and games that don't, it's night and day. Of course, neither approach is technically bad, but I have my preferences, and I'm about to explain why that's relevant: There's an annoying amount of context sensitivity in INSIDE. Jumping means jumping, at least most of the time, but the Grab button is used for way too much. The uses are varied enough that you don't really think about grabbing things as a physical act, but rather have to conceive of it as a more general ""interact"" that relies more on the vague intuitive idea of how a game wants you to use something than it does the physical act you're having the character perform. This doesn't like, kill the game, in the way that having a nonsense and unsatisfying story does, but it was a frequent annoyance, to have a larger mental gap between controls and actions than I'd prefer, that contributed to the gameplay feeling uninspired and unengaging.

Anyway, idk, 5/10, not really worth your time unless you love the visuals so much that you'll play anything for them alone. Personally, I feel like the visuals tricked me into expecting more.",1669950210,1669953270,False,0,1,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

I am aching to know more about what the heck is going on, [spoiler]but any kind of explanation for the genocide, abandoned urban decay, and human experimentation can't possibly match whatever conspiracy one can come up with in their head. Any explanation would make it mundane, boring. It would bring rules to the world and apply limits to what could possibly happen next.

However, I suspect there ISN'T an in-world explanation. I suspect this whole game, and the whole journey of the protagonist, is symbolic - and thus the world doesn't make any logical sense, and it's not supposed to.
What is it symbolic of? Well, I have my theories, but frankly I have no real idea, and I don't think anybody else does either.
I'd love for the developers drop some hints or confirm/deny fan theories, but I'm not holding my breath.[/spoiler]

As a game, it's a bit rough. Bounding boxes are large - plenty of times I've had enemies shoot me through walls [spoiler]or grab me while clearly outside the water (if you've played it, you know exactly who I'm talking about)[/spoiler]. Some of the puzzles have unforgiving timing or require precision maneuvering. I suppose this is to ratchet up the drama/blood pressure, but having to redo a puzzle a dozen times because I couldn't get the timing down is more frustrating than fun. The protagonist is slow and stumbles about, will cheerfully drop off ropes and handles without warning, and run right off into voids at the slightest button press.

That said, gameplay isn't the point at all. This isn't CS:GO - the point is the world and the story, not having hyper-tuned mechanics for maximum control. Even when you're just riding an elevator, the state of the world around you is whispering history and events.

Is it worth a play-through? Absolutely. Put on the headphones and turn down the lights for the maximum experience.
[spoiler]Most people will be able to complete it in one or two sittings, depending on their tolerance to frustration. There is zero practical replay value.[/spoiler]",1669784653,1669784653,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was the kind of place that attracted older people. You know, a place that is small enough for an old barnacle to get around but large enough to get everything you need on your shopping list. The place had a few managers at the time, one of them a 50+ y/o guy called Pat. Pat was the kind of guy who loved to tell you about the sports cars he owned and never passed up an opportunity to explain to someone how car companies design their vehicles to make the light dance across their cool red and blue bodies. I was standing there in the summer heat one day, looking at the car with Pat as he explained how this worked - he had me walk around the car and see the light effect in action ('Pretty cool, Pat' I would say). I'm not a car person. The only car I've ever had some kind of affinity for is my late dad's 280Z Datsun. It don't like it very much anymore after my brother replaced all its parts, cut it up and turned it into an over sized RC car. Anyway, I'm standing there with Pat while he talks about the history of automotive aerodynamics and I'm itching to get home to play INSIDE. I played the first half of INSIDE before going to work one day and finished it when I returned home. A couple of months later I went to a friend's house for a party and talked about the game with someone I'd known in passing from high school.

I found that compared to the previous game Limbo(previous installment by Playdead studio), though the puzzles were challenging, it doesn't take much time to figure them out and finish the game in one entire seating. I felt that this game has an overall darker( includes blood and more gruesome ways to die )theme than the previous one. It's smart use of camera angles, playful mix of shadows and lights throughout, pushes you to pause take a breath, move the character around a bit, record and take a screenshot.

Some small nits and picks which i believe could have made the game slightly better. 

When picking up boxes and activating ""rocket boxes"" i believe the animation interaction and response time when trying to select a box and gearing it up to launch was a bit annoying, Sometimes I'd wind up climbing the box and loose time trying to bend down and activate it making it more irritable,

The same problem takes place when trying to enter or exit through small openings or where you have to select (on mac it's the shift button), hold and launch(don't wanna reveal spoilers)

The story of this game always leaves you wanting more, so I'm not sure how players will feel after they finish this game. I haven't played Limbo in years (even though I enjoyed it so much ). The initial urge and curiosity to quickly ace through the puzzles sans perfection dies slowly once you complete it and get to the finish line to see what happens.

No, the visuals aren't even that good, this game falls flat on its face. It's ""story"" doesn't exist, it has a terminal case of ambiguitis. I did not feel anything while playing this game, because a lot of the time I was thinking ""why?"" and ""this was 20$?"" back when this game released in 2016. That view hasn't changed, this ""game"" is still 20$ over 6 years later.
Terraria is 10$, and is way better. Undertale is also 10$, OMORI is 20$.

The gameplay is subpar, even compared to LIMBO, the gameplay and puzzles are subpar. Most of the beginning of the game is being chased, with a lot of it being trial and error. You won't know the truck shoots you, or the branch on the ground trips you. The best parts of the game are with the mind control puzzles and those are a shockingly small section of the game. INSIDE does at least try to change the formula but ""threat management"" becomes 50% of the game instead, which is just as annoying. Hide from x, do thing, hide from x, repeat. It was tedious the second time, because the threat has been dealt with, its just annoying.
Then you get weird and totally random bullshit like why does the girl not kill you after one specific part? If you're caught any time before you die, but when you're forced to be caught she... Ya know what, its not explained why the girl suddenly gives you the ability to breathe underwater. It's just ~~SHOCKING~~ because ""oh look!!! its nothing!""

The ending is terrible, its made entirely for the shock value, the alternate ending is even worse because it makes even less sense.

I think I explained my opinions on this game by just saying: ""Oh look! Its nothing!""

This game is worth 5$, nothing more.",1520731798,1668316994,False,8,0,0.511145234107971191,0,True,False,False

**Achievement notes at the end of this review.[/b]

INSIDE checks the boxes for me after having played LIMBO. What its predecessor seemingly tried to achieve, this game succeeded at greatly. I'll be comparing this game to that experience a bit here - it may sort of double as a review for that game as well.

In a nutshell; is a short, linear puzzle platformer with low difficulty and an atmospheric world featuring an unspoken story.
The atmosphere being sad, intimidating, hopelessness and such fun things.

For the general story and experience, the two games start off very differently despite looking similar. Boy slides into screen and off you go, travelling mostly along a single axis and taking in the minimalistic scenery. But where one starts off in LIMBO and it's essentially a simple from-A-to-B experience with obstacles along the way, INSIDE actually makes you feel like you're (among other things) a little underaged detective.
From beginning to end you bear witness to scenes that may tell you what's happening. Wether or not it'll all make sense in the end remains to be seen until you actually get there, ofcourse. But there's certainly a lot more to it than ""Where is person X? Oh look, person X is on the far right end of this game"".

The puzzles then. Cue a collective ""yeah, duh"" here as I say that this was the most important thing to me that I wanted to see improved after the first game. Where LIMBO seemed to want to punish players for progressing by introducing tedious puzzles to them that required nearly impeccable timing to avoid death in, INSIDE instead looks to reward players who can turn off the overthinking part of their brain and see the simple but clever solutions to its puzzles. There's plenty of opportunities for fatalities but not only so. Not every puzzle has you getting cut up or crushed on failure.

While I appreciated the elements of physics that LIMBO incorporated into the puzzles, the whole game (after the starting levels) just felt like nothing more than a series of painful tests chained together to never really give you a breather or a sense of accomplishment. Too many times a puzzle was retried because one element of it was off by half a second.
INSIDE is a little more forgiving and relies more on, as said above, not overthinking solutions.

This leads to internal reactions of ""Hah, ofcourse! How did I not think of that before?"" rather than ""Feck sake, I figured this puzzle out 10 attempts ago but I'm still dying because I keep grazing that random sawblade"". That may be a poor description but you'll know what I mean when (not if, right?) you play this game. It made me actually appreciate and enjoy the puzzles. Like I said, there's generally a low difficulty but due to HOW the game challenges you, it remains a satisfying experience. And with the addition of new mechanics and interactions, INSIDE knocks it out of the park here.

As for atmosphere, LIMBO with its basic black, white and grey colour scheme was totally fine in my opinion. But it became rather bland after a while with the punishing puzzles just making me feel like a lab rat getting shocked all the time by evil scientists. With INSIDE there's a little more room for the player to marvel at the surroundings. The scope of the facilities, the events, the possible storyline/plot and the interactive experience of the player with the environment and other creatures.

Last but certainly not least important: [u][b]it's short![/b][/u] As a casual player I got through the first game in about four hours, stubbornly throwing myself against lethal objects just to force myself to figure out solutions and timings. This game I beat (finding just a couple of the achievement-linked secrets) in about 3,5 hours. Lots of adult gamers with limited time to play will appreciate finding a game that's actually good, satisfying to play and finished quickly - a session or two depending on your daily/weekly game time. Looking to slowly clear out your backlog? Install this one today, you won't regret it.

In short, PLAYDEAD had a concept for LIMBO and I liked the idea but did not enjoy the execution of it. Then they made INSIDE and fulfilled the expectation that I had in playing the first game. I'm happy to put this game in my personal 'gems' category where it belongs.

[b]**Achievements:[/b] the only achievements are for finding the individual secrets. They are cleverly hidden but easy to find if you keep your eyes peeled and explore a bit. Thanks to the chapter selection you can easily load any specific section of the game so there's no need for full re-playthroughs if you missed any. A guide/walkthrough is not needed and they do not need to be found in order or in a single playthrough.
Spoiler tagged hint to help find them: [spoiler]yellow cables indicate the presence of a secret and will often lead you to them. Some secrets have long hidden paths and others are close to the main path.[/spoiler]

Going into this game I only knew it was the the successor to LIMBO which I also enjoyed, the 2d theme puzzle plat-former. Although, unlike LIMBO, there seemed to be something more going on here.

The 2d/3d feel of the game along with its art style really made it rather enjoyable and definitely satisfied my hunger for a game that provides challenging puzzles along with suspense and awe.

Game good. Game short. You did read other reviews, right? Then shut up and play this game already.





Not spoiler free not short review:

Inside is a beautiful game with both great artstyle and intriguing designed world, story, great puzzles and very good set pieces.
The game is short and sweet so it doesn't overstate its welcome. 
It takes around 4-5 hours to finish and I simple adore the Lovecraftian style ending.

I don't have much negative stuff to say about the game. The game was perfectly balanced in term of puzzle challenge and didn't had any particular annoying moments or bugs.
What I have is couple of personal nitpicks. 

The game is trying to be creepy but I say it could go even further with that concept. 
For example more weird creatures, especially lurking inside water.
Same thing with stuff in the background. Some extra glowing eyes, moving shadows, shapes would be nice there.

Secret ending is stupidly cryptic and hidden not in fun way to unlock it on your own. 
It's basically ""press left or right or up button in right order"" type ""puzzle"" except it's based around fart sound effects coming out of tape and password is hidden in the most random location in the game that no way any average player would even GUESS the real purpose of it while playing the game.

Also this password is always fixed for every single player. 
I think it would be way cooler if password was more randomized.

Achievement descriptions are not enough helpful in finding collectibles. First few was ok but the further you go with the game the worse it gets.

99,9% of players won't even know secret ending exist without reading about it on the internet and 99,9% won't even bother replaying entire game and scrapping every single locations for hours and hours in hope of finding collectibles on their own resulting in simple looking at guides on the internet. 

That is indeed a terrible game design. 
Fun hidden secrets are one thing, cryptic stuff is another but the game litteraly gives you ABSOLUTE ZERO reasons to even search for those on your own without proper hints. 
Yeah, there is sometimes that yellow cable as a hint but more often it's not there or well visible and replaying the entire game just for those is beyond tedious thing to do.





My idea for fixing that huge issue mentioned above:
Inside have pretty deep checkpoint loading system which displayes images of location sometimes related to achievement (sometimes not sadly) and stuff. 
Checkpoints are displayed in a form of small red squares. 

So to hint collectibles locations with them would be displayed as you progress the first playthrough in a form of slightly bigger empty golden squares without filling and collecting the thing fills the square with gold filling (gold because it symbolize a light).

When you beat the game for the first time a new, final big square appears showing you the location of final collectible, allowing you to access the room with it (in the game you can enter it at any time) and just like in the game you need to light all previous lights (aka golden fillings) on wall to get final collectible. 

Collecting the final one display now big panel on the wall with mysterious text hinting the player where to go (aka in game location of secret ending) something like:

""to preserve your incoming doom,
seek the location of red room""

A location that player probably already visited in the past, nearby one of early collectibles.
Right next to this text would be a up/left/right password combination that is fully randomized everytime a player starts a fresh new game or press ""reset game progress"" in options.

In my honest opinion doing this would encourage players to seek those collectibles and secret ending on their own instead of them instantly searching the internet for guides because this is a simple result in creating over complicated cryptic collectibles.

People most of the time WANT to get 100% or to see extra puzzles/content or endings. 
That is normal gamer brain nature.

BUT even tho the game is short, people don't want to spend hours and hours and hours on replaying the game on their own to find those thigs without even knowing if its where, there or not. 

That's why developers should put more effort in hinting those locations to encourage players in searching for them because if the player knows that instead of searching the entire game for one or two collectibles all they need to do is to search those specific locations it makes them more willingly to do so on their own.",1665693601,1665694281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without saying too much, the puzzles are mostly straight forward, but a few of them definitely took a lot of thinking and brainpower xD

This is indeed a perfect example of insanely accurate planning and execution. A game which serves as a workshop itself for gamers and developers on how to create a complete, unique and distinct adventure.

My advice would be to not read this review and to just play.
If you're interested you can find the first minutes of gameplay to ease up your mind on my channel (where I upload the first minutes of the games I review): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W5UDWw5IGY

If you want to learn more, I'll explore some aspects below without telling much of the story.

[h3]Oppressed[/h3]
This word comes to mind when you start. 
If you've ever played Little Nightmares, you'll probably find some recognizable patterns in this game's pacing. 
With that said, Inside manages to bring the atmosphere and sense of stake to the next level, resulting somewhat more original and oppressing.

I can't quite put my finger on it: it may be the desaturated tone, the neverending silence, the masterfully created ambiance. I don't know, but there's a constant sense of danger and discovery which instantly sets you in the right mood.

[h3]Creative Physics[/h3]
Throughout the game you'll come across different type of puzzles, and even though they're really not that difficult, they surely are creative and make you appreciate the effort. I would say that creativeness has been more of a focus rather than difficulty. In fact, everything runs smoothly and rewards you for thinking simple patterns. 

What's interesting is how characters' animations and movements were made. Particularly your character, the child. There's a sense of heaviness and naturality to movements when actions are performed, and it allows for a more immersive and ""desperate"" feel to your constant run towards your objective. 

That combined with the use of ""inverted"" water physics made for an unique environmental experience, even though I would've appreciated more of that (even though I prefer to have less quality experiences than more average ones).

[h3]The Sound Of Silence[/h3]
It really baffles me that the ""silentness"" of Inside is what makes it great. Sound direction is so on point, well layered, dark and heavy that it makes for half the experience. Just hearing the world around you and the strangeness that comes through it is enough to make you invested. 

Even though it may be simple at times, this game's ambiance is unbelievably layered. Some ideas excited me for their originality. Really, really good.

Other than that, you won't hear a single line of dialogue while playing. I'm constantly repeating myself in my reviews, but this subjectively makes for the best experience one could ask for. You've got a world which makes itself believable and interesting without a single explanation. Everything is there and what you see is enough to draw your own conclusions. Inside is just that: there's no menu, no introduction, anything. It's just you, the player, experiencing a slice of time in the bigger picture that is Inside. 

[h2]Closing thoughts[/h2]
Inside isn't a long game. In fact, it'll probably take you roughly 3-4 hours to complete (that is if you walk around and explore with a slow pacing). But it is so intense that you won't be bothered by that at all.

I'm kinda sad that Epic will be Playdead's publisher in the future: this game is the perfect example of creative freedom with a powerful message and clearly shows the developers' intentions all the way through. I hope they'll still manage to surprise us. Funny enough, given Inside's overall meaning, it's interesting to see Playdead being funded and aided by Epic. On a further note, though, publishing games by yourself is hard and can lead to uncertainty on the economic side, so it's no wonder they went this route. I'm eager to see their next project.

With that said, this is an amazing example of what Unity is capable of and, from a developer point of view, the amount of character they managed to squeeze into Inside is really remarkable. Truly one of the best games I've ever played, and it'll be remembered fondly.

Play this game, you won't regret it.

TLDR: I got this game on sale for €1,99. I've never been so glad I didn't pay full price for a game

I went in blind, I knew nothing about this game. I saw it on sale and I gave it a chance. 
First impressions were alright, the game is nice to look at and I enjoyed the atmosphere and overall sound design. 
...aaaand I ran out of positive things to say. 


I can't state this enough though, it took me less than 3 hours to beat this game from start to finish (Not rushing it, I definitely took my time), and I was obscenely bored through the entire duration of it... let me explain

I never felt challenged during any of the puzzles the game throws at you. Most of them are trial and error, or so intuitive calling them ""puzzles"" is generous. Even then, most of the best puzzles this game has are repetitive and tedious.
I won't spoil any of the story but I felt my time had been wasted in the end, I felt it was pointless and ambiguous. 

I didn't absolutely hate inside, but I definitely didn't enjoy it. I think it's worth a buck or two, but I would've been pretty mad had I paid full price for this.
Most of what you're going to be doing is holding right on your keyboard while waiting for something interesting to happen. Also the fact that the default movement is set to the arrow keys instead of WASD was an instant slap in the face, forcing me to remap the controls to my left hand instead for comfort and muscle memory. 

I would honestly tell you to spare yourself playing this UNLESS you find it on a huge sale. 
Inside felt like a chore. I felt the game was wasting my time as I was playing it, which is interesting given how short it was. 
It is aesthetically interesting (mind you, not mindblowing), but not worth its full price.

Inside is the story of survival of a young boy against all odds - physical barriers, dogs, people, and other such adversaries in the game. The gameplay against this narrative comes in 3 flavours, which the game rotates through as you play: escaping adversity, puzzle solving, and spectacle.

Spectacle I have no aversion to - the game nails its art style and atmosphere, and is thoroughly enjoyable eye candy. Sometimes the sections felt a little long to me, but I typically play more action intensive games, so this isn't a great surprise.

Both escaping adversity and puzzle solving are entirely mechanically devoid - that is to say that the challenge isn't knowing what to do and struggling to do it, it's not knowing what to do, but once you work it out it's relatively trivial to pull off. There's nothing wrong with this, it just means the game places its difficulty/challenge in the solution finding. This is important.

The character controls comes across rather out of place in a lot of the escaping adversity sections of the game, where the boy moves at a comfortable jog / light run, despite having a ferocious dog running full pelt behind you with clear intent to kill. This can feel frustrating, because if you don't quite have the solution to the puzzle (but you're most of the way there), it feels like you probably could have survived if the protagonist just put a littttle bit more effort in.This bring me onto the main thing I disliked about these escaping adversity sections in general: they require trial & death to overcome. In my opinion, putting a time limit on solving a puzzle when your life is at stake is not fun, and it's the core mechanic of these parts of the game. It damages immersion in my opinion and makes solving the problems not feel rewarding.

To talk more generally about the puzzles (this also applies to escaping adversity), they are not designed to facilitate first time success / improvised success. Timing windows are narrow where present, and the game does nothing to help or guide the player (hell, it doesn't even tell you the controls when you start playing). In dedicated puzzle sections (those with no imminent threat of death), performing the necessary trial and error ends up being time consuming and slow, primarily due to the size of the environments and how slow your character moves.

The final nit I'll pick with Inside is the size of the environments. Especially frequent during the spectacle sections, you can end up without a clear indication of where you need to go, and thus simply have to run in one direction until you find a wall, and then turn around. The game's achievements lead me to believe there are more secrets hidden throughout the levels, however more often than not I found myself having explored the 'wrong' way intentionally to no reward other than the boring return journey. The game actively feels like it's trying to dis-incentivise this 'explore the other way first' style of play.

To conclude, I did complete the game and enjoy it's ending. I didn't feel overly compelled by the story due to it's obscurity, and was more than ready to be done with the puzzles by the time I got to the end - and that's for a short 3.5 hour game.",1664358007,1664358007,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A few things I’d say I can complain about (again, maybe not faults in and of themselves, but when look at side-by-side comparison with Limbo):
- Limbo has dozens of gruesome ways to die and it was super cool. Not so much here. I mean there are a few spectacular and grueling scenes, but not as many.
- Overall, puzzles are much simpler. Much closer to “figure out how this mechanics work”, rather than Limbo’s “hit a perfect timing”. If Limbo had to be “beaten” (that <5 deaths achievement was real), INSIDE is rather “walked through”…
- That plot twist that happens closer to the end of the game (you know it when you see it)... I don’t know… Creative, for sure… But it feels totally out of character, (being small and helpless in a hostile world)…

I guess i should first say that if you for some reason haven't seen or played Playdead's first game, ""Limbo"", you should really check it out, very similar to the structure Inside has, just going 6 years back in time since Inside's release.

I have a couple of things to say about this game, and i really did not structure this review whatsoever so i'm just going to spill everything how it is on my mind, the first thing i would like to say is that Inside beyond being just a 2.5D platformer is an experience that i would recommend to literally anyone, seriously, if you're checking out this game, buy it, the most interesting thing about this game without any doubt is it's visual story telling, i love how the misterious events of the game unfold on the background, leaving the player to think about what's really happening in the world around our misterious red shirt friend, the more you advance the more questions you will have up in your head, questions with no specific answer, the person playing formulates a meaning to the story of their own thought, which is a charm that i adore of this game.

I sometimes even forgot i was playing a somewhat conventional platformer, which speaking about platformers i also want to dive a bit into gameplay, Inside is a somewhat conventional platformer, however it does play a bit with it's own physics engine, introducing a couple of mechanics that are fun and keep the game interesting, fun and overall enjoyable, due to the game being relatively short, the player won't reach a limit where the mechanics get old and repetitive, keeping it's core gameplay fresh.

The last aspect of inside that i really want to talk about is it's visuals, in all honestly this game looks absolutely beautiful, i don't know how Playdead did it but this game is so aesthetically pleasing, every scenario in this game looks like it's been polished several times to look so gorgeous, real and organic.

So yeah this game is pretty god damn good, recommend buying it on a discount, but i mean i would still buy it at full price no prob.",1617328278,1663828920,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

I'm going to be very honest in this review, I have no idea why this game has as many 10/10's and ""Masterpiece"" ratings that it does. It definitely has some good going for it don't get me wrong, I am recommending it after all (only on a sale though), but there are some very obvious flaws and things that are so underdeveloped or basic that I'm shocked at how high the metacritic score for this game is. At the same time though, the atmosphere and setting are very, very, very well done. They absolutely carry this game from start to end, and I imagine it's why INSIDE has the scores that it does. I can absolutely see people overlooking its shortcomings and focusing only on the atmosphere the game creates. On top of this, the ending of the game is absolutely the best part of the game and is quite fantastic to be fair. Ending on such a high also probably contributes to the high scores but nonetheless, let''s go a bit more in depth to the different aspects of INSIDE.

[h1] Presentation [/h1]

The best part of INSIDE is absolutely its presentation. The world you travel through is dark and mysterious. Very rarely will a bright color appear on screen, and it absolutely nails the mood its going for. The game takes place on a 2D plane but there's fantastic depth to the settings and backdrops. you can see people in the background, and at times the camera will change its angle revealing more of the world, reminding you just how tiny and defenseless you are in this world. The death scenes are long, drawn out, and filled with gore. When you die you really do feel as if you've been brutally murdered, with no hesitation or remorse. The lighting is for the most part very nice as well. At times it did seem to be a little too dark, making things hard to see but this was rare and never impacted gameplay too much. Sound wise, there is very little music, while I understand why they went this route, in order to really make you feel truly alone in this world, there were definitely times where I think some light atmospheric music could have gone a long way. The sound effects such as bones snapping, glass shattering, and dogs barking at you are all extremely well done and add a lot to the game. The game looks and sounds incredible.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

This is where a lot of people may disagree with me but I'm not here to please everyone, I'm here to be honest. The first 2/3 of this game are an absolute bore. First of all the movement speed is soooo slow. It feels like it takes forever to get anywhere in this game, which isn't helped by the fact that there are long stretches of walking in this game. These honestly feel like they are just here to pad out the time spent playing the game, since to be fair there's probably only about an hours worth of quality content in INSIDE and that might be pushing it to be honest. Up until the final few chapters the puzzles are so simplistic and underdeveloped that they might as well just not exist. I can't think of a single puzzle in the beginning of the game that I thought was worth my time. Luckily, as the game progresses the puzzles do get better, and by the end there are a few quality puzzles that while still weren't amazing or anything special were fine enough to not bother me. Unfortunately quite a few puzzles are recycled multiple times, and these are also some of the longer puzzles to do. They often involve running back and forth to avoid animals or staying in the  shadows to avoid light. These tend to be the weaker of the puzzles which makes them being repeated more frustrating. There are some secret collectibles scattered throughout the game to be found, and some of these are quite well hidden so there is some replayability if you look for that. Overall for a puzzle game, it mostly falls short for me. For a $20 game I would hope for a lot more puzzles, and for those puzzles to be of higher quality. At times you can really see the developers start to get creative and have some new ideas but these moments are far too rare sadly. Having said this I don't think the gameplay was the developers main priority. I think that honor would go to the story which we'll talk about next. 

[h2] Story [/h2]

There isn't one.


Ok for real though, INSIDE is one of those games that doesn't tell you anything. There isn't a single line of dialogue in this game, spoken or written. Telling an effective story like this is incredibly difficult, and ultimately I don't think INSIDE succeeds in this. Anything resembling a story is so loose and flimsy that you can watch 10 videos on Youtube explaining the meaning of the whole game and they could all be saying something completely different (I'm not joking, if you play the game and can't figure it out look up these videos on Youtube, each one is saying something different). Perhaps this is the whole point of INSIDE. That it's all open to interpretation and there is no one correct answer. If that's true than that's some bullsh!t. If this was a 3 dollar game that lasted an hour than sure, I can see it working. But it isn't. This is a $20 game full of filler because the developers couldn't come up with an actual story so they put together a vague outline of a vague story and filled it with beautiful scenery and a memorable ending so that the internet would start talking about it and make the game go viral. And it worked perfectly. If you enjoy vague stories that are incredibly open to interpretation than this is the perfect game for you. Unfortunately for me I prefer my stories to be actually stories with dialogue and that make sense. How you want to consume your video game stories will be the number 1 decider I think for if you enjoy this game or not. 

[h2] Conclusion [/h2] 

Ultimately, this game is all right. If you can get it on a good sale than go for it. It's fine enough for a couple bucks and has some good world building. Don't buy this expecting a great puzzle game though. There's more filler here than a Disney live action remake and the story is about as well done as one too. This game is in no way a masterpiece or the perfect 10/10 game people claim it is so don't go into it expecting that. There was a lot of potential here but the shortcomings prevent it from reaching the heights of other great games. If it looks interesting, wait for a sale.

Still, I can't help but think that I could copy-paste most of my review of Little Nightmares for this game. Both games are truly great story rich games but somehow INSIDE stood out a bit more for me. It reminded me of the familiarly mysterious and horrifying dystopian environment of Little Nightmares.
Although, INSIDE offers a bizarre and confusing plot in a highly surreal world while providing the player unique puzzles to solve. While being chalk full of disgusting imagery, it also stands out due to the fact that the ending and the plot of the game keep the player thinking about what they just witnessed and experienced.
At first, I was hesitant to buy this game due to the short amount of time it takes to complete it.

It's amazing how scary this game even though their are no jump scares. Even if the game play isn't all that great, the presentation is outstanding.

The game feels feels like a worthy upgrade to Limbo (the developers' previous game), which I constantly kept in mind when noticing every improvement and will now compare to.
The visual style noticeably better, but to be honest Limbo didn't have much going on in that department to begin with.
The world feels more lived and interesting, yet the atmosphere still captures that lonely feeling that the developers were going for.
The movement felt more fluid and didn't contribute negatively to the progression, something that did happen in my experience with Limbo a few times.
The game doesn't feel as unforgiving. Yes, you can screw up, but you'll know exactly what you did wrong and what you should do in the next attempt instead. In Limbo, sometimes you'd die unfairly for multiple reasons, one of which the afore mentioned controls.

This seems like I'm bashing Limbo but I do not mean it that way at all, Limbo is still a great game. I just mean to represent how much Inside is an improvement and why you should play it if you enjoyed Limbo.

Now that the comparison is over, I'll also add the positive that this game is pretty easy to complete all the achievements for, if you care about that sort of stuff.",1663359149,1663359149,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

With a combined hour count of over 100 hours, I haven't ever once gotten sick of the environment, the mystery, the soundtrack, or anything about the game really. 

The Story:

The story is incredible. Actually its the lack thereof that is really incredible. Inside manages to take a 2.5D environment with absolutely no text and turn it into a mystery that slowly but surely expands over the course of the game. There isn't a single room that doesn't have something intriguing in the background (or foreground), and you can actually piece together the movie from the first couple areas alone, if you're looking hard enough. The amount of speculation the player can take away from the game's ending is also incredible, as it is all up to perception of the events during the game, and the buildup to the grand finale.

Audio + Visuals:

The art and sound that appears in the game embraces the player and drags them in. There's no choice. You are immersed whether you want to be or not.

INSIDE goes all out on the first, but doesn't do completely terrible on the second either.

INSIDE, without spoiling any of the content - is a journey filled with environmental puzzles. It usually recycles the same mechanics (in a good way, and often very cleverly). The low poly characters are offputting and bland, but compensated for by extremely cinematic lighting, beautiful camera angles and a generally very pretty decor (albeit macabre). The sound design is unimaginably good for an indie title. The procedural animations are very convincing. The physics are right on the money. The puzzles are subtle but never hard. It's nothing short of a stunning presentation I've seen attempted many times before, but never with this much grace.

As a game INSIDE is not great. A lot of the puzzles rely on ""reacting on the spot"", and if the situation is interpret wrong (often without proper feedback, it can be one of an option and if you fail well... you have to do it over). Some of the puzzles are difficult to make sense of without just trying a few things - and trial and error is a hard no for me when it comes to game design. It's not outright bad however; the puzzles are, as mentioned before, quite intriguing and tend to reuse mechanics used previously. This makes them easier to read in most cases.

INSIDE is a really noteworthy title as long as you aren't looking for a fair challenge of any kind. Go in to experience, not to win.",1663019456,1663019456,True,1,0,0.436083197593688965,0,True,False,False

It is a solid platform/puzzle game, with good graphics. Story-wise, you don't really understand what is going on, but you know something is very wrong. You play as a child, which makes all the dying in multiple horrible ways particularly unpleasant to watch. Because of all the mystery and puzzle-solving, it is very engaging, but I would not call it fun. The game leaves you somewhat scared and confused, much like a kid must feel if left to fend for itself in an hostile, uncaring world like in this game. It is an emotional ride, and what keeps you going is the mystery, which becomes increasingly more complex, and the urge to help the poor child reach safety and get some satisfying resolution [spoiler](which never happens)[/spoiler]. The game just gets weirder and weirder, and both endings leave you sad and wondering what it was all about. Fascinating and cryptic, like an abstract work of art.

Danish independent developer Playdead made quite the entrance with the premiere of ""Limbo"" in 2010. That was about a boy's journey in between the living and dead. As if that wasn't already engrossing, Playdead came up with the spiritual successor ""INSIDE"" half a decade later with a more ambiguous title! 

I played the demo on console before and woah I didn't understand it- that's a given as I knew there had to be underlying messages hidden way in there! I also reviewed the former when I was still writing much shorter, clustered reviews back then- so I regard this as a way to show how far both Playdead and well me, have progressed! Lets get right to it~  


[h1]""Breach The Surface""[/h1]

[u]The Gist:[/u]
A boy abruptly emerges from the woods. Where is he running from or maybe even heading towards? Along the way he runs into a desolate wastelands, other people being held captive and an organization that also wants to apprehend him. Before he realizes it, he's found himself within a string of experimentation and it seems there's no going back.

[spoiler] ! C-conspiracy? Could it just be that?[/spoiler]


[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]

[b](a) On The Run[/b]
If you've played Limbo, you'll feel right at home. It's a 2D platformer with a huge emphasis on puzzle solving in order to figure out how to get around obstacles. More cooler neat animations were added, that are delightful to look at! For instance, if the boy steps on the edge of an object, ledge or suddenly decides to quick turn after building momentum. And boy is he quite the swimmer, being able to dive and swim skillfully although he could use some more practice when it comes to holding his breath. 

There are also actions that he'll do by instinct and these are prominently displayed during stealth segments like crouching down, palm of his hand against the wall surface. You can tell a lot of work went into his movements alone and I really appreciate that!! Controlling him (poor choice of words) is always a treat~ 


[b](b) Classified[/b] 
Though the puzzles were not as migraine-inducing as Limbo, they were still unique and do not seem randomly thrown in. What I mean by this is they fit the cold and controlled environments that they were most likely actual assets and were at one point made specifically for scientific research. This boy is now repurposing these gadgets to his advantage. They may start off like your typical ""drag crate to climb over something"" but that quickly evolves into more ingeniously designed, could have been made by the Riddler- that I also had some trouble with (not as much as Limbo where I rage quit for months). 

There are also secret contraptions just menacingly stationed about, whose functions are not known but they're shaped awfully familiar.. Anyways, the chances of you stumbling into them are quite rare unless you're super observant and take advantage of the ""E"" key every chance you get. But the hints are in the achievements themselves (thankfully not hidden ones) and you can always effortlessly reload a checkpoint should you miss one. Then skip ahead back~ These are optional but they do lead to a strictly, mind-screwing alternate ending of sorts. Just let that set in.


[b](c) Fractured[/b] 
The story is probably 90% why you're even touching this game! It's THAT good!! As for the storytelling however, it could use some work. It's another silent protagonist and there are no conversations (not with words). What we do end up with is a very mysterious sci-fi plot and a utterly hostile world, devoid of hope. What follows next is merely my interpretation of what the title could mean and the whole point of the story; so chill and feel free to skip~ 

[spoiler]Now, meaning no.1 the boy (who's dressed in red) is actually a spy sent INTO to break out some...thing. That explains why he knows where to go and is kinda competent. Hence, the organization guarding the complex is aware of this and is constantly on the lookout. No.2 is related to the mind control aspect- to literally get INSIDE someone's head which is a big part of the puzzles. OR finally, it's about secrets and how ""to get on the inside track"" of something. There's an extraterrestrial being that could save the dying planet and so experiments are being performed on it. But they didn't anticipate interference from the boy who may or may not be controlled.[/spoiler]There's probably more outrageous or plausible (your call) angles to approach this. Mindblown!!


[b](d) Out of Bounds[/b] 
Now I'll breakdown what made this game scary! The many creative deaths and variety in animations of said dying aside, the horror is much subtler. One, notice the setting- a place that's abandoned caused perhaps by a fatal disease, the infamous global warming or[spoiler]alien invasion[/spoiler]. Heck maybe it's man-made, idk cuz what's presented are the after effects but not the before. Either way, we could have potentially been staring at our future and we didn't realize it, at worst didn't care *gulp*. 

Then there's the obligatory paranoid thought of a top-secretive research facility in the heart of the woods somewhere, away from civilization. Is it run by the government, are they doing it for the sake of mankind or towards an exploitative and personal gain? But with revelations of a [spoiler]device overriding free will, taming of a creature of sorts[/spoiler], it would point towards the latter and fitting of human nature. Finally, I couldn't help but shake the notion of a little bit of Marxist ideals in there. For one thing, it takes place in a work environment and then some of the workforce appear mindless to do the bidding of some higher power. Followed by the inevitable revolution of the oppressed. One last thought, I may be overreacting but where are all the children!!? 


[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]

[b](i) Does The Top Stop?[/b] 
I'll just say it- I didn't like the ending. Woah, that felt so liberating to get off my chest. In all seriousness it wasn't actually THAT bad, just let down. It probably requires a lot of thought but patience has never been my strong suit.[Spoiler]There are two endings; canon and alternate, or maybe they're reversed, IDK!![/spoiler]. The fact that it ends on a cliffhanger- a happy-ish note, whatever. 

But then you start to overthink it. Even something as simple as, who's good and evil for example??! You realize for example [spoiler]the final scene is similar to a certain staging area behind glass. Coincidence?[/spoiler]. This game is perhaps too rich for me to analyze and I despise it for that but it did nothing wrong (maybe that's what it wants of me). I didn't encounter any bugs and you heard how the story went. I know what I must do about the score.. but first.


[h1]""Deeper Than Ever""[/h1]

To recap, INSIDE may retain the core characteristics of what made Limbo a worldwide sensation; from the moderate graphics to potentially challenging platformer puzzles. However most apparent is the magnetic, mysterious plot to put that curiosity leash around you but it is a far cry from there on out. The story is even more interestingly convoluted and the title can bear many meanings. Whereas the ending of its predecessor could be hinted at, Inside leaves you hanging with uncertainty as you never really guess what the game will throw at you next.

Piled with the shock from progressively horrific happenings that unfold and a truly oppressive post-apocalyptic world, you cannot help but think of the worst! Perhaps most terrifying is the fact that we'll never (not definitively) get an answer as to what it actually meant- to peer into the developers' minds. You're still most welcome to try and you know there'a little part within you that will be dying to~

You're immersed in the circumstances of the character and through them see and experience an internally consistent dystopia that is by turns baffling, horrifying, and compelling. The design makes effective use of visual tropes (hiding in the shadows, silhouetted by headlights, dilapidated urban rooftops, run-down rural farms, underwater vastness) to draw you in to a story and an environment that is simultaneously familiar and alien, relatable and unknowable.

The gameplay also deserves mention, as its puzzles are sufficiently challenging to sustain interest without being either too difficult or too repetitive. However, from the very simple controls to the side-scrolling 2D layout, the overarching design goal seems to have been to keep the player in the world rather than in their head.

The blurb for the game gives little away, a bit like the game itself in terms of a clearly defined plot, but the objective itself is clear enough. 

When I started playing yesterday I wanted a game that wasn't too difficult, but interesting enough to keep my brain occupied - as I've not been in the best of headspace of late, and weirdly, this quirky, dark, and rather twisty game would be a good choice. Enough to keep me distracted and let my brain work a few things out while I focus on what the hell I've walked into...

I can honestly admit I've never been so morbidly curious as to how many different ways my character can die in a game!
Let's just say, no punches are pulled, and there's something weirdly fascinating about the combination of the visuals and the outcomes of failing, as well as an uneasy atmosphere to begin with. 

Like some of my favourite games, there is no dialogue - and to enhance the creep factor in Inside, music is also sparing. It's very much you and your thoughts against... the 'enemy'. I also like that the game is deliberately a bit vague - making it really multifaceted as to what you decide who and what the enemy is. (No spoilers, but let's just say I didn't expect to end the game the way I did!) 

I picked up on the achievements/secret puzzles a bit too late, as I didn't spot them, so there is replay value for me - I'm not a massive achievement hunter, but I did find the big 'secret' but it's dependent on earlier secrets being found... so will sort that out as I want to know what the outcome of that is. 

This is a game that could easily be completed in an evening - I don't rush through games and it took me just over four hours. 
I'd definitely recommend it if you see it on sale, and want something different for your evening, or if dark and twisty is your kind of game.

[u]PROS[/u]
- Because there aren't any dialogue/text/audio logs whatsoever, the game makes you focus on its beautifully-rendered backgrounds that are full of intriguing scenery which give you a sense of the world you're in and its many compelling mysteries. Sometimes less is better! [b]Show us, don't tell us[/b], and this is a perfect example of getting that right!
- Half of the game consists of solving its many unique, very creative and deceptively clever puzzles. I wish more games did puzzles like this!
- Towards the end of the game you're treated to some of the CRAZIEST, WTF, most FUN moments in video game history ever! The game is worth playing for this alone, for real!! XD

A spiritual successor by Limbo developers Playdead, Inside is a worthy successor that graphically surpasses the original even if the gameplay is more of the same; another fine work of environmental storytelling with mostly slick, satisfying puzzles and platforming.

Slyly dumping an unnamed child-protagonist in starting forest; Inside soon veers into more dystopian territory. SPOILERS AHEAD. Menacing thugs and creepy malformed pigs are revealed to be the first outriders of a sinister, mind-controlling autocracy that seems to have seized power in a crumbling, post-collapse world. While there’s no antagonist as memorable as Limbo’s spider, a bananas twist in the game’s final act is easily as striking, even if its relation to what came previously appears tenuous. SPOILERS END. Indeed, Inside tells its story wordlessly and with a kind of arthouse portentousness that some players may find frustrating. The end is ambiguous, and if the game has any kind of overarching message or meaning, it’s very much left up to the player to discern. 

Platforming is naturalistic and responsive, aided by wonderful animation, and the environment has clearly been play-tested and refined to Valve-like levels of polish. The 3D backdrops are more appealing than Limbo’s, as are the Schindler’s List-esque splashes of colour in a largely monochrome world. The puzzles are mostly satisfying, although I find this kind of game’s “guess-what-I’m-thinking” approach to problem-solving occasionally frustrating; with no room for creative solutions. In a couple of instances, I seemed to steer away from the correct path forward, and resorted to internet solutions to avoid severe frustration. But perhaps, dear reader, you are more intelligent than I. At the very least, extremely generous checkpointing keeps you from repeating more than any individual micro-challenge.

Clocking in at three to four hours, thirty dollary-dos may seem a little steep for an experience with limited replay value outside a few hidden collectables. With less free time than I’d like, however, I have no qualms recommending this kind of gaming amuse-bouche; especially one as well-crafted and evocative as Inside. You just might want to wait for a sale. A great jumping-on point for the growing family of Scandinavian atmosphere-drenched platformers, don’t miss Limbo and FAR: Lone Sails if you enjoyed this, or for something cheerier the wonderful Steamworld Digs 1 and 2.",1657960798,1657961014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visuals: 10/10, Might just be me but the city sections give me MASSIVE vibes of Half-Life 2 and Little Nightmares (despite the ladder being made after INSIDE) mashed together to create an very bleak and hopeless environment.  The factory levels give an pretty dark and almost souless feel to everything.  I just cant shut up about the visuals for both LIMBO and INSIDE.

Music: 7/10, Very melancholy in nature, didn't mind that much although at some points it got really good

Gameplay: 6/10, There were some points where the puzzles got a bit frustrating and annoying, Most puzzles are fine, but i strongly dislike the water and siren puzzles. Stealth is pretty good, the chase scenes are at a completely different level tho.  I absolutely love the chase scenes with the dogs and the humans,  Not sure if this is ""spoilers"" but the one chase scene with the people montioring the line with mind controlled humans you are in and letting the dog loose has so much tension and suspense. I would love to see more of it in the next game.

Sercets: 5/10, I'm that type of guy who typically doesnt like to go out of my way to get ""sercets"" and having to play a level over again just to get it, then to go to another level and rinse and repeat, Although the sercet ending is pretty good.

Overall, INSIDE was a very unique experience, so i give it a 8/10. You will love it for its visuals, i assure you that.

Can't wait for what Playdead is cooking up for its next game!",1657529142,1657529208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
