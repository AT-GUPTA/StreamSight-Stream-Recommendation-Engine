It's a big step up from ""Fallen Order,"" offering a much larger world to explore.
The fighting, moving around, and graphics have all gotten better.
The story is deep and emotional, adding new depth to the Star Wars stories we know.

Because the game is bigger, sometimes it feels a bit slow or dragged out, also ray tracing had to be turned off to stop game crashing every 5 min.

The story picks up five years after ""Jedi: Fallen Order."" Cal Kestis, the main character, has grown from his previous adventures, making him stronger and more confident. This growth shows in his fighting skills and the use of Force powers right from the start, making battles more exciting.

The game's world feels more alive than ever, with stunning places to see and lots of details that make it feel real. An interesting new area is Koboh, a planet that reminds you of the Wild West, filled with unique characters and challenges.

However, the game's large size can be a bit much at times, with so many places to explore that it sometimes feels overwhelming. Despite this, the mix of characters and their stories keep you hooked, showing different sides of the galaxy during a tough time.

Fighting in the game is more fun, with new ways to use your lightsaber and Force powers. This makes each battle feel fresh and exciting. Moving around the game world is also better, with Cal feeling more agile and able to do more from the very beginning.

Even with its few issues, ""Star Wars Jedi: Survivor"" does a great job of building on what made ""Fallen Order"" good. It offers a deep and engaging story, better gameplay, and a rich world that feels new and exciting. Cal Kestis' journey continues to impress, making this one of the best Star Wars games out there.",1708827314,1708827437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To discuss the game, regardless of console, I was not a huge fan of the side quests, or ""rumors"". They did not feel like they added anything important to the game, and the exploration felt similarly. Most of the loot you can find of the beaten path are cosmetics, which I personally do not find much fulfillment in. I'm also not sure if I was too fond of the metroidvania world, which sees you returning to various planets over and over again with the option to revisit and explore previously locked areas. I really feel as though this would have been more effective as a right linear game with some puzzles and platforming elements. Furthermore, the shortcuts you unlock along the way definitely feel forced, rather than clever, and make the previous obstacles feel like they were put there to squeeze more time out of the game.

The combat was also disappointing. The parry system, while very satisfying when it worked, does not really prepare you for the challenges thrown at you, and thus does not go far in making you feel like a badass jedi. I never really felt excited to spend the skill points I unlocked because the skills are very underwhelming, with basic force pushes and pulls, and various minor new combat moves. Additionally, the enemies vary VASTLY in difficulty, which leads to some incredibly frustrating encounters. For example, one mini-boss I found about halfway through the game was easily the most difficult fight in the whole game, though only because its moveset and attacks were extremely difficult to dodge and could one-hit kill you if they landed. This leads into the overarching problem with the game's combat. As this is commonly referred to as a 'Soulslike', you can easily reminisce about memorable fights FromSoft's various difficult games, where tight controls and responsive feedback means that when you die, it's on you. In Jedi Survivor, however, many fights can feel incredibly frustrating, like you're constantly fighting the controls to overcome an obstacle rather than finding harmony with them. For context, I have played many incredibly difficult action RPGs like Sekiro, Elden Ring, and Dark Souls 3 to completion, so I am very conscious of what good controls feel like.

The performance is also ABYSMAL. I went into this game with low expectations due to reading many reviews, but nothing could prepare me for the absolutely embarrassing optimization. My rig is as follows:

Monitor: 3440 x 1440p
GPU: RTX 4080 16GB VRAM
CPU: i7-14700KF ~3.4Ghz
RAM: 32GB

Even though I'm running a high-end rig, I was expecting to be unable to run this with raytracing enabled, but many moments made me wonder if I should have turned the settings down. Constant stuttering and frame hitching absolutely marred the experience, constantly dragging me out and preventing me from suspending disbelief. Performance decreased the longer the game ran, to the point where restarting the game would restore a decent framerate. Unfortunately, not mods or fixes exist as the issue is purely with development. These development issues bled out into the gameplay as well, with many cutscenes having graphical bugs and some execution animations occurring 15 feet off the ground. 

Finally, having to launch this through the EA app topped off the horrible experience. To get my Dualsense Edge controller working, I had to add the EA app as a non-steam game, and then launch the EA app through Steam. Otherwise, controller input was not detected. I tried many different controller configurations but was unable to get any working other than this. 

To summarize, this port is a complete embarrassment for EA, and a huge detractor for Respawn, developers of the incredible TitanFall and TitanFall 2. Yes, there were some awesome moments, and yes I did enjoy parts of the gameplay, but the consistent gameplay and performance issues made fully exploring and realizing the open-world utterly unenjoyable. I would not recommend this for anyone on PC, regardless of specs. I would also not really recommend this game period. The pacing, side quests, and gameplay were a huge turnoff that added a lot of filler, and not enough memorable content. 

NOTE: I do not typically write reviews for games, even ones that I don't enjoy, but this is beyond unbelievable for the $70 price tag. If I had not gotten this on sale at 50% off, I would be incredibly upset with my purchase, more so than I am now.

I love the world, the music, the ambience, the gameplay, the customization, literally every new thing this game brought about is amazing and every aspect they refined from the first one is, in fact, refined. There's just one major issue: the game runs like dogsh i t. It's unstable and lowering graphics settings seems to have minimal effect on the frame rate. The game is just poorly optimized for PC and it's such a damn shame. I have a ryzen 9 5th gen, an RTX 3070, and 16 gigs of RAM. The game's minimum is 8 gigs with recommended 16 gigs, but when I play it never gets to 7 gigs of RAM usage, so that's not my bottleneck. I play on an SSD, my thermals are good, my machine should be MORE THAN CAPABLE of running this game. But it just simply cannot. That also rules out the steamdeck.

 I played most of these 17 hours on release, played for around an hour a couple days ago to see if they'd done anything substantial to make the thing run better and it almost feels worse than it did when it came out. I dunno. I just wish the game ran.

Overall, i think the game is fantastic with great acting, story, gameplay, music, really just the overall game itself is awesome. But it just. doesn't. run. And that hurts.

Nice story, not a huge epic but a cool addition to the Star Wars lore in times of the galactic empire. Variety of worlds with beautiful sceneries and immersive environment. Entertaining new challenges over the open worlds as Cal unlocks new skills and scaling enemy difficulty make most of the locations interesting even in late game. This made me enjoy the game overall and finish all the worlds to 95-100 %.
- 
Graphics: Terrible optimisation, EA should be really ashamed. Optimisation sequence at every game start seems really unnecesary to me. Being in menu while AFK stressed my GPU to 100 % due to unlocked FPS - like really EA? Tons of useless graphic settings but no FPS lock? Did anyone even test the game menu? Best visuals achieved with FSR but character faces are still blurry and ugly in close shots for some reason. Playing with DLSS or without upscaling made the graphics look like a 2010 game even on the highest grahics settings.
Game mechanics: Clunky combat system, little pauses between combat actions make it literally impossible to avoid hits, no matter how skilled and fast you are. Unnecessary cosmetic content - is it a Star Wars RPG or a hairstyle/gardening simulator? Wouldn't the manhours invested in all this useless boring junk be better spent on development of Cal/BD-1/Mantis/mounts upgrades with an actual impact on gameplay?
Story: [spoiler]Is Darth Vader going to be a part of every Star Wars game no matter how unnecesarry it is? Felt suprising but realistic in Fallen Order in an inquisitor training centre, but here it felt too forced. The end was just pathetic. A child being fine around its fathers' killer? Is Kata a psychopat or what?[/spoiler]

The characters are well written and relatable making you want to finish the story. I found myself watching cut-scenes with a desire to see what's going to happen to the characters. The story was well written, picking up where Jedi Fallen Order left off. It truly rounded out the main character Cal, adding to his story rather than just having him exist for players to play as. I think one of my favorite parts was how this game kept all the powers Cal learned from the first game, having the player start with them. It was a nice change of pace rather than having the writers try and explain that Cal lost his powers. Without spoiling the game, I will just say the entire game brings Cal through a terrific character arc that very few of the new Star Wars movies and shows have achieved. 

Now that the story is out of the way, on to the game play. As I stated prior, it was nice to play a sequel in a series where the main character did not need to start a square one as far as abilities go. It was fun finding new powers and abilities that built on the old ones and using those to solve new puzzles. The new light saber stances were a welcomed addition and I found myself wanting to try each one to get the full experience; however, I did find one that I enjoyed more than the others and I ended up using that stance the majority of the time. The combat was enjoyable for the vast majority of the game with a few exceptions being legendary enemies that you could encounter early in the game. Luckily those enemies are not necessary to defeat in order to progress the game and a  player can return to them later once they are more powerful. 

The puzzles themselves, while solvable, are challenging this time around. I found many locked paths that had no clear way of how they open. In the end, some of those inaccessible areas were only able to be unlocked when I explored and forgot the area existed. It should be noted, the difficult puzzles are not all necessary to complete the game. In the end I found myself trying to complete all the puzzles, which ended up making me gather every item in the game, making this one of the few games I have ever completed to 100% with all the collectibles. 

On to the bad. This game is not without its faults and most of the issues I have with this game are in the form of glitches and bugs. For example, there is currently a glitch with the sound where dialogue is next to impossible to hear. When I first started the game I saw text on the screen and did not understand why; it wasn't until I saw the characters lips moving that I understood there was actual dialogue taking place. I was able to solve the issue by changing a lot of the sound settings in the game and tweaking settings on my machine. Another glitch came in the form of doors that would not re-open and required exiting the game to solve. Despite these issues I still found the game to be very enjoyable. 

I bought this game and Jedi Fallen Order at the same time when they were both on sale, and I had very little expectation for them both. I was happy to be surprised.",1708706446,1708706446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall – Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has a lot of great upgrades going for it from the previous game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The traversal mechanics feel awesome! The different ways you can grapple, wall run, wall jump, and slide down walls are great, also the Merrin teleport sequences are insanely fun! The additional stances are a welcomed upgrade. I personally went with Crossguard for bosses and rare mobs to make easy work of them and blaster stance for everyone else. This allowed me to experience two very different styles of combat on the fly, the slower/souls style of gameplay and something a bit faster with some mixed in, powerful, ranged stuff. An improvement in the combat all around. The storyline was also very well done, and the exploration felt rewarding and didn’t drag the game down. Very much looking forward to seeing what they continue to do with this franchise.   Highly Recommended.

First off, there is no arcade mode. That was the best part of its predecessor, Fallen Order. We can no longer just go into an area and just kill things or face challenges in an arena. This severely cuts down on replayability.

Combat feels so janky, it doesn't make you feel like a jedi at all. There are few boss fights that pose fun challenges, but everything else feels either too easy or annoyingly a little too difficult for fun common enemies. Too many common enemies are unaffected by a lightsaber swing and too many more die from one hit. At least let the lightsaber interrupt their combo if their scrap staff is going to interrupt mine. 

Additionally, the frames do occasionally become an issue, but it's to a point where I can still try to enjoy my janky lightsaber fights. There's also frequent crashes, these issues I would overlook normally if this was in alpha development, but for $60 from EA, this is just disappointing.

First and foremost, the movement and traversal have not changed in the slightest.  Cal still feels floaty and unattached to the ground.  His running and movement are still awkward looking and don't feel natural.  Momentum during traversal gimmicks is still completely unpredictable, and most terrain design makes no sense.  Cal can Jackie Chan his way up only specific surfaces and sprint up 60 degree slopes. However if there's some water on a 45 degree slope it becomes an impassable slip'n'slide.  Enemies continue to appear from rooms with no doors, or in places they have no reason to be, isolated on a platform with no way to have gotten there.  After meeting up with Merrin again, enemies literally burst through a stone wall to come fight you leaving behind a completely otherwise enclosed hollow in the rock.

Combat has been diversified with new stances, which are incredibly satisfying and straight up well designed. But overall combat has become worse.  Every enemy except the basic stormtroopers and B1s are just a spam-fest of attacks and massive damage sponges, even on the easier difficulties.  A B2 battledroid should not take 7+ strikes from a lightsaber to take down.   A major complaint I have of the previous game was Cal's lack of forward motion during lightsaber attacks, allowing enemies to slowly backpedal while you swing at the air.  I'm happy to say I I don't feel this way at all anymore.  However, a new, far worse issue has been programmed in.  The developers have taken the pathetic, lazy design route of implementing ""difficulty"" by making all but the weakest enemies unreactive to your saber strikes, and arming them with a plethora of unblockable attacks and one hit kills.  That's literally it.  This is 100% of the game's difficulty.  It's that basic and that dumb.  Zero effort to design thoughtful challenge, just enemies with varying immunity to your abilities, playing by a completely different set of rules beyond what's reasonable.

The game is equal parts excellent and frustrating.  I've still stuck around to play it to 100% completion.  I really like the characters and voice acting.  Cal himself has really grown on me and I believe his voice actor did a particularly amazing job.  Sad characters can be very transparent, but Cal is completely natural and believable.   The music is exactly what you'd expect from a Star Wars game.  The style is consistent and there are a few pointed drops of classic song bits.  There's a lot to love, but much of the game still just feels like trash to play.  I still find myself struggling against the game rather than against the enemies and it does not currently leave me with the impression that player feedback was considered on a reasonable scale.   However the implementation of fast travel via meditation points is extremely welcome.  We should have had it in the first game, but at least it's here now.

There are still fundamental flaws in too great a number so i can't leave a positive review once again.  

Here's an example of what I mean when I'm talking about textbook, objective bad game design.  The double Oggdo boss fight.  That's right folks.  The logic of ""How do we make the game harder?  Oh, I know, just re-use an old boss and make it a gank!""  Oggdo Bogdo and Spawn of Oggdo do nothing but trade relentless unblockable attacks back and forth in a rhythm which removes the punishment window where you can even hit them back.  They have a grand total of 7 attacks... only 2 of which are blockable.  The aggro'd one attacks while the other tries to constantly one-shot you with the old frog tongue attack.  They have now removed the ability to cut the tongue off because fuck you that's why.  The fight has a timer though it means nothing.  Giving the impression that you need to beat it quickly.  And worst of all, there's no ""retry"" option, forcing you to endure the death animation, the force tear exit animation, then load back into the world, listen to call say something inane like ""Oops that wasn't right"", then re enter the force tear with another animation, then load back into the boss fight just to try again.  For a lot of people, that process will be longer than the boss fight attempt.  I struggle to understand the lack of basic game design concept implementation.  Keep the player engaged, limit the time needed to get back into the action after a failure.  The double Oggdo is a tiny diorama/arena battle in a skybox, there's no reason this shouldn't be able to quickly reset without needing to re-load the entire game twice.  Especially after dying because the invisible ceiling around the edge of the arena has again stopped you from jumping out of the way of an attack. 

Oh and all you get is a single kill point for winning. As if the injury necessitated insult.

My overall experience with bugs an general malfunctions was minimal.  No game breaking or long lasting issues occurred.  Cal mysteriously lost the use of the X (square) or Y (triangle) button on one stance from time to time, requiring a complete relaunch of the game, but I believe that was related to my hardware and not the game.

It was a real love/hate with SWJS, just as it was with SWJFO.  I'm sure when the next one comes out I'll dive in again.  I still really want what this series has to offer, I just want it less frustrating.  I still hold the hope that the next instalment will get a positive review from me.",1706998540,1708545714,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

They probably also didn't bother checking their computer if anything on their system is causing the issues. (Ever heard of Event Viewer?)
I personally had a strange issue with my processor, causing problems in games, replacing that fixed pretty much all issues I had with any of my games.

I run an AMD system with a Ryzen 5 5600X and a Radeon RX 6700 XT.
The game is running smooth in 4k without any crashes.

Sure, I do not have raytracing turned on, cause that does not improve the gameplay in any way.
And if this was the only thing causing issues, just turn the stupid setting off !

This game is loads of fun to play, combat is very intuitive.
Story, albeit a bit short, is quite enjoyable.

If anyone is still doubting to purchase this because of the bad reviews from tech-illiterate people that blame games instead of fixing their computer.

I think this is an amazing sequel to a set of games that are truly a blast for Star Wars fans to enjoy an amazing world building experience. I loved all the emotions this game made me feel, besides the frustration of playing on a really hard difficulty. I think the combat is fun and rewarding when you conquer a level, or group of people. Again the story is incredible, I almost cried during some parts and my emotions were a roller coaster., especially towards the end. As of writing this I plan on completing all achievements, but there are so many collectables and things I need to do/explore, I am not looking forward to it.

I'm so glad I got to play this game, because I had a blast. However, I was not impressed with the frame rates, sometimes it was like I was watching a slideshow. For a game that costs $70 dollars, it's embarrassing that this game hasn't been optimized to run on a gaming PC like the one I own. I can't imagine playing this on a console, my condolences to anyone who has to play it on one.

I also glitched out of the ship once when it was trying to leave for a different planet, so I had to save and exit. Thankfully I didn't lose any progress because of this, but still was a bit worrying.

That being said, currently, there is a problem where the PlayStation controllers aren't working - if that concerns you, wait to buy till it gets patched.

Overall the story was excellent, immersive, and entertaining throughout the run. Although some story beats are predictable, there are also multiple unexpected developments. In addition, there are opportunities to further develop relationships with your crew on the Mantis, and meet new interactable NPCs on the various planets.

Gameplay-wise, it's pretty much the same as Jedi Fallen Order. Although mobility is improved, and there are more customization options for combat, if you did not enjoy the previous game, I doubt you'll opinion will change.

They give a short recap of the previous game using a video, so overall you don't need to know the prior game plot. To honor the plot, Cal does have access to single and double lightsaber stance at the start with additional stances to be unlocked throughout the game. As for collecting everything, later in the story you can unlock maps that show the specific locations so its a mix of collect as you go and handle on later. 

At this point in time, the game is very demanding in regards to performance. The graphics are beautiful and detailed, but you need a mid to high-end GPU for a decent framerate.

Okay, I don't see why this game is at 'mixed reviews' other than it being an EA title. 
-performance, bugginess far and above better than the first game, though still not perfect. Running this game on a two year old laptop with an A3000 workstation graphics card, which is kind of mid range, and it's fine, in my opinion. It hasn't crashed on me once. I don't have ray tracing enabled and it's still beautiful. 
TIP: They were lazy setting up the control scheme for keyboard + mouse. I made only one change, swap Tab and Ctrl so you your hand doesn't instantly cramp up. I've found that's all I needed.
-graphics are great, improving on what was in the first in the series
-art is great, lots of beautiful locations and great star wars frontier/ ancient ruins art
-combat + platforming action are all there from the first game with some new additions and improvements
-open world, suffers from the same confusion about when it's okay to chill and when you need to stay on mission that all open world games do, but I think that's maybe part of the point of this game after the first one
-the world of people you can not kill and things other than combat that you can do is larger, which again goes back to the theme of this episode which is Cal wrestling with whether he should be ""a weapon"" or stop and try to live [if he even can].

I'm here to say that the game is a bit rough, but it is by no means unplayable, and it is by no means deserving of a ""mixed"" review status. This is a really, really good game. Plenty of systems can play it at a solid 60+ fps if you are willing to compromise on certain settings. And the game will still look great. I've had no problem getting very high frame rates that are stable.

I'm tellin yall right now, I have no issues getting a solid 170fps with ray tracing off. With ray tracing on, I get a solid 90 fps most of the time. But that's RT for ya. All settings are on Epic, AMD FSR is set to quality, and AMD Fluid Frames activated via the AMD Adrenaline Overlay.

Specs:
Resolution: 1440p
GPU: AMD RX 7800 XT (16gb VRAM)
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700x
RAM: 32gb DDR5

Obviously those are solid specs. But they're upper mid-range; not top of the line. I'm noticing that a lot of people reporting lousy performance happen to be using NVIDIA GPUs. I'm wondering if the game is just better optimized for AMD GPUs because game consoles run AMD. My other theory (without deep diving into specs/benchmarks) is CPU bottlenecking.

Obviously EA sucks. I hate them as much as everyone else does. But since they basically have a monopoly on Star Wars games, we may as well vote with our dollar and show EA that people still want great single player games like Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor.

I almost gave it a 10/10!

Unlike its predecessor, Star wars Jedi: Survivor focused more on a grounded story rather than a grand scale like the Empire and the Fate of the Universe. Jedi Survivor almost, ALMOST, has the perfect blend of classic Star Wars action like the original trilogy, and a really immersive and grounded narrative, unlike the sequel trilogy.

Playing this on PC was not the best experience but it was fine given the condition it was released in. Leaving all the technical issues behind, I felt like Jedi Survivor shows the universe of Star Wars in the best way possible. The dim and saturated streets of Coruscant, the vivid and lush lands of Koboh, and the grainy deserts of jedah; the game looks fantastic.

The story was way more interpersonal compared to the first Jedi game, as this one focused more on Cal's growth not only as a Jedi knight but also as a friend, a pupil and a lover. Survivor made me care for Cal which inadvertently made me care for Bode, Cere and all the other characters involved. 

The characterisation of Dagan was a personification of how order can slowly become a dictatorial power without compassion, which is what exactly happened with the Jedi order. Dagan served his purpose..but the story writers had me in shambles with Bode Akuna. Oh Bode....

While Survivor does not have the perfect narrative (some parts of the 2nd half felt a bit bloated and rushed), it certainly is a way superior product compared to what Star Wars has become lately (Fuck Disney, really). The 
gameplay, on the other hand, felt like a more polished version of Jedi Fallen Order instead of being a generational leap. Considering how great the gameplay of Jedi Fallen Order was in the first place, I honestly have no big complaints.

Overall? i would say Survivor is a good 8.5/10.",1708370266,1708370266,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Specifically, the first main planet you go to seems to have a lot of performance issues in its open world sections(50-60 fps), while the rest of the game was very smooth for me (above 60 fps). High to Ultra without RT. And the game looks gorgeous at those settings. I also had 3-4 crashes throughout my 25 hours, a couple of which were very inconvenient and caused me to have to redo some things.

Performance aside, this game is fantastic.

If you have played [i]Fallen Order[/i], you should know what to expect for gameplay. If not, I like to describe it as [i]Elden Ring[/i] meets [i]Uncharted[/i], or open world-ish souls-like combat with lots of platforming and traversal.

To me, this game series is undoubtedly the best ongoing Star Wars narrative, aside from maybe Andor. But if you come to Star Wars for the lightsabers and Jedi, this is it. It is mature and impactful in its storytelling. I cannot wait for a third entry.

Another positive note, there are a lot of cool fighting styles (stances) that you can spec out, equipping two at a time. I found myself geeking out every time I unlocked a new one. There are the ones from Fallen Order of course, but my personal favorite new one was, [spoiler]and I am not a sequel fan, the CROSSGUARD stance, inspired by Kylo Ren's fighting style (and saber). It uses those big heavy swings and its tree has a lot of really cool, powerful-feeling abilities.[/spoiler] The game uses these different stances to switch up your gameplay in a interesting ways, and you are only ever required to use one right when you acquire it for tutorial purposes.

Gameplay feels really great with the introduction of new mechanics, skills and stances meaning there's a play style for everyone. The story was excellent, lots of unexpected twists and turns with meaningful moments and characters with depth

Everything about this game just feels like an overall upgrade from the first and the game is pretty massive

Onto the controversial topic PERFORMANCE, My game ran relatively fine I never had a crash and for the most part it was stable, If lower frame rates every so often bug you I would make sure you have good hardware and expect to probably not run on max settings (I was running at max settings with RTX off on a 3070 and Ryzen 7 5800X) I do think a lot of people playing this game are maybe trying to run too high settings for their systems when they know the game isn't amazingly optimised so keep that in mind going into the game. Plus game is amazing don't worry about trying to get the max graphics possible, just play the damn game

The only real problems I noticed was lower frames in large open areas and the holomap on the mantis running at around 20fps but it didn't effect gameplay and honestly was just kinda funny and the former I probably coulda fixed with lowering my settings but I just never bothered to

The dodge/parry timing is off, not by too small but by being too long before the actual hit. At least on ""Jedi Knight"" difficulty, you will miss the dodge/parry if you actually time it right before the hit. Additionally, whose idea was it to add a tutorial item mid-combat (hold F to block with dual blades) and then have it immediately NOT WORK and kill the player? Was that on purpose? The story thus far is a retread of the first game. We get new side characters and before we learn their names they die. Oh no, not what's his name! Just like that ""friend/mentor"" in the first game, they really tried to make a moment out of nothing and failed. The gameplay is roughly the same, the graphics are fine but not astounding. This entire thing is a C- at best, but I really hope to come back and adjust this review later on because the potential is clearly there.

The exploration and traversal challenges that Fallen Order brought is dwarfed by what you can do in Survivor because the opened world aspect is some more vast and I have to applaud Respawn for referencing old school games like Mega Man X and Super Metroid for their traversal mechanics and Devil May Cry for the secret challenges portions. The puzzles  are mostly tied to the story like in Fallen Order but this time they are more intricate and needs your full concentration. The combat is as intricate as the first one but there are so many new things Cal can do and it feels like full gameplay evolution and in my opinion it strays away from the Souls like formula and is more akin to a Devil May Cry game. 

The story is a great departure from the previous game making Cal and his friends have a more fleshed out personality, the game also introduce you to a lot more characters since now you have a central hub with optional side quests you can get from some of the people roaming around the main planet, they all have a back story to tell and they feel like they belong in the lore as you progress more and more through the story making them have a sense of connection to the main characters. To me this franchise grew to almost feel like a ''what if'' Anakin Skywalker didn't turn to the dark side and instead fought in the shadows against the Empire, every references from the original movies that you may understand or remember have their moments and it feels like this franchise is great at making them more meaningful to give Cal a good back story to tell each time he gets into a situation similar to other main movie characters which is great for his development.

There aren't many grips that I have against the game but there's one thing I really think Respawn should address and its the power scaling that Cal is heading to for his arsenal, I think if he is going to to carry most of what he learned in this game to the next, like they did from Fallen Order they should improve to what he already acquired instead of giving him another set, that way it makes them more iconic and unique to him and makes him feel less over powered like Star Killer in The Force Unleashed for example, It makes it more believable since Lord Sidious and Darth Vader are suppose to be the strongest force wielder and even they don't really feel that over powered lore wise. So that way if they build the next world around the new arsenal, it could make solving puzzle and traversal not only about what you unlock as movement and tools extension during the story or what BD can do to help Cal solve puzzles.

Speaking of BD I don't know if it was a bit lazy but lore wise one of his perk seemed off and made using it in puzzles a bit convoluted but that's just me so whats stays in Star Wars stays in Star Wars huh!?",1708129962,1708222879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This wasn't perfect game at all. But it was good enough that it got me back playing something from that universe.

Jedi Survivor goes beyond that and brings back not only that which I liked from 2019's Fallen Order but also something that was lost since the old days of Lucas Arts games. 

One thing that comes to mind when thinking about this game are all the great characters that you meet while playing it. Not only the main characters which are returning from the first game, but also the great cast of supporting characters that you will meet along the way. 

There are many great lines of dialogue to be found if you go fully exploring all that the game has to offer far beyond the main story. I would say it's even better than the main story, which is very exciting as well, but in the end didn't exactly stick the landing for me. Still, I very much loved the journey and the places you get to go there. 

The thing that comes to mind about the supporting characters in Jedi Survivor is that this game has a sense humor... Jedi Survivor can actually be funny at times. Cal has even one liners!!! Many of these lines of dialogue are depending on your actions and how you choose to engage certain enemies.
In brief, this game has good writing, and excellent world building, something that I think must be told.

The levels in Jedi Survivor are excellent. There are many layers to them. When you first explore most of them, they offer you a clear path, with some optionals here and there. Some paths are obviously blocked to be later unlocked. But... when you start advancing on the main story and gaining certain powers, and even more so if you care to explore past the main mission and unlock more abilities... you will find there is more than one way to explore each level, and some abilities could even change completely the way you move on each level.... there are even whole sections absolutely hidden from the main story. Excellent level design all the way.

The music is very good, not because it sounds like Star wars but because it tries to do the impossible (And forbidden) which is to separate itself from the Universe it comes from, keeping the spark alive.... and it very much succeeds in doing that.

Playing Jedi Survivor was one of the few times I still was able to enjoy playing a Star Wars game and sincerely I wouldn't mind going back at it again one more time in the future.

But there better be a Poncho!

And would be a 10 had Respawn, likely forced to do so by EA, not implemented all these open world Inquisition-type bs and instead focused on developing the main story more.

Fine, it's cool customising Cal, but this game, as much as Fallen Order, is a story-driven game. And in particular in Jedi Survivor, the story is mostly based on the relations between main characters. I am not stupid to think that it will happen, but I still have some vague hope that for the sequel, the devs will be more focused on the story aspect of the game and not some post-game things, because nobody does them anyway.

The game suffers from odd stutters and pop-in even when the frame rate itself is fine. See Digital Foundry videos on the game's performance and decide if you can deal. It definitely took away from some of the cutscenes, but it was never unplayablely bad.

The gameplay expands on the first game well, and all of the saber stances are fun and interesting with their own playstyles. The story ranges from very mid to really cool depending on where you're at. Some sequences of the game are extremely traversal heavy and start to drag.

I had a good time playing it, but really hope the horrendous performance issues that were somewhat addressed since launch did not ruin the game's reception so much that a potential sequel is canceled. I think if this game was given another 9-12 months in the oven, it would've been received more similarly to Fallen Order. If there's a sequel, I hope the developers are given more time to work on the game. (Given the state of the industry, that won't happen).

It's in almost every way a perfect sequel to Fallen Order, from game mechanics to the character evolution, the story progression, the music... It was incredible fun the entire way through, not to mention an emotional roller coaster. 

That said, it has it's issues, the main of which and the one that almost ruined it for me being the performance of the game itself. At the time of writing, I'm playing this on a 7800x3d, an RTX 3090 and 32gb of ram. The best gaming cpu on the market and a slightly older but still flagship grade gpu atm and the game still manages to stutter and lag at many points.

It's horribly blurry on anything below 1440p, ideally 4k even as for some reason they apparently have it set to 50% resolution scale by default and the TAA is just god awful. FSR and DLSS help in sharpening it up a bit but still...
Ray tracing is a complete no go as well, the moment I turn it on it becomes an unplayable crash ridden mess. Thankfully, at least most of the bug's have been fixed and once ray tracing was off the game no longer had any crashes or freezing issues.

It's really a shame because I truly believe that underneath all of the problems it has, is an amazing gem Respawn just need to polish up and allow to shine. But even so, I simply don't have the willpower to leave a negative review. It gave me exactly what I hoped it would after Fallen Order and then some, with some of the scenes just breaking me completely.

This game is more of the same stuff you got out of Fallen Order. Personally, I think the spark of starwarsy joy is lesser, but still present. If you liked Fallen Order, you'll probably like this.

No doubt you're expecting me to mention the bugs and performance issues. The latter was far more my experience than the former; I experienced screen tearing, occasional framerate drops, and a single crash in my 32 hours of play. I will note however, that according to Steam's statistics, 45% of all players complete the story. That's actually a really good percentage, which indicates the performance problems *probably* aren't as widespread as people report.

Now, some thoughts:
There's a lot of stuff to do; this is a bigger game than Fallen Order and contains a ton of secrets and discoverable stuff. In 32 hours I'm nowhere near a 100%, that was my time to clear the main story (although I did spend a good amount of time wandering, hunting down secrets, and fighting bonus bosses). You start the game with most of the stuff you had in Fallen Order, none of the ""the protagonist inexplicably doesn't remember how to do things"" nonsense.

Story is a bit different; while the Empire is still an ever-present looming threat, they're not the main baddies this time around, but saying more would be spoilers. You'll spend most of your time exploring the planet Koboh, which serves as a hub, and occasionally venturing out to other worlds. Characters from the first game reappear, of course, but there are some new faces as well.

All in all, I think it's a good game, *on sale*. I would not pay 70 bucks for it, that's just too much even for AAA talent.",1708132500,1708132500,True,2,0,0.495145648717880249,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome. 

A solid sequel to the first one, although I still find the first a little bit better. The maps are much bigger than FO and that for me is a disadvantage as I felt FO more diverse, since the planets were quite distinct from each other. In survivor you get 2 large planets and a few very minor ones (which btw are not very nice looking). The planets are very well crafted with lots of distinct environments but I still lacked the feeling of exploring that galaxy far far away.

Other than that: a solid plot, a (extremely challenging) fight with Darth Vader and new challenges being added till the very end.

The game is very competent in reinventing itself as you progress, with new abilities being added gradually till the very end, which for me is very appealing as it feels refreshing all the way.

Regarding the technical issues, I decided to wait a few months to buy the game as I was concerned about the reviews, but now most issues seem to have been addressed. I luckily got away with very occasional CTD and lags, but other than that it ran fine. So I cannot complain about that. Hope EA learned their lesson though, and in the future avoid releasing such a good game with so many issues. It's a shame.

I like more here the combat then in fallen order and that's because for the lightsaber stances which is a great improvement and if you choose the best stance the fight it will be easy.

STORY:
*Star Wars Jedi: Survivor continues the legend of Cal Kestis and his relationships with the companions who previously appeared in Jedi Order, especially Merrin, did at least provide some excitement.

GAMPLEY:
*Combat is enjoyable as you’ll use Cal’s lightsaber and force powers to defeat various enemies including stormtroopers, bounty hunters, wildlife, and droids
*Each stance can be upgraded with special moves. I mostly used the single blade as it features more damage and the second most used stance is double blade just for the fast attack.

That said, I do recommend picking this game up at some point, if you are a star wars fan generally, or want to know the continuation of Cal Kestis's journey as a survivor.  This game is absolutely worth the $35 price point, but I would not pay full price due to that being encouragement to EA that their intolerable management of games is anything north of acceptable, as it clearly isnt.

Purchased it again almost a year after release. The game is still unplayable to me. Sure, I was getting 20-40 FPS before and now I'm getting 40-70 FPS. But i'm still getting less than 50% CPU and GPU utilization and having textures constantly downsample and microstutter everytime I turn around.

To people who are happy to play a game at 30FPS, it's probably worth it to buy on 50% discount. MAYBE even people who are happy to play at around 60 FPS. You'll probably be there 50% of the time.

But if you are ""spoiled"" like me, who is used to being able to run every game at 120+ FPS, it gives me a headache to play this to the point that it might as well be outputting 15 FPS. 

Also, the fact that STILL, almost a year later, the menu is not navigable with a keyboard, is testament to the fact that EA just does not care to make this game function properly on PC. 

Very disappointing.

One other annoyance, while not game ruining, is Respawn Entertainment doubling down on bad boss design for the animal bosses. particularly Spawn of Oggdo. Instead of taking in the feedback of Oggdo being horribly designed with Dark Souls 2 boss level tracking and outright broken hitboxes on some of his moves; they doubled down and memed about it with the reward you get.

The game also looks absolutely stunning and reminded me how far games have come in terms of graphics. 

With that being said I do have some complaints. The story felt a bit underwhelming. In this game, Cal struggles to continue following the Jedi Order and begins to question if he’s even making a difference. This was interesting but they kind of just put it off and introduced some new villains that felt kinda flat. There is not much in terms of the variety of planets to visit which is a shame being how beautiful the game looks. The game featured a sort of “hub planet” that offered side quests that didn't feel all that important or worth doing. In terms of performance, I didn’t have any huge issues other than annoying frame drops in certain locations. (Nothing game-breaking)

Final Take: I’d give it a 7/10. If you enjoyed Fallen Order or Star Wars in general, it's worth buying. That being said I would wait for a sale. I wouldn’t buy it at full price.

[code]If you're reading this and suffering controller problems, here's the closest thing to a workaround I've found:

Outside of a physical problem, there was a recent EA App update that screwed up controller support for a lot of people that play through Steam, including me. The workaround for that is to [b]kill any running EA app processes, open Steam and add the EADesktop.exe as a new game. Now launch the EA App through Steam and then Jedi Survivor through the EA app.[/b][/code]

Star Wars: Jedi:  Survivor (henceforth just Survivor, I'm not dealing with that many colons) is the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order (Henceforth Fallen Order).  In this game, you take control of Cal Kestis as you attempt to find a safe home from the Imperial Empire, whose grip on the galaxy at large has never felt so ironclad.  This journey will take you places, meeting (and subsequently lightsabering) interesting people, and whereas the first game's stakes were potentially galaxy-spanning, this one is far smaller, far more personal, and more character-focused.  It's all the better for it's tighter packaging than the original, especially given Disney's, shall we say, recent handling of the franchise.

Gameplay-wise, everything about Fallen Order's style of [i]'Baby's First Soulsborne Ring: Shadows Die A Lot'[/i] was already working, so Survivor's focus is taking that foundation and piling on [u]MORE.[/u]

More stances, more moves, more ways to play and engage with the combat system, as well as far, far more ways to customize Cal, your lightsaber, BD-1, and a blaster you acquire for one of your stances.  Respawn did not have to do this, especially not with how hectic combat gets, or the fact that said blaster is only used in one stance.  But they did, and I'm rejoicing all the more for it.

In fact, and much like last go around, exploration might yield small upgrades to your health and Force meters, and more stims, this series' Estus-alike - But a good chunk of your exploration rewards come down to customization rewards instead, and these always feel good, even if you never plan on using them.  Almost none of the customization is real-world cash locked, with the few bits that are being upfront in the Deluxe Edition, and if other games can do this avenue, I'd be down for it.

Graphically (when everything works), this game looks good.  Yes, to be expected considering we're up to the PS5/Xbox Series X as standard now, but I don't mean just 'oh haha look at all dem PIXELS'.  I mean this game looks and feels like a Star Wars movie, from the used future of Coruscant to Koboh's more 'Western IN SPACE' feel, from the Empire's sterile, distinctly hostile halls, to the High Republic's distinct style of futurism.  Respawn came at this game with a clear love for the source material, and it shows across the board.

Musically, it's also a home run - Again, Respawn clearly went at this after binging the first three films and chasing that binge with the prequels, because the music manages to pay homage to various themes in Star Wars history while also managing to be it's own thing, sampling the series while never ripping any music one-to-one from it, or only doing so for especially high-profile moments.

I played on a PS5 controller the entire way through, and aside from EA's updates actually breaking controller support, requiring me to download DSX to fix it, I had a decent time.  But this does bring me to my criticisms of Survivor, and unfortunately there are quite a few.

For starters, the PC port is a joke.  While consoles absolutely had it rough with this one too, the PC port stood out at launch for just how insanely awful it was, and while I mostly only ran into stutters outside of combat or funny graphical errors, I cannot and will not overlook that this game's technical state was and still is a mess that should've been left to cook longer.  I don't know if Respawn's QA just didn't have the manpower they needed, or if EA rushed this game out the door.  I can't name names and point fingers.  What I can do is lambaste the state of the game and say that it absolutely needs more fixes then it's getting, and that EA needs to stop breaking their products in half.

The price point only makes these technical issues more readily apparent - 70$ is nothing to scoff at and implies a premium product for the money spent.  To pay 70$ and have [b]this[/b] be what your hard-earned money gets you is disappointing, and while I had fun with this game and walked away enjoying myself, I also got this on sale for 50% off - I went in with reduced expectations and months of bug fixes, and this still wound up sometimes struggling on my computer - Small stutters, especially on launch, a need to compile files every single time I launched the game, and the odd moment where I clipped through geometry and had to quit to the title to fix it.

On less technical matters, the fact that the base gameplay is 'Fallen Order with extra stuff' can be hit or miss.  On the one hand, like I said, everything about Fallen Order was already working, don't fix what ain't broke.  On the other hand, however, the baseline combat system is in need of a bit of zing, and I played on Jedi Knight, the 'normal' difficulty, and found my best way to play was simply to use the basic combos for every stance, parrying when enemies tried to attack.  This is fine, it works, but hopefully the next game manages to find ways to spice up the combat system.

Additionally, the 'Metroidvania' approach taken, mostly on Koboh, your primary planet of sorts, means you'll be doing quite a bit of backtracking if you're out for 100% completion - and even if you aren't, you're still going to want the upgrades and extra stims exploration provides you - which, while the game does throw new enemies and make encounters a little trickier, to it's credit, the act of backtracking in and of itself can get repetitive fast, especially when it comes to treasure hunting, which can feel damn near like a pixel hunt.  Yes, the game does hand you upgrades that mark collectibles, but it felt like those were needed considering just how large these worlds are.

The final question is, 'Did I enjoy Jedi: Survivor?' and the answer is 'Yes, but...'.  I'm happy with my time spent here, and I admit to feeling like the 35$ spent wasn't wasted money.  However, I cannot emphasize this enough - [b]PLEASE, ONLY BUY THIS IS YOU'RE CRAVING MORE FALLEN ORDER, AND ONLY ON A SALE FOR AT LEAST HALF OFF.[/b]

The game's technical state is still sub-par, EA's app is still managing to find new and exciting ways of breaking the game, and honestly, much as this is going to suck for Respawn, I'd argue this game really isn't worth 70$, not for the bugs it's still dealing with across the board.  Honestly, if Steam had a 'Mixed Feelings' option, I'd pick that for this review.  It's kinda terrible that we only have 'yes' and 'no' for options, because at the end of the day, I enjoyed my time with Survivor, but I can understand if a lot of other people didn't enjoy their time with this game, or are frustrated with all the bugs.  I get it.  It's natural to expect a game that's charging 70$ to live up to that expectation, and seeing this game fall so far below par really does not do it any favors.

End of the day, buy this game on a steep discount - The story is great, the gameplay's good if you enjoyed the last game, it looks and sounds like Star Wars damn well should, but the technical side of things are a mess, and will likely remain a mess 'till the day Respawn has to stop patching.

I bought this after getting a 4080 Super thinking surely I could now just brute force my way through any optimization issues. In those first 30 minutes, I came to understand just how wrong I was. 

At 1440p on this 4080 Super, I cannot play this game with RTX effects enabled. I can barely get acceptable framerates with RTX off. DLSS does nothing to alleviate this problem. Frame Gen on the 40 series does, but within seconds you'll see the ghosting and artifacts on absolutely anything that moves, down to Cal's hair when moving and his head when turning the camera. You can actively see the generated frames being spliced in because you see whatever is behind moving objects. The thoroughly terrible optimization on full display, getting so few frames that you can see the generated ones without even trying. 

Again, all of this on a GPU second only to the 4090. Despite how much I loved the first game, and how much I'm sure I would love this one, I cannot recommend it. The fact that my GPU can run Cyberpunk with path-tracing on at full resolution, but not this game, is the only reason I need to tell you to avoid it.",1707961387,1707961545,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I decided to rate the game positively as I watch the end credits.
Despite all the technical shortcomings, constant crashes, framerate issues, etc. I have to give the writing staff and game designers huge kudos. The story is so rich, charged and at moments really funny, that I was absolutely immersed in the universe. I am at a loss for words explaining how beautiful this game looks too, leveraging all the power of Unreal Engine. The spirit of the Star Wars Saga really shines here. After the disaster that has been the Skywalker Saga, this is just so refreshing to experience. Not a single moment has been felt by me like it has been wasted. Grinding has been kept at a minimum, if you just want to enjoy a rich and beautiful story in a galaxy far, far away. (If you want to 100% it like I did, there is some grind, but still worth it...) A must for any Star Wars fan. That is why I implore the devs to make it technically more polished for the next installment, if one will ever surface. Thank you for a massive game, content-wise totally worth the asking price (especially on sale)

I have to say, great game, feels nice has so much more content than the last installment. It obviously runs great UNTIL the VRAM gets filled. I am almost 100% positive it is an oversight in ""garbage collection"" of the VRAM. I have ~130 fps on epic settings, until I see the VRAM being full on mangohud (Linux gamer here, hi), that is when the stutters happen, assets are obviously not being unloaded regularly and it is a major oversight. I know memory management and optimization is a hassle, but you will have to handle it eventually, or this is the last game I am purchasing from EA. It is not logical to me that there has to be 15 GB of VRAM used in an area where none of the previous assets, where the 15 GB got filled is visible to the player. Fix ya s**t !!!! Why I know it is an oversight on your part? Changing the visual settings to the lowest possible one does not change the VRAM utilized.",1705440595,1707960918,True,0,0,0.884945690631866455,23,True,False,False

I got the game on sale for $35, and at that price point it's kind of worth it, I guess. Paying the $70 full price would definitely be a rip-off.

The Good: 
 - The visual design is spectacular. The scenery, combat effects, flora and fauna, etc are really pretty. It feels wonderful walking around exploring these places. 
 - The combat system is interesting, visually appealing, and gratifying. The skill required to study your opponent, time your strikes, parries, and special actions makes it a fun challenge (I'm playing through on ""Jedi Master"" difficulty and it feels about right)
 - I enjoyed the mix of combat, exploration, and puzzle game play. It's not just running around killing everything in sight - there are interesting things to investigate, problems to solve, and places to explore. 

The Bad: 
 - The UI was clearly designed with a controller in mind, and very little effort was made to support mouse and keyboard. I refuse to spend even more money on a controller just to make this poorly built game a little more playable. If you're going to port the game to PC, you should support the default control scheme for a PC. 
 - Lots of graphics glitches. While the graphical design is spectacular, as described in ""The Good"", the implementation of that design leaves something to be desired. 
 - The game clearly has memory leaks. The frame rate is awesome for the first 20-30 minutes of game play, after which things get progressively more stuttery as we run out of memory (I have a RTX3060TI and 32G of ram). These issues should have been resolved in any of the recent patches, but nope.
 - The story line has potential, but falls flat in some areas. There appear to be some weird plot holes, but it's hard to tell because the story is hard to follow. Also, when you get story line information, it gets saved to a kind of database, but that database is really hard to navigate, so it's hard to look things up later.
 - In combat you lose the ability to look around. Your view is locked onto whoever the computer thinks is your primary opponent at the time. The greatly reduces your ability to move tactically. You pretty much just have to lock into combat with one particular opponent until they are dead and the game releases you to look around again. This gets especially annoying in battles with multiple opponents. 

The Ridicules: 
The rewards system of this game is chock full of intentionally silly nonsense that cheapens the experience and makes it feel more like a time waster mobile game than a AAA Title. While I'm happy to have moved on from Jedi Fallen Poncho, I'm still left deeply unsatisfied with this iteration. 

Loot that you find in the environment should make some reasonable amount of sense. For example: wandering around a bandit base and finding medical equipment (stims) or blaster parts absolutely fits within the setting. But hacking into a crate and finding a haircut or a beard is absurd. Unlocking character customization is fine, but a token amount of effort to make it less immersion breaking would really help. For example, there are shops all over the place. Add some barber shops that have different styles to choose from that you can unlock. 

Parts of the rewards system is based around doing things that seem very counter to the Jedi way. Looting scrolls from ancient archaeological sites and selling them for personal gain, for example, doesn't seem very Jedi to me. 

Conclusion: 
If you buy this game, I won't judge. You'll probably have some fun and enjoy the ride through some fun Star Wars content. However, technically, it is an absolute disgrace. As a software developer, I would get promptly fired if I pushed software of this caliber to production. This is clearly an example of a studio deciding to release something subpar out of greed and laziness, knowing that fans will buy it anyway because Star Wars.",1707944446,1707944446,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Just finished and overall I don't like this game. It is such a waste of potential, seems to be rushed production, messy and unpolished.

Game itself wants to be a mix of Tomb Raider - collecting meaningless (literally, mostly cosmetics) items on map and souls-like (respawning enemies, boss fights) and I believe it could be good if execution was not so damn poor.
Fights that are supposed to be hard are not because of some clever boss routine but because they are scripted to be unfair - for example very vague boss attack that kills you instantly (big frog, rancor) or series of unblockable attacks from multiple enemies overwhelming the player - it is simply not fun, but frustrating; lowering difficulty makes game no challenge at all. This aspect kills a lot of joy from Jedi Survivor.

The story is just meh, I mean I have seen it 1000 times already, feels like nobody cared much to make it interesting. Previous instalment felt like real SW movie, this is more an EA game.
Characters are mostly boring (with exception of Greeze) and had no real meaning, you may skip non cinematic dialogues and you loose nothing.

Tech issues are still there - stuttering, especially at new areas, memory leaks causing game to crash 2 times after long sessions (I have Ryzen 5700x + rx 6900 xt with 16Gb, I consider this a decent config), but they were not bothering me as much as poor gameplay.",1707939055,1707939055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall it's a great game with an engaging story, neatly building up and expanding on its predecessor, however the performance on PC is simply outrageous. In order to speed it up you can try the following:

1. Lock the game to 60 FPS directly in the Nvidia settings by selecting the .exe file in [i]Binaries/Win64[/i] folder
2. Disable Ray Tracing and/or DLSS
3. If you have a SSD + HDD setup, disable the paging on the HDD. To do so:
- Go to Settings -> System -> About -> Advanced system settings
- On the Advanced tab, look for the Performance section and click Settings
- On the Advanced tab, look for Virtual Memory and click Change
- Look for your HDD on the list and select it by clicking on it
- Choose ""No Paging File"" and click the Set button next to it
- Select your SSD and make it System managed and click Set again
- Reboot your PC to make the changes active and try starting the game again

That did it for me, allowing to play on Epic in 1440p relatively smoothly (on 3070). 
Still, the number of adjustments you have to make despite meeting the minimal and recommended requirements is unacceptable, don't buy this unless it's heavily discounted.

Other than some glitches like improper lightsaber stance animations I had a pretty fluid and fun time with it.

The combat is undoubtedly the best out of any Star Wars game. Flashy, varied, makes you feel like a god but is still challenging and rewarding. Literally Dark Souls with Light-sabers, and the new force abilities are amazing too. Lifting an entire stormtroopers squadron only to slam them intro the ground and then spinning my double-bladed saber around like a pinwheel through them killing them near instantly is so fucking gratifying. the Dual weidling lightsaber stance is quite possibly the best one in the game, do yourself a favor and try the game out with that stance alone. 

The story is definitely a lot less gratifying. Without getting into much spoilers it does weaken the overall experience for me personally close to the ending of the game. Especially with a certain reveal.

Otherwise, this is still a goated star wars game. Pick it up on sale and if you have a monster PC.

Good:
On a technical level, this is what a sequel should be. I loved that it didn't do a skill-reset like I see a lot in games. Powers-wise, it picked up where the first game left off. It expanded gameplay by adding new stances and companions. The telekinesis and confusion were great additions. 
The movement had some upgrades, namely the dash and the grapple shot thing. 
The story was pretty good. I loved playing as Cere, and fighting Vader felt really fun. I could feel my heart hammering in my ears as I finished it. 
I really liked the holo-tactics minigame and the process of recruiting people to the outpost.
The voice acting was pretty good, still hoping to see Cal in live action at some point. 

Middle: The game felt much smaller than Fallen Order. There were 7 planets with pretty sizeable maps in the first one and only 5 in this one, not including Tanalorr because just getting to Bode explores the entirety of the map. 
The maps we do have are either Desert Planet 1, Desert Planet 2, or Imperial Base I, Imperial Base 2, or Coruscant (Imperial base city). Having a map like Kashyyyk would have been great. In fairness, Desert Planet 1 (Koboh) had some cool and nicely colored areas. 
The maps were also very linearly designed, with only one real way to get to where you need to go. There was no room for thinking outside the box or navigating your own way, like the game tells you to when it introduces the lift and slam force moves. 
The movement, besides the dash and grapple, stayed pretty much the exact same. No fault for it, but it could definitely could see some improvement. 3rd game could maybe have a movement skill that adds triple jump or higher jumps or longer dashes or something. But this would really only be good if they didn't keep adding invisible walls to keep you from traversing any path but the ones the devs want you to take. 
While good, the story was incredibly short. It felt like maybe 2 or 3 missions with Bode before he betrayed Cal. No real time to make any emotional connections- just ""I have a daughter. raah I'm evil now"" 

Bad: It ran really poorly. I don't have a super beefy computer, but a 3070 and 16GB of RAM should've been able to run this pretty consistently. It did not. Even on medium settings, it still ran at ~40 FPS with a good deal of stuttering. 
Some of the bosses had moves that felt dumb. The hammer and axe droids come to mind with the spin-up attack that tracks you farther than your 2 dashes take you so you just kinda take damage no matter what you do. Maybe it was the stuttery performance, but that was far from the only enemy that felt like there was no counter once it started that move. The flip side to this is other enemies like Dagan were just too easy. I think I lost to Dagan once the entire game but after that he was too easy. It was more insulting since there was a time I beat Dagan without him landing a hit, and then it cut to a scene of him kicking me around. Just felt wrong to flip like that. I remember having to struggle against most of the bosses in the first game, but not here. The bosses were usually really easy, but the animals were much harder. I'd rather do the Cere-Vader fight again than fight a Sand-Wampa. 

All in all, this game sits at a 4.9 out of 10. Just on the edge of where I would recommend it. I had fun playing it, but the performance was sub-par for a game that's been out this long. The movement was linear and uninspiring, but the combat was great with new stances so it became a game of getting through traversal to fight. The story was too short, the planets too few, and the maps too small, so I would recommend buying it on sale like I did. Even having paid $35, the price seems a tad too high IMO. If you can get this for maybe $25 or $30 max, that would be about worth it.",1707855005,1707855005,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

A full jumping puzzle game, ok i knew what was getting into since i played the first, but the story?? OMG what a bunch of CRAP! Jedis now use pistols!!! wtf??? And the usage of pistols along with a lightsaber is a stance, whats next? Hand grenades? or missile launchers? Next serious plot BS  they give in to their passions , the fall in love kiss the girl, whats next? Cracking a cold one with the boys watching football? Honestly the scriptwriter was on some serious shit, he said ok, today I am going to destroy the lore of the Star Wars universe with the approval of Disney. Thats story wise, game mechanic wise there is no point in searching for cosmetics, i mean why spend hours looking for chests just to get a set of colours?

Recently, however, I've run into a HUGE issue... Controller support.
This game is quite literally built around the use of a controller, it even brings up a prompt that to have the best and most enjoyable play-through, you should use a controller.

Previously, I used my Xbox Series controller with absolutely ZERO issue, but after picking the game back up, it straight just doesn't work anymore. Pressing the left thumb-stick brings up a giant on-screen keyboard and I cant even pause the game without hitting ESC on my keyboard. None of the other buttons work at all and it seems the camera is stuck in ""fastasfuckboi"" mode. It's only ""playable"" with MaKB and I really don't want to play the game like that, because, at time of review, I JUST beat, at a nearly 100%, Fallen Order, using the same exact controller.

I might update the review if this issue gets fixed by the Devs before I figure it out myself but I spent a solid 2 hours online searching for a solution and nothing seems to work.

The story is so much more interesting and you can clearly tell the dev. team spent the time between releases thinking deeply on how they could make a rich and satisfying story about grief. I would say more but going into this knowing nothing made me enjoy it a lot more (it would also be very spoilery). 

The gameplay is also much deeper than the first and I love the different additions to the styles of combat. Cal must have the most advanced lightsaber in history at this point with how customisable it is.

It does away with most of the jank that rubbed me wrong in that original game, combat feels tighter and deeper with the fun addition of upgradeable stances, and traversal is made much more engaging from the start as Cal thankfully already has most abilities unlocked by the start of the game this time around. 
Maps are larger, but thankfully fast travel is here so as to not make returning to places as a chore as it was before. The overall structure of the game is pretty similar still, though some meatier side content lets you spread out the main story missions and explore the planets a bit more. I’m still uninterested in collectibles here, cosmetics are simply not worth the time investment of solving puzzles and re-exploring areas, but force tears are a welcome addition to the exploration side of the adventure.
Some of the new things added do feel underbaked, especially the perks system. At least while playing in normal, I didn’t need to pay attention to it, and when I did, I was fairly frustrated by the limitations imposed on equipping them.
It still is a pretty standard AAA action adventure game, with big set pieces and an entertaining story that aside from some standout moments wont linger in your mind for long after rolling credits. Still, I really enjoyed that it narratively involves the High Republic era and that it doesn’t just stick to the familiar tropes like Fallen Order did. There are a few surprises, new and interesting characters, and compelling developments to the existing cast. It felt rather fresh in comparison to the major Star Wars media we’ve been getting in the last couple of years.
Performance is pretty solid for most of the game, though it takes a real dip in the last couple of missions. Clearly the team prioritized optimizing the first chapter, which ran nearly flawlessly, to the detriment of the rest of the game. It’s playable, it didn’t affect my experience all that much, but It’s a clear stain on a pretty damn solid game that I hope the devs fix up.",1700592290,1707778757,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Thankfully, that time never came. I loved the first Jedi game, and if you also did, you'll likely love this even more. In terms of the story and actual gameplay so far, it gives you more of the good stuff laid out in fallen order (plus extra) and the increased open feeling of the game compared to the first makes it even more fun to explore.

It was worth buying, but i'm glad I waited. Releasing this game underdone had unfortunately marked it's reputation for what could've been a no asterisk celebration of a great sequel. It's always frustrating seeing time and time again AAA publishers push something out too soon, leaving devs to scramble months after fixing the game under public scrutiny.

You don't need to optimize files for a menu, and you don't need to load game level files while you're in the main menu. You can do that when the level loads like every other game.

The game lags on my very strong and new PC. This is the only game that lags out of my entire Steam library. I'm being completely honest. There isn't a single game I own that lags, other than Jedi Survivor. It's as if the game is completely unoptimized. Look through all of my other reviews, and you won't find a single mention of lag in any of them.

Some of the audio clips are loud and staticy, as if the sound file is clipping. Either the files are actually clipping, or something is causing them to be played way too loud.

The stamina bar on some of the taller bosses is always near the top of the screen. When you finally drain their stamina bar and break their stance, their stamina bar can go high up off-screen, which causes you to miss out on a visual queue for your small attack window. I don't understand why your wouldn't have the enemy stamina bar height limit set to the top of the screen.

The bosses' projectile weapon throw can go through walls and buildings. This is bad game development. At least have it bounce off or hug the wall. Removing collision is lazy, and looks terrible, and isn't fair to the player.

The game stops when you have the boss at 5% health, to tell you that you can use a new or changed ability, as if that isn't one of the worst times to stop the game and tell you information that you didn't need to beat the boss. They even force you to hold a button to auto-kill the the boss that's at 5% health. Senseless.

This game crashed during the middle of a cut-scene. I don't think this has happened to me since I played a game on xbox 360. Even then I don't know if those crashes were ever during a cut-scene.

While Jedi: Survivor improves on many things from the original, the lack of planet variety after finishing the game was disappointing because while each planet is exponentially larger than the ones in Fallen Order, the scenery doesn't vary nearly as much. The game play is great albeit slow and cumbersome at times but overall leaves you satisfied and thirsting to explore for more. Jedi: Survivor's story has me really conflicted. Without going in to any spoilers, I'll just say that after a certain point the plot was easily predictable and could've been handled differently to create a more satisfying and interesting ending.

With these criticisms aside however, Jedi: Survivor is definitely worth playing if you enjoyed Fallen Order. It does a really good job with the open-world and the level of customization is awesome--both cosmetically and in terms of game play styles with the new stances. I recommend using a controller while playing.

- Why I chose to leave a negative review.

     - I bought it on steam so I can have the convenience of launching it from the same launcher I use every time I play a game. Steam Launcher is objectively better than EA, Ubisoft, Epic, Paradox. ect... ect...

     - Every damn time I launch the game it EA launcher runs and it does a loading screen saying its checking my computer to optimize the settings of the game. Takes 30 sec. Then it runs me through choosing a bunch of first time launch settings. That I have all ready set up. Then it tries to play the long ass catch up video in case I did't play the first game. It's all very frustrating.  
     
     - I was able to bypass EA launcher on the first game. So, i was able to use my Bluetooth controllers. Can't use controllers with EA Launcher. There are no setting anywhere on EA launcher for controller support. Steam Launcher you can use any Bluetooth controller. Now i'm stuck using keyboard and mouse after having just mastered the controller having just beaten the first game.

The issue is that in order to make this work, you have to either learn brand new skills, or as is the case in this game, mysteriously forget how to use the Force.....again.  For force skills, pushing is one skill, pulling is another skill, but to push or pull things up or down, instead of forward or backwards? Well that is an entirely DIFFERENT skill than pushing or pulling, and you don't remember how to do this until 2/3s of the way through the game. Game bloat!
 Can't land at a base cause of reasons,  so you land at a distance and you go on foot through some crazy back trails and platforming hellscape, but a storm stops you, so you wait overnight and end up at the base just as your ship is landing at the base as well, making your entire prior level utterly worthless.
 For the entire Jedi order being wiped out, everyone is suspiciously well-equipped against lightsabers, including raiders and regular imperial troops.
  All of this is to make your time more difficult, but it is so glaringly obvious that it just feels like game bloat.
 Instead of dealing with the forms for lightsaber combat, they just did it stupid-like.  Hit the enemy with the blade, thats a skill!  Now, hit them HARDER, thats another skill!  Hit them HARDER and FURTHER, thats an entirely new skill!  Now dual-wielding, double-ended, and extra-long sabers are all different skill trees, and each one iterates just like this.  Game bloat.  The Vader fight is truly one of the lamest battles I've ever seen in a video game.  I just quit after that, it was so.....STUPID.  Lame-ass overpowered enemy you know you can't kill, unblockable attacks that track and slide across the map to grab you, being pushed, pulled and knocked down at will.  And he kills you at the end.

The Good: Story, Graphics, continuation on original game
- There are new skill trees that compliment what you already know from the first game. 
- You start game with double jump and force push/pull etc so you're not starting over.
- They really add to the skills you learned in the first game with new skills like jump dash and ascension cable but your really want to have played the first game and learned those skills or this will be a challenge
The Bad: 
- Most garbage PC port ever made. They just didn't care. 
- Mouse is wonky and doesn't work well in the menus. 
- It's nearly impossible just to key bind because the mouse and controls are so bad
- Some of the keys are unbound and you have to end task and restart the game and bind them. 
- If you change the jump key you can't jump off of walls when running and also later when climbing. You then get stuck unless you use default key binds.
- The port was done so poorly that you get a reminder every time you load that you should get a controller and not use a keyboard and mouse
- Nothing is optimized. and the game optimizes files for 5 to 10 minutes every time it's loaded
- As much as I am loving this game I am tempted to get a refund because I can't use key binds I want. You can change the defaults but then they don't work",1707666147,1707677390,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

to elaborate on the dislikes:
1. any non-combat force fracture i played was a massive headache, the reward was subpar for my efforts.
2. most boss battles in the game had some gimmick i found, at Jedi Master difficulty, to be annoying to deal with.

in conclusion, the game is NOT worth $70, and should be picked up on a sale, the lack of optimization is shocking, as i could play Fallen Order on its epic settings smoothly, but here i need to run medium or low to get a slightly worse performance than that.

This is a good game, it's just the pitiful performance that hinders it. So far I have managed around 30 hrs of game play and would not recommend the PC/current version of this game. The performance is just atrocious and the bugs that are present are frustrating. 

I was truly excited about this game and pre-ordered it but the post-nut clarity has kicked in gentleman. This game could have been GOTR but this launch is just awful sadly. There's no way that the performance of this game was an oversight and EA's recent excuse for the poor performance due to OS is just stupid. The game should have been delayed point blank period. 

The executives/management need to play their own game and see if it's tolerable. I feel for the devs, there are a lot of details in this game but the quality of life in this game is painful and frustrating. I wouldn't have minded waiting for a month for the Devs to improve the quality of life of the game. As someone who pre-ordered the game and paid $90, it shouldn't ever feel like your BETA testing it but this game does sadly.

But there's no denying that from a gameplay, atmospheric, and graphical perspective, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor improves and refines on its predecessor to a high degree. 

Beginning with the single best opening to a Star Wars game since the Darth Vader prologue from The Force Unleashed, Survivor sets out to deliver an exhilarating action-adventure title with improved combat and customisation, and it succeeds: You can perform Force Mind Tricks which can allow enemies to temporarily fight on your side, you're given not one, not two, but FIVE different combat stances to master and upgrade, you're given an AI partner in some sections and you can make use of special attacks through this partner character, and of course the combat still f---ing ROCKS: You get all the powers you gained in Fallen Order right off the bat, new force attacks to wield and master, and you're given more challenging enemies to use these skills on, and the loop of pulling an enemy in and stabbing them, swapping to the other stance for crowd control or fast damage, engaging two other enemies with said lightsaber stance and then swapping to good ol' single-bladed to block, parry, and eliminate the elite feels so bloody satisfying.

So overall, though the console versions are a better choice due to their better optimisation, now is a perfectly good time to buy Jedi: Survivor on PC.

Edit:
Looking into it more this seems to still be a pattern with EA especially for pc ports. Here are some more details on my experience. The game had issues with big picture mode (I could hear the audio for the overlay but it wouldn't show and the controller lighting kept changing to the default every few minutes unless I hit the button for the overlay) the first time I launched but it did work eventually. After that however I can hear the game but not see it. On top of that the performance is pathetic even on reduced settings. To top it all off despite me buying the game ON STEAM they forced me to install their garbage platform for a SINGLE PLAYER only game. 

Come on EA this game could have made you a fortune if it just worked. The previous game was a smash hit and this could have been too if you just put a little more care into making a quality product. Its been around a year since release and its still unplayable for a lot of people. Get your garbage out of a single player game that has no use for it and make a decent product. Thats all you had to do and I would have bought this on day one at full price happily (I had even booked vacation time to play that I cancelled when I saw the state of it). Now here I am absolutely loving the previous game (I bought it in ps4 and pc and played it multiple times on both) reluctantly returning the game because its just not where it should be.

And FWIW, I am a very technical PC gamer. I keep a very clean Win10 installation for gaming and have decent hardware: Ryzen 5950x, RTX 3070Ti, 32 GB G.Skill 3600 CL14 RAM, Samsung 980 Pro, X570...and it still runs like a potato. 

I'm also a software developer myself so I understand the technical hurdles. But they're not THAT difficult. This is just corporate greed. I'm sure EA didn't give the developers enough time or resources to properly port this to PC -- I've played it on PS5 and it was pretty great (after the first few patches). I would have gladly bought this game again on PC if it worked properly. But the port is so terrible that now I kinda feel bad for giving EA any of my money in the first place when I bought it for PS5.

Just an over all improvement over the first game with no sequelitis...yet.

 BIG performance issues were encountered throughout the entire game and i almost broke my save 2/3rds of the way through my game by marooning my self on top of an elevator because i somehow managed to bypass a cutscene, a boss fight, and an ability unlock with the ability being story related and required to progress. I had to jank my way out and my save was real screwy after that with previously unlocked cosmetics and items being gone and unobtainable or equippable.

I had no intention of bypassing an entire section of a stage, i was just going where i thought the game wanted me to and it was not difficult to bypass as all i did was jump to a ledge.

Environmental variety was also very disappointing. Just different flavors of desert and some basic space stations environments. In the Star Wars universe there are so many different planets and incredible environmental diversity but in the game you just go on a tour of the southwest...

But, putting aside performance, the game itself is fantastic. In my opinion, an improvement over the first game. In particular, the ability to choose your own playstyle with the 6 stances on offer made for a lot of fun deciding what I liked best. I also quite liked the story, with the new and returning characters all making for interesting dynamics and memorable beats.

After 8-9 patches the game is still lagging sometimes. See Digital Foundry's review after 6 months. The latest patch from around 17-01 completely ignores my controllers.

For me it presents as such: The game thinks I am using mouse and keyboard while I'm using a controller. So the in-game prompts change from X/Y/A/B to ""enter"" or different symbols/prompts. The controller input for entering into the menu translates to a backwards dash. When I press ""B"" to go back in the menu it trips up/flips out. It wants to translate multiple inputs at the same time. The audio signals as much, giving me at least 3, maybe 4 or more ""clicks"".

Here's what I tried:

    Unplugging keyboard and mouse and other peripherals, just to check if these were causing it. No solution, 
    the issue persists.
    Different controllers, checking if the controller is faulty. No solution, the issue persists.
    Tried the same controller on different games. No issue. So this proves it is not the controller.
    Checking file integrity through the Steam app. No solution, the issue persists.
    Uninstalling the game and reinstalling through Steam. No solution, the issue persists.
    Checking for Windows updates and GPU updates. No solution, the issue persists.
    Raising a Help-desk ticket with EA. No solution, ""we do not support your peripherals"".

I've had a friend confirm this. Through Steam, they downloaded both Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Their controllers (DS4 and DS5) both work fine on Fallen Order. But Survivor provides the same issues as I am experiencing. So this seems to be the work of the new patch.

I really want to undo the latest patch, but EA support is no help. The game has become unplayable.

The only way I've been able to get it back in working order now has been to ""add a game"" to my Steam library. That ""game"" is the EA app. Now I have to start the EA app through Steam, then start the game. And the graphics have been downgraded in this way.

Horrible framerate that you can't increase no matter what you do. I have a top end PC and no matter what I do the damned fps won't go higher than 80. average fps I'm getting is like 60 and it dips to the 40's sometimes. Lowering resolution doesn't work and overclocking my cpu didn't do shit. Even setting fsr to maximum performance didn't do shit. This is unacceptable. Why doesn't the game have dlss? I guess this is your fault EA for siding with a shitty ass budget company like AMD. Their fsr is just bad. Oh and I must not forget to mention the crashes, just had two in a row. 

I'm more mad at myself for not waiting on the game but what can I say, I was excited to play it and didn't have anything else to play. It's just a shame, because I'm sure that if the game ran perfectly I would actually highly recommend to play it.\
Update after finishing the game: The performance is still shit, they haven't released a single patch during the time I played it, texture glitches, fps drops and stutters all over. Just wait until they fix it and get it on sale, which is a shame because aside from all the performance issues the game is quite good.

So I full heartedly recommend this game, because it just really is that amazing.

Update (Post Patch 8): After the most recent patch, I started a new play through. I ran into some issues with the framerate of the game causing some crashes, but these were ultimately fixed by setting my fps to 60 in my GPU driver settings for the game. There is no fps setting in game. Following setting a limit on the fps, I still experienced a few crashes, but they were limited to one very spoiler-y area near the end of the game.

Each stance can be upgraded with special moves. I mostly used the double blade as it features fast attacks and long reach, which helped me to evade enemy attacks.

•	Many enemies will try to shoot you from long range, but if you time blocks correctly, your lightsaber will deflect the blaster bolts back to damage or kill the enemy.

•	I regularly used force push to knock weaker enemies off ledges for instant kills. One time I even managed to do this to a miniboss who still had about 80% of their health bar remaining. You can also use the force to pull enemies, throw your lightsaber, and use mind trick to make enemies attack each other.

•	Most of the game takes place on the planets Koboh and Jedah, in addition to a couple of smaller planets and a brief visit to Coruscant.

•	Playing on Jedi Knight difficulty (the middle of five options), combat is challenging but mostly fair. I really struggled with the final boss [spoiler]who for some reason is significantly more powerful than Darth Vader[/spoiler], and because I wasn’t enjoying the game for reasons that I’m about to get to, eventually I just dropped down to story mode so I could be done with it.

•	Much of the action takes place miles above ground level, and you have to navigate terribly designed maps which are full of huge gaps where you can fall to an instant death. You’ll need to jump, double jump, air dash, wall run, grapple and rope swing. The further you progress in the game, and the more force powers you unlock, the longer and more annoying these sequences become, regularly requiring the player to chain together 15-20 moves, and if you slightly miss time anything, you’ll have to go all the way back to the start of the sequence and do it all again. And there were a number of occasions where I was confused about where I needed to go next, or how to actually get there, which frequently interrupted the pace of the combat.

•	Sure, Fallen Order had some sections like this, but while those were relatively short, Jedi Survivor’s maps are entirely built around it. Maybe some players like this kind of gameplay, but I don’t. It reminds me of the difference between Doom 2016 (which I loved) and Doom Eternal (which I hated, and yes I know I’m in the minority there too).

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is nothing special, I think it suffers from the villains not being interesting characters, but its at least better than some of the recent Disney+ TV shows (Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka).

•	Cal’s struggle with the dark side, and his relationships with the companions who previously appeared in Jedi Order, especially Merrin, did at least provide some excitement.

•	Voice acting is good.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 25 hours to complete the main story and a few side quests.

•	While I didn’t notice any significant framerate drops, the performance doesn’t feel smooth, like there are frequent small stutters (i7-12700K, 32GB DDR4, RTX 3080, 1440p). The first few hours seemed mostly fine, but it got worse the further I progressed. Koboh has the worst problems, but as its also the biggest planet, this is where you’ll spend the most time.

•	I also regularly noticed white flashes at the edge of the screen while panning the camera sideways inside buildings. I can’t remember seeing this before in other games so I don’t know what is causing it, perhaps the game was loading textures slightly slowly, even though its installed on my SSD.

•	The game optimises some files (I’m assuming shaders) every time you start it up, it doesn’t take long, but considering the above issues, I’m not sure if this actually does anything.

•	The game crashed twice with no error message. By itself its not the end of the world (I can live with 2 crashes in 25 hours), but it still deserves to be added to this list of shame.

•	Level up menu doesn’t tell you what the abilities further up the tree actually do until you acquire the ability immediately below it. I’ve never seen a game do this, usually you can see the whole skill tree to plan your character build in advance, so this is a really dumb design decision.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Jedi Survivor isn’t a terrible game, and if Steam’s review system allowed a neutral option I would have picked that, but overall my feelings are more negative than positive.

While my dislike for the aerial gymnastics is a personal preference which other players might not have a problem with, you’ll still have to deal with unacceptable technical performance which gets in the way of the otherwise enjoyable combat and story.

I wrote a more in depth review of that game but I will give my spoiler-free takeaways from this game here briefly then get into some mild spoilers (same as the last review I will not spoil the best part)

What I liked: 
- The atmosphere of this game
- The skill progression
- The story

What I didn't like
- The number of planets
- The polish
- The graphics/performance

[h2] Atmosphere [/h2]
This was by far the best part of the game. The Jedi series does a great job at linking episodes 3 and 4 well, as this is probably the coolest time period in Star Wars, and this game expands upon Fallen Order. I'll spoiler flare this, but the coolest faction you fight in this game are the Bedlam raiders and it may be just because I am a [spoiler] prequel fan [/spoiler] but I thought it was cool and logical how they used [spoiler] battle droids [/spoiler] in their armies. Fighting them at the same time as stormtroopers is so mind blowing to me. The wild west was done well with my favorite part of the game Koboh. The planet has so much to explore and feels like a home base which I think the franchise desperately needed. Some of my favorite moments in the game was just getting lost and exploring Koboh. I also enjoyed the customization in this game a lot more than Fallen Order. I got to pick all of my favorite colors, outfits, hairstyle, lightsaber, etc very early on due to my exploration and am very satisfied with how I made Cal look. 

[h2] Progression [/h2]
I thought this game did progression in a similar way to Fallen Order but better. I enjoyed trying out all of the different lightsaber configurations you can do - however I stuck to [spoiler] dual sabers + cross-guard [/spoiler] for most of the game. I also enjoyed the progression with regard to mobility, of which I think Survivor did better than Fallen Order. I would get lost exploring Koboh, and for example see a [spoiler] balloon [/spoiler] and be confused why I cannot progress through the map but realized I just needed to progress through the story to unlock that mobility. It feels more arbitrary than in Fallen Order, where you would learn double jump or something, but in Fallen Order I found the mobility upgrades specifically more fun with regards to exploring Koboh. 

[h2] Story [/h2]
I won't get into much about the story, however I very much enjoyed it from start to finish. At the end of Fallen Order we assembled a cool cast of characters and when I picked up this game I was expecting us to pick up right back where we left off. However, to my initial dismay we did not get that and instead got a time jump. However, I would argue that this payed off when I consider the course of the narrative and especially the ending. Yes, you are in a sense re-assembling the same cast of characters however to me it adds to the atmosphere. How the characters changed and how the exist at the end of the story. I very much enjoyed the story's conclusion. If I were to criticize the story, I'd say that the game could have handled the Villains better. There were a few main Villains and I would argue that two of the three were handled okay and one was handled masterfully. 

[h2] Planets [/h2]
I have basically stated that my main enjoyment in this game has been Koboh. That is true, but honestly it is the only planet in this game that was interesting to explore. The other planets feel half baked and visually boring especially when you compare this game to Fallen Order. We do get a fan favorite map Coruscant which a Star Wars game has desperately needed for a while. However, I would say that the only map with any replay value is Koboh. Most everything else you can fully explore while progressing through the story. One of my favorite parts of these two Jedi games were back tracking and exploring new things you've unlocked but only one planet does this. You could argue that value and quality of Koboh is worth multiple planets, but if that is the case they need to make the other planets visually distinct from Koboh. Which they weren't. The overall color pallet of the games planets is very monochromatic. For example, in Fallen Order when you visit Kashyyk this disrupts the color pallet with a very green planet. But when you go from a desert to the wild west to a grey moon rock the colors don't change that much and it can look boring visually. 

[h2] Polish [/h2]
This game is very unpolished. Sure, there's a big map to explore but so many things you walk on you feel like you're about to phase through the map. For example, lets say there's an X wing on the map if you jump onto it nine times out of ten you would phase right through it, slide off, or be standing on an invisible box feet above the structure. Only one of ten times would you jump on something that isn't the standard pathways you would traverse and actually stand on it like you would if this was real life. It gets frustrating when you go to explore around the map but the map would decieve you and actually the developers didn't bother coding collision physics. The game also just generally feels clunky. With regards to bugs, I only ever experienced one bug that was basically the EA launcher and steam launcher disagreeing with my controller inputs which was solved by launching the EA launcher through steam. 

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
Biggest complaint right here. I have lower to medium computer PC specs when you consider what is needed to play this game. And I had to run the graphics at the lowest possible setting and would barely get an average 30-45 fps. And that's with the game looking straight up worse than a Ps2 game. I would rather just be playing an other ps2 or ps3 game from a visual standpoint, as it would look and run better. Which is crazy, this is a huge trend in the modern gaming sphere where games are vomited out horribly optimized meaning people have to buy crazy expensive GPUs when the devs could just optimize their games or just make games with ""worse"" graphics but run better performance wise. You could even stylize it to make up for the ""worse"" graphics and by ""worse"" I mean not photo realistic which I don't even want anyways I just want decent performance. There were times where Cal looked like a lego figure which was crazy but luckily everything else about the game made it worth playing.",1706764590,1706764590,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The PC was restarting itself every time I tried to start it. Turns out the problem was only in my ten-year-old power supply.

With the latest 24.1.1 adrenaline, Ryzen 5 3600 and 32 GB DDR4 RAM and RX 6800xt, the game currently gives 100+ fps in 4K epic settings with FSR balance.
As for the game; I've played Fallen Order before and liked it very much. I thought it truly reflected the unique atmosphere of the Star Wars world, even though it had its shortcomings. In the first episode, we met our young character named Cal Kestis, who took his first step towards becoming a magnificent Jedi, and of course his companions. As for Jedi Surviver, I'm only on the planet Koboh at the end of the 10th hour, and even now I can easily say that they have surpassed the first game in every aspect. Brand new mechanics added to the game, the richness of storytelling, graphics that have improved with the development of technology, tons of different creatures from the depths of the Star Wars universe... In short, the game is truly magnificent. However, in a way that I cannot understand at all, EA managed to turn this game, which could be a candidate for one of the best games of 2023, into a technical disaster and not even be a candidate for anything, or let's say it was a candidate for the disaster of the year award. For now, without further ado, I'll end this review by saying that it's a game that definitely deserves its full price, with not much possibility that it will change. 9/10",1703437118,1706739613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They didnt work either, but even if they did, they shouldnt be needed for a game made by a company as big as EA.

Edit at 30 hours: 
I got the game to work with an average of 40-50 fps, though it was still extremely laggy in certain parts of the map. If it wouldn't be for the lags, the gameplay would be real fun. If you liked the first game, you would also like this one.

[MINOR STORY SPOILERS] I finished most of the story, and while the story itself was also quite good, it wasn't focused on the empire. This obviously led to fewer fights with stormtroopers and such, which I find quite sad, as they were my favorite enemys. Also, the raiders suddenly having like 50 guys with laser swords for their boss fights felt pretty random.

     63 hours in, after enjoying quite a bit of the game, my controller simply - one moment - became remapped to randomized inputs.  I tried everything I could on the game - remapping the buttons, resetting the control scheme, disabling STEAM mapping.  Tried the controller in other games - worked perfectly fine.  There were times in the initial stages of the issue becoming present where it would occur, then go away, so I tried reboots, restarts, and a variety of 'turn it off and turn it back on again' type solutions for both hard and software.  Nothing worked.  Cal just continued to randomly jerk around and I couldn't even get to the settings menu with my controller - it had suddenly become a block - wait no a force power - wait no a block button.  Frustration, sadness, and shock.

     Sadly, after a series of several days of attempting to find a solution, I realized that the issue had replaced my enjoyment of the game with a constant fear that even if fixed this issue would sneak back up and randomly eliminate my ability to progress further into the game with a controller.  This has now - after consideration and reflection - completely removed my desire to continue what I would consider a potential waste of time and effort.

   If you use a controller, be aware of potential issues.
   If you use a controller, have had this issue, and are willing to share how you fixed it, please let me know.  I am open to revisiting this if a root cause and solve is available.

Since the last patch the game doesnt run for long as I keep on having crashes due to a ""lack"" of VRAM (Im running a 7900xt with 20gigs...) I dont seem to be the only one either.

Pros
-----
-A worthy successor of Jedi - Fallen Order in terms of gameplay, mechanics and story
-Familiar characters for people who follow Star Wars Verse
-Its cool to see Bode use his Jetpack
-The Coruscant level was fun despite FPS being in 40s, it didn't feel unsmooth overall even when the fps dipped to 25
-I like the game so far.
-They released a patch in sept 2023, which means they haven't given up on this game. I hope they release future performance patches that totally fix the issues.

Cons
------
- The planet level that follows Escape from Coruscant seems a bit boring even with fps staying at 60 but i had only played a little. 

ADD - Post playing 23 hrs i can say that the game is a bucket load of fun
ADD#2 - 100% achievements seem to require a second play through and involve a bit of a grind. I won't be doing that, at least not for achievements.",1694404925,1706672899,True,8,0,0.537644922733306885,0,True,False,False

Below I am going to list some pros and cons of the game and you can decide if you want to play it. I did end up 100%ing the game in the end which took awhile so I will also be factoring those factors in replayability, gameplay, and such. 

Pros:

⚪ The Story. The story for Jedi: Survivor was amazing in every way and it truly made this game feel like a Star Wars game while exploring such an unknown area of the lore and mixed it with amazing moments and a great plot-twist.

⚪ The Gameplay. The gameplay for this game was unique, there was variety, and it was VERY smooth. The variety of the different lightsaber stances that Cal obtained gave you SO much variety. Fighting enemies and bosses with different abilities and moves felt so unique to your specific playstyle and I absolutely loved that. Even when 100%ing I still had fun because I was able to try out two lightsaber stances that I really hadn't touched. 

⚪The World. The world of each planet in this game was so expansive. Even for smaller planets like Coruscant, it still felt like there was so much to do there because of the constant movement of the world around. And as for the biggest planets Koboh and Jedha, it was fantastic. It was everything I could've asked for in a Star Wars game when exploring and everything was always kept fresh even when going for 100%.

⚪The Characters. Now this is something that drastically improved from Jedi: Fallen Order. Characters like Merrin have been brought up from basically nothing into fan-favorites. Other more side-characters like Cordova really had you make more of an attachment even though you hadn't seen them in Jedi: Fallen Order (in person). Caij, Doma, Turgle, Zee, and even Skoova are all characters I'd love to see return because of the way that they were represented and the personality that they had. 

Cons:

⚪The Optimization. Optimization and graphic issues for this game have been extremely common unfortunately. Frame drops, crashes, bugs, grainy areas, and more have been evident in players' play sessions and it really has brought the game's hype down. With future patches I am hoping this will go away and if it does completely, I will update this review as needed but for now, expect bad optimization.

⚪Character Movement and Quality of Life. This is more of a small scale thing but I was always annoyed by the character movements in some in-game cutscenes and in other areas. Whether they were walking or speaking, it just felt robotic at times. Once again this is small and for the most part it looks fine but I'd thought I'd add it in.

Overall, Jedi: Survivor is an absolute must-play for any Star Wars fan and an encouraging play for non Star Wars fans. With some bad optimization and bugs, the game has received backlash but that is and will be fixed (I hope at least). The pros in this game do really outweigh the cons here and I want you if you're reading this to play and try this game. You won't regret it. 

My Final Rating (Currently): 92/100
(for note Jedi: Fallen Order for me was a solid 88/100)

I've played about 30 hours with only one crash, whereas before it would be crashing every 30 minutes. Major improvement. Still not great performance, but it's so much better. It's to the point where I'd say it doesn't hinder game play anymore. (I play with all settings on low, and it runs well most of the time) I recommend playing on Jedi Master, other difficulties are too easy / too hard. I had the most fun on that one.

But, then I couldn't actually remember much about KOTOR 2 so I went back and played through it immediately after Jedi Survivor. Then I started watching the movies, all of the originals and then the prequels. And I replayed Fallen Order. And then I watched a few shows, started reading the books and am now back to Jedi Survivor doing my new game plus run. Really, what this game is is a joyous romp through the galaxy so many of us have grown up with. It is the best that galaxy has ever looked and sounded (my god, the music in this game is *perfect Star Wars) and it is just reveling in the characters this series has given us. Cal, Greez, Merrin and Cere are all woven into the fabric of Star Wars in ways that develop them much more than the meandering plot of the game. And that's fine. The plot of Star Wars has rarely been the point-- it's always about the characters. And what this game reminded me is that no matter how you feel about the current state of Star Wars it is still fantastic to get lost in all the stories told over the last 50 years. This game brought me back to Star Wars in a way I haven't been as exuberant about since I was a child.

Going back to KOTOR 2 made me realize how similar these two games are. Both are strange stories, fragmented and a little unfocused but both are pushing against the boundaries of typical Star Wars narratives. Both explore the meaning of Jedi and what forms the force can take. And both games are fundamentally busted. KOTOR 2 needs a mod to fix its rushed conclusion and unbalanced gameplay. Jedi Survivor needs serious compromises to be made to enjoy it on a technical level. Both games feel like these patched together, barely functioning experiences with directive vision that outpaced the technical foundations of the games. They barely work. But, wow when they do, there's a magic to these games that is the promise delivered by the very notes of the iconic music that's been echoing around since before many of us were born. 

I appreciate this game for so many things. The art direction is stunning at all times. Coruscant has never looked better and Koboh is FILLED with secrets. There are so many gestures and hints at the wider galaxy that on a second playthrough I am grinning at the references to Manaan, and Nar Shaddaa and giddy at the cameos hinted at. I forgive the game when it freezes, or stutters, or I get mauled from the often clumsy combat. I slow down and poke around the planets and sometimes just rush to the next story beat because I want to know where these characters will end up. And now that I've seen where it all goes, I just want to go back and spend more time with them in this delightful world Respawn has made. Hopefully, the game will be uncompromised by technical issues sometime soon (or in five years when new technology can brute force through the problems) but until then it is still the second best Star Wars game ever made. 

My tips for good performance: Drop the resolution, use DLSS/FSR, and absolutely cap the framerate using your Control Panel. It will still stutter and at worst freeze for a few seconds but it's not terrible now and at least for me, I hardly notice it anymore.

Is it ideal, no. Does it detract from the game. Absolutely. I still really, really enjoy this game.",1706200734,1706579457,True,152,6,0.801231265068054199,0,True,False,False

It improves on basically everything that Fallen Order started with new powers, more lightsaber stances, better combat and so much more customization. You can play the game the way you like, with whatever playstyle you prefer. 

The story is also great with some old friends coming back and new faces showing up. It's clear that Cal evolved so much since the first game and his entire arc shows it. He's a great protagonist and the game makes sure that you feel as close to him as possible.

I could go on but I'm gonna get to the point, because you're probably wondering ""if this guy loves the game so much, then why the hell is this review negative?"", and that is because of one simple thing that sours the whole experience and makes it really hard to enjoy the game as a whole: performance.

The game just doesn't seem to work properly whenever you get to a slightly larger area, which composes basically 60% of the entire game. You can be playing the story normally but as soon as you try exploring or going to a different area, there's a pretty good chance your frames will drop to 20 with constant stutters and just general instability. And that's universal, no matter if you upgrade your PC every two months with the latest parts, there's a pretty good chance that you'll be having headaches from the constant drops and frame instability.

The worst part is the game is absolutely amazing, it's everything I expected from a Fallen Order sequel and more but I can't even walk on the main hub without having my frames jumping up and down with unpredictable drops every 10 seconds. It's completely unacceptable that a game can be launched like this on PC while the console versions of the game have basically no issue running it. Because that's the main problem here, if you even interact with the game's UI for a few minutes you'll see that this was made to be played with a controller, on a console. Some of the UIs literally have no mouse support forcing you to use WASD. It's not unusable, but you can see that they (EA/Respawn) weren't giving half a shit about the PC community and forgot to optimize the game for PC users.

I hope that one day they'll fix the performance issues and make the game run smoothly as a whole. When that happens, I'll be the first to change my review to reflect how the game REALLY plays and how good it really can be. Until then, I can't recommend this to anyone.

The game lets you play the way you like with skill trees and fighting styles like in the first game. Besides this the combat system is very good, it is not too slow and requires some skill at the highest difficulty.

A specific group of characters is shown pretty childish. This has been partly in movies/series but got carried away a bit too much in my opinion. You still need to have in mind what the duty of these characters are.

Many people got angry because the game has been a mess in the beginning. I played it in January 2024 and it was playable. You wont get your 144 FPS in the game unless you have the newest setup (maybe not even with it).
Overall its playable fps wise as long as you do not mind a maximum of about 60-80 fps (Intel i7-11700K with NVidia Geforce GTX 3070 and 32GB RAM)

☑ Significant brain usage

Is sometimes challenging at bosses but overall more for the casual player. Game difficulty can be adjusted so it could be marked as ""Difficult"" too if playing on the highest difficulty (which is Dark Souls average).

☑ Isn't necessary to progress

Open world so go explore it. The world itself has about half the playtime (maybe more). There are some nice things to explore but nothing which really got me very curious.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore

☐ Good

☐ It'll replace your life

Sadly the story is not the best one (in my opinion). A few things were very predictable and a few but important ones did not make much sense. Overall an average story.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

Long when you look at the first game. It took me about 35 hours to complete the game but i did not search for everything on the map. So maybe the game could get to 40-50 hours. Overall a good amount of playtime for a story based game from EA.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left

It was nice to play but i did not catch me very much. Overall nice to play if it is on sale but not for the full price.

---{ Bugs }---

Old PC couldn't handle it but my new PC can.

Fun experience overall. Game play is smooth and enjoyable, boss fights are good, story is interesting enough (so far). One boss fight was so funny I actually applauded afterwards. Incredible haha. Enjoyed the new stances, the new crossguard stance, despite making me puke every time I look at that monstrosity of a lightsaber, was very satisfying. Not much else to add, nice customisation, interesting puzzles, great dismemberment and finishing blows; very solid game.

A few areas to be improved:
-Cut down on those 'unlock this ability to access this area for a cosmetic' backtracking places. it's fine if it leads to an interesting area or a boss fight, but having to go through the same areas 3+ times because of it is tedious and unrewarding. The first game did this as well and it does nothing but artificially add game time. Instead reward the players who go out of their way to explore (because they'll do it regardless) instead of punishing them with a duller experience for a cosmetic they're probably not going to use anyway.
-Go all out on customisation. Maybe one day we'll get a game like this where we get to customise our jedi from head to toe. For the time being however, atleast let us have more control over outfit colours. There's so many interesting outfits that I never put on because I didn't like the colour scheme options I was given. Also I appreciate the different blades having different sounds, but giving us some shader options for the colour would feel so amazing and would make the lightsaber feel more personable.
-A realism mode. I know it would be gimmicky, but playing through the game with realistic damage both to and from the enemies would allow a more immersive and tactical experience. It would add replayability to the game which could be a substitute for the backtrack exploring. It adds a more healthy, satisfying and enjoyable dynamic to the gameplay.

Like I said, very enjoyable experience. Cannot express how happy and appreciative that we get to play these single player story based games as a Jedi. I hope this is just the beginning for these games, There is so much of this universe (past and future) ready to be created and explored. I look forward to every second of it.",1688436093,1706533287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Much more of a open world-ISH play style then the first.  Side quest actually felt like they were worth pursuing.

-Using a RTX4080+7800X3d in 4k Res w/ ddr5 6400 CL32

At certain times the game still shows room for improvement, such as minor stutters on the more populated and open areas of Koboh. However, performance has been vastly improved since the release. If you haven't picked this up yet, I'd highly recommend it now. It's rare we get such a well crafted story with meaningful gameplay these days, especially from Star Wars. Survivor builds on everything good from the 1st game and makes it even better, while also introducing new elements to combat that create even more enticing (and addicting) possibilities. May the force be with you Jedi friends!
ORIGINAL UPON RELEASE;
The game itself is amazing, what a fantastic sequel. However the optimization for the PC version is horrible. Riddled with performance issues from stuttering gameplay, to crashing and freezing your computer. EA claims windows 10 is the issue, but I'm running 11 on a rather high end build and am forced to run medium graphics settings just to get passable performance between crashes(60ish frames on a 1440p 240ghz monitor and a 3090). I'm impatient and wanted to see where Cal's adventure led him, but if you're more disciplined than I then wait for a patch jedi friends.",1683268816,1706424134,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I don't feel any of the described performance issues. Only the EA and StarWars-Splash is stuttering - i couldn't care less.
On my system (8700k, 32GB RAM, 6900XT LC) it feels smooth in 4k and good-looking settings. (About 80 fps)
To all haters, which say 80 fps isn't smooth blabla: It's not a shooter.

To anything else: I'm 9 hours in. So far the story is interesting. 
Gameplay is fun.

If you liked Fallen Order, you'll like Survivor. Nothing more to say.

*Update*
I'm much further now and i really really like the game. All new implementations are fun. I love the crossguard, for example.
Also, the character-writing is very good. You connect with the good Guys. I love Merrin's jokes and Skoova always has me laughing with his fisherman's stories.
But as it was with Fallen Order, when it comes to the bad guys (except maybe the Ninth Sister, which simply IS a stupid brute) - the Second Sister was a masterpiece -, Survivor shines in that category.
In Survivor, digging deeper in the story you come to realize, that they all are haunted and broken. Be it a code of honor that simply turned to an unbearable burden of being instrumentalized, or be it overcommitment and ambition turning into obsession leading to the point of no return.

The final boss fight and the end to the story are really special. It hurts me that this is buried under so much other trash. This could have been a masterpiece if EA/Respawn had more vision and focus. A real shame...

Update after 45 hours:

Most issues aren't game breaking. It's playable now, even with constant stuttering and other weird glitches. But I still don't recommend this game. It lacks polish and feels half baked. I wish EA had cut half the features in this bloated mess and focused on refining/balancing combat. Some encounters are really fun to learn and overcome, while others boil down to throwing as many enemies at the player as possible without concern for balance. And the story... utter nonsense, even by modern Star Wars standards. Fallen Order wasn't perfect, but it had heart. Survivor is corporate garbage that only exists to tick a box on an earnings report.

Original review at 7 hours: 

An (ostensibly) strong game ruined for a massive PC player base because of a terrible port. Stuttering is constant, graphical artifacts like shimmering and culling errors mar otherwise lovely detail, and general performance is wildly inconsistent. Average frame rate with everything cranked (including RT) at 1440p is 70-80 without FSR, but that will drop to SINGLE DIGITS for no apparent reason in certain sections of the game. No settings changes affect these drops, even dropping to the low preset and enabling FSR at extreme performance mode. It is totally baffling. Just terrible software.

I am going to push through because I'm playing in parallel with a friend, but it pains me greatly to have paid EA and Respawn for this shameful, low effort port. I went into 2023 thinking Jedi: Survivor and Starfield would be my favorite games, but it a game about Pinocchio somehow ended up having more polish and heart. A TOTAL SHAME. Don't buy this unless you are willing to be furious.

1- the settings/menu button doesn't actually do anything 
2- To get to the menu/Settings page i had to open the holomap, THEN hit the settings/menu button to get there
3- During tutorials, or even just a button prompt to get up there, it Defaults to PC keybinds
4- The PS4 button prompt only shows up when you are interacting in some way with the controller, and only when you are, as soon as you stop it goes back to showing PC keybinds.
5- the ""Sprint"" Button (L3) pulls up the on screen keyboard for some reason??? and there is no way to turn it off. But yes you do start sprinting. only to hit the ""back"" button to get rid of the keyboard, taking you out of a sprint. 
6- Controls switching between buttons for no reason,Two i experienced were- holomap button turning into precision evade button, Big rectangle button bringing up the mouse on the screen.

All this with long loading screen times, opening graphic animation (Respawn, ea logos when booting up the game) running at LESS than 10 frames a second for some reason, Constant frame drops, etc.

I can very much tell that this IS a GOOD GAME. or it would be if they actually put effort into making the game playable. if its playable, the sound design, the combat, the story and voice acting i guarantee are great.  as what i could play WAS great. poor player support is Killing this game, and its play ability.",1706293874,1706293874,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It sure would be great if I could actually, y'know, [b]play the game![/b] :D

Seriously, the prologue chapter went flawlessly, but ever since I arrived on the first planet I've had constant crashes, both during cutscenes and during gameplay. It's literally gotten to the point where I can't advance in the game because a required cutscene keeps freezing halfway through, requiring me to force quit the game and relaunch it. I finally managed to get through that cutscene and beat the boss, only for the game to immediately freeze on the next cutscene!

And now I can't even play the game, because it crashes roughly 10 seconds after loading the level. I can't walk more than a few steps from the meditation point without it freezing, meaning that in its current state, this game is [b]literally[/b] unplayable.

If they manage to fix these issues, I'll update my review, but for right now this is absolutely unacceptable.

Avoid at all costs until they fix this problem. EA doesn't deserve your time or money.

UPDATE: I finally revisited this game and, thankfully, it had been patched to the point of being able to play it. That's not to say that the game is without issues still, though; I was only able to play roughly 3 hours each time before another crash, and the crashes got more frequent as I neared the end. The game still stutters pretty horribly, even on current graphics cards, so it's far from optimized.

Overall, I would recommend the game to someone who's already a big fan of Cal and Star Wars, but I wouldn't go out of your way to play it if frequent crashes irritate you.",1683613920,1706266660,False,5,0,0.558008730411529541,0,True,False,False

I get about 40 FPS in the big areas like Koboh and around 70 FPS in smaller areas. I'm sure the performance would be better if I played at a smaller resolution but for me, these frames were fine enough that I enjoyed playing the game. Ray tracing makes it extremely laggy though with my specs which I believe was the cause on why my game crashed once. I turned it off though and it was fine from then on. 

As for the game itself, I really liked the movement, enemy mechanics, and combat in Fallen Order and I think they improved upon that in Survivor which was the main reason I bought this game.

Something I disliked is the game's performance - as described by other reviewers, the game lagged at some locations, Koboh for instance. My laptop specs are DDR4 64gb, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, NVIDIA RTX3060 and it still struggled to provide a smooth experience, despite having the graphics set to Medium.

Some other downsides are bugs that appear occasionally - an example I can give is that when clicking on the button to open a chest and you are attacked at the same time, you never get to open the chest and receive your reward as this action gets interrupted. You can't seem to open the chest afterward too, as the option to open it does not appear when nearby. Another common bug I found is AI enemies spawning/dying at weird angles, sometimes in the air.

I think the gameplay can also be enhanced as I barely used any of the lightsaber skills that I obtained and mostly maxed out the Force and Survival ones as I found them easiest to use in combat. Another thing I can recommend is to add more maps, as returning to the same one for the main mission multiple times can become boring and I wanted to explore new locations.

Jedi Survivor is an amazing story-driven action adventure. If you liked the new god of war games, or horizon games, uncharted games and even the new tomb raider games, Jedi Survivor is right up your alley.

It has some of the best graphics I've seen in a video game. Ray tracing is beautiful here and adds a lot to the final image quality. The parkour is  JOY! Cal's ability pick up from those of the previous game and are vastly improved. Combat is fun and exciting. The enemies are hard, as usual and boss battles can get a little difficult if you're not used to this type of game.

The story is also pretty good, although a little inconsistent at times. The villain is not what I expected and although I enjoyed the final moments with him, it felt a little out of place. I don't think his motivations were well fleshed out, but the story isn't really where this game shines the most.

It's the incredibly fun mix of crazy combat with crazy parkour moves that make this game INCREDIBLY fun.

I thoroughly enjoyed my 30 hours of gameplay and I barely did any side quests. I don't think I will go back to those anyway.

Now the performance is still broken as I type this review.  Especially in the real open world maps, the game will stutter constantly, even when my GPU was 70-80% usage and the stutters were crazy. The more enclose areas were usually fine and stutter free, but overall, this game still needs a lot of polish performance wise.

Welcome to JEDI NOT SURVIVING. You reprise the role of COW TESTES, the ORANGE KNIGHT. This time you're older and wiser and slightly more manly, which isn't really saying much, but at least you've learned the poncho is not the HEIGHT OF FASHION, and you can grow FACIAL HAIR. You still can't pronounce your OWN NAME. Your BLACK MOM isn't around to cut your hair anymore so you can get a MOHAWK if you WANT. The quest hub is PLANET TEXAS. You can disguise yourself as a COWBOY with a MULLET and CHAPS and BANDANNA and HORSESHOE MUSTACHE and a GUN. Yeehaw. All you need is WINDSWEPT HAIR and SHORT BEARD and you'll be ORANJI-WON KENOBI. Yeah there's CHOCOBOS on Planet Texas, what're you gonna do about it Squeenix, SUE THE MOUSE? Ride your horsebird into the sunset. Bring peace and order to your one-town empire of dirt, ranchers, and miners. Shoot bandits. Kill rattlesnakes. Buy a drink in the saloon. Of course there's a farming mini-game. Invader Zim is a little green frog.

I sure hope you played the first game 'cause the devs start you off with all the powers you had at the end of it and expect you to know how to use them or die. No tutorial just ""git gud, scrub."" Don't know which buttons do what? Check the settings, the game won't tell you! Then the devs introduce new abilities you gotta figure out or die, all in the first level. The first boss is a boss from the first game, but she's back with a robot arm, all her old moves, all the moves of the final boss of the first game, plus new mechanics you've never seen before, and you've gotta just figure it out. I died. This is significant because I got hundreds of hours on JEDI FALLING OVER for PS4. I bought it twice, for PS4 and for Steam. It's not just a favorite game, it's my comfort game I fire up when bad things happen in my life. I accidentally did a deathless Master Difficulty run on Jedi: Fallen Order and I died to the first boss in Jedi: Survivor on Knight Difficulty, who mostly had abilities I already knew how to handle. The game is hard. You are the Jedi who is not Surviving.

There are Jedi who are Surviving in this game. Lots. You're just not one of them. There's so many Jedi Survivors revealed throughout the Disney canon that at this point we must conclude almost no one died in the Purge. Order 66 was just a court-ordered eviction served by sheriffs so the Emperor could move in and sh!t in Yoda's bed probably. So many Jedi Survivors appear in this game you even get one from the High Republic who is still surviving ""somehow"" (actual in-game quote, making fun of Episode IX, love to see it). So basically every Jedi in the galaxy is surviving but you. You die all the time, and for stupid reasons, for instance chickens, like a Zelda game. The first yeehaw you meet (named Mosey lmao) tells you nothing in the Valley is that dangerous and then you die a dozen times to lizards and apes trying to find Muppet Dad's saloon. The game is hard.

Remember that frog on Bogano who killed you 30 fkng times? He was one of the hardest bosses in that game; the devs thought ""what if we made him harder?"" Spawn of Oggdo has a OHKO with a huge hitbox and he will spam it over and over. If he hippity-hops while you're near a wall he will stunlock. Then you fight him and his dad at the same time. You get to fight a rancor, which is cool, then you get to fight two at the same time. You thought it was rough dodging the frog's OHKO? At least the frog is only the size of a car, the rancors are the size of a building.

Like Cow, the devs are older and wiser, too. They listened to some fan advice. You actually do get to fight Darth Vader (as BLACK MOM of course, who is more badass than before, and deserves her own game). You can turn off damage from FALLING OVER, which you will do, even more, since the platforming is still janky, and even worse with the new mobility mechanics. AND YOU CAN PET THE CATRABBITS! Remember the one you tamed in the first game, who got into the ductwork of Muppet Dad's ship, the MAN-TITS? Apparently it brought a girlfriend and got loose on Planet Texas and became an invasive species of semi-feral pokemon, and you can pet all of them! Remember your goth girlfriend MERLIN who is a WIZARD? She DOES touch your d!ck this time! Cow has no game, because he's a virgin from a monastery, his pick-up line is ""the Order wasn't right about everything,"" but Merl doesn't care, she wants her babies to be orange and psychic! Your droid BD-SM is a perv who watches you two go at it! Tired of your lightsaber working like a wiffle bat that glows? There's a perk that massively increases everyone's damage to be more like the movies! It's only available on New Game+ but at least it's there! You have a lot of fashion choices, other than Scrapper and Poncho! The starting outfit is hideous so grab more outfits hidden across the land, and buy them in shops you pay for with stuff you find hidden across the land! Pallette swap colors! The battledroids are back and are hilarious! They will distract you with their funny and you will die of laughter! EA sucks but this game doesn't! The story is Good Actually, remarkable for Mouse Wars, and I can't wait to see what happens to Cow and Merlin and their baby on Planet Barbie in the third game!

In so many ways this is a worthy successor to the original, but it fails hard in key areas. The story is great, and it has a lot of the same great combat style as the first one, with very cool additions. There are some superb souls-like fights (ya Rayvis!). The world is rich and interesting, with lots to explore and discover. Customization is also super fun -- way better than the first.

But where the game falls down is on the technical side. When you have precision fights and challenge levels  that require intense focus and perfect timing, things like random framerate drops, unresponsive controls, and weird hitboxes are infuriating beyond belief. There are several fights in the game that are completely unbalanced (Spawn of Oggdo ones especially), and at times it ends up feeling like playing QWOP instead of a AAA game. In almost every cutscene there is bizarre twitching fabric and frame drops, and honestly if I was the actors and writers I'd sue. They put on such a good performance but everything they did was marred by the janky jank platform. In the end, the whole thing comes off as amateurish and unpolished.

The other vexing thing is that the devs have just ignored this, even with all of the ongoing comments about these issues. It feels like they just took the money and ran. They did an underwhelming optimization patch at one point from what I gather, but it still clearly hasn't added the polish this game deserves.

I run a 7800X3D, 4090, and a Samsung 990 Pro SSD yet EVERY launch the game has a ""Optimizing Game Files"" that takes 10 MINUTES to finish. With everything max I average 120-140fps (1440p, RTX and FG enabled) but the MICRO STUTTERS DO NOT GO AWAY. 

The Frame Gen impleementaiton is bad. The UI and environments will keep glitching and artifacting- really breaks the immersion.

I think the writing is fantastic. I love traveling with comrades and friends in the game, the banter is fun and everyone has a special place in your heart. Tells a very well-done Star Wars story. 

The mechanics work very well. The progression here is what you’d expect and definitely sucks you in (at least for me) to explore, A LOT. Kept me hooked for ~40 hours. There are some more frustrating moments but I think that is more on me than anything else. Can I attribute that to the development? Maybe?  But it’s blended well enough to question that decision.

I think the most frustrating parts of the game is really the polish. The cinematics always have some artifacts that just go nuts, transitions that are flawed, and some scripts that don’t get kicked off right because of the one-offs. I wish Respawn would get more resources to truly polish the dull parts but we all know what happens with wishes in one hand…
Overall, it’s a good game, not great, but just good.

[SPOILER FREE]

When I first played Jedi: Fallen Order in 2021, I fell in love with its flashy yet strategic combat, lovely story with likeable characters and gorgeous world design. And I have to say, Jedi Survivor delivers on all of these fronts and more. Now, I first have to put a disclaimer in that all of my playtime was on a modded version. I mostly used cosmetic mods like Outfit Manager and May the Performance be with You, but I did dabble in some game altering mods like the mod that allows you to use all lightsaber stances instead of being limited to two at a time.

However, when most people think of Jedi Survivor, they think of its terrible launch. I am in no way defending it, but I personally bought it a few months after release when most of the issues were fixed. But the game's not perfect and neither was Fallen Order at launch. It crashes very often and I had to get in the rhythm of compulsively resting at meditation points to not lose my progress. Frame drops do still occur, but they are much rarer than before. Over all, I believe that this game, in its current state, is still amazing and here's why:

- Combat -

The combat in Jedi Survivor is a step up from Fallen Order in almost every way. The new skill trees for every lightsaber stance, force ability and the survivability tree include tons of unique moves that, once unlocked, help to spice up combat in meaningful ways. The new stances and reworked double-bladed stance are also all incredibly unique. The single blade is your reliable standard stance, seems boring at first but when I tell you you'll use it way more in NG+, I mean it. The double-bladed saber is amazing at clearing out groups of enemies. The new wider swings and acrobatic leaps make you feel like the Darth Maul you were always meant to be. The dual wielding stance on the other hand makes you play insanely aggressively because it not only allows you to cancel attacks by blocking but also has super fast attacks and an auto-parry attack. The absolute best stances though are the next two, starting with the blaster stance. Not only is it insanely fun to play like a swashbuckling pirate and combine saber combos with blaster shots, but also you can PARRY with your GUN, which is one of the coolest moves to master that feels amazing whenever you use it. The blaster sound effects are also gorgeous. The last stance, the Crossguard is also insanely fun. This is your claymore, so to speak. Slow but powerful. Knowing when you can attack and when you should stay back will win you most of your fights with this thing. I will not spoil what happens in the story, but I will just say there is a secret 6th stance that will be an amazing shock to anyone that experiences it.

Force abilities feel better than ever too. The addition of B1 droids that will crumble if force pushed into eachother or a wall is an awesome move. Also, the infamous flame troopers from Fallen Order can now be countered by force slamming them into the floor, causing their gas tanks to combust. When I figured this out, it was one of the coolest moments of my time playing. And don't think I can talk about the combat without talking about the execution animations that are absolutely the most satisfying part of the game. Combined with the light enemy dismemberment, it makes for an insanely cinematic experience. Enemies are also unique and fun to fight (unless it's those goddamn chickens). In fact, the bosses in this game are so fun that I installed the enemy spawner mod in order to re-fight a ton of my favorite bosses like the lightsaber raiders or ""The Mastiff"", an elite magnaguard. The major bosses are also massive spectacles and feel as epic as the first game, in some cases maybe even more so. But the game does recycle a lot of basic enemies as bosses later on, but I see it as an Elden Ring situation where that just means more game to play.

- Progression & Story -

The story of Survivor in general takes itself less seriously than Fallen Order, but it has its heavy moments. Dealing with themes of love, loss and settling down, the story is multi-faceted and the characters are three-dimensional. And yes, the overall quality of the story may not be as high as the previous game, it still is an amazing time. Survivor also adds so-called ""Rumors"" which act as side quests. Every rumor either gives you something new, shows you a new area you'd have never found if you were to just do the main quest or it could even lead you to secret bosses. Also, no little dotted line or obnoxious quest marker is needed and these quests can be completed mostly just by exploring the open world. Also, a lot of progression is tied to exploration. Exploring rewards you not only with cosmetic items to bling out Cal, BD-1, your lightsaber or your blaster (all of which have been vastly improved from the recolors and endless ponchos of the first game), but you also get health and force upgrades and extra STIM canisters as well as trinkets to exchange for more cosmetic items in the game's shops.

The planets, now more than ever, feel like actual planets. God bless Fallen Order's heart, but most of the planets consisted of you being high up on mountains that conveniently were shaped like a video game level. Survivor's main two worlds, Koboh and Jedha feel way more like actual real planets that could exist. And the more linear video game level-like areas are just sub-areas found in these massive planets. Exploration has also been massively improved with an actual useful holomap and upgrades that can show you hidden chests, upgrades, scans, plants and relics that you haven't gotten yet. And of course, the game's graphics are absolutely gorgeous, as to be expected from a game following up to Jedi: Fallen Order, one of the best looking games of the previous generation.

- Movement -

Fuck you, movement is getting it's own section. While yes, Fallen Order had some parkour, it felt more like a chore to get to the next combat encounter than an actual fun part of gameplay. On the other hand, like 30-60 minutes into your first playthrough, you will get a grappling hook that will instantly make platforming way more fun. Luckily, all of the upgrades from the previous game are available from the start in Jedi Survivor. Later on, you also get an airdash and get introduced to green portals that, when dashed through, reset your dash and double jump. This, combined with the even later floating grapple balloons turns a merely passable movement system into flat out a movement masterpiece. And the developers know this. After defeating a certain major boss at the Observatory, for instance, a wall opens up, revealing an obstacle course of floating walls to wallrun off of, bars to swing from and balloons to grapple onto to get back to a save point to fast travel to the Mantis. The developers could have easily given the player a save point and told them to just warp back, but they knew this would be more fun. Also, more room for error allows players to make a few mistakes while platforming and the end-game parkour force tears will straight up turn this game into a kaizo platformer. Prepare to rage at the game if you decide to try one of these.

- Conclusion -

Over all, Jedi Survivor builds off of all aspects of the previous game and turns a great game into an amazing one. Don't think about the more negative reviews, as most of the technical issues have been ironed out and the game is now in an actual playable state. Objectively, it's about a 8/10 game, but it's an 11/10 Star Wars game. The ability to LARP as a jedi is not only insanely fun, but truly getting good at the game's mechanics is one of the most rewarding things I have ever seen. Take it from me, a person who has had 3 playthroughs of the game and a ton of hours just spawning enemies with a mod to enjoy the combat system more. If you are still doubting if it's a good game, just grab it when it next goes on sale. It'll be well worth it.",1706005011,1706005011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first entry in the series was a fantastic metrodvania paired with smooth combat and great enemy types. This game, while it improved on some things, most aspects got worse. While i gave this game a thumbs up it comes with alot of asterisks.

First the good:
Graphics 9/10: The game looks and feels amazing. The new combat animations look super cool as well as the new Cal/BD/ customization allow for some great cosmetic combinations. 

Maps 7/10: The new maps (mainly Koboh) are greatly expanded upon. Its large and feels perfectly dense with things to do and explore. I do think some sequences had to much platforming that left me bored in some areas. Also the map, while having great star wars aesthetics can be hard to read in the denser regions.

Story 5/10: The story is serviceable. Nothing amazing but kept me interested enough to keep playing along. Not much to say here.

Stats/progression 7/10: The new stances are great. They feel well thought out and are fun to play. The skill trees for the stances and other abilities are nice as well. The perk system didn't feel like it belonged in the game at all. I couldn't tell many of the perks having much of an effect and overall it felt like an afterthought.


The Bad:
Difficulty 3/10: I played the first game on Jedi Grand-master and eagerly jumped into this game on the same difficulty. It is clearly not balanced on this level and instead of providing engaging challenge is just overly frustrating. I ended switching to Jedi knight after the save corruption issue around 3/4th into the game. 

Enemies/combat 2/10: Combat in this game has high highs and very low lows. The game feels best when fighting many grunt level enemies or 1 elite level enemy. Unfortunately most of the game is fighting 2-3 medium tier enemies with supporting grunts and leads to very frustrating combat. Almost all enemies including the majority of grunt level enemies have red unblockable attacks which feels very out of place and a cop out for creating meaningful difficulty and combat. This creates situations where you are being spammed with unblockable attacks from multiple enemies which can be hard to avoid while surrounded or locked in a animation. The vast amount of enemy types does not help. Each Star wars faction has 10+ enemy types that instead of having a variety of good attacks has just 1 or 2 spammy and annoying attacks. Cal's attacks also have a lot of inconstancy. While breaking the enemies block bar forces a stagger many of your attacks seems to be decided at the flip of a coin on if the interrupt the enemy or not. This leads you diving into enemy combos where you had previously and successfully interrupted the enemy and launched your own counter attack into randomly getting punished for seemingly no reason.

Performance 4/10:  Playing in 2024 performance was actually pretty good, getting over 100 frames on max settings and didn't experience many frame hitches. Many achievements can be very difficult to get to activate and can be a real chore to get them to pop. The only major issue I experienced was losing around 5 hours of play time including 2 boss defeats from a save corruption and is the only reason I didn't rate it higher.

Bosses 4/10: Many of the mainline story boss fights are very annoying to fight. Once again instead of having a variety of moves to keep you guessing the bosses rely on a short list of annoying and powerful moves that are difficult to play around and are capable of spamming red attacks back to back leading to many portions of there fight were you just have to dodge not being able to get any hits in.

Side missions 3/10: The side missions or ""Rumors"" seem to be another afterthought and were added just to be filler or simply to check the box off its RPG checklist. None of them were memorable or provided little if any lore/world building. 


Overall 5/10: I wouldn't recommend playing this game above Jedi Master and if I could start again would stick with Jedi Knight. A lot of the game felt a little scattered. From the rumors and many currencies to the elements of outpost upgrading and perks the game felt like it was trying to accomplish and implement to many new systems and failed at making them cohesive. The game overall had good moments and was fun to play. Its worth the time but would wait until its on sale to pick it up. I'm hoping that this game is the low point in the series and that a potential 3rd game can really dial in the combat and a few other aspects more.",1705978941,1705979145,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I am a long time Star Wars fan but found this game to be quite disappointing. 

Bad performance that still isn't fixed with the latest patch (4). Constant frame drops and stutters in just about all areas/planets. Especially Koboh. I tried to wait for the performance to be fixed or at least a good bit better than launch before I beat the game but got tired of waiting.

Combat is better than Jedi Fallen Order but still feels sloppy. He can also only dodge without a roll which makes it annoying to deal with large enemies that spam unblockable attacks. Makes no sense how a Jedi can't do something as basic as a roll dodge. 

Platforming starts off interesting but gets excessive and tedious further into the game. 

Good boss variety but the last couple bosses just spam unblockable/gotcha attacks that drain your life quickly. Third from the last boss is the best in my opinion because he doesn't do that.

Story is decent but the ending makes no sense. Definitely could have been written better. The game also seems to drag on at one point then the next thing you know it abruptly ends.

Overall it is a decent game but I can't recommend it with the performance issues and the $70 price tag. Even if the optimization was good and the game ran well on PC it still wouldn't be worth $70.

Initially, this game suffered from terrible optimization to the point that it was breaking high-end PCs. However, the game seems to have improved quite a bit. If you enjoyed the original Fallen Order game, then you will find this just as enjoyable, if not more.

However, the game is still not without performance issues. I have a higher tolerance as I come from an age of low framerate, low-poly games where the mouths don't line up with the words being spoken. On your average PC, it is likely you will experience all of these issues while playing. Running it on medium to high graphics, I often find Stormtroopers look like they're from Star Wars: Jedi Knight at times. It's actually *playable* after almost a year of optimization, but I can't say it will play *well*, especially after playing for a couple hours (Suggesting a memory leak).

And of course theres no mutliple saves so this would be a TOTAL RESTART AGAIN.

December Update: After half a year the game still runs poorly, but after the game's terrible performance and corrupting my save files forcing me to restart, I gave it months before I tried again. I have it on medium settings to run just ok. I got past the 10 ish hr mark where it failed last time. Now I have encountered a game breaking bug where RB doesn't trigger certain abilities and it is impossible to progress forward (new ability unlock). (yes my RB button physically works, and no cntrl doesnt either). Half a year later the state is still BROKEN. I looked online, im not the only one with this bug. Only known fix is YET ANOTHER RESTART. 

Orginal:

For weeks the game was unplayable. It would crash on the opening cut scene. Finally after a dozen crashes got it past the first cut scene so i could actually play the game. Even then it ran like GARBAGE, and I would have to watch cut scenes on youtube just to skip past the crash.

I refrained from buying the game for some time, because of reports of performance issues and glitches. It did crash a few times when I was running around one of the towns, fortunately a patch released a week it had solved all issues.

I enjoyed the story and the characters. Perhaps the foreshadowing is a little to strong for my taste, but it's still enjoyable.

The strongest parts of the game are:
- the combat, each sword form feels distinctly different, you really need to learn the opponents and look for cues to react properly, no button mashing in this game.
- jumping puzzles, the game introduces skills you can use to traverse the map gradually, allowing you time to learn them in various scenarios, there's quite a lot of them, but you don't feel overwhelmed, some puzzles require more dexterity, but they're not very finicky,
If you mess up a puzzle or a fight, you generally know what you did wrong and can improve in the next attempt. Generally, the game mechanics are well thought, so the game gives you challenges without being frustrating. That being said some bosses or enemy combos are quite hard, at least on the difficulty level one below hardest.

If you enjoyed the previous game, you'll definitely enjoy this one, I sure did.",1705882398,1705882398,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Great/Fun game play, visuals are outstanding...Story was even pretty interesting. Buy it - play it - enjoy it

Now on to some bad things:
-PC Performance is not that great. Not terribly awful but dropping down to 40-55 FPS at times is crazy these days.
-It was very close to being too long of a game. The next one should be between Fallen Order and Survivor.
-I dont think the end boss should have been who it was. There were 3 other choices that may ahve been better.
-Frog Boss fight was absolutely absurd...The single and duo version...Talk about killing the pacing of the game. The difficulty was so out of place coupled with the tiny boss arena and constant spammed attacks + their 1-hit kills, ridiculous hit boxes too...bleh, vomit. Basically, this is what happens when a Developer runs out of good ideas for a boss fight. They just put 2 of the same bosses in a small arena. Such a cop-out imo
-Also had 2-3 hard crashes

All that aside, great game so play it

Worth noting that Jedi Fallen Order was a better game, imo.

Cons: Too short (22 hour playtime). Too much focus on increasingly punishing boss battles (including one recycled from the last game). The player makes no decisions of any consequence. By the time you have cool force powers for managing groups of enemies, you no longer have groups of enemies.

As with the last game, the story is painfully short and kinda just ends. It feels incredibly constrained for something set the Star Wars galaxy. Along the same lines, I know the storytelling for this type of game needs to be a bit linear, but it would be nice to have more choice on some of the details.

Pros:
1.Story is well paced, emotional and incredibly well thought out which will keep you in your seat for hours just wanting to know whats next and whats gonna happen to your favorite characters.
2.Gameplay is way more improved compared with the first jedi game and at points you will feel like a total badass when fighting both bosses and group of enemies.
3.main quest are a beauty and a trill to play throught.
inbetween:
1.Lack of unique bosses, most of them are kinda almost the same just different skins and i had this same complaint for elden ring but i aint saying that the amount of bosses is bad just that it has a rather large roster of bosses maybe around 50 and maybe 7 of them are unique(random number not really representing the amount of bosses)
2.this one depends on the person but i found that the game was way easier than the first(could be because the first game was unrefined or that i dont remember the game as correctly as i think), never really felt like i needed to go back or been in a bad spot maybe once or twice. if i had to say this game is way lower in difficulty than a dark souls game but fun either way.
3.Maps are way to large and i kinda do prefer the last game maps more but at the same time i dont and the new maps got their charm like nova and shattered moon.
Cons:
1.Like many have said Performance is a little shaky(havent seen how it was at first) in some parts it would grind down to a halt, specially for me was the first array and it was in some parts of it not all so it was kinda weird.
2.Crashes are there but they are far apart thankfully, i would recommend not to go back to coruscant there is a nasty crash there that almost got me stuck.
3. this one kinda contradicts the pro before but gameplay are a while can get a bit boring if you don't follow the main story.
4.Too many collectivels which can increase the game time from 12-15 hour game to 30 if not 40 just looking for them which too me i find boring after a while but my ocd got me screaming for that 100%.
5.some colletivels you aint gonna be able to acquire them until after certain missions so a lot of back tracking is required.(which i hate with a passion)

Now i do recommend the  game to most fans of the first game and if you can buy it on a sale then you would enjoy it more(i believe i bought it during christmas and it was maybe 40% if not 50% off so it aint unheard off to buy it at half the price.
Do i recommend you buying it at full price? no, if i remember correctly it had a lot of issues when it launched so the only way to fight that kind of bussiness practice its to vote with your wallet.Do i recommend you buying the game? 100% yes.

The good: new stances, new mechanics, perk system, new enemies, new and more customization, did not take away all the force powers from the first game, like other games do in the sequel. There's a tactical minigame which is fun. The combat is still fun. Voice acting is really good. NG+ extra perks are fun.

The bad: Shallow gameplay, finding the optional collectables are 80% of the game's playtime. There's also no dark side clothes for New Game+.
About the gameplay:
Because its a terrible port you'll encounter with a ton of bugs. If you play on lower difficulty thats fine because most of them happened during bossfights, but as someone who finished Sekiro multiple times on NG+7 charmless and demon bell'd, i started it on Grandmaster Difficulty. The game itself wasn't difficulty at all tho. The problem is the random bs you encounter like: dodging's invincibility frame doesn't work, bosses' attacks randomly 1 shot you (even with max stats). You're out of the bosses' range and they teleport next to you and one shots you. You're out of the attack's range, their attack still hits you for some reason. Blocking randomly let's through the damage like you did not block (had full stamina bar). Some challenges are annoying because you go against 2-3 huge monsters who are just ganking you in a corner (more enemies doesn't mean more fun). Randomly falling through the floor. Special pistol skill randomly doesn't work, but used up the force energy that was needed for that skill. Main and sidequests sometimes softlock themself (a door closes that shouldn't have, enemies/npcs don't spawn) and you have to quit to the menu and restart again. Platforming puzzle's are not planned correctly, what i mean is i had to knock down some pillar to create a bridge from one platform to the other, but you could just simply jump over. Later on when you unlock the Dash ability its just game over for the platform puzzles. Dash is so OP you'll just skip 90% of the platforming with that, it can even get you to places you are not supposed to have access at that point. Also there are a bunch of places which looks like you can stand on, but no, just just fall through that and loose some of you HP.

About the story:
The main story is fine, nothing special. ""Obviously will betray you person"" will obviously betray you. Very suspicious person who might be a bad guy is revealed to be a bad guy. Nothing in the story will surprise you or make you go ""i did not expect that"". There are no real decision's in the game, there are no multiple storylines you can choose from. The game has 2 Jar-Jar Binks level of stupid side characters, one of them has his own questline where you have to listen to his lifestory which just doesn't fit the main story's darkness. Sometimes you literally have to just stand there for 5 fookin' minutes and wait for him to finish his stupid story. I would've done literally anything else other than that.

While the same fun movement and combat system you know and love from the first game has been expanded upon here (although not absolutely every addition is welcome) and the story is broadly very good, there are some very polarising points within the narrative (and one or two points that seem like outright oversights), and the game still has gremlins pertaining to technical performance and persistent, albeit minor, glitches.

+ Combat is excellent, and the new fighting stances are mostly welcome additions (not you, blaster stance)
+ Engaging storyline, similarly to the first game
+ Graphics are very pretty
+ Some of the new characters are excellently written
+ Holotactics is a fun minigame, albeit very RNG-driven. Potential to expand this further in future games akin to Gwent in the Witcher franchise
+ Cameos from two legendary characters in the Star Wars universe, including one with its original voice actor
+ You can customise Cal, his lightsaber and BD-1 in a greater number of ways than ever before...

- ...But the downside is, the Mantis is no longer customisable for some reason
- Movement mechanics have, in my opinion, gone too far in this game. Having Cal be able to double jump, flip, and dash forward all while he's falling mid-air ruins immersion; and some facets of movement such as the electrified ziplines literally defy physics and as such are immersion breaking. In my opinion, movement in this series peaked with the end of Fallen Order
- Some very odd character development (spoilers ahead): The vast majority of the characters you fight with [spoiler]are the same as those in Fallen Order[/spoiler], which feels a little lazy; the [spoiler]Cal and Merrin romance[/spoiler] felt like hollow fan pandering that contributed nothing to the story, and there was a missed opportunity to allow the player to [spoiler]turn Cal to the dark side. By forcing players into staying light side yet also to 'embrace Cal's darkness' in order to literally complete the game, you're simply painting him as an angsty episode-2 Anakin[/spoiler], which is character regression that literally nobody asked for.
- Some plot holes in the story including quite a large one (more spoilers): [spoiler]When Darth Vader attacked Jedha, why didn't he simply walk into the next room and destroy the Mantis after defeating Cere? Before the fight, Cere told BD1 to wait as she'd be along shortly - presumably they're still in Mantis in the next room with the communication codes - what on earth was he doing?[/spoiler]
- The ""big planet"" in the game that was hailed as a ""hub that Cal can come back to again and again throughout the story"" is 90% empty nothingness with barely any NPCs, not that many enemies, and very little diversity within the landscapes; and this just feels like lazy game design
- Planting seeds in a cramped rooftop garden has to be literally the dumbest side activity in any game ever, and aside from a Steam achievement there's absolutely no reward whatsoever for doing it
- The game crashed six times for me in 30 hours, the Steam overlay stopped working in-game for me after about 20 hours, and there are a lot of short freezes and stutters (particularly in cutscenes, which is very odd)

While the list of negatives is long, I would still say that this game is definitely worth playing for Star Wars fans, or people who were otherwise fans of the original game. It definitely lacks some of the polish that the original had, but there is still a lot to like about it, and it follows on nicely from the end of Fallen Order whilst simultaneously placing itself in strong stead to set up a sequel.

Excellent story
Fun, engaging fights and plenty of challenge if you play on Jedi Master/Grand Master levels

At first I thought it was just something that happens upon first launch, but maybe not?  The only major complaint I have with the game is all the stuttering on the main world, Koboh. This game could definitely use better optimization, but if you can get over that, and are a fan of the last, Starwars Jedi, game, then this is a game i would recommend. 

Side note: This game is absolutely awful with the steam overlay and any other 3rd party overlay and even its own overlay at times. If you are trying to change the resolution for the game, it simply will not let you interact with the prompt that asks if you are sure about changing the resolution. I've also had both the steam overlay and the AMD Adrenalin overlays either not work properly during game play, or just not work at all.

**Original Review:**
As someone who is a STAR WARS fan, I'd recommend this game to every fan and non-fan of Star Wars, despite the fact it had some performance issues due to a rushed release (it's EA's fault, not the developers). Respawn did a great job on the game (fr fr no cap). But don't buy it until a good patch (day one and performance patches are bad)

My overall thoughts after completing the game:
Story: 9.5/10
It has its quirks but is still a good one, a tragic one, almost like Rogue One's. Characters are well-crafted. I appreciate that everyone has their own motives and is driven by them.

Graphics: 10/10
Visuals are great, even though it's not UE5. It still does the job and portrays the world as if it were a movie.

Gameplay: 8/10
I enjoyed the movements and battles, but some boss fights are annoying. Oggdo and ***** (Spoiler). The second one is like... there's no point in the duel because everyone knows the outcome. But you still have to tear your bum to get it right and ""win"" the boss fight.

Customisation: 10/10
Wow, you can customise EVERY aspect of your character - yourself, lightsaber, blaster, BD. That's fantastic.

Performance: 3/10
You have to compromise on FPS with this one. I played with a laptop 3050 Ti, low-mid graphics at full HD in 30fps with blur. I capped it to 30fps manually through the NVIDIA Control Panel. It almost feels like it's not the FPS that matters but the stutters.

I have to keep saving the game and crossing my fingers that the game doesn't crash suddenly. My machine is OP so I don't think that it's my system that is causing the crashes but rather the game it's self.

I managed to finish the game. The story was Ok in my opinion but to me, it seems like EA can't let go of Darth Vader and people turning to the dark side because of their loved ones. Same plot, same idea, rinse and repeat. I know that many things here are canon but still .. EA taking a plot that is maybe now 50 years old, repackage, and sell. 

Graphics great! Very beautiful! There are glitches here and there but the game keeps crashing randomly every now and then.

Combat definitely a fresher from the previous game with some twists; but you really can't fully master all stances so you get stuck with one or two unless you replay the game and try different stances.

Value for money .... not so great given that the game is expensive for us as EA's passive beta testers. I think that the game's price would have reflected more if the game was well tested, patched and fixed. Few glitches or game crashing for example once or twice during a full game run is forgivable but relying on save points and praying that we don't crash till the next save point, is nonsense. The game needs to be fixed.

I think EA should compensate the people who paid the game's full price with a free DLC.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
First and foremost, [b]Jedi: Survivor is an excellent game at its core[/b]. I'm a major Star Wars fan and loved Fallen Order, so I'm probably biased to some degree. But I found the story to be engaging; the characters likable, well acted and convincingly animated; and the gameplay to be incredibly fun. Respawn has done an fantastic job capturing the feeling of the Star Wars universe while providing a fresh enough story to not feel like we're just rehashing old and exhausted themes. Next to Rogue One & Andor, it's my favorite SW setting & story in recent years. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Regarding the core gameplay loop, Jedi Survivor will appeal to a broad audience. This is a game that gives you clear direction while providing you with enough opportunities to take brief detours, so that it doesn't feel entirely on-rails. If you're someone who wants to turn off your brain and enjoy an engaging, interactive Star Wars story, lower the difficulty and enjoy the ride. If you're a completionist and get your dopamine hits from exploring all the nooks & crannies for chests and collectibles, the environments in this game have just enough secrets to reward careful exploration. If you thrive on fast & smooth movement, wall running, and jumping/flipping about, I find Jedi Survivor is among the best in this regard (on par, IMO, with Spider-man & Titanfall). If you love the challenge of precise timing in combat (ala Dark Souls, Sekiro, etc), the lightsaber combat on higher difficulties can be incredibly challenging and rewarding.

Overall, this game greatly exceeded my expectations based on what I read in reviews. I came in expecting a 6/10 game, and was surprised to find that [b]this game is easily a 9/10 (9.5/10 for a Star Wars fan)[/b]. I'm shocked that it hasn't gotten more buzz and isn't more widely praised. But that's probably because...

[h1]Performance/Optimization[/h1]
There are definitely some performance issues. I'm playing on a setup that is much faster than what the typical gamer will be using (7950X3D, 4090), and I'm still experienced some stuttering in certain areas (particularly Rambler's Reach on Koboh). It is noticeable and occasionally annoying, but it's not a deal breaker for me because it's A) infrequent, B) restricted to specific areas, and C) doesn't affect gameplay. However, I must acknowledge that if I'm experiencing this on a high-end system, I have to imagine it's even worse for others.

With that said, I don't think occasional stuttering should be the deal breaker everyone is making it out to be. Maybe it's because the issues aren't all that bad on my system, or maybe it's because I'm in my mid-30s and grew up playing games that were [i]way[/i] more janky and stuttery than this.  Personally, I'm willing to acknowledge that 1) the optimization could (and should) be better, and also 2) this is a phenomenal game only slightly marred by suboptimal performance.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
If you are a Star Wars fan, the gameplay seems interesting to you, and you have a decently fast system, I recommend that you strongly consider giving this game a try. I'm glad I decided to take these Steam reviews with a grain of salt and tried the game out for myself, otherwise I would have missed out on what is one of my favorite games in recent years.",1705590925,1705591389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review after finishing the game:

It's a bloody shame that EA can get the Zelda-like open world right, twice in a row, only to shit the bed performance-wise.

I'm running a solid i7 10700KF with 32GB of RAM, and a 4080. I tried multiple settings, even low on 1080P, but the baseline is the same: the game is poorly optimised. Some areas barely get 40  FPS. And the fractured experiences, which should be uber small sandbox environments, well I've had framerate drop to 20 in those after just 5 seconds...

So the game is obviously a console port, and while I dislike the console-first development mentality it makes sense both financially and mechanically. Cater for the many, not for the few. However, having a 70 euro game run like utter trash on hardware that cost upward of 3K, I just can't accept that. If they are willing to charge this much for a game, they should be willing to offer continuous support, at least for 3 fucking years (see Witcher 3, which started out as a bug ridden mess too).

The story is decent, although it has an arc that you can see coming from roughly quarter way through. The first game was easier in this aspect, as they were defining where they wanted to go - but now they are locked in on that route.

Gameplay is much improved, mechanics are nice, a few interesting lightsaber stances added. One less planet to explore than in Fallen order, and only 4 are truly open world, one is a small sized map, and one is a glorified boss arena. I felt like I have less to explore, and more tedious cosmetics to gather.

And the real issue. The game has severe crashing issues, even in January 2024. I literally had to skip about 4 cutscenes and watch them on youtube, as they would constantly crash at the same spot. I find this laughable in a 70 euro game.

The game crashes at the exact same spot in two other places: one running up to a tedious bossfight, and one as I deliver the killing blow in the hardest bossfight imho. It was numbingly harsh to rerun these in the hopes of the game shining its mercy in me, and letting me progress. 

One of the planets crashes regardless of where you are, and as meditation points are far between, I found myself saving after every major enemy killed and every customisation gathered. (Once the save wiped the chests I found, and I needed to redo the whole region).

And the final straw: the game worked fine with a PS5 controller on bluetooth, until I reached the last 5% of the game. Then it just shat the bed.

I tried everything, from reinstalling drivers, re-pairing the controller, repairing the game folder, etc. Only to find in the community hub that it was the same for all controllers, and the issue started roughly on the 16-17th of Jan. So I finished the final boss with the controller on cable. Not a biggie, but fucking frustrating that this is something ""normal"".

My baseline: the game is 75% of the quality of Fallen Order, with both gameplay and mechanics being better - but story being a significant downstep.

They leave space for a third game, but I sincerely doubt I will buy it, if this game is in such a shambolic state even close to one year after it's release (and I read it was waaay worse on launch day, so glad I held my horses.)

Buy it with a 40-50 discount, but don't pay more than 40 euros for it. Not worth it.",1704659060,1705568213,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But this follow-up underlines that this was lightning in a bottle and EA is still as incompetent as ever.

Performancewise it's a mess: crashes to desktop (especially annoying since the game only saves on bonfires, so there's a lot of progress to be lost); very demanding while looking dated and worse than its predecessor (especially the details) and it's very troubling to get a controller to work (SteamInput isn't working, and you'll need 3rdPartySoftware to use a DS4-controller) - and don't get me started on the need to install and use the OriginLauncher.

The game itself ist FallenOrder, just worse in every aspect. The combat system feels of, parrying unrewarding, enemies attack faster than the in-game response time gives you time to react, and despite dueling focused most encounters are against groups, with many enemies being resistant to the only crowd control system (i.e. the force). Instead of handcrafted linear levels, we now have boring open-worlds to waste time in to get from point a to b, with trillions of useless cosmetics to collect. Oh, and we have an useless perksystem now, cuz, ya know, many popular titles have one these days. Story is bland and uninteresting, with many plot contrivances (after you crashland on the next best planet after the intro-mission, this just happens to be THE planet where there was the big OldRepublicMcGuffin) - to the point where I skip the obligatory DarthVader cutscene simply because I just lost any interest at this point in what happens to the characters and the world at that point.

So yeah - everything wrong with modern game development today. Just string together the bare minimum of what could be exspected from a game, and hope people buy it for the ever declining IP that is Star Wars. GG EAids.",1705531875,1705531968,False,2,0,0.537619650363922119,1,True,False,False

This game series so far has been a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars universe and as a huge fan myself I've been fully invested in these games. I really do hope EA continues with this series as I want to see more of Cals story and development. As far as post Order 66 Jedi stories go, Cal's by far is the best and most interesting. This is a very interesting take on the Star Wars universe and I simply cannot wait for more. 

Even if you arent a huge fan of Star Wars the combat in this game is very fun and can also provide a major challenge if you choose so, almost on a Dark Souls level. If I were to critique this game i'd have to say personally am not a huge fan of the Puzzle parts of these games but its not too overdone and it does blend into the overall game play pretty well. The bosses on this game, while do provide a challenge and fit the story well defiantly are not as diverse as Fallen Orders bosses. Just to name one example without giving any spoilers, you fight the same boss three different times throughout the story and besides him there are only a few other different ones but EA makes up for this by giving each fight a unique experience in terms of combat and how the boss works in terms of abilities and move sets and such. 

Overall while  this game had a slow start, it quickly had me on the edge of my seat and I cannot wait for EA to release a sequel to it.

But like so many other games, they made the boss battles super annoying. It's bad enough trying to get through boss battles with the primary protagonist character whose fighting technique you've become accustomed to over many hours of gameplay. But then they throw you to the most difficult boss battle yet that you have to complete with an ancillary character who has only one fighting stance which you may have not been using the entire freaking game. Plus the ancillary character definitely doesn't have all the stim packs the primary character has accumulated. I mean, I went out of my way to find as many stim pack upgrades throughout the game as I could and then they just arbitrarily decide, ""Nope, you get four stim packs now."" So what was the point of all that?

But aside from that, the holes in the battle mechanics are glaringly obvious during boss battles. For example, why is it that pretty much any enemy can interrupt my attacks if they get a blow in before I land mine. And yet, if I get a hit in against any enemy during their windup, their attacks carry through without any hindrance? They intentionally add imbalances like this to create the illusion of a challenge. But it's only a challenge in the sense that you have to memorize every potential move the antagonist can make and be sure you never attack after one that has an immediate followup attack that you can't possibly interrupt even though their windup should leave them wide open to attack. 

Basically, there is a disconnect between when the enemy appears to be open for attack and when they are actually vulnerable. You can't go by appearances. You can only go by memorization of their attack sequences. Is that fun? I don't think so. I think it would be more satisfying to see when they are vulnerable and have the opportunity to capitalize on that. 

This isn't a game of skill. It's a memorization game. But to add insult to injury, every boss battle has three stages where they totally change up their attack sequences in the third stage. Which means you may have spent hours working up the muscle memory for stages 1 and 2, but then that all goes out the window in stage 3. Unfortunately, you have to get through stage 1 and 2 over and over just to get to stage 3. It is so f#@king tedious. And it's not like you can abandon the fight so you can go elsewhere to build up your skills to return to it later. You either get through the boss fight or... that's it! There's no other option other than just not continuing to play the game, I guess. It's just poor gameplay design.",1705459635,1705459635,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 It worked perfectly fine. However, there are a couple of areas that caused frame drops, which lead to the game crashing. But this was much later into the game, and if you leave the area before it crashes, you're fine.

Was really engaged in the story albeit did not like overuse of unnecessary puzzles and random inconsistent, super challenging platforming while traversing the levels. All else is great great. 
The game is a 7/10 for me. Great plot, shows Cal's growth and superb character development for all major NPCs in my view.
Visually, one of the best looking games of 2023. UE4 still is an amazing game engine.. 
A bad PC port though unfortunately. EA probably decided to be like: if you do not have a performance based PC, then it is not for you. 
Doubt it if we will get any further update in the early future. Probably a sudden update after 6 months, which may save this on PC.

Obviously I was quite disappointed to hear about the poor PC optimization at launch, and braced myself for another EA disappointment that I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up for. 

I picked this up on sale and tried to play it, but couldn't get far past the opening 10 minutes due to stuttering - literally unplayable on a pretty good computer. 
I am happy to report that minus a couple of hiccups in cut scenes and the occasional graphical glitch in gameplay I am enjoying this follow-up. The game is gorgeous, and technically it's consistent and stable. 

Without getting into the whole issue around companies releasing unfinished games I just want to say that this effort is appreciated. Ultimately, EA's blunder resulted in me getting a really well polished AAA game for less than $50 while it was still quite new. I'm happy to give this a thumbs-up.

Is it well made? Definitely not... Having to ""Optimize Game Files"" every f*cking startup is just a joke, game crashing might occur if you are unlucky, optimization is still lacking and some QoL features would be desperately needed (e.g. holy hell, how do Force Tears not have a Retry option). 
Is it still a good game? For me, yes. The story is interesting, even if it rarely surprises, the enemies are interesting and the stuff to find during exploration keeps one engaged.

Same as its predecessor though, it is also not more than that. If you are expecting customizing skillsets and maximizing potential like in KotoR, don't look here. Everything you can find is - again - purely cosmetic and absolutely useless.

The story was interesting, and it avoided two of the big pitfalls of modern writing: First, the villains were all interesting, developed characters with understandable and at times even sympathetic motivations. Second, the writing didn't engage in the recent trend of making the main character's actions so dark that they become an unsympathetic villain themselves. If you hate shows and games where the main character is really a villain, you won't find that junk in here. This is a story about an actual hero doing his best in the circumstances. 

I played this game long after release, so I didn't encounter any of the technical issues that happened at launch. I have a pretty good rig (RTX 3080), and it would still have its fans screaming whenever I played this, but the frame rate mostly held up... and the game is absolutely beautiful, so you're getting something in return for all of the technical requirements. 

I've played several Souls-like games before, and I played through this game on Jedi Master difficulty and cleared most of the content, including most (but not all) of the optional bosses. I killed all the optional bosses in the actual world, but left two force tear boss challenges alone (I couldn't quite summon the motivation to fight hard bosses in featureless battle arenas shaped like a dark circle ... come on devs, you have to at least do a little decorating!). Honestly the force tears could have been removed from the game completely with no real loss, if I had known what content was in there I would have skipped them. 

If you like the experience of playing high difficulty, precision combat games, I think this game will leave you slightly unsatisfied on the highest difficulties. On Jedi Master and above, the combat starts to come apart a little bit and reveal some sloppy edges. Enemies are completely inconsistent on what attacks are interruptable ... at times, a small poke will interrupt even an enemy heavy attack. Other times, an enemy will be completely invincible during even a light attack, and there is no way to know the difference other than extensive memorization. Of course, ANY attack that you make will get interrupted by a passing breeze, so the lack of consistency between player and enemy interrupt mechanics makes the combat feel broken. Enemy heavy attacks (especially grab attacks) also exhibit huge graphical glitches. You will frequently dodge far out of the way, yet still get hit (the graphics effectively show you getting vacuumed back into the attack, even though you're well out of reach). I think it's due to a flaw in the game engine, where dodging the attacks is actually about timing, not your position, so if you are far out of range but your timing is ""wrong"", you'll still get hit and the graphics will have to interpolate whatever is necessary to make that be true. If you're playing the game on regular or story difficulty, this won't matter at all. However, if you're considering a play-through on Grand Master, I wouldn't recommend it. Find a different game with better mechanics. 

Anyway, most of this is quibbling. I put 60 hours into this game and have no regrets. Enjoy another great Jedi game!",1705313290,1705313456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun, the story is engaging, the characters have depth, and the game ran fairly smoothly overall. Yes, in highly saturated areas of the game with multiple assets, the game still stuttered a bit. But as a casual player who doesn't care much about ultra-smooth gameplay, I could overlook the stutter issue. One fatal flaw with the game is EA's atrocious save system. First of all, they pretty much force cloud saves. That creates a whole host of issues with multiple user reports of hours of lost gameplay. Secondly, if your game file gets corrupted (which happened to me and is the main reason why I'm writing this) and you didn't backup your files, you lose pretty much all of your progress and have to start a new game. I tried the Jedi: Fallen Order corrupted file fix where you open the game folder in files, create a new desktop folder, transfer the main save file into the created desktop folder, and load up the game again -- didn't work. After losing about 20 hours of gameplay, I cannot recommend anyone to get this game until this major issue is resolved. Now, if you don't mind relentlessly backing up your save files, you can give the game a shot. I probably won't be playing again until this issue is resolved and, ideally, my save files are restored. [TL;DR: good game, still stutters a bit, EA has a horrible save system, regularly backup your save files if you get the game any time soon.]",1705312194,1705312194,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy this game, but it is easily the worst performing game I have ever purchased which is such a shame. Such a laggy mess, FPS lag/drops, stuttering, freezing, and the worst of all just constant crashes. 
It is so frustrating playing for 30 or more minutes just for the game to crash and you lose all that progress!
There is no autosave so if you crash it will load back up to whenever you last saved it.
This game is sadly broken, even with recent updates claiming ""fixes"" it still runs like trash. 
The only reason I recommend the game is because it is actually an amazing game under all the performance issues. I have had a great (yet frustrating) time exploring this universe. If you are patient and can put up with the BS, it is worth buying. (Maybe wait for a sale or buy it on console lol)

I liked the story, more customization options and the different fighting styles with the lightsaber this time including the blaster. Very cool! 
I sincerely hope Disney doesn't do a live action story because after this game, Kyle is a much more complicated character and I don't want Disney to mess that up. The ending is a little surprising if you're expecting a neat, tidy ending, a couple things make not so much sense, but all in all, it was a blast visiting my friends from the first game again and watch them grow and evolve. Especially BD-8. I love that little droid! The fight where you play Cere is better than anything this side of Rogue One and while there was a narrative  that I wish I'd been given a choice on, it was great. 
The only thing I didn't like is all the jumping around and climbing puzzles. This isn't Tomb Raider or Uncharted and it doesn't need to be. Every climbing or ""Parkour"" level I had to do was a drag. 
the ending suffered because choices made in the course of the game seem to be ignored. No spoilers, just saying some behaviors at the end seemed to come out of nowhere.

because.

let's start with the good part. this game has a story that I think is quite good, some scenes are really epic, then there are ups and downs. the ending of this game was enough to make me shed a few tears.
then the graphics in this game are beyond doubt. you could say this is an upgraded version of Jedi Fallen Order.
The features in this game are quite different from the previous game. especially the force cal feature.

the bad part is.
yhis game is very very unstable. starting from FPS which suddenly decreases unclearly. I crash often. what annoyed me the most was the crash during the boss fight in the cave. dozens of losses in boss fights = dozens of crashes. this game has very poor performance.

Now it's day 3 since playing this game and it will not load at all.  I'm currently re-downloading the game to see if that could help fix the issue.

Sure the gameplay and the story is amazing, but I can't play the game more than one day without it crashing on me.

Their update system is also annoying because it'll say ""3GB update"" or something like that, and then it downloads the 3GB but then most patch the entire 117GB game, making a 3GB update take an additional 20 minutes. I had 30 minutes to play a game and it wouldn't let me play until updating, now I have no time left.

Note: everything stated here is my opinion which you are free to disagree with.

Maps:
I felt that the maps in this game were more open and less linear than the previous game, which I saw as a bonus. It wasn't so much that it was overwhelming (except for maybe the first visit to Koboh), but just enough to where you feel like you are not solely limited to just following the story progression 100% of the time. I can tell the developers put a lot of effort into the level design and it turned out very well. On max settings this game is beautiful and had me in awe more than once. I will say that do to some of the less linear level progression I did find myself lost once or twice but due to my own tenacity I just kept trying to figure it out until I did which got me to the end. Free exploration is very rewarding as you go throughout the game, as you gain additional life essence, force essence, stim packs, and skill points that you might not otherwise recieve. Not to mention all of the paints, materials, parts, and other customizations. 

Combat:
Picking this game up after finishing Fallen Order truly feels like a sequel. It doesn't feel like you are starting from scratch and many combat features late game in Fallen Order carry over into Survivor and the skill tree builds upon that (albeit in a new way). I enjoyed this game for the story so I did not play on a difficult setting but I found that the combat was rewarding and challenging enough to where it forces you to learn how to use your skills and learn your enemy rather than just mash buttons. 

Puzzles:
I thought that the puzzles in Fallen Order were a bit overbearing as they stood in the way of the main objective. This is no longer as much of a case in Survivor. You may complete puzzles for a reward, but they are not strictly necessary to complete the game most of the time. I found that the puzzles were fun to figure out and not too obvious. The rewards aren't always worth it in my opinion, but it was fun just to complete the task.

Story:
If you are a Star Wars fan you will likely enjoy this game. If you are not a Star Wars fan, this game might be a bit cheesy for you. The cutscenes can be long but I thought they were all worth watching. One thing I didn't like was how often combat was interrupted by cutscenes, especially when its to keep you from actually killing the boss. If you play this game at a leisurely pace, I'd say you can expect at least 20 hours of gameplay out of it. Spoilers: [spoiler]The Tanalorr story arc was a good one to roll with in my opinion, but getting to Tanalorr was anticlimatic. The story ends when you get there and fight the final boss, but you are only left with a vague direction in which the story may go from there. I also thought Cal being prompted to ""embrace the darkness"" was extremely cheesy and it made me laugh every time I saw it.[/spoiler]

Technical Issues:
I understand that several people have complaints about performance and crashes. I played on max settings and the performance was fine for me. Granted, I have a pretty decent PC. I did experience a handful of crashes, in total less than 10. Just enough to make me paranoid about them happening, so I would save often. I cannot speak on how this game performs at the lower setting levels on less beefy computers, but I think the game is pretty well polished at this point and as of writing this review it has not stopped receiving support.",1705253128,1705253128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fighting more than 1 enemy at a time leads to some of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had in a souls like. So many boss fights are buggy or cheese-able. I defeated a rancor because it got stuck on an invisible wall in the middle of the arena. Some bosses straight up fell through the floor during their attack animations and instantly died, and those same bosses would sometimes push me through the floor and I'd fall to my death outside the game world.
The visuals are also terrible. Running the game on the lowest settings I see frames as low as 15fps running around in the open world, yet there are collectibles that literally do not render unless you play the game on a high enough graphic setting, so good luck trying to 100% if you're not on the highest end PC.

All of the good parts from Fallen order remain. Almost every ability carries over from where you left off meaning there is no ridiculous backtracking to reacquire skills you ""forgot"". This makes for an incredibly rewarding start of the game to those who completed Fallen Order. The combat is slick and improved with 5 different lightsaber stances, brand new takedown animations, and a more diverse set of enemies. Force pulling a heavy assault trooper and having him shoot his own comrades will never stop being fun. And some bosses like Rick or SoO make for incredibly memorable experiences.

Platforming is elevated with additional abilities introduced early on making traversal so much easier and more satisfying. Although there are some tedious climbing sections Tomb Raider style, they definitely make up a smaller percentage of the overall game than in Fallen Order. The mountain ascent at the end is a culmination of all the platforming abilities and is one of the most stunning sequences in the game.

Puzzles are for the most part unchanged in their complexity and you can expect the answer to almost always be force push or pull. This is fine but I wish they did something more with the puzzles. Cal has grown since the last game and we would expect the player to as well. However, I really enjoyed the Jedi chambers scattered across the main planet. These introduced a slightly more difficult set of puzzles which gave a needed challenge. 

The story is as good as if not better than Fallen Order with more tight writing and excellent voice lines from enemies (new and old). The development of old characters pairs nicely with the new ones and none of the character arcs seem to be competing with another. Where the gameplay of Fallen Order felt driven by its overall story, Survivor's gameplay is compelling enough to drive itself. This is not a knock on the story at all and I think the rumors and bounty system greatly add to the overall lore of the universe. 

Performance in January 2024 is completely acceptable. I read horror stories of literally unplayable games or game breaking bugs but I never encountered any of these on my desktop PC (5700, RX 6600, 32gb, 1080p, high graphics, no FSR, no ray tracing). Occasional frame drops when loading a new part of the world quickly went away and I could easily game at 60 fps. Glitched walls or floating enemies only appeared every few hours and never took me too far out of the immersion.

I have not finished the game at this point, but it has evoked some strong feelings, so I'm doing it now.
Firstly, at the time of writing this, January 13, 2024, the game is still very unstable. I get a crash to desktop in practically every session of play, which means a crash every 1-2 hours. You will also lose all your progress since the last meditation circle, so be prepared to retread areas that you have already done.

Secondly, while the main story is engaging and fun, the side content is simply tedious padding.

In terms of gameplay, it is very good. There is a balance of exploration/platforming and combat. The former is what you would expect - environmental puzzles, hidden secrets, etc. Both feel pretty good most of the time. The controls are responsive, platforming sections are usually designed well, and combat encounters, while challenging, are also usually well designed. Take note that I say USUALLY, because there are some that seem to be intentionally designed to frustrate the player, but more on that later.

Most of the secrets are cosmetic, and therefore serve no purpose other than another box on the checklist. Some of them are more useful, such as skill points or upgrades to your health/force bars.
There are also optional Force Tear challenges. They take the form of a combat or platforming challenge. I have encountered a number of them, and for the most part they are fine. However, there are some where the design philosophy seems to be to kill the player over and over again until they eventually figure it out. One in particularly required down to the millisecond timing on a jump, and if you fail it, you have to do the entire section over again. And that wasn't even the end of it. Unless you are a masochist, I would say these aren't worth your time or sanity.

The exploration aspects are significantly expanded from the previous game. I find it to be impressive, but tedious. There are a number of MetroidVania elements, such as interconnecting maps, and barricades to your progress that you find the solution for later, and so are encouraged to backtrack. I find the back tracking tedious, but it isn't strictly required most of the time, so it's a neutral thing as far as I'm concerned.

Combat is good. You retain all your abilities from the previous game, and add more as you go. There are also new Lightsabre stances. There are 5 that I have unlocked so far: Single, Double Blade, Dual Wield, Blaster and Crossguard. Each have their own stats and advantages. You can get through most encounters with any stance, but certain stances suit specific situations better - ie. the Double Blade is the best against groups of enemies. I am a bit frustrated by the fact that you can only have 2 equipped at any one time. This narrows my focus, and prevents me from experimenting with the different stances. It also means that I have ignored some, and poured my skill points into Double Blade and Single, because this combination is applicable to the largest variety of circumstances.

Most enemies you can expect to deal with on your first try. This includes the story bosses. However, there are some optional enemies that aren't meant for the casual gamer to take on. I am of two minds about these. Sometimes I enjoy the challenge, but other times, it isn't clear what you are supposed to do (ie. Unblockable attacks that also seem to be undodgeable). The placement of the respawn points on these doesn't help either, and often requires you to retread an error with enemies just to get back to the fight.

I am enjoying the story and characters so far, and there have been some very entertaining moments, but I think at this point, I am just going to rush the main quest, and ignore everything else.",1705203431,1705203431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-my meaning to the negative reviews
-general quality of the game
-comparison to the first title


The negative reviews.

Most of the negative reviews tell about how unplayable the game gets because of bugs or bad performance. I myself waited for an offer and started the game with mixed feelings. And I was pretty suprised hoe good it was. It crashed only once and the little bugs (a very few i noticed ) were more funny than hindering me in any way. It also wasnt have as laggy as somke comments suggested [Ryzen 5 3600X, Radeon RX6750 XT, 16GB Ram, solid 60 fps on 2K monitor]

I can understand that the high price is somehow greedy of the PUBLISHER and the deemingly early state of publishing wasnt well timed, but it doesn't alter the effort of the DEVELOPER to create a nice game.

General Quality

The game in itself is pretty well made. 

The controls are as simple as varaiable and rich on funktions. Just the right method to make all aspects of the force as accesable as possible. You can now only use two sworstyles at the same time, but therefore there are 5 well designed possible ways to gut your enemies.

The story was wonderfull continued and pretty  ineristing. Even the tutorial was more actual gameplay than a tutorial, but still didn't lack the oppertunity to learn the basics of the gameplay. It stayed thrilling till the end and now i wish for more of Cal's story. 

The graphics are pretty good and adjusted nicely to the rest of the game. Overall the graphic designes of clothing, weapons, characters and surrounding felt really well placed.

The gameplay was astonishing. Also it wasnt't any specific trait it exceeded in, it proofed a  jack of all traits. The mix of Jumpn Run, Bossfights and Puzzles as possible challenges really made wondering, what i will have to face around the next corner. The devs really succeeded in making an accessable, storytelling soulslike, that came with a high variety of challenges and fun.

Everything of these points get added up by a richness in detail. But therefore it can be overwhelming in some situations.

Comparison

Star Wars Jedi seems to evolve pretty good. All expects of the first title where used to build up on. I pretty much liked how they seemingly tried to  improve every aspect of the first title and that they actually succeeded. In the end it is a good mix of old and new aspects, which seemingly grow with the main character.

Even with the big backlash of the cancelculture, i hope Cal's journey is far from over.

I experienced no such problems in the previous game.  The environments are nice.  Combat is fast and furious.  Two high points.  But another really big downside is the save game system.  It sucks!!!  No auto save.  No manual save.  You have to save at checkpoints which are few and far between.  So when the game crashes all your progress is lost.  And this may include some difficult parkour.  I'm not a fan of parkour.  I prefer puzzles.  Hopefully future patches will solve the stability issues.  

ok I got the game running good now.  Visuals on epic with an Nvidia 2070.  No crashes.  Have to give it a thumbs up now.  Game looks great.  

Ok the games looks great but plays like a square wheel.  Too too much parkour!!!  OMG!  This game is parkour on steroids......I thought the first game had alot but this survivor game puts it to shame.  And the story is weak.  I can't remember what I'm supposed to do most of the time cause I'm too busy falling to my death from all the running....jumping....dashing.  Too many hoops to jump through.  Some are ok but if that's the whole point of the game.....come on.  Hire some writers with some imagination.   If you're not a fan of parkour and/or not really good at it (like me) stay away from this game.  Even if it's free.  It's a waste of time that can be better spent on a game that's way more enjoyable. (By the way I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse.  Maybe a controller is better.  I don't know.)

Ok after getting further  into the game (near the end) I have to change my recommendation to thumbs up.  I didn't see it coming.  Events better than any star wars movie or game thus far.  Blew me away.  All the pain I endured from the non stop parkour was worth it.  

Ok I  finished the game and, after giving these ""events"" some thought(I'm trying to avoid spoilers),  I've concluded they just don't make alot of sense (This character's motivation seems flawed to me).  They were more for ""shock value"".  So my opinion of the game remains mixed but I have to keep my thumbs up because the look of the game is fantastic and the combat is great.

Problem is? I can barely play it. Completely rebuilt my PC this past year from the ground up, and this game crashes constantly, and stutters frequently with major frame rate drops.

Looking at other recent reviews it may still be the case that older hardware may struggle with the game.  But I hope not because...

The game itself, is a triumph.  Everything you loved about the original is waiting for you, with really fun upgrades in the complexity and variety of combat styles.  The boss fights are thrilling, and VERY challenging on grandmaster mode. the exploration is heavily rewarded.  And the customization is completely insane.  The amount that you can customize Cal's appearance and your lightsaber is incredible, especially in today's market of exploitative microtransactions.  There are none of those.  Everything is only unlockable through gameplay, and that gameplay is fun and challenging, never a grind.

Finally the story.  No spoilers.  This is the Star Wars I've been looking for.  The first game had a touching and memorable story featuring great characters.  This game has that, but it's something more.  By the end of the story you might agree with me that Cal Kestis is the most profound and complex Jedi we have gotten in the Disney Era.  The writers really took some chances, and the animators truly understood how to let moments breathe and develop.

I truly hope the performance issues with this game don't damage it's profitability, because I am longing for another entry from this team.",1705103097,1705103097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, I'd like to address the elephant in the room. Optimization. The game is incredibly poorly optimized. It runs like total crap. I have an 8700k and a 3080. Running in 3440x1440, I was lucky to get 40 frames. HOWEVER, with some tinkering, (a performance enhancement mod from Nexus Mods and enabling rebar on my computer) I was able to get my frames up to 60-75 frames. Still not ideal given most people who attempt to play won't be on a machine as good or better than mine. HOWEVER, I'm going to move past this topic to discuss what a brilliant game lies underneath the poor optimization. 

[h2]Story[/h2]

This game has a fantastic story, told through in-game discoveries and brilliant cutscenes with incredibly well done mocap and voice acting. It's honestly my favorite bit of Star Wars content from the past several years alongside Andor. 

[h2]Graphics[/h2]

The poor performance isn't JUST because of bad optimization. This is one of the most ambitiously beautiful games I've ever played. Character models are stellar, and it has some of the best looking environments and set pieces in any game I've ever played. This is my new benchmark for visuals. 

[h2]Audio[/h2]

The sound design is incredible. The music very much fits into Star Wars, with many familiar motifs, and plenty of new pieces. The sound effects are incredibly well done too. From enemy sounds and weapon sounds, to the environments' atmospheric sounds, this game is astonishingly immersive. 

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

Jedi Survivor has the best blend of gameplay elements from many of my favorite games. Let's start with the combat, which calls to the deep and challenging combat of Soulslike games. It doesn't have quite the same level of depth or challenge as something like Dark Souls or Elden Ring, but it comes damn close while staying approachable, and the difficulty options let you decide if you want the challenge or not. Regardless, the combat feels very satisfying and rewarding. Now exploration. The large set pieces and open areas densely packed with colllectables and upgrades, combined with the smaller, more tightly designed dungeons cut a balance between games like Uncharted 4 and Twilight Princess. Exploring these large areas is fun, but exploring them again with new skills and items makes it just as satisfying the second time. The skill trees aren't particularly deep, but they are immensely impact, so they really boost the experience. Lastly, the platforming in this sequel has greatly improved to the point that I rarely fast travel. It feels fun running around, jumping, and climbing over the environment to explore. 

[h2]Overall[/h2]

I absolutely recommend this game to anyone that has a machine with the horespower to run it. I really wish we'd get a good performance patch. It would be a 10/10 if it was optimized. But, because of the technical issues, I'll have to dock it a point, making my final score a: 

9/10",1705100867,1705100867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat sucks ass.

The stances are nice in theory. In practice, I never needed to use anything other than dual wield because of the speed. Blaster stance deals too little damage. Double bladed stance is unnecessary if you time your perfect deflects right. Single blade stance is inferior to dual wield. Crossguard stance is far too slow to be useful because enemies hit you mid-swing and interrupt your attack.

Bosses are overly easy, even on the highest difficulty. You simply stand in front of them, perfect parry and dodge their attacks, then you hit them a few times. You repeat it about a dozen or so times and you win. That's it. Doesn't matter which boss it is, if you time your parries and dodges right, you will always win.

The regular mobs are far more difficult than the bosses because you are at a disadvantage by default when you are outnumbered. It is impossible to attack anything if the enemies are grouped up and attack you. Which is always because all enemies have the same movement speed, regardless if they're stormtroopers, chickens or DT droids.

You like fighting the DT droid miniboss? Good news! It's now a regular enemy and you get to fight 2 of them at once while you get shot at by miniguns and run from flamethrowers. 

Fighting bounty hunters is straight up annoying, especially when there are multiple of them. They spam the charge shot attack from multiple directions, knocking you down constantly and not letting you heal. And they run away if you try to hit them because the range of your melee attacks is pathetic and they resist telekinesis because of course they do.

But dear Reader, I hear you saying: ""Git gud scrub."" I did. I completed the game on Hard mode. It wasn't enjoyable.

TL;DR Buy Elden Ring instead.",1705099772,1705100217,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game (as of January 12, 2024) still runs pretty poorly (enough to be noticeable but not debilitating across a full 20 or so hour play-through); it's fun enough to play but nothing innovative (or that in-depth for people already experienced with more traditional Souls-like gameplay loops). Perhaps most importantly, the game is (without sales) $70 and (despite its lush environments, expensive-looking textures, and particle effects) doesn't do anything well enough to really justify that price tag.

But Star Wars has never been a franchise of principles. Star Wars is about vibes; it's about feeling. It's an aesthetic firstly, a vague retelling of Campbell's monomyth secondly, and a semi-functional story about hitting red and blue lightsabers against each other (and doing force tricks) thirdly. In this sense, Jedi: Survivor (TM) is the perfect Star Wars video game. It nails and perfectly expands the aesthetic palette of Star Wars with wonderful new creatures and species designs, better defines some lesser explored regions of the galaxy, and provides just enough Force bullshit to make it all go down relatively smoothly.

It isn't as deeply detailed as Baldur's Gate 3 or as photorealistic as Alan Wake 2 or as stylish as Hi-Fi Rush, but it has that undeniable and infectious Star Wars charm: aliens in strange jumpsuits pressing blinking buttons before jumping to lightspeed; massive dinosaur-like creatures waddling, cawing, and rolling over in desert-dusted ruins; sleek art deco High Republic relics and meditation chambers collecting dust in the forgotten corners of the galaxy. Its story is mostly forgettable and only gets worse the more attention you give it, but that is besides the point. It feels good to cut things with your fully customized lightsaber. It's fun cutting the mouthed spike-balls in half and then blowing its brothers away with your blaster before hitching a ride on a five-foot-long seal-faced bat creature. It's fun to break your double-bladed lightsaber in half and cut a charging rawka into a shish-kabob. In short, the feedback never gets old: the whir of a lightsaber blade, the crackle of stormtrooper comms through their helmets, the oblivious dialogue between two B2 battle droids, then the sound of it all getting effortlessly cut through with the premier tool of the primarily pacifistic Jedi Order.

The cutscenes might occasionally glitch out (the UI elements not disappearing as the black cinematic bars take over, the beginning and ending bits of dialogue getting cut off abruptly as gameplay resumes), but I honestly think that's a small price to pay for a Star Wars pseudo-Soulslike as engaging as this. If you like Star Wars, you should get around to it at some point, though probably in a few years when the price and performance has been drastically improved.",1705095812,1705095998,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

[h2] The Pros [/h2]
Jedi Survivor is genuinely a complete upgrade to the previous game in every single manner. Respawn have taken all the feedback and issues associated with Fallen Order (i.e. lack of fast travel on planets, intense backtracking with no shortcuts) and clearly show they have improved on it. 
The game's customisation through your playstyle and appearance has been improved tenfold, with weathering, aging, many material types, individually replacing aspects of Cal's and BD-1's appearance to really make it the player's own journey through the footsteps of Cal Kestis. 
The different Lightsaber Stances are also incredible, with more than double being provided over what Fallen Order had -- the extra stances are omitted from this review due to spoilers. But each stance comes with it's own unique playstyle that allows the player such flexibility on how they wish to experience the world through their own flavour of combat they prefer. 

A lot of the decisions made has been with the 'Player First' mentality. With the mountainous level of accessibility for any player wanting to enjoy this Star Wars story. 

The story and characters are also fantastic, seeing everyone grow and change from the Fallen Order to Survivor with the inclusion of new characters now introduced new avenues for Cal to go through his journey as a 'Survivor' of the Jedi Order. 

The worlds and attention to detail within them cannot be understated with just how [b] beautiful [/b] this game is. Being on Corusant and seeing the neon signs, the water vapours coming out of vents, the alive environment of one of the deeper levels of the planet-sized city was one of my favourite things about this game. But...lets talk about the cons...

[h2] The Cons [/h2]
Jedi Survivor on PC struggles intensely. Currently I am running an RTX 2070 Super and was required to run the game on medium settings with a lot of lower settings as well ON TOP of adding in a couple of additional external settings to make sure the game ran, let alone play. 
I had an issue where my game would crash consistently that I would find out was due to a bird flapping its wings. The game would process this in a very unfortunate way and crash the whole application. After I applied a setting, it would run, but my FPS would fluctuate heavily. 
In a lot of the open worlds, the game struggled to keep a consistent FPS, it would jump and drop and break the experience it was just managing to build. 

Granted, there have been 8 stability patches since release, but after finishing the game since the most recent patch, it still struggles. I have attached 2 websites that I would recommend to people to go through first if they were to buy the game. But please only get this game during a sale. It is still not worth full price due to the mountain of technical issues, which is such a shame because the game is genuinely fantastic past that.

A fantastic continuation from where we left of last time. the only thing this game is missing for me is real stuff to loot that changes your stats and damage, which will help to fuel exploration. as it is now, i dont overly care if I miss a poncho or two via exploration. looking forward to the rest of the story.

- 1 freeze / restart game(happened within the first hour).
- 1 bug where I couldn't progress the story, restart fixed this.
- A few bs encounters in the game, but encounters that has no time limits.
- I run a 3070, with all settings on at least high. The lowest drops of fps I've been down to is between 30-50, which wasn't unplayable, but certainly not something I would want to play at all day. Luckily this only happens at a few locations, and they're not places where you spend huge amounts of time. Otherwise 70-110fps with no issues is where I'm at.

---------------------------

- Combat is really satisfying, and imo far superior compared to Fallen Order. Where Fallen Order felt like PG combat, Survivor is much more raw, and you get the sense of power.
- Sense of scale is a 9/10, really well done.
- Great story & characters.
- Reasonable amounts of stuff to do at late game.
- Great graphics.
- Customization is also great, and I find myself spending quite some time checking it out.

I don't think any game today is worth $60+. But if you can get this on sale, I would say it is worth it.

Yes i had frame rate stutters but the mostly stayed at 60 fps throughout except looking at the star map it would always drop to low 20s. Graphically there were some minor hiccups here and there some mostly funny, others were a texture in a dark area was missing; audio wise, zero issue. I played this game at near high settings all around at 1440p at (almost always) 60fps with no crashes, no game breaking bugs, nothing of the sort. yes i did have slow down were there i maneuvered too quickly in open areas, but that was very uncommon to rare.

I can tell I'll get more game time out of this one than I did the first one, even if it isn't a great deal more. That being said, here are some of the problems:

The performance issues are real, but they've gotten a lot better. At least now they're manageable. This game will have problems on the steam deck. If the dumbed down graphics or laggy combat don't get you, the freezing and crashing during cut scenes will.

Combat is boring, and that is a direct result of the dinky skill trees. Each lightsaber type is too similar to the others. I just went with the highest damage stance, the crossguard, and never really switched away from it. Once you unlock the powered up throw and the sweep attack, the double bladed becomes pointless, and the crossguard is already better than every other stance from the jump. Wait for enemies to come to you and every fight will be cake. This is on grand master, BTW.

None of the ""puzzles"" were challenging. Though, it is puzzling how coordinated all construction across these planets appears. The tons and tons of railing required to set up the dull, pointless, almost filler-style climbing in this game would result in a staggering bill even the funding for the death star couldn't cover. That includes all three death stars. Let's not kid ourselves here, the starkiller base was just another death star.

The characters were all pretty much the same as the first game. They have one or two goals, and there isn't much deviation. Spoiler, but not really because we all saw it coming, [spoiler]Bode's betrayal was the most tedious bit about this game. It was this whole thing, from the beginning, that was just done to drive a turning point for the main plot and add such a ridiculously boring subplot. Also, how many grenades have I force pushed back towards the thing that threw it? But I couldn't do that with Bode? No? Sure, makes sense. Gotta drive that plot and ignore basic things the force sensitive character has been able to do the entire time.[/spoiler] Bad writing packed with plot holes and stupid gimmicks.

The controls were sometimes unresponsive. I used a Playstation dual shock controller, which is fully supported, and there were many times when I would be smashing the circle button and Cal just wouldn't dodge. At other times I couldn't force push or pull for way too long after doing any attack with the crossguard saber. It wasn't consistent, either. Sometimes I would be able to do those things without problem.

Get this game, like I did, on a steep sale.

Addition: The game optimizes files every time you launch it. The first time takes the longest. It's funny, though. I wonder how this game would run if it didn't burn a minute or two of your time upfront- and it's a minute or two if you're on a good machine.

1. When you're in the key binding screen at the main menu, the mouse does not want to work. You have to click on buttons multiple times before the game finally registers you've clicked on something. Then, sometimes it will just rebind whatever key you clicked on to be the LMB instead of whatever you want it to be.

2. Game will randomly freeze. Even when I have my specs meeting well past the minimum requirements, the game will still freeze up about 30 minutes into every play session. Searching around online tells me it is the anti-piracy software being unable to check the EA app properly, thus it thinks you've stolen the game, and it shuts it down on you.

3. Some keys, if playing on a keyboard will be unbound at the start of the game. While playing through the start of the game, there will be tutorial sequences thrust upon you where the game pauses and instructs you to press certain keys to do certain actions. If those keys are unbound, however, the game will stay paused and you have no recourse other than to simply alt + F4 out of the game, reload an earlier save, and lose your progress.

This game is a bug-riddled mess that was never supposed to be played on a PC.

I felt like this game was of a quality I saw 10 or 15 years ago.

1. Its controls were obviously designed for console gaming, this seems insane due to the predecessor being a nice combination of both PC and console controls. On PC it feels terrible and unintuitive. Menu use is not consistent and moving right on any menu could be mouse, arrow, D, or who the hell knows.
I am not normally a game-pad user, but felt forced to use one here (I tried an x-box controller)... and I hated it just as much. i am sure someone who normally uses a game-pad might be comfortable, but I was not.

2. The writing feels weak and mashed together to attempt to make a story. From the beginning i felt very little, if no connection to the characters, not even the ones I felt something for in the predecessor. I just felt like I was going through the motions.

3. Game-play felt less intuitive than the predecessor. it just felt clunky to me. Like I was being forced into playing a certain way rather than the fluid adaption of other Star Wars games. Multiple times I fell to my death simply because it was not obvious what i should be doing. I felt less like a jedi, and more like an untrained padawan, as if Cal had decided to unlearn even the ability to walk properly.

4. Graphics were the only half decent thing, however they did not feel like an improvement. It looks like they just spent more money on detailed textures and left the rest alone. the issue is, how many people seriously pay attention to the tiny leather creases in Cal's vest when playing?

Overall I simply did not feel involved in the game. i can tell I wont be finishing this one for several years and may become buried under plenty of superior games.",1704984711,1704984711,False,0,0,0.499203801155090332,0,True,False,False

There is a massive VRAM leak that if not handled manually (by restarting the game yourself every 20 minutes to an hour) will simply cause it to crash and sometimes even crash your PC altogether. And on consoles having dips below 720p I mean what the hell.

The story is amazing, the characters likeable and relatable - The world is amazing and the combat is rewarding in a satisfying way. If you're a Star Wars fan this is a game that is simply made for you. If you're not particularly into Star Wars like me, there is everything to enjoy the same way. The exploration, the story, the gameplay are all a strong point for this game. 

So my advice is to wait until the devs actually fix it (which at this point we're starting to doubt they will) or grab it for cheap through a sale because shame on EA for charging $70 for a game that is broken and hasn't been fixed after a whole month since the last patch. So wait and see. If it is fixed at one point then go for it, and I'll even change my vote on this review. If not, there are plenty of other games that deserve attention and that don't crash in your hands.
 
If you own a console, I'd grab it over there. It seems that the performance mode on consoles offers a smooth 60FPS which is better than what a mid-range PC could get, most likely. But I wouldn't take the risk with the PC port if you're running anything less than a 3070/4070 or 7900XT...

Throughout Star Wars media, we've seen our fair share of stories that follow the path of the Jedi, who through hardship, sacrifice, and loss, stray dangerously close to the dark side. Cal Kestis is my favorite example of this yet. Without spoiling, our protagonist keeps me intrigued during the entirety of the campaign to see how he'll end up. Cameron Monaghan gives so much emotion to this role and I love every second of it.

Gameplay wise, Survivor doubles down on activities and collectibles tenfold from its predecessor, and although that may sound good, it can be overwhelming at times with how much there is to collect and grind for 100%. The campaign felt longer to me, but it was also much easier than the first game. I'm not sure if this is because I've gotten better as a gamer, or the fact that I already had the game's pace and fluidity ingrained in my brain, or maybe it was just easier, but I only struggled with a handful of scenarios throughout the game. Saying much more about it would be spoilers, but I think it didn't overstay it's welcome. 

Since launch, the game appears to have been fixed, mostly. I had a few crashes, plenty of texture loading malfunctions, and overall abysmal texture detail in some areas, with the occasional frame drop in high detail areas. Cut scenes played very smoothly, though. The hub area, Pyloon's Saloon, was the center of this problem. I can't say it affected the combat very much, but lulls in the game made it noticeable. There are also a few gameplay related bugs that can halt progress on certain side activities, but I only found this in 2 instances, 1 of which I circumvented and the other I ignored as it wasn't that important to miss. Nonetheless, It shouldn't be there. I would hope in time these problems will be patched. If you're thinking of picking this up, I advise you make sure you exceed the minimum specs, and get it on sale. It functions very well 90% of the time.

I had to upgrade my PC in order to even play this damn game, but I think it was well worth it. I eagerly await the next installment.

I played it on an AMD RX 5700 XT and a Ryzen 7 3700X and I ended up dropping down to mostly medium settings on 1080 and still had many instances of Frame Rate drops, the worst being large spikes in the middle of combat. It's mostly an issue on the large hub area and the AMD FFR would sometimes have to make Cal's hair and other fine details fuzzy to keep performance. I had one Crash to Desktop but nothing else that was game breaking. 

Personally I found the game worth playing despite these issues though it is a bit ridiculous it still performs this poorly after 6 months of patches. Your tolerance to pushing pass these issues should determine if you are willing to gamble. Unfortunately, if you are counting on the two hour refund, you might just be arriving to the biggest problem area and might not have that much time to test if its worth it to keep going. 

All that said, this is one of the best Star Wars games on the market and I'm glad I played it. But it still needs more optimization and its unclear if EA is planning on dropping any more updates.",1704950456,1704950456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Frame rates will plummet in larger areas regardless of what your graphics are set to, and the game will often crash when interacting with vendors or during very important cutscenes. This is exacerbated by an extremely lengthy ""optimizing game files"" loading screen every time you relaunch it, which also makes relaunching the game to test and apply fixes extremely frustrating. 

This game also enforces the use of Temporal Anti Aliasing, which looks absolutely disgusting, and is hugely taxing. If you want to simulate what facial blindness must be like, the TAA in this game can do it for you, because it makes everyone look like mud. The only way to fix this is with mods. 

Maybe buy this one when there's a definitive update, or the game goes under $20.

TLDR, Jedi Survivor is a VAST improvement over its predecessor, Jedi Fallen Order, that is also very welcoming even to those not very familiar with star wars. All components of the game are major upgrades, however the poor performance of this game cannot be ignored.

[h2] The Real Review [/h2]

I've been burnt out of a lot of games lately, and many games on the steam store just haven't caught my eye. This game changed that. I was very invested in this game throughout the entirety of its duration, which on its own is a colossal upgrade over Fallen Order. Fallen order was a roughly 20 hour game, whereas this one took me around 50. I explored as many avenues as I could in both games, and took them at my own speed and played on Jedi Grandmaster, the hardest difficulty available.

The story is easily the biggest improvement over Fallen Order. Fallen Order's story was fine, but there was just something off about it that I mentioned in my review of that game. It was the pacing! The game was paced like a movie, where you have a big action scene, then a slow part and a buildup to the next action scene. Jedi Survivor was finally given a story designed with gameplay in mind, and it breathes new life into this series. There's never a dull moment, every time you log off thinking ""I'm gonna go do this tomorrow!"" and it keeps you involved with what's happening at all times. 

The stances! The stances are the best thing this game could have ever gotten. Yes, there were different lightsaber modes in Fallen Order, however they served more as special abilities than proper weapons. In Jedi Survivor every lightsaber type is its own, fully fleshed out stance that has a full moveset and an entire skill tree.  

Combat has seen a major improvement by opting to overhaul the force abilities. There are many, MANY more approaches to combat now due to new force abilities as well as upgrades to existing ones. Every engagement has a powerful strategy to it that might not be immediately recognizable which greatly incentivizes out-of-the-box thinking and clever tactics for every enemy type. 

Exploration! Not all of us love it, but some do, and those of us that do will be happy to know it feels much more natural in Jedi Survivor as opposed to its predecessor. There's so much more to explore and you never feel forced to do any of it. It all feels natural in the sense of a curious ""huh, I wonder what's down that path"" as you go about the planets instead of there being this question mark on your map and you feeling forced to fill it out. As for the planets themselves, There's two main planets and a few extra, mainly story focused planets, which is more than the first game, especially given that the main planets are massive with loads of upgrades and other things to find. 

Downsides...they exist in all things, and this game is no stranger to them. There's been one thing plaguing this game since it launched, and that's bad optimization. The state this game launched it, whether it's better or worse now, cannot be excused and EA should absolutely be held accountable for it lest it occurs again in future titles. I have quite a powerful computer, so I can't speak too much on my experience, but I will mention that there were absolutely occasional noticable stutters. I averaged 80-110 fps on a 3090ti and 13700k, playing at 1440p with all settings as high as they'll go, raytracing disabled and dlss quality enabled. Do with that as you will.

Overall, Jedi Survivor is a phenomenal game that I enjoyed thoroughly. If you even remotely liked Jedi Fallen Order, I implore you to pick up this game the next time it goes on sale. $70 is definitely a high asking price, but $35 isn't so bad for a game with 50 hours of true content.

My guess i that these people have extremely nice Computers and the game doesn't run perfectly... although it should run better, its just fine for me to beat the game and then some. Overall the story is pretty good, but learning different combat styles with the light sabers and the different force powers is where this game shines, and I definitely get Star Killer vibes at certain points in the combat. I would definitely buy this game in the sale, but I beat the main story and got to about 90% finished with the game.

The game builds off of the first game and excels in every aspect that was in the first game. The combat is very fluid and sophisticated, while being very easy to learn. During the beginning of the game I was struck away with how high quality it felt. As the game went on and progressed, it just kept one-upping itself, so to speak. The game was so enjoyable from front to cover and I enjoyed all of it. There was only really one exception to this almost master piece of a game. The performance. If you do not have a very up to date or powerful PC you most likely won't be able to get solid FPS while playing the game. The game had major stuttering issues for me in the beginning (first 1-2 hrs) but after that I had very occasional stuttering/FPS drops.  Now if you can bare slight FPS drops for 1-2 hours the game is so worth it. The last thing I want to talk about is the story to wrap up this review. 

The story of this game fits so well within all of Star Wars. Continuing the protagonists story after the first game makes it even better and seeing the character growth in all characters, as well as new. Both sides of characters (good and bad) were thought out very well. The lore and storytelling throughout the game was very satisfying and quite enjoyable.

This game is definitely worth full price if you have a great PC, if you don't have a powerful PC get it on sale so if it doesn't perform well you're not ""losing a lot of money"".

Overall this game is a solid 9.6/10

for the infamous performance: the game ran like butter most of the time on my pc; which has an RTX 4070 and 12900F Intel i9. with DLSS on quality and Nvidia's overpowered frame generation, I almost always got over 120 FPS and it even stretched into 200 FPS territory sometimes (epic graphic settings as well). There were some crashes when I first reached Koboh, but they stopped and since I haven't had any crashing issues. I gotta say, I was surprised especially considering what my expectations were going in. either im lucky or they actually patched things out.

the gameplay is usually very smooth and well fleshed out, though, I will say its definitely better suited for smaller combat encounters. when you get like 5 big enemies charging at you all at once by the end planets it just kinda... falls apart. its only for a short time in compared to the whole game though, so I can forgive it. being able to rip through bosses and enemies like a dark souls game is beautiful either way.

the story is magnificent, and a great continuation of fallen order. it even made me tear up once... shits beautiful. I won't say much here to avoid spoilers.

the graphics are absolutely insane, some of the best Ive seen in a game so far. literally, when I first played this game I was just... immersed in the world of Koboh. Jedha's great, Tanalorr is beautiful as hell, Coruscant is Cyberpunk 2077 in Star Wars... god, I LOVE IT ALL.

I got this game on sale during winter break (it was $35) - a friend of mine gifted me a $25 gift card through steam as a christmas gift. this meant I actually only spent around $10 on this game, and my god, its fucking worth.

Had to refund my purchase as I couldn't get past the opening sequence. I have an RTX 3070, 16GB ram and an intel i7 10th gen, which puts me slightly above the recommended requirements for this game. The GeForce Experience app recommends the game be ran on Epic settings.

The game launched fine and compiled the shaders (which this game does every time on boot up for some reason). I started the game and everything seemed okay but then it suddenly crashed in the opening cutscene. I thought that's odd and lowered my settings to 'high' and upped the DLSS (upscaling). The game allowed me to get a little bit further into the game, and I actually gained control of the player character. I continued down the one path I was allowed until going into an elevator where another cutscene started. Crash number 2 occurred at this point. I checked the integrity of the game files. They were fine. I booted one last time and crashed even earlier in the opening cutscene. 

After 3 crashes, I unfortunately cannot play this game. Since refunding, I have looked into 'fixes' online and some people allocate extra memory for the game and such - but I really shouldn't have to be going out of my way to get a £60 game to run on modern hardware. 

The game also appears to be having other issues running on PC with other crashes being reported in the reviews here and online.

This game follows suit with being quite unforgiving with its combat on the normal difficulty. 
There are a miriad of times where you get stunlocked or unfairly ganged up by about 4 high-tier enemies and they slap you to shit and then you die and then you alt+f4 because you cant take the game's shit anymore.

I'd say the bosses are better this time around. Except the final boss... Its still just as sucky as fallen order's final boss.
Unblockable attacks having less than half a second of time to react to... the only difficult part being the final bit where you get stunlocked into oblivion and having your guard broken over and over...

Of course its not meant to be easy... but isn't it meant to be fun to play too?

The new stances are... ok? i don't really know what to mention about them...
They are most likely meant to cater towards whatever playstyle you find best or easier but i found that basically the only one that seems to be viable at all is the dual wielding for speed.
Other than that, they ran the double-sided lightsaber into the ground, added the cross guard which was not interesting at all and got me killed every time i gave it a chance. Out of all of the new things they gave us, im glad dual wield isnt restricted to a single move like the last game. I also like how they gave us a gun/single blade stance which utterly deprecates the single blade stance

I do prefer this games usage and point of view in the post empire-ruled galaxy as it is the most packed timeframe of any star wars part.

I just find it funny that im at a loss for things to write about this game because basically all i mentioned about in my review about Fallen order is true here too.

GREAT story.  GREAT and WELL acted characters.  Well written, well directed, fantastic cinematography and more.  

But even now, this game is full of major bugs.  And it on hardest modes on PC will troll, or it is broken.  It will deliberately break its own rules in hardest modes all day, every fight, every time.  Many fights even on easier mode are just broken to hell and back.  Your mastery matters not at all when things get harder at Master and up (but at Knight and lower everything is a paper puff rollover easy).  Just only if the game decides if you win or not.  It is that obvious.  There are a LOT of game bugs that will crash you and more.  

Devs wanted to make sure you hate this potentially stupendously good game.  They succeeded.  They actually made me, a SWU fan, despise this broken trash.  I will not play it through again.  And that was their intention.

A sequel is great, to me, when you're basically continuing where you left off, with all the controls, tools and skills already acquired still there, and the only difference between the first and the second is the story and adding to what wasn't there. Changing the entire game with controls, stories, skills and people is just irritating. Especially if you're a different character and it doesn't tie very much to the first.

This doesn't do that. It picks up where it left off as it should. 

EXTREMELY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT!

Cons:
1. Not as many places/planets to go to this time
2. Performance was an issue yet not as much as people say and it mostly was because of me(I debugged it from the beginning).
3. I only wish for more interactive dialogue options. 
4. Can't customise the Mantis anymore

Pros
1.  Biggest is already mentioned above
2. Such a beautiful story that makes you hunger for more after it is over
3. So much more customisation for Cal

I recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who loves Star Wars.

Plot telegraphs pretty obviously, but it doesn't matter as the actual story is executed well so it still lands.

Locomotion feels excellent, although how you get around in some of the set pieces did require some suspension of disbelief (beyond even that of what force powers might allow), it's used to play up the spectacle however so it's at least fun even if a bit ridiculous.

Combat is just okay. I played it on Jedi Knight which was not exactly difficult, the power fantasy survives it. The different stances and being able to swap between them was nice, although I never felt any particular need to switch due for strategy's sake. Only major point of annoyance was occasional 1 hit kill moves which, thankfully, were not frequent. The tracking on those abilities though made it so it felt real bad when they were encountered (crazy eyed frogs, I'm looking at you).

Overall, Jedi: Survivor is an improvement to the first game in every way. It does exactly what a sequel should do, that is to say it takes everything that was great about Fallen Order and expands upon it. The gameplay is tough but satisfying, although some boss fights do feel unfair to the point where they're more frustrating than fun. 

Where this game really shines is the writing. Fallen Order's story and characters were great, especially in comparison to all other Star Wars naratives that have come out in recent years. That being said, Survivor really blows Fallen Order's story out of the water. Not only does the overall conflict feel grand and important, the internal battle raging in Cal is what really sells the story. Survivor takes the characters from the first game and develops them further, making them more interesting and easy to get attached to. I cannot wait to see how the narrative continues in the third game.

But as great as it is, it also has many issues;

At least early on, every time you start the game you have to go through the 'initial setup' screen, and every time you have to watch/skip a recap video of the first game.

The menus and settings can be super difficult to navigate because pc controls do not work properly. 
When changing keybinds the menus can get stuck, it can sometimes lock up and fail to register keys being pressed anymore. 
Even in regular gameplay there are some keybinds for abilities cannot be changed and are awful, certain abilities will automatically be used because of the wonky way controls were set up, for example I am often automatically focusing on an enemy and unable to do anything until I hit the focus keybind again to toggle it off even though I never use it in the first place.
It seems this is because it was ported to pc without native pc controls in mind, you often can't click things in menus because it wasn't designed for a mouse, and even just using keyboard it can still glitch a lot.

Lots of crashes in certain spots, almost always DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG 

The 'Toggle Hold Pull' accessibility setting keeps stopping functioning, requiring to go into settings and toggle it off and on again to work.

A native FSR Frame Gen patch would be nice for those who don't have rtx 40X cards.

The UI seems somehow visually worse designed than the first game?

I'm really hoping there will be more updates to come and fix these odd thing for any newer players, because it got really frustrating early on and the badly done pc controls really weighed on me getting into it at first.",1704416138,1704769152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can attest on first run it was laggy and choppy, but easily fixed after lowering Windows resolution to 1920x1080, disabling V-sync, and changing game from Windowed Fullscreen to just Windowed, that last step really helped.  From then on it has been smooth and pretty.  GTX 1660ti, 32gb ram, 2.8 i-9.

Edit:  I played through it once, going again on harder difficulty with more exploration, and really seeing more of the flaws.  I still think its a good game, but the flaws are glaring.  
-Enemies become invincible during certain movements despite attacks hitting them.
-Enemies go from prone to standing in an instant when attacked.
-Most enemies can resist force pull/push despite no explanation of how they can, like robots and raiders.
-Most of Cal's abilities require delaying or charging which is opposite of the game's entire premise:  speed/reaction time.
-Enemies can attack while in conversation and Cal cannot respond.
-Enemies 'combo' attacks cannot be dodged, blocked or parried once begun, (like original NES games where you get stuck repeatedly hit until dead.
-Enemies always get priority when attacking at the same time as your attack.
-Enemies instantly regain all block/stun meter after being hit 1-2 times. (I wish Cal's block meter did that!)
-Blocking is ineffective roughly 30-40% of the time, despite hitting block on or just before an enemy attack connects.  In addition, blocking is in too high demand.  You are required to deflect multiple blaster shots, and multiple melee enemies at the same time, yet you can only block once every 1.5 seconds.
-Enemies with AoE (area) attacks require fast & far dodging, meanwhile your main attacks are with an up-close lightsaber... an oxymoron if there ever was one.  In addition, enemies can perform red area attacks repeatedly, essentially making it impossible for you to attack until they decide to do something else.

There are other issues like places you should be able to walk or jump but are blocked by invisible barriers the devs didn't want you to cross, but didn't bother to put up an actual wall.

With this one I get dragged into a cutscene so unnaturally as they try to have us enter a cutscene from a certain angle and position while we could just be facing the opposite direction and it just makes it look silly. This game needs some serious optimisation. It can run fine at times and then suddenly I am on 30fps. I don't even get that low on any other game even with rtx on. This is very disappointing. 
Also the models could've used a bit more work. Cal looks deformed at times and a slight spoiler here, Eno Cordova looks straight out of a 2010 game while standing next to Cere who actually looks real. 

I would honestly say the game needed another year before release. Like seriously this came out in April of last year right? How can it run so poorly almost a year later? 

Also, any tips on performance would be helpful.

Edit: After playing the game a bit longer, it seems to run a lot better later on in the game. It still has some bugs but they are not so bad that it makes it unplayable. The gameplay took a huge turn and the new moves learned are quite fun to use and make getting around that much better. 
I do not know for sure but it could just be the beginning of the game that runs poorly, not a good look obviously as first impressions are big but as it is running a bit better it does make me enjoy the game much more.

The game is definitely a good upgrade from the previous title with more options for weapons, but I still dislike how linear the game is and how little character customization other than cosmetic options there are.

You spend your time hunting down chests and whatnot only to get a new hair cut. It's silly. I also find it silly that the cross saber is treated like an actual heavy sword. Taking longer to swing as if it's actually heavier. It doesn't make any sense with regards to it being a lightsaber with a guard.

I love that you start with all the moves you learned in the first game and then give you new ones. Is so refreshing to see a game that doesn't start you from 0 again. Also love the different lightsaber stances. They all work different so that you can approach combat with your own play-style.
The story sadly wasn't as good as the first game. Not to say it was bad, but i wasn't as interested in it as i was with the story of Fallen Order and it even was very predictable in some cases.
I didn't had much problems with the performance, it does drop frames from time to time, specially on bigger areas, but i'm sure if you're able to mess around the setting you can work it out. Or play it on a console, that's another option lol

All around, i do think this was one of the best game of 2023, but the strong competition last year and the poor optimization it had at launch sadly made people forget about it.
The game is very well worth the price. Just a heads up, i HIGHLY RECOMMEND playing Fallen Order first. Both games can get pretty insane discounts for the type of games they are. So i don't think there is no reason to not buy it, even if you're not a Star Wars fan

When everything works, it is a visual, fluid, story rich game with excellent audio, good combat and great production value.

However the technical side of things leaves a lot to be desired. I have an RTX 4090 and at 4K with RTX the stuttering is incredible and there are ton of visual glitches. The game crashed about 7 times in 58 hours making me paranoid about saving often. Thankfully with Frame Generation it becomes much smoother but if you don't have Freesync or G-Sync, you might struggle. Also, you have to wait every single time before playing for 2-3 minutes for ""optimization of files"".

There's a lot of content in the game and it can become a bit tedious with a ton of collectibles. There are maybe 300-400 of them in the game.

Taking into consideration the technical issues, this game is a solid 7/10. Without those, it is what you want from a Single Player Star Wars game and a sequel to Fallen Order. A 9/10 there.

The game itself looks great and plays well enough on my 4070. I'm not through the main story so can't comment on that. I do like to 100% open worlds and that's where a lot of player frustration comes into play with this title.

Example 1:
Had a puzzle where you had to move a rolling mine from one point to another. So I cleared the route of enemies, got the mine, game respawned the enemies even though I didn't rest at a bonfire. Mine exploded.
Cleared it again of enemies, quickly got the mine. Enemies spawn right before the entrance where I had to drop the mine off, mine goes to the first enemy and explodes. 

Example 2:
Spent 40 minutes trying to get past a gust of wind on an open world obstacle. The game had been training me to turn off machines or pull switches to advance such puzzles. I looked all around the area, figuring I was missing something obvious. In the end I searched on the internet, and it turns out I needed a new power to get past that particular obstacle that I had not received yet. The game did not inform at all that I needed some new kind of power, even in the way of a simple 'can't get past this, I'm missing something' line from Cal.

There is a lot of frustration like that where mechanics teach you one thing, then open world traversal requires another. In that aspect the world itself is quite hard to navigate as well. Jump puzzles aren't hard (remember jump puzzle difficulty is often subjective) but some are downright insane, especially some of the tear/fissure challenges. 

The 'bonfire/sight of grace/dark souls save system' does not work consistently. Many enemies respawn even though I never rested or fast traveled, even when never exiting an area (see puzzle issue above, where respawning enemies kept exploding the mine that you have to precariously move across the map). 

Things are more polished than the first title. But it's still 'off'. I can't put my finger exactly on what, but my guess is that the issue is game testing. Either they didn't listen to their gameplay testers or ignored feedback, especially when it comes to puzzle solving and 'game logic', or they just didn't test it well enough, only testing the 'happy flow'.

Which leads me to the last issue with this game, 'can't do this/can't go there.. because GAME LOGIC'.
""You can't simply jump that 2 meter high ledge and get to that area, even though 1 minute before I jumped a 7 meter gap without issue, because.."".. game logic. 
""You can't climb that ledge, which looks 100% identical to that other ledge that you CAN climb, because"".. game logic.
""You can't jump attack here, but you can do it there, because"".. game logic.

That game logic is illogical at best.
So when this is on sale and you have a few free days, buy it and play the main story. Do not try to 100% unless you are a masochist and love semi-broken-but-functional gameplay mechanics and logic.",1704718378,1704718743,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Over all: This game is playable runs well enough to get you through the story. In my experience I haven't had the game crash or had a bug that soft lock me in areas. I do recommend giving it a try when its on sale for around 50% off. For a $70 game wouldn't  recommend it at all.

The issues: As I said before the game is playable, but there are many bugs when it comes to graphics and the in game cut scenes. Fist one is this game goes through an optimization process EVERY TIME IT STARTS.  So When I bought the game I thought I had to refund it because the intro of company bumpers and logos where running at 10 fps. Then it hits the optimization process. Why they thought it was a good idea to have the optimization process after the bumpers and logos is beyond me, but every time the game starts up it will look unplayable. 

Game Play issues: I haven't had to many bugs that would affect game play. At most I would drop frames for a bit for them to pick back up again, but  this was rare in some cases. Only really happened when I was in an area for the first time or there was a lot of explosions on screen. When I fist started playing I noticed harsh lighting issues or objects that would be called in if I moved the camera fast enough resulting in the to flicker in. This happened often with tight or dark areas. Rarely I would be able to push enemies through walls  that tossed them out into the void. Things like the ships holo map for selecting planets looks like utter garbage with very low texture that made it look like it was being rendered by a ps2. It also made the game lag. 

Cut scene issues:  Here is where most of problems I would find. Since most of the cut scenes are in game most of the same issues persist from the game play section but worse some how. A lot of time you can see the frame rate drop dramatically objects be called in or flicker in and out of existence. At certain points you can see them accelerate and slow down for normal dialogue. Like the ultra-HD scam you would see in Best buy where it will be playing a movie and the movements of the be fast and when they people start talking it would slowdown.  I found this as an issue because I find it as an eye sore and explosions, light saber wooshes and blaster fire would have a delayed impact sound wise. When flying through space A lot of the textures would look compressed and grainy making ask what I'm looking at most of the time because it was hard to make out any details. At one point the characters looked at it and said ""Its beautiful"" for it to pan over and it be so low rez to the point where I had to nod my head and say sure sarcastically.

My experience with performance has been less so, but I played the first game on base xbox one so I can manage to an extent. However, new effects causing shader comp stutters for ~1 or 2 seconds is getting aggravating, it distracts heavily in cutscenes and quieter character moments.

EDIT: Finished the game, and the story truly was great.

Still, the framedrops on Koboh are egregious and unacceptable.

I can absolutely recommend this to anyone with a higher end PC or is willing to play at 30 fps on a lower end rig, and hope that the third game improves on the core just as much as this game did for the first. I had no crashes, and while the performance is not what it should be, the game itself was  enjoyable enough to look past the drops. Characters were fun to spend time with, the core group being great to listen to and interact with. The story doesn't focus solely on the Empire which makes me glad - and allows them to shine when they need too without retreating the traditional ""rebellion"" points so much Ep. 3-4 media covers. The plot feels organic and largely isn't padded out. Game play is wonderful - the new movement abilities make the platforming feel better than the first game and honestly sticks out a lot to me in general with how great it feels. New enemy types and re balancing on some abilities (pull, removal of slow as a force ability) improves the flow a lot. Hacking droids and confusion were great abilities to not make Double-Bladed stance the go-to for crowd control. Bosses felt fresh, and the new stances like Blaster and Greatsword felt good to use and mixed up combat.

Bulletised Version:
Pros: 
   - Greatly expanded combat move-set and traversal abilities.
   - A great story that follows up on the previous game without retreading, character growth feels natural and while one twist is somewhat predictable, other parts are not and the journey still feels good to play through.
   - Planets are MUCH easier to navigate, there aren't any areas like the Swamp in the first game that are borderline impossible to travel across.
   - Enemy Variety is much larger than the first game, with the Bedlam Raiders helping mix up combat encounters and keep the Imperials from feeling fatigue.
   - Bosses were overall an improvement from the first game; (Skip this if you want to avoid spoilers)
          - Each of the Dagan fights felt different enough for him to not feel like the same boss, particularly the final one in the observatory.
          - Ravis was probably one of my favorite fights from the game, if a little easy, the pacing on it was excellent and the second phase felt really good to play against.
          - Bode could have been harder in the final phase, but overall was a very good fight to cap off the game.
          - Other smaller bosses and the bounty targets are a good way to add some encounter variety, non-Jedi bosses using a mix of blaster and saber was nice as well.
          - Some of the wildlife still feels a little overturned sometimes. I.E the Wampa things in some of the Koboh areas are a little crazy the first few times you encounter them.
   - The additional stances - Blaster, Dual, and my favorite, the Greatsword Crossguard Saber, did a lot for combat as well, as they were each very fun to use.
   - While jarring at first, the change to have some enemies resist pull and then make you parry them to pull them I think was a huge improvement over outright immunity to the status.
   - Removal of slow overall improved the game-play, the ability was effective but not interesting to use.
  - (Spoilers) I also liked how they actually made Cal more ""grey"" in the sense of how the dark side is utilized before and during the boss fight, I.E being necessary to defeat Bode but also an uncontrolled force as shown in the ISB facility. It feels realistic in how they handled it and doesn't just fall into the traditional ""dark side evil jedi don't do"" thing that so many other supposedly ""netural"" (i.e Ahsoka) Jedi end up parroting.

Cons:
  - Performance was a negative. I have a I-7 13700 with a 4070 and would struggle to hit 60fps in some areas. Raytracing I used some on Courtesant before turning it off due to perfomance hits. It is not unplayable but definitely should be better as most players do not have higher end rigs, and for how well these games preform there is no reason there should not be more optimization.
  - There was some graphical artificating present in indoor areas when quickly moving through or rotating the camera. This was only present indoors however, and was relatively minor.
  - Some enemy types are less thought out than others, I.E Flametroopers who reload too fast making pulling them the go-to to defeat them, and the spike balls on Koboh having hitboxes that do not match their attack animations.
  - I would have liked them to maybe have one more planet or so to the game to add some variety? Koboh is HUGE and some of the story destinations there could have been moved to another planet in the system just to add some visual change. 
  - I wish there was more to Tannalorr other than the Final Boss, having some exploration to it even if it was post-game only would have been nice to see more of it.
  - Rumors largely being useless aside from simply pointing you in a direction, actual sidequests with rewards tied to them I think would have been more interesting since many rumors autocomplete if you explore before they become active.
  - Fully optional abilities that you have to explore to find, I.E the electricity thing, as it kinda causes exploration to be discounted early on since progressing the story is the only way to unlock new traversal abilities.",1704658485,1704659513,True,1,0,0.512320339679718018,0,True,False,False

Are you a fan of invisible walls and poor level geometry? Well you're in for a treat. Think you can just jump past that pipe? NOPE, its a wall. Want Cal to grab that ledge you're jumping at? Well, that wasn't the developer's intention so you just have to sit there and wonder why Cal wouldn't grab the wall.

That's not even all!!

The combat system in this game is so half baked that it you feel so powerless as a Jedi. You have TONS of options. (They did a good job at making the game feel more robust than the first one.) But, your options don't really change anything. 

Wanna be a two hander big sword guy? Great, they have a play style for you. BUT you get no i-frames so you get knocked around constantly even by tiny bird enemies. I know what you're thinking, skill issue?

LOL NOT EVEN

you hit enemies to damage their ""block bar"" but legit if you let off pressure for half a second, their bar regens. As if that's not frustrating, your hits barely do any damage so combat becomes an attrition game of mashing instead of the pseudo-souls style combat we got a taste of in the first one. Now don't get me wrong, first one ain't a masterpiece by any means but holy crap did they really just phone this game in. Would've probably been better off just going full DMC hack n slash if they wanted to have the artificial difficulty like this.

There are SOME positives. Obviously the world building is there, its Star Wars; and the maps are pretty massive. But damn is the story predictable and how can I feel like a powerful jedi when I'm hitting things with my lightsaber like 50+ times before they go down.

-Fast Travel is implemented which saves a lot of time.

Cons:
-Some Parts of some Missions are just annoying.
-Some Parts of some Missions (platforming) are very unintuitive
-Some Bugs made it from the first game to this one...
(fe. Being able to walk freely when a sequence should be played in combat where you have to press a button repeatidly)
-Sometimes it still stutters 
(but closing and restarting the game seems to fix it... still while having to save on meditation points, this is not a good solution...)
-Another major Negative Aspect has been some attacks in a few Boss fight.
(There are two types of attacks, 1 you can block and dodge, 2nd the red ones which you need to dodge. Yet some attacks that aren't red will lock you the defensive stance, so you can't dodge once you block them, those attacks get followed up by a red one that you obviously can't block, but because you are locked, you can't dodge them... This is just stupid, make the attacks red or something else... Yes you could dodge them all... but it is still stupid.)

Overall I have to say, even if those negative Points are annoying, they do not occur that often and the good ones, especially the very good story, outweighs them.
I would rate this game 7/10.

It improves on most things, but performance will probably never be fixed, and the combat will have initial appeal to those who appreciate soulslikes but it has flaws that will put off people who are experienced. If you can deal with that the game is overall good.

There's really only one area where more detail is needed than what you can get from a cursory look at the steam page and other reviews. Combat.

This game wants to be more like sekiro than dark souls, and while it can be fun it fails to understand what made sekiro good. Anything above a mook with a blaster you'll attack a few times, get parried, then the enemy will attack a few times and you're expected to time your blocks to deplete their posture which opens them up to taking more damage. However, unlike sekiro breaking posture doesn't guarantee you a kill or removal of a healthbar, it only lets you get about 3 or 4 hits in before their stamina recovers. Most enemies don't have a lot of health so this would be fine but posture gauges can take awhile to deplete and they regenerate pretty quick if you're not applying pressure to them. Also enemies can do unblockable attacks where they  glow red for a moment before striking to warn you. This system works well enough... in 1v1 combat. Against groups it starts to fall apart. What happens in a group is that the enemies will start to gang up on you, and typically in groups the devs will often put two copies of the same stronger enemy type and their attacks will overlap creating situations where it's impossible to avoid tons of damage without backing off entirely, letting their posture refill. And even in some cases there are enemies who will overlap unblockable ranged attacks. This is not helped by the fact that there's only one combat stance (dual wield) where you can cancel out of animations, effectively making it a stance you always have to have equipped on higher difficulties. Finally, you WILL have performance issues, I did even with a 3080, which can make parrying in areas where there are performance problems basically impossible.

The issue is Respawn doesn't really know how to make a good difficult game. You can make enemies harder by giving them punishing move sets, or making them harder to punish or making punishes less effective. You can make encounters more difficult by adding more enemies. Instead of intelligently picking and choosing from these methods, the devs decided to kitchen sink any encounter that they wanted to be hard. Or in the case of some legendary enemies (bosses that are just elites that do more damage and have more health) inflate their values to where there's effectively a minimum health requirement for encounters because on your first playthrough you will simply not be able to get out of any real fights without taking damage. As far as playing jedi go, Cal is the weakest jedi you can play in any game. He has a lot of different stances he can use but he's actually not that much stronger than a guy with an electro staff. Any melee enemy can block blaster bolts for some reason, and without heavy skill point investment force powers are not that strong, using a fat chunk of your meter to lift an enemy or mind control them for just a couple seconds. There are ways to make him stronger like increasing his max hp, max heals, max force, and skills that give him new moves or powers but you will feel like you're up against poor odds most of the time.

This is all to say the combat system will not impress the action game or soulslike connoisseur. It's a step up for sure from your normie movie game combat system that's afraid of depth, but Respawn didn't want to alienate those normies so the combat ends up having a lot of balancing issues. Bosses and your average fight can be fun and satisfying. However you will frequently, especially towards the end of the game, come up to an encounter which is just not very fun because the design of the encounter clashes with the design of the combat system itself. It's clear to me the devs realized this issue because you have a sort of ""super"" force power that charges up with attacks. Through most of the game it slows enemies around you until they've been hit once or twice (basically letting you 1v1 a guy for a little while, where the game is strong) which near the end doubles as a rage power letting you 1 tap all but the tankiest enemies. This power is a crutch to get through the hardest dogpiles so the devs wouldn't have to think too hard about designing their encounters.

If you're not looking for ""sekiro/dark souls but it's star wars"" there's a good game here. The combat simply fails to hold up to scrutiny of any real depth. If you have NO performance issues because you have a 4090Ti or something then you can play on the hardest two difficulties and probably still have a good time. Otherwise just put it on medium and cruise through it, this game isn't strong as a difficult or challenging game. It's stronger when the combat has enough room for error that you can appreciate the spectacle of it better and not be forced to bring the ""good"" lightsaber stances instead of the ones you like most.",1704640224,1704640224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ok, so first off, gameplay. You start out more or less where you left off abilities-wise from Fallen order. You already possess all the force and BD1 abilities from the last game, though some of the lightsaber skills are innate, and a few need to be unlocked again. This game does however have its own suite of traversal upgrades for you to unlock (including a grappling hook), as well as the usual ability upgrades and a few perks on the side if you want to mess with that. Its the same basic gameplay as the first game aside from that: Sekiro clone, since we're just calling it that now.

As far as fighting and progression goes, the first half of the game is pretty strong, teaching new players pretty well and getting veteran players a warmup. But the second half of the game kind of ran out of ideas, and just starts throwing tons of heavy enemies at the player often, as well as a few multi-boss fights (which NEVER works, and is never fun) just to irritate you. The final boss was... well he was OK. Not sure what all the fuss was about, there were more challenging fights in the game.

Story-wise this game gets a higher rating from me compared to Fallen Order for the sole reason that it plays fast and loose with common tropes. In other words, it ended up being predictable at some points, but managed to be unpredictable and even surprised me more than a few times. I don't dislike it honestly, its nice to see things not following the typical predictable narrative pattern.

Though the game also did leave off on a bit of a cliffhanger. I won't spoil, but something major happens that affects both the character and gameplay in the second half of the game, yet the game doesn't really highlight this, or even attempt to elaborate much on it. It ends with it being unresolved, presumably for the sequel it is definitely setting up.

Overall good rating, not the best in the world, but for the most part it was enjoyable. I would rate it 6/10, simply because the composition of the fights in the second half of the game became more annoying than fun more than a few times.",1704612671,1704612671,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

I love the open world environments and ability to explore to find more items. You earn all the cosmetic items by finding them in game. There is so much content to this game that I have only scratched the surface at 25 hours. This game really will challenge players of all skill levels. It's fun game and great sequel just know that if you have a lower end system you might need to wait or upgrade. This game is currently better, but not perfectly optimized. It still has bit of hitches. At least it's not stutter city like it used to be. Makes use of new graphics cards. fluid motion amd 7000 series and nvidia frame generation 40 series. So It really asks for these cards. If you have 3070 to 3080 you should be fine. If you have 6800 to 6900 amd you should be fine.
Update I just beat the game. This game feels like 2 to 3 times the amount of everything from the original. It feels more than just a sequel it evolves everything while adding more. It's everything I wanted and more. They devs through ever amount of content they could in the game with meaning. I feel like they nailed it the issue is the game needs update still.

3080 Founders Edition, I average 140 FPS in Heaven Benchmark on everything maxed as far as it will go at 1440p. That's 4 frames below my monitor's refresh rate.

I get a fluctuating 20–80 FPS in Jedi Survivor on the following:
    Low everything
    DLSS on Balanced
    Ray Tracing off
    Motion Blur off
    Film Grain off
    Chromatic Aberration off

Stutters heavily, with the largest FPS drops in the more ""open world"" environments, like after you crash your ship on Koboh. 

Still do not recommend buying this game.

**Post October Update**
While slightly more stable, FPS drops are still insanely common. The addition of nVidia DLSS is a nice step, and setting it to ultra performance may stabilise the game, but also make it look like a load of crap. Yet another example of Game Developers using upscaling as optimisation. Game can't inherently hold a stable 60 FPS on medium or higher graphics at hardware specs above the recommended options. This game should still be on your ""wait to buy"" list. 

**Post July Update Edit**
Running this for the first time since June, there was an update in July and none in August. While not a potato in a dumpster fire anymore, it is still a potato. Rig is still well above recommended hardware specs as stated in previous edits, still can't run this game at max. Ray tracing off and medium at best graphics settings get me a smooth gameplay experience. Meanwhile larger games with better graphics run seamless at 90+ FPS on my rig. Respawn and EA Games still have a lot of work to do here, but I doubt they'll put much more effort in to it. Either get the best overkill hardware money can buy, or come to terms with running this at mediocre settings with arguably top tier hardware.

**Post June 20th Update Edit**
FPS still fluctuates heavily between 30 and 65 while overclocked, this is at max graphics turned on now. I am way above the recommended hardware specs, let alone the minimum hardware specs, so maintaining a minimum 60 FPS all the time shouldn't be an issue. Game is still not optimised obviously.

**Original Review**
TL;DR how did Respawn let this happen?!

Forget the steam deck, this thing barely runs on a good gaming rig. Fallen Prder (IMO) was a master piece, but Survivor? Jesus…

TL;DR: Buy it on sale if you enjoyed the first one. It's way better on almost every aspect. Performance sucks so don't expect anything above 60 fps. No ray tracing unless you're on a 4090 with a current gen CPU.

Review:

I have a general rule of a game being worth it if it gives you around 1 hour per € you spend. I bought this during the winter sale for 35€ so it achieved just about my standard. The game improves on almost everything compared to the first one. I just completed the story and did a fair bit of side questing, though i have a lot more to do. That said the story was overall good but not mind blowing. Some moments left me really scratching my head. A certain sequence was particularly boring to play but i am not gonna spoil it here. 

As for performance i have a 5900X with a 3080 OC and 32 gb of ram and i got ''almost'' steady 60 fps @ 1440p everything on epic without RT throughout the whole game with minor dips and stutters on very specific areas, bear in mind this is with the latest performance patch. With RT my fps would tank to around mid 40s in some sections so i turned it off. Weird enough i think the game is somewhat CPU bound. Maybe it'll improve in the future but i highly doubt it. Sad to see a game this day and age that compiles shaders for a solid 2 minutes every time you launch it. I'll give it that it really does look beautiful nevertheless.

Sad to see such bad performance cause the game is really good. I can see myself playing for 10+ more hours to try and complete the skill tree and try new game plus. So there! you know what to expect.",1704596456,1704596660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story sounds somewhat interesting but you have to get through so much unbearable shit that it's not worth it and i'll probably just watch a youtube video.

Anyway, my problems with it and mainly not with the combat, although I did find that repetitive and boring button mashing, but with the parts between the combat.

This game is very beautiful but i don't have time to appreciate the beauty because the traversal is unnecessarily complicated with the weird triple jump parkour and confusing, unclear, puzzles which i am constantly looking up because the game doesn't show you anything. 

This game is also very linear for an open world game, it's very similar to the new God of War games but with a lot less cutscene and a lot more resting. The resting mechanic in this game is also stupid and gets annoying and *repetitive*.

Pros:
- Great gameplay. They definitely upped the difficulty a bit, but once you progress you are also become OP compared to fallen order. It feels quite balanced in the end. Lots of variety to play. Definitely has a dark souls-vibe, but it's still star wars mostly.
- Lovely story. Great follow up to fallen order, and a good set up for the final title. The lines between good vs evil become blurred and enter the grey area. Cal is more experienced, but also still has a lot to learn. Great writing, acting & voice-acting from all actors. No character feels out of place. Plus a good set-up for the final title. 
- The exploration has been increased ten-fold. Much more to do, and none of it felt grindy. If you're looking to complete everything at 100%, there's quite a lot of backtracking, but if you follow along with the story, you'll unlock about 80% organically. 
- Music is great as ever. 

Cons:
- Obviously, the performance issues are still a thing. Although it's definitely more playable now, there's still regular framerate-drops, and you'll need a decent pc to play it. I got a mid-end pc, and performance was still struggling at big or open areas. Don't play with rtx yet, this game can't handle that. My game crashed 3 times during the entire playthrough without rtx, kind of annoying.
- Playing with mods disables achievements, but the game doesn't tell you that. I think it should.

Final verdict: Is this GOTY? No. But is it fun? Absolutely! If you can look past the performance issues, there's an absolutely great game underneath with a great story and tons of variety in gameplay. Worth 70 bucks? No, but worth it on sale. if you've played fallen order, it does everything better. I bought it on 50% discount, absolutely worth the 35 bucks!
If you liked fallen order, play this game! If you haven't played fallen order, play that game first, it's only 5 bucks atm and still a very strong title. Jedi: Survivor is a solid 4/5 for me, despite performance. I'll be replaying this title quite a lot of times probably :)

Very fun game with many improvements from Fallen Order. You start off already feeling fairly powerful, so there's no hard resets from the experience gained in the first game, and then you only get more powerful and competent as the game progresses. Skill is definitely rewarded in combat and everything feels earned. 

The story was interesting, though not as compelling as in Fallen Order. I feel this was mainly due to not having one clear antagonist throughout the game and splitting the screen time given between multiple which meant their motivations weren't fully fleshed out.

The customisation is great and with the new hub area at the Koboh saloon you really get immersed into the game and build a connection to all the different characters.

Performance is definitely not very good I was mostly at ~60fps with semi-frequent drops to ~30fps. The galaxy map was the worst however which would always drop me down to ~10fps. I've had multiple crashes to desktop, some while just exploring and playing the game, and others when tabbing out to my second monitor. I also experienced stutters once which was solved by changing the program priority in task manager.

All in all a great game just let down mainly by the poor performance.",1704549079,1704549079,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'll post my specs below, but after over 40 hours in the game I've only experienced one crash, and that was about 5 hours in. Outside of that I've had zero issues with performance or stability. 

I'll let better writers provide a review of the game and gameplay itself, there are plenty of wonderful reviews out there providing that detail, and I simply wouldn't do it justice. 

The only single gripe I have with the game is that it has to ""compile resources"" every time you start the game, and that can take upwards of 2-3 minutes. It's not a deal breaker by any means, but it is a little annoying. Outside of that, no major complaints.

If you want to run this game at high or max settings regardless of ray tracing, you need a GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM and 16+ GB of RAM. The CPU also needs to be 6+ cores, maker does not matter. This puts your PC on par with the strongest current gen consoles.

I managed to get this game to run at a consistent frame rate (20 in intensive areas and up to 70 in less intensive ones) at ultra settings WITH ray tracing using a slightly kinked RTX 3060 and a Ryzen 3600, both are pieces of tech that are considered obsolete today. Now for the actual review.

REVIEW:

I will admit, I waited until the Winter 2023 sale to buy this game, since I do not support games by spending $70 for the ""base game experience."" However, the $35 I spent led to me discovering a complete sleeper hit from this year. 

I played Fallen Order finally last year and was genuinely surprised that it was a solid combat game with metroidvania style exploration, but the story fell flat in the end and the combat didn't feel... ""Free."" To put it in a basic sense.

Jedi: Survivor completely blows all of the shit Fallen Order did out of the water. If you are a metroidvania connoisseur, like Souls-like/Yakuza style combat, and/or love action RPGs, this game is quite possibly your GotY. Unless you're not a Star Wars fan, then you might only like the game in the end. 

On top of that, the story is straight up one of the best pieces of writing in 2023. Screw any kind of route you can take in Baldur's Gate 3, this story is consistent, never skips a beat, and always keeps you second guessing, which is something Star Wars fans have been waiting for YEARS after Rise of Skywalker. I actually got very emotional in the last third of the game. 

I highly recommend getting this game IF your PC can run it, or on a current console platform, and preferably when it's on sale.",1704503445,1704503445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then I thought back to Cyberpunk and how everyone was saying the exact same thing there. Like with Cyberpunk this game runs very good for me, I hold a consistent 50-90fps with zero stutters and only one crash so far (In 5 hours of playing thats not too bad) and some mild frustration because the settings menu was bugged for whatever reason when I first booted the game up, a restart of the game fixed that. Other then that zero issues. Keep in mind I am running a 3070 currently so I am not exactly mr big bucks or anything and I am running the game on max-high settings ray tracing 2560x1440. 

The game does seem to be very CPU and RAM dependent for some reason though, it eats a good 8gb+ of ram at peek and absolutely devours CPU cores, I run a I9 7900x and I hit peeks of 70% usage, I never see any other game hit peeks that high, only time I have seen higher is when I am rendering something. So if I had to guess the game is just CPU hungry and most people skimp out on their CPU because 99% of games are GPU limited. Soooo maybe just dont run a old intel CPU and the game will be fine. The min specs are definitly very generous I dont think this game would be playable on those, but yeah if you struggle to run this game just consider a CPU upgrade and you will probably be fine, and/or stop trying to play modern AAA releases on a toaster and expecting it to work.

There's really nothing I can add to the review pile that hasn't already been said. I went for it because it was 40% off and Fallen Order was my gateway drug for souls games. The game itself is greatly improved from it's predecessor, more mechanics and play styles to mess around with. The new platforming mechanics are pretty sweet, but the gameplay loop is way too dependent on it, I feel like I have to platform for 10 minutes for every 5 minutes of combat.  

The combat is really only difficult because the frame rate will just drop to 10 FPS mid boss fight, or because you're surrounded by 30 enemies at a time, but overall is fun and satisfying to play. 

Games like this always just make we want to go back and replay Sekiro though, and when I do I just have more appreciation for how freaking good the combat system was in that game.

In all seriousness the story does get super crazy and gets a little ""yeah whatever""
definitely gets ""gamey"" with certain moves in boss fights that are more ""funny stupid"" than ""wow thats cool."" 

Classic trait from the first game of a boss spamming unblockables on the last phase 
overall villains fell a bit flat and the block meter is just too short for the sheer amount of enemies you fight (especially the last level)
unnecessary amount of mechanics that you'll use for 20 minutes and not touch again until the end of the game

BUGS:
Buttons randomly deciding not to work was extremely annoying and immersion breaking.
Also don't go into steam overlay while interacting with a force echo, that was a guaranteed crash for me.

I played my entire play-through on Master yet that last level with no rest points was absolutely criminal and would not be possible for anyone above Jedi Padawan.

Definitely an improvement over the first game but has some serious bloat mechanics, just plain stupid boss attacks, a block meter which does not reflect the amount of enemies they throw at you (yes i maxed the block stamina) , and a last level that has NO rest points so its impossible on any difficulty above Padawan.

BUT...
The PC port of the game is downright dreadful, it's better than it was on release, but it's still abysmal,
luckily,  just before the game was released, I had upgraded my PC, from an old one with dreadful performance, as such I was used to getting a maximum of 30 on certain games.
Thanks to this, I didn't experience performance drops, I'm so used to getting FPS drops that I didn't spot it.
In conclusion, everything but the performance is great, and thanks to being so used to poor FPS, I functionally experienced the game without the performance problems.
The game is great, but the performance is pretty bad, most of this can be remedied by installing some mods and turning your graphics down.
I would honestly suggest playing the game, but I just can't recommend paying £60 to EA, especially whilst they're pushing out unfinished games, rushing devs, and refusing to fix the broken games or have them complete on release.

1. The performance issues are mostly resolved.
Throughout my playthrough, I only encountered three bugs that caused me to lose progress (two of them were in the same spot). They collectively only set me back about five minutes of playtime, which is still too much for an $80 game, but it's a significant improvement from what some players have reported. I have a 12th gen Intel i7 with 16 GB RAM and a 3060Ti, and the game ran beautifully. The main disappointment was that I couldn't use ray tracing because it resulted in a loss of around 20-40 fps (averaging around 75 fps normally). Nevertheless, the game still looked impressive.

2. It is a substantial improvement over the previous game, Jedi Fallen Order.
There are more customization options for Cal, adding a unique touch to your experience. The combat system  options are more in-depth, providing a richer gameplay experience. The story isn't merely a repetition of the last game but set in the future; it holds plenty of surprises and challenging bosses (depending on your difficulty settings), making it feel like a fresh experience.

3. It is definitely a game you should consider buying if you've been waiting for the issues to be resolved. I purchased the game during the 50% off sale, but I would have been willing to pay more than $40 for it. If you're interested and it's on sale, it's definitely worth considering the purchase.",1704388892,1704388892,True,1,0,0.504739344120025635,0,True,False,False

With low graphics I can get 60 fps in closed zones, but the main hub of the game has run as low as 22 fps. It's really, really horribly done, I have no idea what went wrong but it's really awful.

That said, the game is amazing. Everything a sequel should be. Builds on everything done by Fallen Order and takes it to another level, both gameplay and narratively wise. To me no other SW games can compare to this one (no, not even KOTOR), and it's on pair with the best films. It's not perfect, parts of the story fall definitely flat. But the good is truly good.

First of all I get a crash every 25-30 mins - since the game uses checkpoint save games I lose progress and gets me annoyed for repeating the sector..
Second - performance is sluggish , i get 20-30 fps drops out of nowhere with a 4090 and i9 CPU 32GB RAM..
And to continue the complaining - every time the game starts it needs to optimise.. takes 40 seconds for me.. 
Graphics is ok-ish but there are a lot of graphical small errors and bugs. 
Kestis moves like a skater-it slides on the terrain, running and sprinting is not really synchronised. Then he clips trough walls and objects. Ragdoll physics is kinda off. 
Lightsaber does not leave marks on every surface like in the old Jedi Knight 2 games but the combat is enjoyable with nice combos and finishing moves. 
I'm really trying this game for the sake of the story cause I'm curious what's going on.

Lag and freezing: This game is so poorly optimised for PC's that AFTER running optimisation at loadup, and with graphics settings on medium it will still lag both in game play and with cut scenes. I will mention that I'm running a GTX 4070, intel core 17 2.9ghz, and 16GB ram. This is enough to run Cyberpunk 2077 on max graphics with ray tracing and it runs perfectly fine.

Then there is the issues with mapping the controller. Jedi Fallen Order everything worked fine. In Survivor you can't map the same button despite them being in a different function area if you want them different from default. For example you can't set under Basic ascension cable to RB, then under Force set slow to RB. It will say that one or the other is unbound. So I have to use my keyboard for less common actions/controls.

TL;DR Is the game playable with all the lag issues? Yes, but it can be frustrating and takes away from the experience of what is otherwise a great game. Don't buy full price, heck in hindsight I wouldn't even buy half price. Maybe 75%+ off until they fix the issues... if they ever do.

I haven't been able to complete the first level yet, though I have made it to more than one save point thankfully. My first time playing the game, I did not make it to a save point before the game crashed, randomly. It was playing well and smoothly, but just crashed and I have no idea why. Several other tries at playing have slowly progressed me a little bit farther on this first level of the game, but always there is a crash. My PC has well over the recommended specs enough to play this game on max settings easily.

I was really looking forward to playing the game. I even waited to buy it much later after it's original launch due to all the bugs I was reading that it was having. I thought for sure they would have hammered all those bugs out by now but it looks like they have not. A damn shame. Game looks great, but can't play it for very long due to the crashes.

----
Edit/Addition
---

The issues seemed to be with RTX entirely. Once I turned off RTX I no longer experienced any crashes. Shame because the game should work with RTX on with my 4070TI, but it doesn't. That aside, the game is beautiful even without RTX. I have greatly been enjoying my time playing it. The customization options have been greatly expanded upon from Fallen Order and it's awesome not being limited to just different color ponchos.

It is still a few graphics stability updates away from being a masterpiece, but once they fix the stuttering you will see the recent reviews flip over to overwhelmingly positive. 8/10 now, 11/10 once it is patched properly. 

Bugs aside the game is really very good. Much more customisation than the previous game, large beautiful maps, and a very good story. It is still a little shaky performance wise, and in my opinion it is version 1.0 quality in current state; if it truly was worse than this at launch, then it is not excusable for EA to release the game when they did. 

In the parts of the game that ran smoothly it was a very good gaming experience; in the not so smooth parts it was super frustrating because it ruins the immersion of a very immersive game. 

If you have a 40 series GPU and enable DLSS frame generation you can play above 100 fps with minor stuttering in the most open areas. I found turning the graphics down from Epic actually lowered the frame rate, so I played everything maxed out. I experienced 3 or 4 random crashes in 40 hours of play, but minor and never game breaking, just annoying as the game takes a few mins to load into. 

Definitely grab it on sale, it will be worth full price once they finish fixing the graphical issues.

Don't get me wrong, the story is great, combat is good, but it's hard to see them through the absolutely abysmal performance at times. Add in the fact that it uses the EA App and doesn't support Steam cloud saves (only cloud saves via the EA App which is far buggier and inconsistent) and the game leaves a slightly negative taste in the mouth.

If the game's frame rate only dipped when a lot was going happening on-screen, it would be understandable, but instead the frame rate constantly dips anytime you're out in the open. Thankfully combat is rarely effected somehow. In addition, this game tries to get away with ""hidden"" loading areas, which are painfully obvious as you are often left standing around for far too long as your frame rate absolutely tanks for a prolonged period of time. If this game looked amazing, I would give it a bit more leeway, but it ultimately doesn't look that much better then Fallen Order and I've played several games that look better while also performing better.

A smaller nit-pick I have is with the difficulties. The default setting (Jedi Knight) is overly easy, at least for Souls-like veterans, and the hardest (Jedi Grand Master) is too punishing. I played through about 3/4 of the game on Grand Master, only to go down to Jedi Master due to the fact you had to nearly play perfectly. Enemies take too little damage, your parries have a VERY narrow window, nearly every boss could two-hit you (even with upgraded health), and boss combos WILL kill you as you often can't escape once caught in one. I highly recommend Jedi Master difficultly as it gives a decent challenge (though still a bit too easy in my opinion) without being overly punishing.",1704295499,1704295499,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

**EDIT**

Well... Here we are, so many months later. The game is now safely considered playable. However, I upgraded my rig from release until now. My rig benchmarks on 3DMark in the 93%-98% range on the toughest tests compared to all other users, so it runs pretty much flawlessly on that. However, on my laptop which is weaker, there are still some pretty noticeable frame drops. Turning off raytracing helps, although I should not have to on a 4070.

As to why I changed my review? Well, the game itself, if you can look past stability, is absolutely worth playing. The leap from Fallen Order to Survivor in features, mechanics, story, exploration, really just everything across the board is something I've never experienced in a sequel. It is honestly a fantastic, fun, addictive game with a moving story and epic experiences. If you CAN push past performance issues, do it. It is worth it. A shame so many have not experienced it.

The DLSS and frame gen update were game changers.  With DLSS on, the game doesn't look like a blurry mess from a terrible TAA implementation, and frame gen pretty much double your frame rate.  The frame gen does leave something to be desired, there is sometimes tearing and pop in when you're moving the camera rapidly in certain environments, but for the most part I was able to ignore it for the huge bump in smoothness.  I am playing at 4K 120 FPS with DLSS quality, max settings including ray tracing, and frame gen on.  I did encounter a bit of stutter early on, but I don't know how it went away, whether it was a game update or if I just got past the area with the stutter, but my game isn't stuttering anymore at all.
The game play is great, the open world aspect tacks on a lot more play time.  I kinda wish it was a longer game, I probably spent half my time doing open world exploring and collecting. The unfortunate part is almost all of the collecting is related to cosmetics, so it's kinda pointless if you don't care about that.

My issue is while everything looks better and is flashier, the terrible context combat was not improved at all. The number of times you'll hit block, or attack or HEAL and just nothing happens, simply no response. The ""window"" of timing for attacks is trash, the window is whatever screws you over, that's basically the rule. So many enemies require you to make a no hit engagement its just silly, and some enemies literally kill you in one hit. Ultimately this is just the previous game on steroids and I mean that for both the good and bad aspects of the game. What was good is better and what was bad is worse. Regrettably this game also suffers from the modern plague of huge play area with light content. In an effort to make you put more hours into the game they made the open world aspects annoyingly open world. They added some decent navigational tools to help cut down the dreg of it, but you will still find yourself walking for long periods. 

The frustrating thing is, a decent star wars story exists in here. But it is mired by unresponsive controls and p**s poor QTE combat events. It has some really good moments in it and Cal's executions are spectacular this time. But, the number of times I've pressed block and instead of parrying or blocking as I should instead Cal just stands there and takes the hit to then 'snap' into the block animation after damage is purely infuriating.

Combat, however, if you've played Elden Ring or any of FromSofts game's, can be quite annoying and difficult out of nowhere.

I would say if you're interested in this game that you do not purchase it for retail value and look into downloading MSI Afterburner + RTSS Tuner to cap your in-game FPS via this software. I found capping my frames at 80fps via RTSS gave me MUCH better overall consistent performance. Capping via RTSS increases your frame timing for a smoother experience which you will want.

The game itself is gorgeous, with environments that make you want to revisit them. This is good, because you'll be backtracking a lot!

Gameplay is decent, some of the puzzles are testy with your timing or reflexes if everything isn't just absolutely perfectly placed/timed. The open worlds are nice, though two are a bit of a pain in the arse to traverse across.
Graphics are average, with a lot of visual bugs (half the Jawa I encounter, the robes are backwards, so the arms clip through and just float), with some lighting bugs sprinkled in for distraction.
The story is.. Well, it's better than anything that came out after Rogue One, but very predictable. Like, 'classic cliche' predictable.
Classic Star Wars sound design, on par with Fallen Order; so nothing bad, but nothing new.

-Story was super strong - each character felt developed and nuanced, and the narrative propelled character growth. There were some legitimately shocking plot twists, and the gameplay felt integrated into the narrative pacing without disrupting the flow. Made me very excited for the sequel that (I assume) they're working on, as they set up each character for some very interesting development.
-The music is phenomenal. Seriously, Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab deserve as many awards as possible for their work on the music. They understand the spirit of Star Wars (and John Williams), and are able to musically distill it without plagiarizing or using the classic themes as a crutch. 10/10
-Loved the added gameplay mechanics. Having additional lightsaber stances kept combat fresh and interesting throughout the game. The perk slots were fun too, my only gripe is that it's incredibly difficult to get more than a couple slots until you finish the main narrative. I was glad that they didn't reset your skills to zero at the beginning of the game, but incorporated new skills (i.e. grapple, Crystal maker, etc.) during the story.

Now for the caveats:
-This game's graphics had major trouble running on PC for me. Thankfully the issues were limited to certain areas in the game (the overworld on Koboh and the Observatory with Koboh matter), but the amount of time spent in these areas at the beginning of the game almost turned me off. The thing I struggle with (from a developer's standpoint) is that most of these issues were due to running too many assets simultaneously - in porting it over to PC, it would have been nice to have simplified graphics in just those 2 areas to make the gameplay smoother.
That being said, my roommate played through the game on Xbox, and had no issues with graphics or lag. If you have a console with this available on it, play it there rather than on PC. I also never had the game crash while playing, despite the lagging and glitches, so props to the dev team for ironing those out by the time I played.
-Very small issue, but finding the Force Tears was a pain. I wish there had been a map upgrade to show those locations on the mini-map.
-Also found the bounty hunter missions tedious because they all took place in postgame. Would have loved to have them integrated into the story a little better.

Overall, I'm giving this an 8/10, but if the graphics/lag aren't an issue then a 9.5/10. Highly recommend if you have the right equipment to play it.",1704155281,1704155281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will gladly change my review once this is cleared up, because with this issue out of the way? So far the game is an easy 10/10.

Edit: The small optimization patch(es) that's been released have greatly increased performance for me. At this rate, I feel choppy and unresponsive gameplay will from now on, be mostly on my end as I am playing with a 1070. 

Regardless. From a gameplay perspective, this game is a massive improvement over the first which was still a stellar game. After my 4 or so playthroughs of the first game, I modded my game with what essentially became vanilla mechanics or luxuries in this sequel. The customization of all things is impressive, and even trumps other games that supposedly allow you to make your own character, despite the fact you're playing an established protagonist in this one.

I have not finished the story yet, but I am engaged and interested thus far. Shortcomings of the overarching narrative in my opinion is negated by the character stories and relationships. Just seeing what Cal has been doing and his journey with those he met in the first game is more than enough for me, personally.

When combat actually works for me (and isnt hindered by frame lag or slow input), it's fun. My favorite combination is the single blade and blaster stances. The latter is especially a blast (ha) in many circumstances.

Honestly, I say buy it. The performance is still terrible, but worth fighting through just to experience this gem.

Edit edit: Performance seems to be worse, somehow. Quite literally unplayable on Koboh which is a significant portion of the game.  Developers had the audacity to ask us to nominate this game for awards. A bit tone deaf, don't you think, Respawn?

Yes this game is stellar. The combat is fun (save for a few encounters/enemy types like the DT droid), the customization is excellent, and the story was very well done, not to mention the journey of the characters was well explored.

But what does any of this matter if it can't be played? Respawn needs to figure out what's going on.",1682729684,1704151812,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But one criticism (more personal preference) is that I absolutely hate when there are so many optional side areas that i can't access and you have to return later when you have a new ability. ESPECIALLY when the game doesn't tell you that you can't do it yet. 

I'm not opposed to there being areas that I can revisit later on for optional content, but this game has a LOT of it.

For example, there was a jump that you cant quite make when you first encounter it, you're close but its just a little off. I looked for a box to move, somewhere slightly higher to jump from, using abilities mid-air to get a tiny amount of extra airtime etc. but nothing worked.

Update: I decided to give the game another shot and I restarted (since it was my only option thanks to a bug with the Forest Array / Rehab Wing.) Here's my thoughts after completing the game.

From the very start of the game you'll likely get annoyed with the repeating requirement to run setup on the game and agree to a EULA every single time you start the game or go to the main menu. For PC, this seems to be due to certain files for game settings being marked as read-only. Why this hasn't been fixed after all this time is beyond comprehension.

I did encounter a stuttering performance issue using the holo map, intermittent at least. Evidently, this has been a known issue for a very long time.

The main issue I see with this game is that the save game system is too basic, mainly a UI limitation from what I can tell, e.g. you'll have to start the game over again from the beginning if your save is bugged because you can only have 1 save file per ""journey."" To me, that's infuriating.

Overall, the game was enjoyable so long as you don't run into bugs that block progression. I'm leaving this as not recommended because blocker-level bugs still exist in this game 6 to 8 months later.

This game has so much potential but it has utterly frustrated the hell out of me with it's ability to not perform on my system.  I'm running a 7950x and a 4090 with 32 Gigs of Ram and this stutters all over the place.  I have ran it without ray tracing, on low settings, at 1080p and nothing makes this game run.  Everytime I get excited about a patch making this game run, it still runs like utter trash.  Do not purchase this game.  Play it on console.  The devs do not seem dedicated to making this run on any pc config.  I'm incredibly disappointed.

EDIT:  If you install this mod it does make this game playable. 
 Now I'm finally enjoying the game almost a year later.

I really hate to leave a “not recommended” review of this game, but I feel I have no choice. I started playing months after release and heard all about the bugs and patches. Not my first time encountering a game with these issues, but you’d think they’d fix it eventually, right? 
Not the case as of now. I played on Jedi Grandmaster difficulty level and I’d say the constant frame rate drops were like an added difficulty setting at times. Sounds funny when I say it, but it was actually annoying to play through. There was another point where, when I entered a certain area, my screen started flickering like strobe lights. Now, I know my graphics card isn’t the best out there, but this was just ridiculous and that part of the game was literally nauseous to play through. It’s a long game with a lot of content and all these technical issues made an experience that would’ve been fun feel like a chore to play through. 
Which brings me to my next point…frame rates I can sort of forgive, but after spending two hours beating a tough boss and being sure to save my progress afterward, my save got corrupted…that’s two hours of my time wasted. At this point, I was pissed and if it wasn’t enough that I had to redo the whole fight, it happened AGAIN later in the game. Absolutely the most frustrating thing I’ve experienced in a game and, as you can imagine, this issue by itself left a horrendous taste in my mouth and more than warrants a bad rating in my opinion. 
To mention the positives though…the storyline was fantastic, I loved it even more than I loved the previous game's story, which is high praise. I loved playing through the quests and exploring. However, the technical issues ruined the whole experience for me. Like, I’m so disappointed that a game with such potential has been subjected to this poor optimization.

Performance/Optimization, not great not terrible mostly perfectly playable for me. Granted I have a 3090 but I was running it at 4k max settings(balanced DLSS). It is a very good looking game and I'd say I averaged 70fps. This does drop to 40 in a couple of areas but not enough to ruin the experience with one exception, the rift battles, the hardest fights in the game would stutter terribly which caused me to die multiple times. Even reducing the graphics settings didn't cure this. Very annoying that the hardest parts of the game have awful stuttering. For me it was relatively stable. I did have a section of the game where it kept crashing however a bit of researched pointed me to look at my VRAM I noticed my C Drive only had 5gb of free space freeing up some more space cured this issue, the game uses a lot of VRAM. Other than those crashes which I feel more somewhat my fault, I think I had 5-10 crashes in my play time which considering the hours I have put into the game isn't terrible. These were a mix of CTD and just freezing requiring to kill it in task man. While not great I think this is perfectly playable as is 

Gameplay, more of the same from the previous game no complaints from me I loved the first this was an excellent sequel. I liked the different styles of fighting and the Souls like gameplay with adjustable difficulty, Jedi Knight was a decent difficulty for me still died a lot and was a decent challenge I'd say I averaged 5-10 attempts per boss. I like that they have different tiers of enemies and throw different combos of them at you. It keeps it fresh and can catch you out when a group catches you off guard.

Story/characters, (minor possible spoilers) near perfection, I can't speak highly enough of the characters and writing in this game. While I saw the twist coming instantly, the further into the game I got I started to doubt myself. I'm assuming that was the intention which was really interesting in how it toys with you. I like the characters in the saloon and learning about their lives. (Although it upsets me none of their butts touch the seats, you can't unsee that now). I loved the emotion of the story boss fights one of them towards the end of the game is AMAZING. Really looking forward to more from Cal and BD -1 who is now my favourite SW Droid (just beats HK47 & R2)

I liked the ending I feel it is the ESB style 'downer' ending and sets up a third game perfectly. I'm really looking forward to another game I'll likely do the sameas I did with this one and wait till it is 50% off because by that time it should be in a playable state.

I soft 100%ed it, got all collectables and did everything in game but only on normal and didn't get all achievements. This took about 90 hours I think. All in very pleased excellent sequel. I just wished it was released in this state.",1704079379,1704079379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing that bothered me was the defense because if you are still in an animation you cant block or dodge/evade and that annoyed me personally. But that might just be my personal preference.
Besides this i can recommend this game to everyone. I truly believe that even if you don't like Star-Wars you might like this game.

[h3]Hru jsem odehrál na sestavě RTX 4070, Ryzen 5 7600x, DDR5 32GB 5600Mz.[/h3]

[h2]Příběh[/h2]

Příběh je jednou z hlavních sil hry. Děj se odehrává pět let po událostech prvního dílu, kdy Cal Kestis už není ten vystrašený padawan, co se snaží přežít, ale stal se z něj Jedi, který na vlastní pěst bojuje proti Imperiu. Cesta vás zavede na několik lokací, jako je Coruscant, Koboh, Jedha, atd... Příběh se točí okolo nalezení útočiště a vybudování všech možných zdrojů na boj s Impériem. Toto místo by mohlo být Tanalorr. Tanalorr byla mírumilovná a na Sílu citlivá planeta na hranici vnějšího okraje, která se nacházela v mlhovině Koboh Abyss. Byla objevena v éře ""High Republic"" mistrem Jedi Daganem Gerou. Ten byl zrazen Jedii, a on je naším hlavním záporákem. Dagan Gera je bezpochyby mnohem lepší záporák a postava celkově, než jsme si mohli vybrat ze záporáků minulého dílu. Příběh je epický, plný zvratů a emocí a dle mého názoru i lepší než v předešlém díle.

[h2]Postavy[/h2]

Na své cestě se setkáte s dobře známými postavami, jak z prvního dílu, tak ale i v herní historii novými postavami, které jsou ve světě Star Wars velmi dobře známé. V neposlední řadě tento díl představuje tucet úplně nových postav. Řekl bych, že naprosto drtivá většina důležitějších postav je napsána skvěle. Mají osobnost, hloubku a většina jsou jedinečné.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

Gameplay se od prvního dílu vlastně moc neliší. Znovu tu máme Souls-like soubojový systém a Souls-like mechaniky. Nikdy jsem nemusel Souls hry, ale tady mi to absolutně nevadí, naopak mě tato hra přesvědčila o tom si nějakou Souls hru znovu zkusit zahrát. Díky těmto mechanikám je soubojový systém velice odměňující, ale každá chyba je drsně trestána. Není žádná anomálie, když na jednoho bosse budeme mít klidně i přes 10 pokusů. Každý boss má svou mechaniku, kterou se musíte naučit, abyste byli schopní ho porazit. Bezmyšlenkovité máchání mečem nebude stačit ani na skupinu normálních trooperů. Všechny schopnosti, které se již Cal naučil v prvním díle, vám samozřejmě zůstávají, a postupem v příběhu si odemykáte spoustu nových schopností. Asi největší změna v hratelnosti je prozkoumávání světa a postojů světelných mečů.
[h2]Svět[/h2]
První díl byl spíše lineární, pouze s krátkými odbočkami, to tady neplatí. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor je open world, a jediné, co vám brání k jeho objevování, jsou schopnosti Cala. Díky tomu vás hra nutí k vracení se k již probádaným oblastem a najít jiné cesty, či jenom v ní pokračovat. Tyto cesty většinou vedou k truhlám nebo jiným sběratelským věcem, které můžete využít na schopnosti či kosmetické úpravy Cala.
[h2]Postoje[/h2]
V prvním díle nám byly představeny 2 postoje: Klasický s jedním mečem a druhý s oboustranným mečem. V druhém díle je postojů hned 5. 2 z předešlého dílu, ""Dual wield"" (dva meče), Obouručný a klasický s blastrem. Každý tento postoj má své výhody a nevýhody, a proto si musíte rozmyslet, který chcete používat, protože budete nuceni si vybrat pouze 2 postoje z 5. Samozřejmě existuje mod, který vám dovoluje používat všech 5 najednou, a vřele ho doporučuji.

[h2]Optimalizace a Grafika hry[/h2]

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor si za půl roku vysloužilo jméno jako jeden z nejhorších titulů, co se týče optimalizace. Jelikož hru jsem začal hrát až po půl roce, můžu s klidným srdcem říct, že toto již není problém. Občas sem tam nějaká chyba, nějaký bug, ale ani jednou jsem kvůli tomu nemusel restartovat hru. Vizuál hry je dechberoucí. Grafika, osvětlení, atmosféra prostě všechno přes vizuál a audio je skvost, prostě 10/10. Hra mi na nejvyšší možné nastavení s raytracingem, DLSS na quality a Frame generation běžela s 100 - 130 fps při 1920x1080.

[h2]Stojí to sakra za ty prachy? [/h2]
Vlastním Deluxe edici a zaplatil jsem za ni ve slevě okolo 60€. Jako obrovský fanoušek Star Wars byla tato hra nezapomenutelná. Nelituji ani jediného eura, které jsem utratil. Pro fanoušky Star Wars je série Star Wars Jedi zatím absolutní must-have. A pro lidi, kteří Star Wars tolik zase nefandí, to musím doporučit taky, jelikož je to prostě výborná hra s zajímavým příběhem, nádhernou grafikou, zábavným soubojovým systémem a rozumnou hrací dobou.

Updated December 2023:

TLDR: 
Good game, wacky performance, buy on sale, expect to file return if it runs poorly, great story.

You need a controller to enjoy this game. 

Long Form:
Game ""works"" - It's clear that there are some issues still, lag spikes from time to time even on my higher end PC. My recommendation buy the game on sale - set a timer so you don't play more than 2 hours (for refunds) test the performance on your PC. If you find the intro playable the rest of the game will likely run smooth enough in my experience. THE STORY is great and frankly leaves me eager to see what happens in the next game. No need to hate on the game for it's poor and I mean truly awful launch that falls to EA rushing it well before the PC port was ready. 

IMPORTANT: It hasn't happened to me but I would be wary of save files corrupting so definitely only quit the game through the menu's quit to desktop option (and pray that's enough to keep it from happening)


Specs: Game was on an SSD, 32 gigs of ram, xtx 7900 GPU, R7 3700x. 


OLD Takes from April Launch:

As all my friends know, I LOVE Star Wars. But I cannot play this game with the frame rates it basically locks you to with is lack of optimization. 

Sure I only have a 2070S, and a R7 3700x but I can play just about any other game on the market with my ultra-wide and enjoy a solid 60 frames at least. 

With this game I get 23-32 FPS maybe, even with settings tweaked and motion blur off because of the low frame rate the game just looks like a blur. Which is seriously disappointing, as I am sure the story is amazing. 

Until the game is fixed I won't even bother to launch it again...


Update May 5th, still doesn't work... :[

Update May 11th, somehow the intro runs worse than it did on launch... At this point they should pay me $70 dollars to keep this shit on my computer.

Update May 17th, ran ""great"" for 15 minutes (the intro until the first meditation point), climbed up a bit saw a bridge and went from 30 frames to 3 frames.

This game was an experience I thoroughly enjoyed, if you played the first game then I can tell you that they have improved in everything from it, new stances, new abilities, better combat, enemy voice lines between enemy soldiers are  great, especially the droids. 

The story is even better here however discussing any of it is would be spoilers so not gonna do that here.

The negatives side of this game really is only the performance, which can be a turn off if you don't like playing lower than 60 fps ( which only happens on 2 planets). The stuttering is also pretty bad but not to noticeable if your not looking for it. In terms of crashes I had 1. And for game breaking bugs there were 0.  And as for visual glitches there are countless. 

The exploration was alright with some puzzles being either impossible to figure out ( talking about the stable priorite shard) or baby brain easy. There are about 1 MASSIVE planet, 1 mid sized one, and about 4 small ones

Every time the game starts it has to ""optimize game files"". This can take anywhere from 2.5 to 5 minutes. It used to take 2:30 for me but now it's gone up to 5.

This wouldn't be a huge problem except for the fact that the game freezes constantly.

This happens randomly. But there's a boss on the planet Koboh that causes the game to freeze everytime I die and it's a tough boss so I die a lot.

Add to that all the performance issues, it's just not worth it.

Too bad, since the moment-to-moment gameplay is quite enjoyable. I don't understand why a game by such a huge publisher is such trash but I'm asking for a refund.

=== Edit after 17 more hours played ===

Steam denied my refund due to time played. That's understandable but still stings a bit. I was determined to play more and found out that there is a way to disable the optimizing file step so startup WAS under a minute. I say was because now the game refuses to startup at all.

This is ridiculous.

=== Edit after 61 hours total playtime ===

Clearing EA apps cache managed to get the game running...

But ya know, every time I feel like I'm actually doing alright with this game it come out and kicks me in the nards.

I was on my way to do a story mission when the game crashed like it does sometimes. But this time the game crashed whenever I loaded my save game. So I've joined the ranks of people who have lost progress to corrupted saves.

Luckily for me, I have a backup from only a few days ago but that's still such an unneeded headache on top of everything.

Srsly. DONT BUY THIS GAME.

I was really hopeful I would be able to complete this game. But, alas, I cannot access the final mission.

The game crashes during the cutscene to reach the final mission. This has happened before. Some cutscenes just crash the game. I've gotten around this problem by skipping the cutscene then just watching it on Youtube. But for this one, it crashes so quickly skipping it is impossible.

This is very much the rotten cherry on top of the trash pile that is this game.",1701300884,1704053795,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay itself is once again excellent, the story serves its purpose and always throws in a surprise when you think it's becoming predictable, and the new Stances and enemy types nicely evolve the Fallen Order Formula. But, like with most AAA games nowadays, it dies a death of a thousand cuts due to bugs and questionable decisions. A quick list of what I noticed, in no particular order:

-Achievements are completely broken, both on Steam and in the EA App.
-While performance is far more stable than the average internet troll and NikTek subscriber is making it out to be, there are still some major drops in transitions and (strangely) the galaxy map.
-The game lacks DLSS support. There's only AMD FSR, and turning that off turns the game into a blurry mess for reasons unkown to me.
-Preorder bonuses are completely missing. I contacted support about this, but I guess releasing a game on a friday causes issues in that regard.
-There is no option to hold sprint. Only toggle is available. Even Fallen Order had that option.
-Certain cloaked enemies will have their cloth physics bug out BADLY, covering the entire screen in cloth and making them an absolute pain to fight.
-The open world sections are empty, boring and pointless. Luckily most of the main story still takes place in linear ares, like Fallen Order.
-On MNK, sensitivity is greatly reduced in non-combat zones, requiring multiple full mousepads to even turn a 90° corner.
-Some of the menu options, particularly the customization section, are often unresponsive, requiring the player to completey back out of the menu to reset it.

And that's not even all of them. I guess it's just the usual, EA publishing a Full-Price Beta Test, so no surprises there. Which is a shame, because the game itself is easily GOTY material.

UPDATE, half a year later:
-Performance seems to have improved, FSR can be turned off now (lol), DLSS is now supported and functioning properly as far as I can tell
-Menus are still VERY broken on occasion
-Preorder Bonus Detection is fixed! All items are added retroactively, even on existing save files
-Cloth physics seem to be fixed
-Sprint Hold is still missing. Reckon you could make a macro to add it yourself, but it's still poor that this is necessary in a AAA game (again, the Prequel had the option!)
-Achievement detection still seems to be wonky, but it's harder to tell now that I have all the story achievements (all of them unlocked at once at some point)",1682706727,1704053413,False,3,1,0.524833381175994873,0,True,False,False

The production value and scope of the game left me feeling like they had earned my money, even if the game has a lot of issues, and a metric ton of missed opportunities. I think that last bit was what bothered me the most about this game, the fact that so much of it feels like it could have been unbelievably amazing if resources were allocated a bit better or if they redid parts of their gameplay loop. 

There are way too many puzzles and way too much climbing, many characters are written in a similar fashion so they blend together into one general archetype, whilst  it feels like there isn't enough location variety [spoiler]because the game is a fair bit less ""galaxy spanning"" than might be expected and you're mostly on one planet[/spoiler]. The story, though beginning and ending pretty strongly, struggles a fair amount during the middle of the game. [spoiler]The villains are pretty weak[/spoiler], a lot of the voice acting is somewhat monotone, combat begins to feel somewhat boring when you figure it out, many (red) unblockable attacks feel unfair to play against, some new enemy types are not fun to fight, the collectables felt generally uninteresting and I could go on. Yet despite all this, I still think the game is very worth your time on sale. 

You should know some of the game's flaws and play around them, maybe stick to the main quest if you find yourself getting bored, and try to set your expectations accordingly. Still, I feel that this game deserves to be financially successful and I feel that it is worth your time. So if you like Star Wars, the previous entry, or souls-likes then please give it a shot. 

The review is over but if you were curious why I would leave a negative review then feel free to read on, because I do feel like this'll prep you for the game. 
So my perceptions were pretty mixed by the mid-point of the game so I decided on a fun way to settle my internal debate on what rating to leave.

I set two timers when I landed on the next planet I went to in my playthrough, one on my desktop to track my overall time and another on my phone to track the amount of time I spent climbing up surfaces or solving puzzles. Every time I wasn't climbing or puzzle solving I would pause the timer on my phone. When I did the math when I left the planet; I was looking at a hot (and extremely generous) 43.4% (repeating of course) time spent just doing those two activities alone. That doesn't sound like a lot but it really is. If you're used to Uncharted then this probably isn't the worst, but man, I was getting to set pieces and instead of going ""Yipee, this looks so cool,"" I was going ""Oh my God, this is going to take so much dang climbing and puzzle solving AGHHHH.""

Probably worth getting though, it is a pretty cool game overall.",1703646124,1704039876,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

[h2]The EA garbage[/h2]
The game opens with a nice little message of a Privacy Policy and a [b]Cookie Policy[/b] that you must accept in order to play. Yes, in a [b]FULL PRICED[/b] video game you have to accept a privacy [b]AND A COOKIE POLICY[/b] in order to play. What the the actual hell?

But that's not all! There is telemetry in the game, that is enabled by default! Yay! Thankfully you can disable it in the settings, but who knows if that option even does anything.

Not only you no longer own your games, they are also becoming spyware, even the singleplayer ones! Screw EA.

[h2]The performance & graphics[/h2]
Yeah, the ""rumors"" are true. The performance leaves a lot to be desired. The main issue are micro-stuttering issues omnipresent throughout the entire game. From the first second you launch the game, even the intro movies lag like you are playing on a 20 year old PC. It's shocking.

I played on a 5900x/4070ti/1440p/SSD and on max settings no RTX the frameframe is very inconsistent. Some areas can run at 100 FPS no problem. Some areas run at 30 or less with insane stuttering. Most notably the main output area which you will be visiting a lot.

Pretty much all cutscenes have a hitch on transitions which makes you unable to see the first second or so of each cutscene.

Not only the performance is bad, the graphics are not that amazing either. Sure, they are good, but not that good for how badly it runs.

Lowest settings appear to have no effect on graphics, or the performance, compared to the maximum settings.

I'd also like to point out that there's absolutely no way to disable anti-aliasing (TAA), not even though config file editing. This results in a [b]very blurry[/b] and smeary game 95% of the time, which further ruins the atmosphere.

Other classic graphical bugs are present here as well, most often lighting bugs - certain areas being pitch black for no apparent reason. Other issues include volumetric fog ""floating"" above ground (on Jedha), effects flickering (Moon), etc.

[h2]What I liked and other issues[/h2]
The story is kinda middling, but still manages an emotional conclusion.

There are quite a few memorable things from all of Star Wars here. The hilarious B1 Battle Droids and others from the Clone Wars, some enemies are pulled from newer media such as the purge and dark troopers, etc.

There are a lot of collectibles. Most of them are either lore, cosmetics or currencies to unlock cosmetics and perks, etc, none of that ""collect for the sake of collecting"" collectibles.

The game does well to sell you the ""being a Jedi"" fantasy. When you get to dispatch multiple easier enemies with the many tools provided, you really do feel [strike]like batman[/strike] cool and powerful when it happens just like in the movies, and this doesn't happen too often which maintains the novelty of it.

Combat is not without its issues in my opinion, there are few frustrating things like a certain boss having an instant kill move that is difficult to avoid because he lunges across the entire arena, issues like getting stun-locked by multiple enemies or even 1 stronger enemy with multiple or long attacks, being hit mid air by melee attacks, etc. No animation canceling for dodge/evade makes me wonder how you are meant to deal with bosses without getting hit.

Sadly no starship battles, but I guess if you want that, there are other games for it. Still, there are a couple fights like that which you only get to look at, and not participate in.

Lastly, a nitpick, but inability to switch between all lightsaber stances really dampens the cool factor. You get only 2 at a time, and sometimes you just want to try a different one from the ones you already have equipped.

Other issues:
[list]
[*]Mouse controls in menus are atrocious in places, most notably the settings menu is UNUSABLE with the mouse.
[*]Weird controls for Keyboard, Tab is evade for example. BD-1 mechanics have unchangeable slow aiming, and the chosen key binds are annoying. Really the game has so many different keys to press I got confused many times and had to stop and conscientiously think about what key to press next. The game does warn you that its best played on a controller to be fair, but still. Thankfully you can rebind them. 
[*] Photo mode forces on depth of field that cannot be turned off. You can mitigate it a bit, but can't turn it off completely. It also does not automatically hide UI when taking pictures through the in-game method.

I purchased this game on sale for $35 thinking it might just be worth it, and besides an overheated computer and often frame drops it ran in an acceptable manner.

The game's characters are unfriendly to the main protagonist and most interactions are full of snarky remarks and poor writing. The game has a consistent theme of new characters being introduced with a wait time of 2 seconds to 20 hours until they betray you with unclear reasons and poor logic.

1. HAVE A GREAT PC SETUP - I have a 2016 setup (all components except for a 2022 AMD graphics card) and I was unable to run this game past potato graphics. This game requires the most updated or latest hardware to run. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS TYPE OF SETUP ON YOUR PC I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT PURCHASING THIS GAME. The performance issues are true for PC players. This game will melt your system in a heartbeat. 

2. THIS GAME WILL CRASH RANDOMLY - I couldn't even boot this game up without crashing. I updated my graphics card drivers which helped but it still did not fix the issue. I still had random crashes or frame rate drops all through out the FIRST 30 MINS IN THE GAME. Even though my system is older, I still had past the recommended system requirements but it didn't matter. 

3. THIS IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN 20$ - I bought this on discount for around 35$ and its till not worth it. The game looks like KOTOR back in 2003. Which is a much better game in my opinion. Unless EA will fix these issues on PC do not buy this game.

4. I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS GAME A SHOT - I played the first game on PS4 and it was an amazing game. From most of the reviews I've seen, this game is even better than the first. I wish I could experience it. EA needs to patch the PC plug in for this game ASAP but if y'all know EA, this will never happen.

I was running this game on an i5-12400f and a GTX 1060, which is below even the minimum spec for the GPU; and so I installed a performance mod from Nexusmods as a precaution before installing the game. Game bugged out on me 2 times, a story bug and a game black screen, which were fixed after a simple restart. 

And now that I've completed the game with an almost 100% exploration, I would say that 95% of the time the game was running surprisingly smoothly. It was smooth sailing at around 60fps and only dipped towards areas where the effect particles were excessive (first world, purple-ish particles area)

- As for story, I'd give it an 8.5/10, and it's expected to have another sequel, likely being a trilogy to finish off Cal's journey.
- Combat has more variety now with new stances, moves, stronger force abilities and perks (like Hollow Knight's charm system). The Grandmaster difficulty in this game is significantly harder over Fallen Order's. It is also a little more jank in its physics and hitbox.
The one thing I really appreciated was that previous moves and exploration abilities from Fallen Order was brought over from the very start, so it is a faster paced game than Fallen Order.
- The worlds in the game was just satisfactory, with 2 of them being large ones (Koboh > Jedha) and the rest being smaller ones. 
- Customisation for both Cal and BD-1 cosmetics has improved, with a variety of clothing, lightsaber parts, BD-1 parts and blaster parts. Unfortunately the Mantis cannot be customised (recoloured) like the previous game.
- New Game+ only offers new perks and a new lightsaber colour. No Meditation training which is a huge shame.

Conclusion, this game is a must-play for those who liked Fallen Order and it is a deserving sequel of a great game. While everyone's experience with its performance is different, I highly recommend you to try the game out yourself when it goes on sale.
Granted, you'd have to rush through the first area (Coruscant) to Koboh to really test out your performance before you go over the 2 hour refund period.",1703964103,1703964103,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Narrative-wise the game is so far about the same level as the last, but I feel the actors have stepped it up a notch. The devs however have taken the Fallen Order formula, and really elevated the experience. While the last game had the souls-like/metroidvania exploration....the devs added more open exploration in the planets I've visited so far. Great for when I don't feel like progressing the story and grinding out for some skill points for more ability variety. All in all, the game has expanded on the solid foundational systems of the last game, keeping the experience fresh and familiar. Last game I beat it on normal and then did a Grand Master run, this play-through we are just going in for the Grand Master. I feel that this time around Grand Master is actually harder than the last game, and feels a bit more like Sekiro difficulty. Not quite as brutal, but you're gonna die a lot from normal enemies. Would highly suggest it for those looking to make it a difficult experience/more of a ""realistic"" Jedi role-playing experience. PS - even more customization, and more zany side characters too!

However, the game's potential is hindered by notable optimization issues, even for users (like me) equipped with powerful GPUs such as the RTX 3070. 

The shining star of Jedi Survivor undoubtedly lies in its captivating storyline. The game successfully captures the essence of the Star Wars saga, delivering a compelling narrative that holds players spellbound from beginning to end. Rich character development, an intricate plot, and exploration of the Force contribute to the game's depth and authenticity.

Regrettably, Jedi Survivor falters in the realm of performance optimization, falling short even for players wielding top-tier hardware like the RTX 3070. Despite configuring settings to the highest level, the frame rate struggles to maintain a consistent 60 fps, creating a noticeable hurdle for those seeking a seamless and engrossing gaming experience. The lack of optimization may prove frustrating for players who anticipate flawless performance on cutting-edge GPUs.

Visually, the game excels with its meticulously crafted environments and character models, breathing life into the Star Wars universe with stunning graphics and meticulous attention to detail. However, the visual splendor is marred by performance issues, preventing players from fully basking in the beauty of the galaxy far, far away.

Despite its optimization challenges, Star Wars Jedi Survivor manages to redeem itself through its compelling narrative and faithful representation of the Star Wars universe. The game excels in delivering a story-driven experience that allows players to feel like genuine Jedi navigating the trials of survival. With focused efforts on performance optimization, Jedi Survivor could easily ascend to greater heights in the gaming landscape.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a must-play for die-hard fans of the franchise seeking an immersive and enthralling narrative. Nevertheless, the notable optimization issues, even for high-end hardware like the RTX 3070, hinder the game from achieving its full potential.

Edit: So I've finished the game. It can be a bit rocky every now and then, but I found that what was killing it the most for me was using ray tracing. So definitely turn that off, and it should run (mostly smoothly).

Now that I've finished it, I can now say that the story was really well made, and I'm interested to see where this is going in the future. However, I think I prefer the storytelling of Fallen Order a little bit more, as it tells a story in a much smaller scope, with (in my opinion) better antagonists.

It's set years after the events of the first game with Cal struggling to fight against the Empire. A series of events leads Cal on the path to finding a safe place from the Empire and perhaps a chance to walk away from the constant fighting. 

Cal has matured from the previous game not only physically but also his control of the Force, though he still struggles with it. The story presents the dangers of obsession and the allure of the Dark Side. Both of which are explored not only by Cal but by the two excellent antagonists serving as foils for the main character. 

Gameplay wise, it is an improvement over the first game. The combat is more intense with increased difficulty along with more combat options. The game introduces new stance mechanic that fundamentally changes the way Cal fights. All stances are viable though some are easier to use than others - I'm looking at you Cross Guard. There is also great improvements of the map as it is far less confusing than the previous game. 

As for performance. I played the game almost a year after release and it was an excellent decision. The bugs and performance issues reported from launch was nowhere to be seen. Even with my low/mid tier gaming rig I was able to maintain 80 fps average on high settings. Though there is an issue though, the game has to compile files every time you start up the game. This was longest the first time you play and gets significantly shorter for every subsequent start up. Still though, I thought most games would only need to compile files once. 

Overall, I found Jedi: Survivors to be an excellent game and sequel. The story, characters, music and game play are all excellent and I would highly recommend this game.

More stances, four in fact, give you a huge variety in the way you play the game. The game world is huge, and you can spend tons of time exploring it.

Built on UE4, the game performance isn't the best for what they are trying to do here. This game simply has outgrown the abilities of UE4. While there is stuttering in one particular area, the largest planet in the game, for the most part, performance is excellent. I have a 4090 and run it at 120 FPS in 4K all settings maxed, EXCEPT ray tracing is DISABLED.

I think the best way to play is with Ray Tracing disabled, yes, it makes the game look better in some areas, but it also gives the models a glowing effect that frankly looks terrible. However, the main reason to disable Ray Tracing is that it just tanks performance and also leads to crashes. The same thing was seen in another UE4 title, Hogwart's Legacy, where Ray Tracing just killed performance.

So, wait for UE5 games (like the excellent new Robocop game) to experience Ray Tracing. But for this game, leave it disabled. The graphics still look excellent with it disabled.",1703912695,1703912695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A couple areas with lots going on, lots of ships flying by, and plenty of different light sources, did get the game down about 85 or so.

Considering the hardware I'm throwing at it, that's honestly kind of sad.  I can play the game just fine, so I'm not going to complain too loudly, but for people without a completely overpowered GPU, I can see where their issues are coming from.

IF you've got the hardware, don't worry about performance, it'll run fine.  If you don't, well, you may may want to play this one on a console, where they apparently bothered to optimize the damn thing.

This is a fantastic action-adventure game with tight, fun combat, lots of abilities and a huge world. 

Don't misunderstand, Jedi Survivor is a fantastic game, and I highly recommend it to people who like action-adventure games. But some of the choices I didn't like vs the first game:
1. Focus on huge samey worlds (Koboh) rather than a variety of planets.
2. Pseudo-Open World gameplay that is not really open world but gives large, directionless areas that don't have great rewards for exploring and/or wind up hitting gated areas. It just feels unfocused.
3. Over the top levels of collectibles. The first game had its faults with this for sure, but it is really overdone here. 
4. Major lack of new abilities. I like getting new abilities in games, they provide a major reward that is not really matched with anything else. It is over halfway through the game before I get my first new traversal ability. I much prefered a progression system typical to Metroidvanias like the first game.
5. I also really loved the 2nd Sister and Inquisitors in the first game, and the raiders are just not as compelling enemies IMO. Given the game's context as a Jedi Survivor, the Inquisitors are perfect villians. But, I am not finished with the game just yet, though I do know the final boss.

In short, I feel like it is a hybrid of a Metroidvania and a Ubisoft game, that doesn't let it excel in a singular focus.

Of course, there are things this game does better. More combat options, perks, fast travel, slightly better map, some new good abilities.

The combat system has been refined, the levels are more expansive, and, in my view, the storyline has seen significant improvement. While Fallen Order was a solid game, Survivor elevates the experience to greatness. I'm eagerly anticipating that the third installment will be even more exceptional, hopefully achieving perfection.

However, there's a caveat. If you have the option, I recommend purchasing the game for PlayStation. This is where I've been enjoying my journey through the game, and for good reason.

about 4.5hrs in now and just had my second crash. This time i lost some progress so i need to go and recollect a bunch of stuff -_-;;

Steps
1.Run the game.
2.Open task manager.
3.Go to the “Details” tab.
4.Find JediSurvivor.exe.
5.Right click it and change set priority to High or Real-time (Loads have recommended not to set to real-time due to it prioritizing a
game over more important pc functions).

1.Locate STAR WARS Jedi Survivor game directory.
2.Find and right-click on STAR WARS Jedi Survivor.exe file.
3.Select Properties > Click on the Compatibility tab.
4.Checkmark the 'Disable Full-Screen Optimizations' box.

second thing i want to mention is that the game has problems with the controls. its mainly true against bosses. i dont understand how the hell a game that comes out in 2023 and you cant cancel an attack, so after you pressed a button you cant cancel the attack and because of that on grandmaster the bosses are too hard, even when they are not that hard but they are hard because you cant cancel an attack. against the final boss it happend to me over and over that i died because of that. now its not only but but also the fact that in boss fight the dodge button  dosent work! i mean. it works sometimes and sometimes it dosent. for example, against the main vilian (not the final villian) after i blocked his attack and he went red i constantly press the dodge button and nothing happens! and then hes damaging me big time. again. maybe on jedi knight people would not care but those kind of things on grandmaster are frikin annoying!

the game is not hard because its hard. its hard because the controls are bad!. and dont get me started on the platforming in this game. they are so annoying. it honestly reminded me of prince of persia games from the 2000's. and if you remember those games, then yeah. that bad

you may like this game if you are a casual. but if you play on grandmaster then the game is too broken for this diffucilty. dont get me started on how the game cannot handle multiple enemies. with 1 or 2 its okay. but when you have so many enemies and some of them are damm strong the game become a nightmare. not because its that hard. because you constantly have to rotate the camera during fight. constantly while doding, while dashing. everything. its a frikin nightmare.

also, one last thing. again. the bosses on this game are not balanced well. the secondery bosses for example. most of them are too easy to beat. other then the rancor and spawn of oggdo. those 2 for some reason are a challange while the rest are just pushover. which is why this is so annoying. yo beat the game on grandmaster. you give it all you get and then you want to beat all the secondery bosses. but most of them you beat in 1-2 tries. so this is so dissapointing. its not like its related to the diffucilty you play in. not only the bosses but all the bounty hunters as well. they get way way too much damage and you beat them so easily that its insane. then you have 1 boss which is spawn of oggdo who is the only one who is actually a challange. and the rancor which is a little challange. but aside of those 2 all the bosses are pushovers. all the bounty hunters are pushovers as well. 

and for the stuttering....

its been 7 months!! and the game still hasent been fixed. and why? because respown aka EA must have their denuvo garbage and we have to suffer.

Although, the game did crash on me twice, which is twice more than is acceptable, but other than that only minor bugs/glitches/stutters (RTX 3080, M.2 SSD, Ryzen 7, Dec 2023). Most of the other reviews have touched on them so I'll be sharing some other stuff the game has going for it:

+ Narrative, dialogue, acting is strong overall and presentation feels distinctly Star Wars.
+ The visuals (excluding performance issues) is absolutely amazing, especially with ray-tracing.
+ Combat feels satisfying and you start with (most of the) skills from the first game already.
+ Skills and abilities progress at just the right pace due to how the levels and unlockables are designed. Great implementation of open-world (again, excluding performance issues),
+ More customization for the lightsaber, Cal, and BD-1 for roleplay, if you're into that.
+ Intuitive UI.

+/- High variety of skills/stances/abilities you can use, might be overwhelming or redundant, especially towards late game. You won't be using all the available skills, I promise you.
+/- Plot doesn't have distinct climax and might feel a bit unstructured (the first game also has this problem). It feels more like a ballad/musical than a traditional 3-act movie. Some people might not be okay with this.

- Combat might feel too easy or tedious at times (especially towards late-game).
- Parts of the narrative could've been presented better and/or more dramatically.
- Few leaps in logic and suspension of disbelief required for ability usage and narrative details (e.g. ""why didn't he/she/they just use this/do that?"")
- Navigation sometimes unclear (e.g., with regards to whether you can survive a fall; ""you should've made that"").

When I finished the game, I really wanted to give a positive recommendation for the game. The story is beautifully touching, the mechanics are extraordinarily improved compared to the first game, and this game masterfully extends the formula that made its predecessor. I love games with a narrative, and this game has a story that is honestly more heart-throbbing then some of the Star Wars films (the Disney ones lol). 

Despite the endless praises I could give about this game, I had to be realistic about the issues that disappointingly rob this game of the respect it deserves.

I remember at some point watching a brief clip of an interview with Steve Jobs (I believe), and he was talking about the dichotomy between the promotions of engineers and marketing people. He argued that often corporations will promote marketing people when given the chance as opposed to the engineers because a marketer's job is specially to make more money. He goes on to suggest that this issue is what causes corporations who seem to initially express and act on good intentions to slowly transform into a greedy institutions. Unfortunately, this issue seems to have leached itself into the development of this game.

[h2] The Performance [/h2]
Everyone here acknowledges the performance as being [b] the issue [/b], and I agree. I wanted to give some examples of how the issues with performance are certainly a lack of optimization as opposed to just the lack of performing hardware.

I'm rocking a 5 year old Alienware Laptop with a 1070 and a i7-8750H cpu, a broken fan, and heating issues! Now of course, if I launched the game for the first time and immediately had issues with sustaining a stable framerate, I could honestly attribute it to my under-performing cinder block of a laptop. But the issues with performance are more nuanced then that and behave strangely!

I have one specific example where this happens. Inside the main ship that's used to get from planet to planet, there is a map in the center which is used to select which planet to travel to; just like in the last game. I will tell you that I will drop from a 30 or 40 fps to like just 5 fps. The interface is extremely annoying for this reason. I doubt that my reason that a MAP drops my frames by 85% is because I'm not boasting the latest hardware from Nvidia. And sometimes when opening that map, it runs totally great for a second before deteriorating into a stop-motion mess again. This is what I mean by optimization; issues that defy reason which clearly express a lack of effort and/or time to QA test. 

The game's maps are segmented like in the previous title, although of a much larger then before. Now naturally, a larger size means more of a performance hog; I'm fine with that. I ran most of the game around and above 30fps which is very playable and not distracting for me. But sometimes, I'll enter a room/hallway/section adjacent to where I just was that will drop me to 20fps and below; in that performance territory, parrying on-time becomes excruciatingly difficult and is extremely distracting. When trying to rationalize why such a small change in location produced such a severe change in performance, there is no reasonable explanation. There are scenes/locations you would expect to loose a tone of frame-rate just to left perfectly fine, and there are scenes/locations which you would expect to be perfectly fine but are just excruciating to get through.

There was one time that I was moving around the map fast enough that I fell into the ground because it simply had not rendered yet. And frequently I see textures and meshes popping into the correct LOD just because I rounded a corner too quickly.

Without a doubt, optimization is needed badly, but I was worried about giving a negative review. I don't want to bury a franchise into the dirt because of the poor decision making that went around a game like Battlefield 2042. But I've had my trust broken so many times that I can't let this bullshit happen anymore. I have to be harsh, not because I hate the game, but because I love it and I believe it can do better.

I would have honestly voted for this game under so many categories for the steam awards on just the positives alone, but I can't appease the careless decision making of a bunch of marketing people who will never care about this franchise for more then its monetary value. 

[h2] A Note to the Developers [/h2]
I don't know how long you guys will be working on stabilization improvements, but there is lots of work to be done. If your hands are already full, then keep on doing the best work you can. Otherwise, if you would appreciate information on how somebody with minimum specs is running the game, I would love to be part of the process to get this game on its feet. I can provide information on which regions/sections/divisions are performing the worst so that improvements can be made there. Just let me know how I can help so this game can finally get the respect it deserves.",1703795361,1703795755,False,161,7,0.784793376922607422,13,True,False,False

The PC performance is absolutely a joke. Sometimes the stutters and visual errors get so bad I literally have to stop and reset because the FPS alone will drop from 200+ down to below 60 in the same area's. Oh god dont even get me started on the stutters, I've tried damn near everything to get them stop but they just wont go away. I'm severely disappointed that after 8 months and numerous patches the game still isnt fixed. 

Update #1 ever since reaching the second planet the random massive frame decreasing is all the more prevalent requiring lots of saving closing and rebooting. Even had quite a few crashes too.

The game is AMAZING. It's absolutely gorgeous, immersive, and it stays fresh and fun the whole time.  

Before trying this game out, I gave Witcher 3 a try because it had better reviews and no history of stability issues.   For whatever reason, everything in Witcher 3 felt like a CHORE.  But Jedi Survivor was the opposite.  It seduces you with a great story, and drops you into the game in thrilling situation, where you immediately feel like you're a hero in movie.  It's challenging, but not overwhelming.

I haven't taken a deep dive into an open world game since Oblivion and Fallout 3.  I was absolutely blown away by how much the game mechanics have improved since then, and how beautiful these open world adventures have become.

There are a few things I didn't care for in the game, but they are very minor: the game is ripe with rewards in the form of skins... obsessively so.  Do I need 100 different options of the paint on my lightsaber?  Do need 50 different jackets for Cal? How many different gun barrels for my blaster do I really need.

I guess some people find this stuff compelling, and it's definitely fun to take a few minutes to change the way your character looks... but THIS is supposed to be my motivation and reward for taking risks in the game?  To be clear, there are plenty of performance-related prizes, too.  I just found the focus on aesthetics to be a very bizarre departure from the games of ten years ago.  Hogwarts: Legacy does the same thing.  I guess it's become the norm.

I have two moderate complaints about the gameplay:  There are a handful of points in the game where you are forced to perform some extraordinary feats, or you cannot progress... like a series of two-dozen intricate midair acrobatics in a row.  Sometimes the automatic follow-camera angle makes these moves incredibly difficult and counter-intuitive.  I wish there was an option to skip them if you get really and truly stuck.  Unlike putting the game in story mode to get past difficult enemies, there's simply no way around these insane acrobatics.  These types of puzzles have their place.  They should be optional and lead to extraordinary rewards.  But often they just feel too contrived to have any place in the story.  Like, Cal is supposed to essentially bounce across a canyon... in world where jetpacks exist? Like any sane person wouldn't be like ""BRB, gonna go grab this incredibly useful tech instead of trying to be a literal superhero.""

My other complaint about the gameplay is that the doesn't quite give you enough time to luxuriate in your newfound powers.  As you get stronger, so do your enemies... thus cancelling out everything you've worked for.  It would be a much more fun game if they kept throwing low-level stormtroopers at you even in the later levels.

I want to end my review on a high note:  My problems with the game are MINOR compared to the sheer joy of playing this extraordinary adventure.  This may well be the best game I've ever played in my life.  So incredibly fun!",1703724553,1703724553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would say about the amount of money you would pay to go see a Star Wars movie in a theater is how much you should pay for this(if you have a PC good enough to run it). My experience so far up to this point, there are frame drops and I have gone through one crash, may go through more.

Everyone is criticizing performance - and rightfully so - but for me the problems started even before the performance started being a factor.

The very first menu that greets you upon starting the game - the FOV/audio setup - breaks if you use mouse with it. The options would change if you click on them, toggling between ""yes""/""no"". Except that's not what they should be toggling between. ""FOV: yes"" doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to be switching between ""tv"" and ""monitor"" presets, but it doesn't work with the mouse, only if you use keyboard to interact with this menu.

This was merely a portend of things to come.

Imagine the clunkiest website or a web-""app"" you had the misfortune of using. That's how the UI in this game feels like. Broken and inconsistent.

- The options menu similarly breaks if you use the mouse with it. Trying to change keybinds (an option that's only available under the ""accessibility"" category, but not under ""controls"" category for some reason. In fact, it is the only option that's available ONLY in the ""accessibility"" category) with the mouse will randomly make some buttons on the screen uninteractive. You won't be able to hover over them, to click them, and navigating through the menu with keyboard will skip over them.
- Attempting to change keybinds will sometimes only work after you press the key like 20 times. Often it would assign a wrong key. Often it would assign the ""left mouse button"" regardless of what key you're pressing, because I guess the game keeps thinking that LMB is pressed because that's what you used to access the keybind prompt.
- You cannot assign Tab to an action because Tab (and Shift-Tab) cycles through UI elements as if the UI was made in Flash of all things. Except sometimes you can. Why? I dunno, I got tired of experimenting when the first 19 out of 20 keypresses would result in no reaction whatsoever.
- Using arrow keys to navigate through the menus can will break the UI further. It will scroll the currently selected UI element out of view, it will skip over elements, it will fail to select a category etc.
- In fact, attempting to change options with arrow keys causes the same issues as in the aforementioned FOV/audiosetup screen, where it would fake the option being changed when in reality it isn't. A telltale sign of this is there being no ""click"" sound when you change options.
- Miraculously all these problems go away if you use WASD to navigate the menus instead of arrow keys. Why then are arrow keys EVEN DOING ANYTHING? Why not disable them entirely if the UI clearly doesn't support them for some unbeknownst reason?
- Using the mouse cursor to click on options will sometimes click on the wrong option, because the hitboxes of some of them extend seemingly across half of the screen.

And the cherry on top of all this: you can't even click ""Start New Game"" with the mouse. It simply doesn't react to clicks. If this doesn't showcase the developer's treatment of the PC port, then I don't know what does.

Only after all this, after spending like 45 minutes fighting the UI to set up the game the way I want, did I start playing. And wow, what a cinematic experience! At first I couldn't even tell if I was watching a prerendered video or an in-engine cinematic, because it was playing at sub-30 fps (all while the graphical fidelity was reminding me of 2003's Freelancer) and the screen looked smudged like from video compression artifacts. Little did I know back then that the game forces a <100% render scale on you, and you can do nothing about it short of modding the game.

And then - my god, the controls. The amount of camera turning interpolation/smoothing this game employs is disgusting - it really brings that experience of controlling an X-Wing, except you're on-foot. Camera sensitivity would change seemingly in every scene, good luck finding a comfortable setting that works for all circumstances. It's not quite as bad as the negative-acceleration mouse-emulating-joystick of the likes of Nier Automata or God of War PC ports, but it's not great either. Especially coming from Respawn of all developers, the studio with a pedigree of making first-person shooters where camera controls are paramount.

Combat feels very scripted, with enemies entering premade animations of interactions with the player character on every hit you make, instead of simply reacting to player's actions. Cal snaps to enemies like it's some kind of Assassin's Creed game, and your controls are locked while the canned animation is playing. Cinematic? Perhaps. Fluid? Hell no. Maybe I'm misremembering Fallen Order, but I don't remember the combat feeling this bad there.

All this at the glorious 20-30 fps. Strange how consoles don't have these performance issues while running worse hardware than the cutting edge PC components that the game manages to still struggle on. It's almost as if PC version has something that damages performance which console versions don't have... ...Oh yeah, Denuvo %&*@$#!

But please, refer to numerous other reviews for the actual overview of gameplay/performance issues of the game, because I didn't have enough time to experience them all: after giving it a short go, and then streaming the game issues to a friend so we can both have a laugh about it, I was nearing the end of a certain 2-hour period.

What happened? How is the second game this much worse than the first? None of the issues mentioned above were present in the Fallen Order! All you needed to do is NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. Yet it feels deliberately worse. It gives off the vibes of early 2000s licensed movie tie-ins, which would be developed by different studios and feel vastly different from game to game. Like the whiplash of Harry Potter 4 being a straight PS2-to-PC port after playing the first 3 games that were made on Unreal Engine directly for PC.

gameplay 6/10 - solid improvement on the first game, although not without its issues. constant animation locking results in clunky gameplay where youre always stuck in animations and unable to move quickly enough for the pace of the combat. the hitboxes for some attacks are awful. its an otherwise atrociously easy game- i completed it on grandmaster. most of my deaths were simply to being stuck in an animation or getting caught by some weird hitbox.

maps/worlds: 5/10 - Theyre alright. Koboh has most of the content, while every other map is minuscule in comparison. side missions are almost all a snoozefest though, and the map design is super gameified with no thought put into immersion at all. random things will be strewn about in a completely illogical way that makes no sense, or enemies placed in locations they should have no way of getting to.

platforming: 3/10 - holy shit it sucks. most of my platforming experience in this game was me looking around confused on where i was meant to go, not to mention how inconsistent wall running is.

The performance is still dodgy, there are constant frame drops on the main planet and boss fights. This is the most annoying part about the game, I was hoping it would have been fixed until now but no, it's still there. It prob won't get fixed so avoid it if it bothers you.
In terms of gameplay, the main issue I have is that the enemy ganks are annoying, The combat is very good when its one on one but falls apart in ganks, you just find yourself kiting and circling the arena due to the block meter and unstoppable attacks, the force abilities makes this more enjoyable but those are limited by a meter. Most of the time I just chose to take damage to get some damage of my own, I dont think it makes for good encounter design.

Summary:
Good game with some annoying enemy encounters, bad performance and some bugs.",1703649427,1703649427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
- The story is amazing
- Gameplay is just the previous game but better (could be a plus or a negative, depending on what you're looking for)
- Character customization

The bad:
- There's a lot of stuttering before entering a cutscene. Sometimes cutscenes are bugged altogether where BD will be riding on Cal instead of in the scene
- DLSS doesn't really do anything and adds some terrible artifacting to the HUD. You'll want to download updated .dll's for better DLSS
- The game needs to optimize the game files before every session. Sometimes it's quick sometimes it takes 5 minutes
- Some enemies are rinse/repeat

Overall:
- They still need to fix some of the performance issues. The stuttering before cutscenes is the most annoying part. However, once you're in the world playing the game, it's really really good. I wouldn't recommend this without a 40 series or equivalent card. There looks to be more bad than good, but I still recommend the game based on my experience with it 4 hours in.

As others mentioned performance issues are there, now I don't know if I am just lucky, but in my case it was not as bad as expected but the shuttering and frame drops come here and there and I only experienced crash once so far. 

On Koboh when frame drops happen more often, it is noticeable, but if you can look past that, it is enjoyable.

The story it self is great, a great continuing to the first one and the skill upgrades and force powers are a massive improvement. 

So why wait for it when it is on sale? despite the fact that me personally I am not experiencing so many performance issues, it is still there and because of that it is not worth the full price.

Improving on everything though falling short partially due to one of it's main strengths and partially due to the rushed PC release.

PRO's:
- The cast is well written and likeable. I really liked the characters. Greez and the badass Gen'Dai Rayvis being particular highlights to me.
- More lightsaber style variation.
- A blaster.
- Plenty more customisation of Kal's appearance, lightsaber and droid. (though not the ship)
- A wide variety of side content.
- Some endgame content and a New Game + (the latter I have still to explore but it gives some extra options, a red lightsaber etc)
- The story stands on it's own but builds an ongoing arc for the next part and is strengthened by playing the first part.
- A lot of gameplay/leveling options, a lot of playstyles and difficulties that can be modified to cater to the current mood/skills/preference. From story mode (casual and laid back) to Grand Master for people that like their games rockhard.
- The almost metroidvania style approach to powers to unlock areas in old areas + the excellent jump/climb etc mechanics continue to amaze. But also at times hold a weakness. (see cons)

Con's:
- This long after release I still had several crashes, including one that lost me a lot of content due to the lackluster save system.
- No autosave bar once in a while, limited save points. Which due to the exploration grind can sometimes be a pain especially with an unexpected crash.
- I wish there were a bit more worlds to explore.
- The Gen'dai which is similar to the Lucas canon's Durge should have had an additional combat near the end. Disney has downpowered this species it seems.
- I'm not a big fan of the Disney version of the Inquisition or the High Republic. If you love the Disney canon this is a plus perhaps. For me it was a con. Though in no worry a huge problem.
- Some puzzles/jumping area become downright ridiculous both lore and entertainment wise, grinding things to a halt.
- Part of the game's content feels artificially gated or delayed. People that don't like excessive puzzles MAY dislike some parts of the game.

Conclusion:
Probably one of the best pieces of Star Wars content we've seen in a decade together with Fallen Order.
Definitely worth picking up. But due to the ongoing (very infrequent) crash issues only at a discount.
I hope they don't rush the launch of part 3. The game deserves a smoother release.

Unfortunately that's where my compliments for this game end.

This game is so poorly optimised for PC, it runs like a turd regardless of how good your hardware is or what settings you pick. Probably about 70% of this game was playable for me, but there are sections that are just a stuttery and laggy mess. When you quit the game it takes a good 5-10 minutes for the game to properly close, and that whole time it is hogging all of your system resources, lagging the heck out of your computer.

The overall story leaves much to be desired. Without spoiling too much, it was incredibly predictable, and the ending felt way too similar to its predecessor.

Playing this game also requires you to go through EA's proprietary launcher. This means having to download another launcher and creating/logging into an EA account. If I wanted to use the EA launcher I would've bought the game on there, this trend of triple A studios forcing you to use their game launchers to play their games needs to end.

If the game was fixed I would consider recommending this game, but in its current state I just can't.

People complain mostly about the performance but what is really the problem is the design.
What was great about Fallen Order? A well designed combat system, amazing mostly linear level design that still rewarded some side exploration with helpful items and the occasional fun cosmetic thing.

This game however is nothing but a design-by-committee disaster. Oh games have open world now, and hubs, and stores, and whatever else crap you can copy over from the latest Ubisoft game, God of War or wherever else you want to steal.

The result is a game where you have hubs that are unnecessary, unnecessary items that you only get to be able to buy cosmetics in some usless shop, NPCs that couldn't be more generic, an ""open world"" that serves no story pupose and just had you kill random animals for no reason, and tons of useless perks, an overcomplicated skill system and combat animations from Cal that make you think he's Geralt killing a drowner but not a Jedi dealing with an already disarmed helpless enemy. You are literally executing some people that are already helpless on the ground.

All in all this is everything that's trash about AAA games, makes everything feel generic and the same. You have companions now.. no reason.. just because games do that now. You have hubs and shops that add nothing but hey, AAA games have that now so it must be here too.

God what an absolute disappointment. I didn't even play to the point where we meet most of our old friends again, and I was REALLY looking forward to finding out more about Merrin. That tells you how incredibly disappointed I was and how little fun I had. Fallen Order made me feel like a Jedi. This made me feel like a God-of-War-Geralt-Zelda-Chick with a lightsaber.

Much better game compare to the previous part with Cal.

I see people complain a lot about performance of the game for me it wasn't bad and wasn't grate ether but it didn't really take much from the game itself of course I wish to have better graphics with my hardware but most people forget that good game usually is not about the graphics it's about what happening on the screen. 

Glad to see totally new mechanics implemented by developers which provides quiet a freedom to the player and amount of content is good if you explore while following the main line of the game.

I personally only question one thing: 
""How the hell in dual saber stance we don't have opportunity to run multi color light-sabers"".
I was thinking about it whole game since I got dual saber stance and totally can understand technical difficulty to handle ray tracing - track such strong light sources, but at the same time dual color was core mechanics in other games... why we don't have it here honestly a bit disappointing.

The game itself is pretty cool. I like the combat. This is less of a platforming/puzzle mess that turned me off the last one in this series.

Performance-wise, it seems mostly ok on my system. Some dips, some stutters, but not often.

What sucks, then?

It just crashes all the time. I've been tolerating it but this game came out in April, and it's December. I don't like having to plan around possible game crashes while I'm playing the game. There's no warning, just freeze and then an Unreal dialogue box for reporting the crash. Then, on relaunch, you'll sit through lengthy vanity cards, and then a lengthy ""optimizing game files"" screen (like 5 minutes I timed to relaunch the game after a crash) before you're allowed to continue from whatever checkpoint you last saved.

So, no, don't buy this, even at 50% off. They still haven't finished it!

EDIT: I seem to have solved my crashing problem by just disabling ray tracing. Would I recommend this game now having that knowledge? Absolutely not. It's still broken 8 months after release and I'm still constantly worried about getting ripped out of the game before I can make it back to a save point.

Im thoroughly enjoying this game and have not experienced crashes at all unlike other reviews. had a bit of stutter at the start of the game but only through cutscenes not in actual gameplay. big improvement from the last game in regards to content. the story is solid and the planets are quite large, plenty to explore/discover. would i recommend buying this game full price? probably not, as it is not the best in regards to optimisation and performance but it definitely is playable with the correct settings. im happy playing at 60-80 fps so im not worried in that regard. end review.

Although that will remain a stain on Respawn's legacy, I am happy to say that after the best part of a year I was finally able to finish the game, and that it's at last in a state that I would highly recommend picking it up.

The game itself is a solid continuation of Fallen Order with the same fantastic cast returning to deliver an incredible and touching story that's really at the top end of what the Star Wars universe has to offer. There are few weak points in the writing, and some moments presented here are as iconic as anything in the much loved franchise. I would say that in combination with the previous game this is shaping up to be my favourite Star Wars trilogy since the original movies.

The world in which the game takes place is truly astonishing in it's level of detail and design. There really are some exceptional locations to explore, and there is a real sense of freedom. Sadly the collectables out in the world are still limited to mainly cosmetic upgrades, but it's a lot of fun just exploring the map. It helps that the game is gorgeous to look at. After many patches it's finally possible to see the game at it's best without having to own a military grade GPU, and with DLSS and RT enabled I was able to run the game at 4K on a 3080. With that said, it's still a great looking game even without all the sliders turned up to maximum.

Gameplay is a mild evolution of what was on offer in FO. It's still wearing it's soulslike credentials on it's sleeve and generally feels the same to play as it's predecessor, with some minor tweaks. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and for the most part, it ain't broke. Boss fights remain tense and generally feel like a fair challenge, and regular mobs are fun to dispatch, though in both cases the continued use of unblockables still feels like a crutch. New stances offer some variety, but I ended up prioritising the one I liked best and sticking with it for the whole game. Where the game really shines is in its set pieces, which really take this game into cinematic territory. At times it's like being put right into the middle of an intense interactive action movie.

Overall this is a 10/10 game which delivers on every level, and any Star Wars fan that's able to should pick this up. Even without the legacy of the franchise to prop it up, this game contains some of the best moments I can recall in any game, which left me catching my breath a few times.

The story is awesome and feels like a classic Star-Wars adventure and i can honestly say this was one of, if not the best game I've played in the last few years.

The mechanics and combat in this game are also phenomenal, it's like a full on Revamp of Fallen Order.

There is still a bit of backtracking but with the added fast-travel ability and better level design its not bad.

The one main thing I am upset about is it seems they removed the ""Meditation Training"" feature from Fallen Order, and with the added enemies, Lightsaber styles, and Force abilities it's something I feel that would be much more useful and bring much more enjoyment to the post-game.

You can tell a lot of love and passion was put into this game, with hours and hours of content to be done, tones of secrets, Easter eggs and fan service. The story has a lot of heart, and instead of having characters develop like 'magic' (*cough cough"" the sequels) we see them change, through relatable aspects, such as a father just trying to protect his daughter in the only way he knows how, or a person faced with difficult decisions, trying follow the only code he knows while constantly having to question it. And I do like how they really dive deep into the emotional and sad aspects, how Cal deals with loss and him having to adapt and prepare for it. How his newly found confidence he begins with slowly diminishes throughout the game and how he has to stop his rage from controlling him. This game not only improves in game play but also in story, while some of the High Republic stuff being harder to invest in, the core aspects are always the most appealing. And the romance, finally in Star Wars, was actually DONE WELL. You actually root for the characters and it's built up throughout the game, and was even hinted at in Fallen Order. It actually feels refreshing to have things like this that doesn't feel forced. This is arguably the best sequel (game-wise), this game also has the best combat and customisation. You can customise Cal, his lightsaber, with 5 different lightsaber stances unlocked throughout the story (duel bladed, crossguard, single etc.). You can also customise BD-1, your lightsaber appearance and more. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game.

The main place I encountered performance problems was the Forest Array.   Most of the time it is fine, but definitely things got worse once all those weather effects from Koboh Dust kicked in.   The weather effects seem to be the real culprit for the performance problems:  They just plain overdid it, and even high end graphics cards can't handle this much weather effect on a huge seamlessly pre-loaded map.  It was a miscalculation.

bosses are badly designed.
seriously, the final boss fight is incredibly annoying. he can push you around all he wants while he doesn't react at all if you try the same which feels incredibly unfair it's like the rules of this world only apply to you and none of your opponents.
more than once has the boss gone from parry-stunned to immediately using a red attack the moment i decide to hit him. remember, i'm playing on KNIGHT MODE. i beat the original on grandmaster.
the game teaches you the whole time that grenades can be manipulated, but in the final fight that becomes impossible for absolutely no reason other than to add artificial difficulty.
the other bosses have many issues as well, but they're not as bad as the final one.

the game isn't very polished. i got stuck and unable to move more than once, first time around I walked in the wrong spot while using one of those desert giraffe things and the second time around i walked in between 2 npcs and couldn't walk out for a while. there's more bugs but i don't feel like giving this more attention than I need to.

The combat will punish you for not paying attention to the enemy timing and behavior, especially if you prefer to just brute your way through things like I do.

I restart game. I wait for it to ""optimize my game files"" and send me to main menu. *press continue* wait for planet to load again and walk around for about a minute. the game freezes. I close the program and continue this cycle.

The longest i was able to play without having to close and reopen the game, after arriving at the first planet, was 4 minutes. 4 minutes was the absolute best. I tried 6 times and adjusted my settings and the other 5 attempts only lasted for a max of 2 minutes before it would freeze.

id say just try it and refund it if it doesnt work out, i was scared to buy it for the longest time. 
i will also say i absolutely despise gay puzzles and platforming and lucky for me theres a difficulty setting that will make them easier so you can nobrain through them without changing the difficulty of the fights. thank god for that, thank youuu jesus.

also remember to open task manager after playing and force quit any EA Games related stuff you see, theres spyware itt.

Whether on my 3080 Ti or my 4090 ray tracing performance is absolutely broken. And, even without RT, no matter the combination of graphics settings or resolution, GPU usage never climbs above 70%. Meanwhile CPU usage skyrockets to around 70%. I've been PC gaming since the original Wolfenstein 3D released in '92 and I have a difficult time remembering any competently made game performing like this.

I can confirm what you've likely heard elsewhere: the game is CPU bottlenecked 100% of time, no matter what you do.

The best-guess explanation I've seen is that the game's use of the Denuvo DRM software is bringing our CPUs to their knees with complex background encryption processes. 

So, that means we're getting an inferior product and a terribly stuttery and unoptimized game experience so the corporate bootlickers at EA can delay their inevitably losing battle against piracy and keep their out-of-touch shareholders happy.

Those are my primary complaints about this abysmal PC port.

The game also suffers from a litany of inexcusable user-interface problems that absolutely have no place being present in an overpriced AAA game from one of the biggest publishers and one of the most popular developers in the world.

These other issues include, but are not limited to the following:

1. Changing game resolution in the options menu simply does not work with a controller, it's swappable with keyboard and mouse only. Even if you unplug your controller while the game is running, it will not work. You must start the game with only KB/M active.

2. You must install the EA app in addition to Steam, and cloud saves are handled by EA, not Steam. In my five hours of playing I've already encountered issues with cloud saves not updating between different systems. A problem I've literally never had with Steam in my nearly 14 years of using the program.

3. The shader compilation ""optimizer"" that runs during game start up appears to be do nothing 9/10 times it runs, and it does absolutely nothing to help minimize stuttering in game. At this point, I genuinely believe its only purpose is to prolong the amount of time it takes to get to the start menu.

4. Even when using DLSS Frame Generation, and/or G-Sync/FreeSync VRR, microstuttering is a constant issue no matter what you do.

EA is the worst publisher in video games, and the decision makers in that company have nothing but disdain and disrespect for their customers. I regret buying this broken mess. Don't make my mistake.

I simply cannot recommend anyone waste their money on this atrocious port of an otherwise great game. Thankfully I bought this for $35 USD, not the insane $70 they've been gouging people with. But even 50% off is an exorbitant price for this slipshod product. Because of all the inexcusable technical problems listed above I don't think this game is worth more than $15.

Once those who are doing the Lord's work figure out how to get this game onto the Seven Seas, I'm deleting this version and going sailing. Yarr Matey!

The story is another thing. It didn't feel... epic. It was good, for sure. But the ending was very disappointing. It felt like a midpoint, not a final boss. So if you're thinking about playing this, just go play fallen order. It's a generally better game.

First of all, let's get the obvious out of the way: The game ran decently on my PC. There were times where the frame rate dropped, mostly in open areas, but it wasn't something that made me want to tear my hair out.

On to the real review:

I think Jedi Survivor is a good soulslike that is somewhat elevated by being Star Wars. It's undeniably fun slashing things up with your lightsaber and doing jedi flips all over the place, but like with the Arkham games you could rightly question if Survivor would be as highly regarded if it hadn't had this particular coat of paint.

As someone who has completed almost all of the Soulsborne games (yes, I am giving out autographs) the combat mechanics and exploration of Survivor don't quite measure up to the genre's best outings. Fighting feels somewhat clunky compared to, say, Sekiro and exploration becomes a bit of an afterthought when you realize there is relatively little reward for doing so.

[h2] Cosmetics: The Game [/h2]

One thing I dislike about Survivor and its predecessor is how underwhelming many of the rewards for exploring are. When you defeat a tough miniboss or solve a demanding puzzle in Dark Souls you're rewarded with new weapons, armors, rings, consumables or other useful goodies. In Survivor you get a new hairstyle. Like a mullet, for instance. There are rewards that go beyond the cosmetic, like health upgrades or 'perks', which are small skill boosts you can equip at bonfires, but more often than not what you find is utterly useless unless Fashion Souls is your main reason for playing these games.

I actually thought this had been improved upon over Fallen Order, but I thought wrong. Halfway through the game, any dopamine surge associated with discovering a hidden area or a chest had evaporated completely, as I knew in advance these would most likely hold absolutely nothing of value beyond a new pair of ears for BD-1, some pink jedi robes or a yet another lightsaber hilt that looks exactly like the other ones when zoomed out. Sometimes I'd find a health or force meter upgrade, but that was as exciting as it ever got.

However, Survivor does improve on its itemization in some key areas. For instance, you now have access to five different saber stances that you can switch between at your leisure, which is an incredibly nice touch and one of the best improvements over Fallen Order. These stances somewhat correspond to the different weapon types you can find in souls games, with the regular stance being balanced, the crossguard stance being the equivalent of a heavy, slow weapon, the dual sabers acting as 'dex' weapons and so on. The amount of polish that went into these stances is praiseworthy, and I can only imagine it took some work balancing the game around all five. Maybe if certain upgrades to these stances or even the stances themselves could be found by exploring rather than just being given to you at story-appropriate times, exploration would have been more fun. The blaster stance, for instance, had immense potential for customization, upgrades and tweaks, but nothing like that is to be found in Survivor.

[h2] Like Sekiro, but slightly worse [/h2]

The combat in Survivor is like Sekiro, but slightly worse. Keep in mind that I played this game on grandmaster difficulty (the highest setting), so anything I say applies to that difficulty level only. Combat is good. Very good, in fact. But only 85% of the time. When things click, you're playing something that looks and feels like peak Star Wars, seamlessly slicing up hapless stormtroopes and combat droids, parrying blaster shots, lifting groups of enemy into the air with your force powers and tossing them over edges. It's very viscerally satisfying. But certain enemies, mostly bosses and minibosses, and their assorted attack patterns are insanely frustrating to deal with, for a few reasons:

1. Certain strong enemies can attack you through your own attacks. This means that if an enemy is gearing up to do a strong attack, you can't cancel that attack by hitting him first. Even if your attack connects, the enemy will just continue his swing as if nothing happened. It creates this annoying feeling that your own attacks have no weight to them and don't actually affect enemies, which is doubly egregious seeing as your weapon is supposed to be a lightsaber.

2. In connection with point 1, certain enemies - mainly bosses - have insanely long combos that you're expected to memorize perfectly. Once these combos are over, you have a very short window of opportunity to get your own attack in, and then the combos start over again. This is what I like to call the Elden Ring syndrome, and I absolutely despise it. Most lightsaber duels in this game feel less like give-and-take sword fights between two evenly matched adversaries and more like lopsided memorization exercises where you spend 97% of the time running, dodging, parrying, jumping and evading increasingly complicated combos until it's your turn to impotently prick your enemy for 3% of his health, after which you rinse and repeat until the fight is over one way or the other. Sekiro had some of the same issues, but its tighter parry mechanics made up for it, and in that game you could parry your way to victory. In Survivor, parrying is mostly a defensive manouvre (and also wonky and unpredictable, but we will get to that).

3. You can get stunlocked - this game features several attacks that can stunlock you. If the first sweep of certain combos hits you, you will get sucked into the remainder of the combo and forced to soak up all the damage. These attacks are fortunately pretty rare, but still absolutely infuriating. One particular droid with a spinning staff attack needs to just be modded out of the game entirely. And don't get me started on Oggdo-Boggdo, that prick.

4. There are many poorly telegraphed enemy attacks and cues: Some attacks, for instance, appear as if you can evade them, but then you actually can't. Even when pressing the evade button at the perfect time, they will hit you regardless. Parrying is also very wonky and hard to do on grandmaster difficulty. It almost feels random if you succeed or not, which is insanely frustrating when fighting bosses with huge health bars whom you're expected to parry. Some parry windows are very generous, others require superhuman reflexes, and there is really no way to know which is which in advance.

Let me again underscore that most of the combat is good and works as intended. I just want new players to know in advance that Survivor is not as smooth as other similar games. It seems like the developers studied FromSoft's mechanics but only got 4/5ths of the way there.

[h2] It feels like you're there [/h2]

Survivor's biggest strength is in how it brings Star Wars to life. Visually and sound design wise, it really feels as if you're part of a Star Wars movie. If someone had shown this to my 11-year old self, I would have fainted out of pure excitement. Lightsabers make satisfying whoosh noises, stormtroopers look, act (and aim) like you expect them to, the scenery is absolutely gorgeous and so on. I have zero complaints about Survivor's presentation. It's clearly a labor of love.

[h2] What story? [/h2]

I think the writing in this game is perfectly serviceable, but nothing rises above standard Star Wars fare as we've seen it in the last 8.295 Star Wars movies released last year alone. Not-Luke, I mean Cal Cestis, is leading a band of merry rogues as they battle the evil galactic empire. This band includes a funny sidekick (who is more grating than funny), a will-they-won't-they love interest, a wise mentor and a few other paint-by-numbers archetypes as we've seen them a million times before. I honestly zoned out a bit during most of the cutscenes.

In conclusion, I recommend this game and would probably give it a 7/10 on a non-binary scale. It's good, but I've played better.",1703272333,1703272333,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

That some of the very basic ones have not been fixed in all these months is beyond ridiculous!

Trust the negative reviews as per the technical issues, and trust the positive ones as to what an awesome game this could be without the issues.
I will update this review when the most serious issues are fixed (and I'm still playing).

Just the most ridiculous: 
(1)
CPU usage is extremely high. FPS is CPU limited. 
I have to turn off ray-tracing to get to a manageable CPU load (still way too high). This is the only game with which I've experienced this in the past few years.
(2)
I have to disconnect mouse and keyboard to be able to play with controller.
If the game receives too many kbd/mouse input events (including unvoidable events from miniscule mouse movements) then the game switches to kbd/mouse mode, turning of the controller input and with no ability to switch back to controller input. Only solution is quit to desktop, restart and unplug kbd/mouse.
This game is strongly (and correctly) recommended to played with a controller - kbd/mouse puts you at a disadvantage.
(3)
Optimizing game files (compiling shaders) at EVERY start of the game. Caching appears broken. 
The workarounds that can be found all have their own drawbacks (you need to write-protect an entire config file).
(4)
Does not work with non-standard aspect ratios. I have a 16:10 display (which is not that uncommon, actually).
You either have significant parts on the sides cut off, or you get a stretched image. The game does not letterbox if you configure a 16:9 resolution.
In other words, the game does not display properly with 16:10 - no matter what workarounds you try, some parts with be distorted or cut off.

Not recommended even at a steep discount as long as these basics remain broken.

I found myself listening to more dialog and optional conversations than normal just because the atmosphere and voice-acting was that good. You also get multiple lightsaber stances to play with, which is nice.

I agree that there are major optimization issues the devs should have fixed, but it was playable. GeForce RTX 3070 Ti
- launch videos stutter, which is weird
- default graphics settings stuttered. 4K w/ DLSS Performance. I turned off motion blur, chromatic, film grain, post processing down, and it wasn't too bad
- Planet map screen has major stuttering

EA launcher is required, NO offline play. 1 day the EA servers were down, and I could not launch the game for about 20 minutes.

A few glitches that bothered me:
- Voice audio out of sync with lips (main character scenes)
- Jawas face glitch in wrong direction

On gameplay, I feel like the game could use more significant side quests to go back over areas. For example, there were parts of Jedah I never explored (where crates/secrets are), but the crates weren't enough motivation to go back. I would have liked to be able to use the landspeeder freely and go back there to do a few quests.

Yes, I could do New Game+, but there are other games to play. There is a perk that changes up the enemies during your Next Game+, which is a nice idea.

- Potential Spoilers? -
-----------------------------------
Honestly this game probably could have used a few more months of polishing before releasing. After completing the game and watching the credits I noticed that there were quite a few other hands in the cookie jar than just Respawn developers and I believe that led to the myriad of issues that plagues the game. I understand others have reported no crashes or issues playing the game. I can't even begin to imagine how many times i said, ""why is my 2080 super having such a hard time with the graphical side of the game?"" Terrain looked so bad at times, sometimes wouldn't render at all. Every time I used the fast travel my game would need at least 10 minutes to recoup so that the frames would be stable. The side quests/bounty hunts all seemed like afterthoughts in the development process and felt immersion breaking as Cal had to go hunt the bounty hunters??? I mean I get it, im not a developer, but come on, at least like put them in places that Cal would run into them during the story or something. 

If you cut out all the sandbox exploration stuff, the story is also kinda just, meh? It kind of felt like a very long Part 1 of 2. Dagan Gera was an interesting idea but felt like a pushover. Rayvis was cool but probably could have been much more terrifying if he morphed like the guy in the 2D clone wars. Also the inquisitors just uh...gave up on Cal? He went from being consistently hunted to the empire being like, meh whatever he's in the outer rim, lets just send...purge troopers/DT's.... 

A lot of my friends have stated that they just rushed the story to get it over with and I completely understand why. The game feels disjointed at times and while I think the concept of the story was cool and very emotionally moving at times (Kata + Bode) and (Khri + Dagan) I think that there should have been at least some higher stakes than just what happened on Jedha with the Empire.

Overall I give the game a 7.5/10, mostly because I enjoy all star wars content regardless, just docking points for poor performance on PC and some personal views on the story direction/gameplay.

----------------------------

Probably joining a lot of other people in that this game suffers a lot from poor optimization. My issue is that there is obviously a memory leak during cutscenes and I crash every time a new one plays. We're approaching 5 months in to this game being available and we're only 7 major patches in with EA/Respawn asking us to be patient as they work through the bugs. 

I'll keep attempting to power through because I love all star wars content but like, this is really sad. It really shows that the team was not allocated enough time to guarantee a well-rounded product.

Ultimately, I need to recommend this game. I think it captures what makes Star Wars 'Star Wars'. The characters are good, well acted/voiced. It looks impressive. Customisation options. Main and secondary missions. Ticks all the boxes and bells all the whistles. 

Something that did riddle my biscuit though: 'hitting' enemies won't stop their attacks. I can understand this for unblockable attacks, but standard attacks still seemingly ignore damage dealt and hit me with my guard down. I hate this. Not only because my attacks are interrupted if I'm 'hit' (even force attacks), but because it stops me from setting my own pace in combat. I'm forced to submit to the pace set by enemy movements/patterns utilising block. Not quite my tempo. Like fighting games, if I see an enemy winding up for a heavy attack, I want to be able to halt them with a quick attack.

I waited for a while for the updates to come in before starting it so I definitely have not hit that many bugs an issues. I have a 9900k and 3070 FE and play on a super ultrawide 1440p monitor. In general the game is really smooth. Occasionally on Koboh the frames drop a bit and twice on Jedha the frame rate dropped to unplayable levels for like 30 seconds, but other than that it's been fantastic.

The story is awesome, lots of turns and excitement. I don't want to spoil anything on that front.

My favorite part has just been the variety of fighting and platforming mechanics. They start you off basically where you were at the end of the first game as far as abilities and most major missions introduce a new movement mechanic be it a grappling hook or other type of movement ability that keeps things super fresh and fun. 

Some of the scripted sequences are just over the top and insanely fun. One in particular on Jedha was a highlight for me. 

Still haven't finished it yet, but if you liked Fallen Order, this is a very worthy sequel for sure. Worth it for full price? Yes. If you are dying to play it, buy it at full price. If you can wait a bit, there have been a number of sales this year already marking it down by 20-35 percent so patience can pay off.

Incredible story, fantastic graphics, and some of the best gameplay you can imagine. It's not only a great video game, but a great addition to Star Wars as a whole. I feel perfectly fine adding this to the rest of the Star Wars properties, and it fits in much better than any of the new movies. It's awesome and I recommend it to anyone that like Star Wars and video games. If you're a fan of Star Wars and haven't played this, what are you doing? 

However the game is horrifically optimized. It is embarrassing. How can you have such a fantastic game wasted in such an awful package? For whatever reason this game has serious problems under the hood, and it is massively affecting my enjoyment of this game. There are much better looking games that run infinitely better. This is like watching The Last Jedi on a flip-phone. A phone that also occasionally just doesn't work. Frame drops are constant, stuttering is constant, and I've encountered a few annoying glitches. But honestly, as much as those suck, it's not like you can't play the game. Even at 40 fps, you can still play and beat the game. As much as I sympathize with other issues people are having, I think in some cases, the complaining is a little extreme. 30fps is not 'UNPLAYABLE'. That is objectively false. You can still play the game. It looks worse, but you can still play the game. But you know what does make the game unplayable? Crashes. 

This game crashes a lot. Like way too many times. For almost the whole game I was fine, except for Koboh. For whatever reason, Koboh has some serious issues. My game would constantly crash there, forcing me to reset my game, sometimes causing me to lose a lot of progress. I should never have to troubleshoot my game, pouring over tons of articles and editing so many settings just so I can get trough a single cutscene. Even then, it will still crash. When a game crashes, it is objectively impossible to play the game I spent 70$ on. THAT is what unplayable means. And the number of times it should happen is 0, for all games. This is unacceptable and is something I CANNOT tolerate, even for this amazing game. 

Even with all the crashing and technical problems, I have made it through what I believe to be 80% of the game's story. I am almost at the finish line. However, my game has now begun to crash every single time I open the game and I cannot continue. I have become locked out of the game and cannot move forward, no matter what I try. EA, you have forced me to write this review because now I can't do anything. I didn't want to do this, but I have no choice. Until you fix this game, and I can see the conclusion to the story me and many others have waited YEARS for, I sadly can't recommend this game. 

Update- 
The game is playable now and I was able to beat it. Thank you for updating the game. Excited for whatever comes next, but please make sure it is optimized well. Don't let this happen again.",1683432294,1703047679,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Not only is it still a stuttery mess, but I upgraded to a RTX4080 and the frame gen in this game is laughably terrible. Just ghosts and glitches literally everywhere you look.

Jedi Survivor gets the prestigious 2023 Technical Garbage Fire award.

UPDATE OCTOBER 2023:

Still a giant stuttery mess. I don't know how anyone thought this was in a launchable state. Even 7 patches later, it's still unplayable.

Avooiiiiid at any price

The game is pretty fun but it's currently a paid beta. On: 

* Win 11 (they blamed Win 10 in a post, but not the case for me at least)
* 2x nvme Evo 980 pro in Raid 0
* i9-13900k
* 32GB DDR5
* 3080 TI 

I'm getting a ton of stutter. Framerates are usually above 50 but occasionally drop down to 20 and are generally all over the place. Seems like the PC version got rushed out the door.

I'd def recommend if all the performance issues are fixed, though.

I played the game with a PC in 1080P 60 fps and high resolution, no ray tracing on...similar to an xbox. While the game designers recommend playing the game with a controller, i used a keyboard and programmable mouse. This worked just  as well as a controller if not better. 
The ""Cons"" on the game included too many chests with worthless contents. Gathering seed to grow a useless garden. Maps that were unjustifiably confusing. And finally a wimpy ending if you can call it that. I was also non-plussed  about some of the precision required for jumps and zip lines. While there were a lot of abilities one could acquire, not all were worth anything. Two weapons, health and Stamina, and some force selections are all you need.
All in all this was a enjoyable game and I recommend you give it a try.

TLDR: 
Totally recommend the game, especially if you're a fan of Star Wars or challenging souls-like games (if played on hard difficulty).
Lightsabers, *light-side* force powers, and Uncharted-inspired platforming puzzles, OH MY!
Virtually everything from the first game is improved. 
Combat is crisp and satisfying.
Beware AMD users. I have experienced several game breaking graphical bugs even after AMD's recent patch. 
Story is good but not amazing. Basic McGuffin.


Spoiler Free:

Uncharted, in space, with lightsabers and *light-side only* force powers. If that doesn't sell you, this ain't the game for you. If you haven't played Uncharted and don't know what it is, think super acrobatic Indiana Jones. If you don't know either, then, I don't...jedi guy who hunts down McGuffins in space. 

Strongly recommend playing Fallen Order first as some of the character development will be lost on anyone who has not played the first game.

Pros:
1) Lightsaber combat in this game took a big step forward. It's probably the most developed saber combat of any Star Wars game to date. It really is excellent! It mimics souls-like games with the whole dodge/parry system, but thanks to the difficulty options it can be much more forgivable than the typical souls-like.
2) Combat is extremely satisfying across the board. Whether it's the parry system or reflecting blasters bolts or (my favorite) throwing a little B1 droid off a cliff and listening to it passively comment on its unfortunate luck, it's all well polished.
3) They do a great job of setting Cal (the protagonist) up to feel like a Jedi Knight as opposed to a fresh padawan. This is especially welcome since we spent most of the first game as a padawan who could barely swing a lightsaber without chopping an arm off and running scared from any real force-using threat. He's maybe not quite as strong as I would like, but they do a great job of making him feel like a bona fide Jedi guardian (more lightsaber heavy than force power).
4) The story is wonderfully absent any real reference to the movies. The story stands on its own with its own characters, several of whom are genuinely interesting and likable. 
5) I mentioned lightsabers and force powers right?
6) Several of the locations in the game have never been seen before. Seeing these new planets, all of which are unique and BEAUTIFUL has been a real treat.
7) The game is pretty lengthy. There are a good chunk of side quests, several of which have some pretty neat stories/scenery and all of which (that I've done so far) felt worthwhile. None of them have been at the level of the Witcher 3 side quests, but they've all been enjoyable.
8) This game has one of the most fun/awe-inspiring quick time battle events I've ever played. It sounds like a silly thing to put on a pro-list, but it was THAT much fun. I raved about it to several friends after completing it. There have been multiple moments like that. A unique fight mechanic. A fun environmental twist. Each mission campaign had something specific about it that I liked that was different from the other missions. That really helps the missions and worlds and even the bosses stand out as individual places. 

Cons:
1) I'm running the game on AMD gpu and it's pretty darn awful. Like Cyberpunk 2066 or Mass Effect Andromeda face-melting graphical issues awful. Some of them are game breaking. I think this is more of an AMD issue, and they've released one patch that helped a good bit. But, there's still some SERIOUS graphical problems. That said, still love the game. Still definitely recommend it. Just, if you have an AMD gpu, be prepared to die a few times due to random graphics issues. I had a moving blubber wall spawn in the middle of a boss fight. Couldn't see the boss at all, but the boss could still hit me through the wall that wasn't supposed to even be there.
2) The story is good but not particularly inventive. It's a basic McGuffin quest line, just like the first game. The hook for this game is that you get to play a Jedi doing Jedi things with lightsabers and force powers. The story serves as a vehicle for the gameplay rather than the meat of the game itself.  It's entertaining, but don't expect it to knock your socks off like an OG Bioware game or the Witcher or Last of Us.




MILD SPOILERS AHEAD******************************





The return of some of the old crew is very welcome, and the addition of Bode was fantastic! He's a great character and good adventuring buddy for Cal. 

BD is just as adorable and wonderful as the first game, maybe even more so. Really, come for the lightsabers and force powers, but we all stay for BD. Let's be honest.

The addition of a bunch of new ""tools"" for Cal to solve his Uncharted-inspired platforming puzzles was much needed. There was only so much life left in the Fallen Order's platforming puzzles, and I was honestly worried about how much more of it I could take. The tools add just enough newness to keep the platforming from feeling stale even 20-30 hours into the campaign. 

Cal feels...underpowered. This game focuses on expanding lightsaber combat, and boy is it ever so expanded. There are several different blade types and all of them feel unique with unique bonuses, though some of the move sets (for instance an aerial ground pound) are copy-paste. His force powers have barely expanded and, because they are exclusively *lightside* powers, lack the flashy and fun choke/crush/lightning/etc. Perhaps this will come if they make a third game? I don't know. But, Cal's lack of any really fresh powers stands in stark contrast to Merrin (who thankfully returns and plays a much more active role) who levels up like an anime protagonist. Seriously, the girl has some WILD powers now. And Cal can, I don't know, pull a droid to him? Mind control a space dog for like 2 seconds? Oh no, wait, scratch that. He can mind control 2 space dogs for 2 seconds each. This is even weirder when in some cut scenes he does crazy awesome things like manages to hold of an enemy force user while also holding up an entirely collapsed ceiling. 

Cal is definitely growing as a Jedi. He has some good lines about self-control, self-awareness, and forgiveness. It's a nice change to see him growing up a bit and becoming a little more aware. It's still not much though. It's tough to really develop as a character when 85% of your voice lines are said to a (ridiculously adorable) droid who just beeps and boops back.",1702969425,1702969425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After ensuring the game is up to date, all drivers are up to date, and everything was setup to operate properly I am still getting under 30 FPS on this game consistently. This is ridiculous. I am going to uninstall this and wait for the modding community to fix it in a couple years.

Don't waste your money on this anytime soon. The performance issues destroy the experience.

Which is tragic. The game is a blast to play and the story has been great. I want to enjoy the experience though and I just can't. It is unfortunately a technical mess. I can't recommend it until something is done about the performance issues. 

8-29-2023: Nothing has changed since June. This game is broken and is still an unplayable mess. There has not been an update in over 2 months. Do not purchase this game. Not right now. 

When this works it is a fantastic game. If you enjoyed Fallen Order you will have fun with this one. 

The only issues with this game are technical. I don't know what's causing such an issue here a this point, but we are far past the acceptable point now. It has been 4 months. This game should have been functional at release. I can accept within the first month with how ridiculous releases have become. 4 months and people can't even open the game reliably for a game that cost how much to develop by one of the largest game companies in the world? 

This isn't worth it right now. This is ridiculous at this point. This is still not even getting into the fact you have to have an internet connection to play a ******* single player game. Whomever decided that deserves to lose their job. 

6-6-23: Not going to play this game anymore until things get fixed. I found a work around to allow me to launch the game consistently. You apparently need to launch it in the background and let it load into the main menu in the background because if you let it try to render the shaders as the active program it will immediately crash. 

I can't believe this was allowed to be sold in this condition. Being forced to be online for a single player game is still ridiculous. EA is awful. This game deserves better than this because when it isn't a buggy mess it's fun and the story is solid. 

If you're thinking about buying this, still don't. Wait for it to actually be fixed and completed.

5-23-23: This game is frustrating. The good parts are great, but it is not as much fun as the original so far. The technical issues have gotten a bit better since release but I am still randomly having single digit framerates during gameplay and cutscenes.

On top of that, the boss fights are generally lackluster. Currently in a super epic fight scene where everything is super dramatic and you know how it's going to go, but... you still have to work your way through a life bar, for no reason. Especially when it just dumps you back into the previous room with no options for leveling or improving your situation. You can only do this fight, with multiple cutscenes, from the beginning, with every single cutscene and QTE included with the same limited health bar and stimpaks. Didn't we leave this type of design behind 20+ years ago? 
Add in the fact that the technical issues plaguing this release are causing drops in frames to the single digits, making the precision defense and gameplay you must employ because of the limited nature of the fight, and you have an absolute recipe for disaster and a complete break in the natural flow of the game and story. I'm ready to just put this game down for the next few months because this isn't worth the frustration. Maybe It'll be better then and I can actually play and enjoy it then?

This game and series deserve better than this. This is just disappointing. Solid 4 out of 10 right now, rapidly dropping because of how disappointed I am.

_________

Short and sweet of it is this: This game was released with too many technical issues and modern DRM measures that make it difficult to recommend at this time right out the gate. I am livid about this and am considering a refund while I wait for things to change. Overall the game is enjoyable outside of these issues and I was really looking forward to continuing to play, but the issues outside of the gameplay are just... well... indicative of AAA PC gaming in 2023.

ETA: Patch came in, game no longer loads. DO NOT BUY THIS. At least, not until they fix the performance issues. This is absolutely absurd and unacceptable. 

Long Version:

I am not running into a lot of the big issues that are making the headlines right now. I am experiencing mostly 60 FPS in 1900 x 1080 but with regular excursions down to as low as 20 FPS on a system running a Ryzen 9 5000 series with an RTX 3080 and 32 GB of RAM. A consistent 60 FPS at this resolution shouldn't be difficult to achieve. I've experienced multiple crashes, including a crash right when launching the game for the first time after installation.

These issues, I'm sure, will get smoothed out with time and if they were the only ones I could deal with it. PC gaming relies too much on patching broken product in the months following release, and that's not going to change. 

My real big issue is with the EA App being required to be installed and operating with an internet connection in order to even launch the game, and the requirement that the game must be updated to the latest version to play. A single player game with no multiplayer options, requires an internet connection, a separate app with its own log in, and I have no option to play the game offline if an update is pending?

I travel a lot for work. I am in places with absolute garbage for internet connections monday through friday. Right now as I write this review I am being forced to wait to download a rather large patch over awful hotel wifi that is going to take around 4 hours to complete. Which means I don't get to play this game this evening for what feels like no reason. Not what I want to be dealing with after a 10 hour travel day dealing with airports losing luggage on a non-stop flight.

This isn't the fault of Respawn, this is EA and we all know it. I would ask EA to do better, but we know they won't.

This is just what we come to expect from PC Gaming in 2023, and it's a sad state of affairs. 

Gameplay is enjoyable and is a great continuation of what Fallen Order set us up with. The story and voice acting so far have been fun and I really enjoy the exploration and combat.

Fallen Order was a solid if somewhat hollow experience. It got all the little things right--the Star Wars flavor, the excellent cast, the well-paced story, and the exceptional production value--but it was let down by the nuts and bolts gameplay, which was trying to be a Dark Souls knockoff like every other game at the time.

In most ways, Respawn appears to have doubled down on both the positives and the negatives. The game looks stunning, especially the facial mocap (I've yet to see an alien as emotive and expressive as Greez in any other game), and the sound design is high quality. The visual design of the environments suffers a bit from that ""Disney"" look that the marvel and star wars movies both have these days--they really love that shimmering metal effect, as it's present everywhere both in this and in the GotG game. That's a matter of taste, though. I thought the main planet, Koboh, looked lovely, with verdant fields and dusty canyons aplenty. The sun-soaked desert of Jedha also looks quite nice, especially when a sandstorm rolls in.

However, looks aside, these semi-open worlds suffer from Ubisoft collectathon syndrome. There's tons of things to find, but almost none of them are worth exploring for. Typically you'll solve a puzzle or finish a difficult fight only to find a box with an ugly moustache in it. Or some paint colors for your robot buddy. 90% of the rewards in the game are cosmetics. The rest are useful but unexciting things like health and force meter upgrades. Every gameplay-changing piece of gear you get is obtained through the story, so taking time to go do sidequests is really only worthwhile if you want more shirts. Fortunately there are some pretty good shirts, and the customization is a lot better than in Fallen Order--it's not poncho city anymore.

There's plenty of platforming, and while none of it is very challenging--it largely follows the triple-A on-rails platforming conventions--it at least looks good and never overstays its welcome. Your aerial maneuverability feels great. Climbing is thankfully brief most of the time. There are several spectacular sequences where you have to leap through windy cliffs and dodge enemies.

Where things start to gradually fall apart is the combat system. Where the prior game was trying desperately to be dark souls, this one really wants to be God of War 2018. But it can't shake off the vestiges of the clunky, deliberately-paced Souls combat style. 

The majority of enemies have unblockable moves, and they like to spam them. Enemies don't take turns, so if you are fighting a group--which is almost always--then enemies can chain-spam unblockables and force you to either eat a bunch of hits or just back off with no way to deal damage. Crowd control options are weak and you don't even get the decent ones until very late in the game. The combat is designed around one-on-one saber duels, but the majority of fights are against upwards of three enemies. Like in Fallen Order, your lightsaber has been heavily nerfed, and it can take upwards of three unblocked hits to kill some basic enemies--and getting past their block can take another ten! You feel like you're fighting with a wiffle bat instead of a beam of plasma.

Yet even in the one-on-one fights where the combat should shine, problems plague the systems. The worst and most frustrating is the parry. The timings are actually quite generous, and an early or late press that would make you eat a hit in Sekiro will often act as though you parried precisely. The issue is that you can't animation cancel any of your moves (with one exception I'll discuss) into a block. This is a relic of the souls inspiration--you're committed to your attacks once you start them. However they all have huge windups, and enemies can hit you out of your attacks. This quickly turns into a shitshow because enemies can start up their own attacks after you begin yours, and hit you faster than you hit them. That means attacking at all feels completely random, and you will eat tons of damage just because the enemies decide to hit you out of a basic swing. Even more annoying, you can't parry every blaster bolt that comes at you (aside from another exception)--if you perfectly parry the first one, you're locked into a simple block animation for the rest that doesn't reflect the shots back. This means if you try to feather the button to reflect multiple shots, you will just get hit because the game thinks you've stopped blocking and you can't animation cancel the block into another parry.

What turns it from frustrating into enraging is that no enemies can be stunned out of their own hits. If an enemy starts winding up an attack and you cut in quickly to hit them, they'll simply complete the attack and bash you. Poise for me but not for thee is such an outrageous and disgusting combat model that I think it couldn't have been playtested heavily. There's no way anyone thinks it feels good. Hammering on the parry button only to watch your slow-ass attack get interrupted by an enemy who wasn't moving before you swung happens almost every fight.

The most baffling thing is that these problems are apparently intentional. The dual-wield stance DOES have animation canceling for the parry. I guess this is so that it feels unique? But locking a basic element of your combat system behind one of five stances is such an insane decision that again, I can't believe this was playtested. The multiple blaster parries thing is also ""fixed"" for the double-bladed stance, which will *automatically* parry multiple shots instead of blocking. It's like in a bid to make the stances feel more distinct, they wound up breaking the combat system for 4/5 of them in different ways. It's like if in DMC Dante could only start a juggle with one weapon, only do an aerial attack with another weapon, and only do a helm splitter with a third weapon--and you could only use two weapons at a time! Absolutely crazy. Play this with a mod to let you use all the stances, you'll have a somewhat less annoying time.

The combat is just broken on a fundamental level, and it really makes you appreciate how good the From Software games really are in this area. I hope for the third game, they really go back to basics and fix these issues. This could be a fast-paced, parry-heavy game that makes you feel like a god, instead of a clunky and slow clusterfuck that leaves you wondering what the devs were thinking.

The general difficulty is completely schizophrenic because of the busted combat. You'll cruise along for 2-3 hours having zero difficulty with fights only to come up against a wampa with trash hitboxes and a plethora of one-shot moves. The worst is a returning boss from the first game who was garbage there and is garbage here. Possibly one of the worst bosses ever designed. His whole appearance feels like a shitpost. I started on Jedi Grandmaster difficulty and got sick of the constant one-shots and broken parry, so I turned it down to Jedi Master and had a much better time. Not because the combat improved, but because I had enough health to just tank the inevitable hits and suck down heals in longer fights.

I really want to love this game. It does all the non-gameplay parts so right that it hurts when the combat and exploration let it down so badly. And the issues are fixable! Hell, they're probably even *patchable*. The whole thing doesn't need a redesign, just some tweaks and the addition of animation canceling. I don't have any hope for this one being fixed, but maybe the next one?

While I can't in good conscience give this a thumbs up because of these issues, I will still probably buy the third game. I like the story and characters, and it was starting to do some interesting stuff right before it abruptly ended. I just hope they fix the combat.",1702942852,1702942852,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

""optimising game files"" every single time after opening game. very annoying

I'm certainly not excusing the terrible launch state, and I'm not supporting this new trend of releasing undercooked games, but I'm not going to be taking the performance issues into account in my review. If anything, the issues should just be a reminder to us consumers that we shouldn't buy content without properly vetting what we're receiving. 

As for the actual game, I loved it. This is a very well executed sequel to an already spectacular title. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and this is coming from someone who isn't even a Star Wars fan. The lightsaber combat is satisfying, and the new ""stances"" system provides a good amount of variety. There are a wide range of new features and general improvements from the last title which just make the experience more pleasant across the board. One particular new feature I like is that the map has the ability to ""guide"" you to the main objective. Definitely a nice QOL addition. 

I got this game on sale, and I'm definitely happy with the purchase. Obviously, do your own research before buying, there's plenty of videos on YouTube to look at. While I enjoyed the title, everyone has their own preferences, and somethings that are non-issues to me, might be dealbreakers for you.

It's an automatic thumbs down until this gets patched.
UPDATE - After completion of the story and much of the side content
Yeah, the tech issues not only never got resolved, they got worse with multiple crashes in play session and even one crash that required me to restart my computer. The gameplay wasn't much better and has become overly obsessed with the platforming that was handled much better in the first title. It's a constant chore going through the levels, often multiple times in the story. There are strings of wire sliding, jumps, wall runs, grabbing ropes,etc and they're all tied together meaning you'll be doing them over and over to get past them and it grinds all the forward momentum of the story to a halt. As for the story, it's okay. It folds in elements of the High Republic era along with the Age of Rebellion and I admit I found myself much more interested in the High Republic era than I thought I ever would be. The thing is that the game ends right where it feels the story is at a half way point. There is also obviously a DLC that was cancelled because there are blacked out planets on the map that never get revealed. It was a decent story, but I feel like I only got part of it. If the developers cared enough to deal with the technical issues of this game, I'd recommend it. Obviously after this long they clearly aren't going to and that speaks volumes to their character. All this is such a shame after the first game brought the single player Star Wars experience back from the dead. I hope that they take the time and care to prevent this for the third entry. This is still a downvote for me. The constant technical issues and over reliance on timing action made it a chore to play and I had to step away at times just out of pure frustration.

I spent about 3 hours playing the intro area of the game. I actually had a great time, once I told windows to prioritize the game with my CPU (which cleared up all the glitchiness).

The game became UNPLAYABLE, and because I played for over 2 hours, STEAM would NOT refund me my money. So now i'm stuck with an unplayable broken game.

You'll have an unblockable attack coming simultaneous to two regular attacks you're trying to parry, all the while trying to avoid blaster fire from ranged enemies, all while you're trying to land a single hit where 4 of the 5 stances you'll unlock have un-cancellable attack animations. Attack windup, furthermore, is so slow, and the range of the lightsabers in most stances is perplexingly short. Arkham combat nailed group fights, because the game made certain that you were never in a situation where too many enemies were coming at you at once, and Batman could cover HUGE distances with single attacks. In Jedi Survivor, you'll be hit halfway through most of your attacks by enemies who start attacking AFTER you did, and you can't manage because EVERY enemy runs DIRECTLY toward you to stand within FEET of you and attack at the same time. Most enemies will take 5-6 standard hits on the Jedi Knight difficulty - you know, 5-6 hits from a lightsaber? The fantastical laser Excalibur? I know different stances are more or less ideal for different situations, but you can only have 2 to change between at a time, and can only swap those 2 for other stances at meditation points. I'm sure there's a reasonable and logical technical explanation as to why they COULDN'T just have all stances available to change between in some kind of radical radial menu (you know, like other games with more than 2 weapons), because the idea that they CHOSE not to is too baffling to be true.
If you want to forgo the lightsaber and utilise the many Force abilities, you'll be faced with a whole new set of problems. You just won't have the time to use any in group fights because, again, they take time and you will be SWARMED. My go-to strategies generally became standing atop ledges and using Confusion and BD's electric shock to turn enemies on each other - this means the game is more viable and less frustrating when it's playing itself.
One-on-one, specifically with saber-wielding enemies, it's stunning. I finished a lot of boss fights with a huge smile on my face. But when boss fights are 1% of your game, and the other 99% is bad combat and slow, laborious exploration, it isn't nearly enough.
In Star Wars, lightsaber fights were thrilling in part due to their simplicity: two sworn enemies would duel to the death with laser swords. When you think about lightsaber fights in all the Star Wars movies, they'll more often than not boil down to just that. Respawn chocked this game's combat so full of stuff. They could have gone simple, and made it excellent, but they made it complex, and none of it works.
If everything I'm saying makes you think ""It doesn't sound impossible, it sounds challenging"", and if that's your thing, then great, and I'm not going to say you're wrong. But I will warn you that it just isn't fun.
The lightsaber doesn't feel like a lightsaber, the Force doesn't feel like the Force.

This game is unforgivable, it has been over ***7 and a half MONTHS*** since it released, and the devs have done absolutely nothing to fix this garbage. This is the worst game i have ever played in my life and its not because of the content, because the game slaps. It is embarrassing for a game to be 70 fucking dollars and lag WHATSOEVER, for 70 dollars i expect Cal to personally come out of the screen and suck my dick. 

TLDR 2-Garbage game, steam release is a ploy to get you to buy the functional console versions. Shame on EA, i dont know what happened between this and the release of spore but they need to be ashamed.

original review-

this game is fantastic and you should not buy it.

This game is the absolute buggiest and most frustrating thing i have ever played in my life. This game is amazing, and i love almost everything about it, and everything is an upgrade from the original game. But dear fuck this game is the worst experience on a PC game i have ever had. The steam release is unfinished, Laggy, crash prone, and at times unplayable. 

I was so unbelievably excited for this game, and i adored fallen order. i gave this game all of my patience now, and i want to save you all the anger i went through with this crap.
I have a good graphics card, and this game crashes every. single. game session. this game has absolutely worn my patience, imagine playing for an entire hour and having the time of your life, and putting up with the stuttering and the lag, then it crashing and you needing to start over from the absolute beginning. this game is **NOT WORTH 70 DOLLARS.** 
I once played the same level quite literally, 6 times because it kept crashing. each time getting worse for my mental attitude towards this game. (if you have played darksouls or any souls game, you can imagine how detrimental a lag in a bossfight or any fight for that matter will ruin your game, this happens all the time.

the cutscenes will lag and crash during what would be the most tense part of the story and you dont and cannot see whats going on, and after it's over (given it doesn't crash), you will be lost and the magic of the scene is gone. on top of that, my controller sometimes won't connect to the game, not the computer, the game, it works on other games, just not this one, and you cannot play this game correctly without a controller.

you should play this game on PS5 or XBOX, if you loved the original fallen order, this game is great for you. the maps are gigantic, the graphics are beautiful, and the little tiny details MWAH, like different color lightsabers making different sounds, MWAH, you can CHOOSE your own lightsaber fighting style! UGH AMAZING, and the story *unlike the first one* can actually be played out because you dont know (unlike the first one) whats going to happen in the end.

Don't buy this on steam, it absolutely blows, i am not kidding you, don't buy this, even if you have the greatest computer in the world, it will not play properly, it is ***NOT*** ready for PC. what sucks is that it is better than it was when it was first released, and it's still unplayable. Buy it on a console so you can actually play the goddamn game.

Don't give your money to EA for this unfinished garbage port of an awesome game.

TLDR: fantastic game GARBAGE port, unplayable mess due to unoptimization don't waste 70 DOLLARS and DEFINITELY not 90 DOLLARS on something you cannot play.",1688756358,1702690627,False,4,0,0.520723640918731689,1,True,False,False

As The Sequel To STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™ It Does Have A Certain Bar It Had To Jump Over, And It Did Indeed Clear That Bar. Thankfully It Didn't Fall Into The Hole That Certain Sequels Do Where The Main Character Suddenly Has All Of Their Skills Reset And Proceeds To Just Throw The Old Skill Tree At You Again With Extra Steps. Plus Making Some Of The Maps Of This Game Open World As Opposed To The More Linear Design Of The Previous Title Allows For The Collectible Aspect Of The Game To Feel A Little Less Tedious.

That's Not Saying That The Game Was Ruined By This, Only That It Could've Used A Little More Work And Polish. Things Such As Some Of The Animations Feeling Very Choppy And How Most Of The Stances With The Lightsabers Tend To Handle Fairly Identically Thus Making It More Of A Visual Preference Rather Than Being Different Ways To Play The Game.

""Optimizing files"" every launch. Optimizing [i]what[/i] files?

Frequent micro stuttering & pop-in. For funsies I tried turning the graphics down to the absolute minimum, and resolution to 1600x900, and still experience this.

Combat mechanics are ""mushy"". The timings for block/parry are way off. There's a long wind up in all attack animations before damage is registered, no iframes, and no animation canceling. This makes Cal feel heavy and sloppy. A huge letdown from the light and precise Jedi we had in Fallen Order. But, every single hit taken staggers Cal. A lot. All you can do if you get hit is hope the enemies will have a break in their attacks so you can stand up, then hope the BD stim heals you before the next hit taken, Since you definitely won't get the time to block or dodge the next incoming attack and you can't animation cancel into avoiding the hit.

Incoming damage is the only real challenge to any of the fights. Taking a single hit is incredibly punishing, and going up or down in difficulty doesn't really change the damage very much, aside from story mode. The damage breakdown is roughly Grand Master (100%), Master (95%), Knight (90%), Padawan (85%), Story Mode (5%). Parry timing and enemy aggression are the same - no real difference unless you drop to story mode, in which case the parry timing is still really strange. And enemy aggression is basically ""a bunch of guys in storm trooper cosplay circling menacingly without shooting because blasters aren't real.""",1702616131,1702616131,False,5,0,0.502104401588439941,0,True,False,False

This game takes everything good about the previous game, and made it better, as well as widening the horizon - the characters are thoroughly enjoyable, the landscapes are fun to explore, combat is interesting, and the whole experience was amazing. Sure, some of the ""plot twists"" were quite obviously coming, but others took me seriously by surprise, which is not so common in games these days and is commendable. 

I am really looking forward to the next installment.

that being said: the game is a massive upgrade from the first in every way it matters, exploration has been vastly expanded and there are TONS of nooks to go hunting for all sorts of treasures within, combat is much the same as the first game with an impressive amount of expanse enabling you to really carve out your own niche style of fighting and as far as I can tell, there are still even more talent trees to be unlocked.
the open world is H U G E and beautiful and just wills you on to keep looking to see what is around the next bend, cave or building.

I'm running an NVIDIA GTX 4060 and a RYZEN 5600x cpu and haven't had any actual issues worth complaining about, however my tolerance for stuff like pop in and textures taking a second to load is quite high, however for what it is worth, I've not actually noticed much of either and the game's been running at a solid & consistent 60+ fps.I will say however the AI (mostly the fauna of Koboh) has some moments where it just acts really goofy, much like the first game if you are just outside of an animals preferred arena they'll start almost pacing back in and out of their preferred fighting area until you get back within the confines they'd most like to fight you in, the spiders of Kashyyk from Fallen Order did the same thing iirc, not a huge deal but does impact immersion.
I'm not actually far enough in to even begin to actually understand what this game fully intends to be or is, however, as a review based off of initial impressions; it is really quite exceptional, I understand the game had some serious performance issues and I understand how disappointing that must have been, especially for a title that oozes as much potential, promise and excitement as the Cal Kestis games.

idk about anyone but after falling in love with Fallen Order my excitement for the story these games are telling skyrocketed and hearing/seeing how broken the game could be both at launch and six months afterwards was rather disappointing, there is no good reason why it'd of taken as long as it did to resolve these issues, however I'd also point out it isn't like Fallen Order is a perfectly performing game either, still to this day it has a fare share of performance issues and I'm not saying this to excuse the state both games launched in, mostly just making sure new comers to the series understand what they're getting into.
amazing games but they can unfortunately often times be quite problematic.

I'll update this review once I've beaten the game and seen/done everything I've wanted to, but so far, yeah I would recommend giving it a try (especially if it is on sale as its full price is incredibly steep) doubly so if you've felt the latest Disney content to be rather lacking, Cal's story really does hit all the notes of a good and well thought out star wars saga.

Update: since writing this initial review I've since beat the game twice & jesus, what a sequel Jedi Survivor is, not only have Respawn doubled down on the movement based exploration mechanics, they absolutely blew it out of the park, refined movement and expanded mid air mechanics that enable the player to close massive gaps while maintaining tons of momentum, BD-1 being an absolutely essential tool for exploration as well as a much needed friend, not to mention he also has some very helpful tools for combat.
which you will often need because not only are there a bunch of rumours to go investigate that can be overheard in the Reach, there are also a bunch of different interesting and lovely side characters to discover, it's just a shame that more wasn't done with them and that they didn't get as much focus as I felt they deserved.
as for the new stances I loved and used them all pretty extensively aside from the blaster stance, some people say it is one of if not the most powerful stance in the game and I can't help but disagree, there is a blaster parry ability that is quite strong but I never once managed to find a situation in which I felt that it'd be easier to make it through a section with it, mainly down to how unattractive and I think neutered the moveset is, the added range and ability to stun targets does nothing for you when the range you have to keep in order for it to be usable are too great to get follow up lightsaber strikes in.
honestly it felt a bit under-baked. the four other stances however, especially crossguard are exceptionally well done and crossguard on it's own is almost a mandatory thing for two of the most important boss fights in the game.

I won't spoil the story but I loved it except for some specific things towards the end, and, that I wish it could have gone a bit further in depth into a certain friends back story, don't get me wrong the story, just like the game, are far from perfect and there definitely are some things that obviously could have been done better, still an 8.5-9/10 game, I just wish one specific character got more explanation.

as for performance, I had two crashes, one playing holotactics and the other after landing a double jump onto an elevator.
the game runs well and I've got a RTX 4060 & an AMD 5600x cpu, however without running DLSS it would stutter ever so slightly when running into a new area or when the camera would pan towards a grand, awe-inspiring shot of whatever natural/man-made marvel it is you're going to investigate, it never should have launched in the state is was in though and for that I'd have to bring my scoring of the game to an 8 max.
why EA feels it is acceptable to launch games in that state I will never know, as said before fallen order had and still has many of the same issues as jedi survivor and had an equally rough release, they'd (as in EA and Respawn) would get so much more positive press if they'd just release a genuinely functional game, especially when it is as highly anticipated as this one.

if it's on sale, it is a no brainer, even if it isn't on sale the game is still worth it however I do understand why someone would chose another title and hold off to grab it at a discount.",1700726028,1702528408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No settings had been changed beforehand and new upgrades were acquired several hours before the issue started occurring. Rebooted PC, installed fresh updates, reinstalled graphics drivers, tweaked nVidia control panel settings for the game, installed the Nexus mod to increase performance, set everything to low and prioritized max performance, and even fucked my hz and framerate to try to line up with 30 fps, but none of those things worked. 

I've gone through like 2 hours of ingame time of just logging in, checking to see if *anything* improved, and changing another thing that *might* help alleviate the issues, but I feel like EA absolutely lied about their PC spec requirements for this game.

 No matter what I do now, the game freezes every couple seconds. Sometimes it’ll stay frozen for 10 seconds, other times for half a second.

I updated drivers, did a clean re install of the game and the ea app, checked my device for issues, and nothing helped. 

Other games are running perfectly fine. I can run Cyberpunk at 90+ FPS with the settings all the way up and RTX on. 

Do not buy this game until you are sure these kinds of issues aren’t present anymore. I got the game for almost half off and still feel scammed.

Cal is no longer afraid of who he is and wants to help rebuild the Jedi order but there is a lot of work to be done and a lot of people in his way.

Sadly a poor launch filled with really bad optimization and a lot of bugs might have scared some people off from trying this game again but I can tell you it's definitely worth it now. It's still a hard game to run and you will encounter small bugs from time to time like enemies clipping through the ground or wall but nothing game breaking and thankfully I didn't encounter any problems during the ""bigger"" moments of the game.

Its story goes through all the emotions with you and ultimately is a great successor to Fallen Order. Your crew, the villains, enemies, lore, planets, and so much more will have your days turning to nights irl in no time. You can get lost just looking at the beauty this game holds, I've never taken so many in game screenshots before but some of the views in this game just blow you away, and I'm not talking cutscenes or photo mode stuff, literally just walking around you'll stop and go ""holy crap, this is beautiful"" out loud.

The soundtrack needs no long sentence, it's Star Wars, it delivers. You won't be hearing too many themes from the original movies which I actually didn't mind before this isn't those movies, this is a new character, a new time, and a new story. That said, listen closely in big moments and you might catch a thing or two.

My favorite part about Jedi Survivor as a sequel is the planets. In Fallen Order I felt that the planets weren't well made, they weren't made for you to explore instead to just move along the main story. In this game it isn't like that at all. Between collectables, side missions, lore, beauty, and much more the main planets are massive with so much to do and explore. 

As well the additions to customization and the combat were also well done. I won't spoil what they are, for that you'll have to play, explore, and defeat some enemies.

From gaining new perks, powers, and strengths as Cal and shedding some tears in the story to meeting new friends and seeing some old ones along the way, this was a great sequel that I couldn't have enjoyed more through my 65 hours and basically 100% completion.

I highly recommend this game if you like Star Wars, open world/action-adventure games, liked Fallen Order, or just want to be a Jedi.",1702508092,1702508092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now it is not fair to this game to give it a negative review in a way, because it is great, from a game play perspective. But considering how unstable it is, and the amount of time it takes to ""optimize"" every time you boot it up... It's clearly not doing a good job of it. It's Unreal engine so I'm guessing it's simply pre-caching here but every single time?! and without changing any drivers.

First time it crashed was during the introduction so it ended up with me having to go through all the pre-settings of HDR and RTX effects etc. Now I am going to mention here, that I have Ray Tracing ON, and run with HDR and these things MAY be what causes it to be so unstable.

But the simple fact that this is a game that you cannot save at will, you will need to reach a save point to do so, if it crashes constantly just because it's so unstable and so often, makes it nearly unplayable on PC.

It's a pity, because it is otherwise a fantastic game and a sequel to Fallen Order in about 500% more massive scale.",1702504967,1702504967,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was the game I was looking forward to most this year. My heart sank a little bit when I woke up on release day and saw the terrible reviews due to performance.

I decided to hold off buying until I saw some more stability checking in with the recent reviews with each patch. Bought the game a few months later but didn't bother playing it until 7.5 patch in which the reviews seem a bit more favourable.

I don't have insane specs. In fact I play on a razer laptop with a 3070 so not even the fully powered one. For these type of games I tend to use my old steam link and play in my living room which has 1080p/60 fps cap. The TV upscales to 4k.

I was pleasantly surprised. I had a pretty much a solid 60 fps with some occasional exceptions like overseeing the entirety of the main area of Kobho when you first arrive. There were the occasional game play problems but completely live with-able. These issues were

For some reason when using the holodeck to select a planet to travel to my frames dropped to like 10-15. I was fine with this since its only used for a few seconds at a time to travel.

Occasionally when playing a force echo in which the characters appear, it would only render their hair for some reason. Dialogue was fine though.

Sometimes I would try to access BD mode to use a dart to open a door to proceed but it would not let me as it bugged out and thought I was in combat when I was not and was certain no one was about. This was my main annoyance as I had no other way other than throwing myself off a cliff so I'd re-spawn. After this it worked fine but at times with lower health and no stims left a bit of a pain.

Only a couple of occasions, the game would randomly for some reason change to a small resolution. Not sure if this was the game or just my computer acting up but haven't experienced it in any other game.

But overall once I got past those problems I really enjoyed the game. Combat was fun and really enjoyed the story. Wouid recommend overall now and hopefully will still see improvements as patches come out.",1702503756,1702503756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]UPDATE:[/b]
They mostly fixed the poor performance and bugginess, so I'm changing my review to a recommend. This in no way excuses the state of the release of this game, which I think was an abhorrent and very anti-consumer decision in an industry where public opinion can make or break your game's success. Given the popularity of the Star Wars IP, and the fact that this is a sequel to an established and successful game, AND that the gameplay itself is so incredible, there is no doubt that a delay would have effected this game's success. In fact I think a delay would have made this game wildly more popular than it already is.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor feels like a significant improvement of Jedi: Fallen Order in almost every way, and a majority of issues I had with Fallen Order I didn't not experience in Survivor. 
[list]
[*]The controls and combat have been significantly smoothed out and feel far more natural and responsive. 
[*]Cal's new abilities complement the gameplay without forcing you to play in a certain way. 
[*]Movement felt smoother and some new movement options were cool.
[*]And the over use of creatures and animals as enemies (that really pissed me off) in Fallen Order was significantly reduced.
[*]To name a few.
[/list]

[h2]Story[/h2]
The story in Jedi: Survivor is up there as one of my favourite stories in a video game with the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2, Titanfall 2, and Cyberpunk: 2077. The story in Fallen Order was already really good and Respawn just turned the dial up to 11 with the writing. There's nothing much else to say about the story other than that it was excellent, exciting, and extremely well written. The writers deserve a huge bonus.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
As mentioned, I felt as though the combat was much better in Survivor compared to Fallen Order; everything felt smoother and more responsive, and I felt even more badass than in the previous game. To be honest, I didn't really care much for Cal's new lightsaber stances, I mostly used single blade, dual wield, and the double-sided blade only and didn't think the other stances were very exciting. However, I can see where people will have fun with a more diverse range of combat styles compared to Fallen Order and it was still fun none-the-less.

[h2]Exploration[/h2]
Although Jedi: Survivor is a far bigger game than Jedi: Fallen Order, I felt somewhat underwhelmed by the exploration in Survivor compared to its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the planets are so cool and Kaboh could almost be an open-world game in itself, but I felt as though a lot of the planets felt the same compared to the diverse range of planets in Fallen Order like Kashyyyk and Dathomir. Regardless, the planets in the game are still fun to explore and there are so many hidden treats throughout them.

[h2]PC Optimisation[/h2]
I purchased this game in November, 2023 when most of the significant PC optimisation bugs where squashed. For reference, I am running an i9 11900K, RTX 3080, and 32GB of RAM and faced no game crashes or freezes during my entire gameplay. I ran the game at 1440p on high settings (V-SYNC on, DLSS off) and achieved a framerate of about 65 - 80fps with dips below 65 being somewhat common. Micro-stutters and little freezes were very common though with the game often stuttering or lagging whenever I entered a new room or had to render a different part of the map, however, this didn't impact my gameplay too significantly, but your preferences for game smoothness may be different to mine.

[h2]Summary (written by ChatGPT)[/h2]
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor improves upon Jedi: Fallen Order in various aspects. Controls and combat are smoother and more responsive, addressing previous issues. New abilities enhance gameplay without restricting play style. Movement is enhanced with cool options. The overuse of creatures as enemies is notably reduced. The story rivals top games, marked by excellent writing. Combat in Survivor feels superior, with enhanced smoothness and responsiveness. The expanded game size, despite impressive, slightly underwhelms in exploration compared to Fallen Order. PC optimisation, experienced on a high-end system, showed minimal issues, with occasional micro-stutters. Overall, Survivor excels in gameplay, story, and combat.",1702383169,1702383227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From a story-wise perspective there's nothing much to say, a nearly perfect sequel to Fallen Order which includes things about the new canon and the High Republic Era (if you don't know about that check it out, you will not get disappointed). Yes, they could have been more creative about the incipit of the story, but it's not really a problem.
Obviously being the middle title in a trilogy it's a build up for the third chapter, and you can notice that especially towards the end.

Gameplay-wise it's far more action oriented than the predecessor with more lightsaber stances and Force powers. It has more fast-paced combat while still maintaining the derivations from Sekiro and its identity. Better and iconic boss fights with totally differents and fun movesets. It also contains more metroidvania moments and has a small but ideal number of “small” planets and a HUGE main planet (I think it's big like all of Fallen Order)

While it's a really bad porting, they tried improving it (even if when I tried every patch it never changed anything so idk) it will be a real shame to miss this game, the best in the Disney Star Wars era (duh, looking at you Battlefront) and probably one of the best across the franchise (At least top 5, KOTOR and Dark Forces will always be better).
At least give it a try and if you don't feel it's right for you request a refund, you will not lose anything.",1700600577,1702322960,True,11,0,0.554261326789855957,0,True,False,False

I'm still encountering small bugs like the charged shot not always working and the EA launcher breaking stopping me from running the game without reinstalling it.

If these issues were fixed the game would be incredibly good. It expands on all the elements of the first game in good ways, and your power carries on from the first game. This means you feel more like a Jedi with powers like force push and pull from the start. The story is also one of the best I've seen in a star wars game.

I still have a few small gripes with how they script the climbing and restrict movement in some areas. The combat feels better but it still occasionally has weird timing on parries and attacks too.

Overall a fun game that is absolutely worth playing but with the bugs and performance issues I would not buy it at the £60 it currently is a full price. It is worth it if you can get it on sale though.",1702322138,1702322138,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Jedi: Survivor borrows a lot from Dark Souls frustrating combat system without taking any of the elements of Dark Souls that made it somewhat enjoyable to a non-niche consumer.

This game is frustrating.  If you get frustrated with Dark Souls, you will get frustrated with this game.  If you do not think Dark Souls is fun, you will likely not think this game is fun.  It has a definitively not fun play style.  Unfortunately, they slapped a pretty sweet Star Wars skin over it so it is fairly hard to resist, especially in a market where there are no good Star Wars games being made and EA has a monopoly on Star Wars content.  Thank you dear baby Jesus for taking away EA's exclusivity, may the future be brighter.

The story itself is good, the level design is unbelievably good, the graphics are great if your PC runs it, and it has a new game plus mode which I always love, but this is all shit on by the Dark Souls like combat that really makes it not fun.  If you are hoping for a revival of the old Jedi Knight (Outcast, Jedi Academy) games, this is not it, do not buy this game with hopes that you will have an experience as amazing as those games, you will be extremely disappointed.

If you absolutely must buy this game because it is Star Wars, wait for a deep discount.  IMO this game is probably an okay purchase for $20, for this price I think you have a chance of enjoying this game even if you completely hate the core game-play loop.  

For those of you who are unaware of the Dark Souls combat system and why some people do not think it is fun I will summarize here.
1) The controls are not tight, the characters movement feels sloppy.  It is more akin to guiding the character vs controlling the character.
2) You can hit enemies as many times as you want with your light saber, it does not stun them.  Most enemies have attacks that are faster than your most basic combos, so the combos are really kind of pointless.  You have a few attacks that can stun some enemies, but using those attacks generally leaves you completely open to attacks for a long time.  
3) Every hit stuns you.  You cannot control your stun recovery.  If you get hit, every enemy on screen can still hit you while you are stunned, there is no limit to how many times you can be hit.
4) The counter system is cool in 1-on-1 combat scenarios, however if you miss a single block, the enemies stun gauge resets.  If you do stun an enemy, they will recover after the first hit in your combo and if you started the second attack in the combo, they will hit you and you will be stunned.  Every time.
5) You cannot cancel any attacks that have begun.  So in a game that is built around countering and dwindling down enemy guard meters, you are best left dodging and doing a single quick attack.   Stepping back.  Dodging, single quick attack.  Rinse repeat till credits roll.

Some people like combat such as this, but to consider the Dark Souls play style to be anything other than niche, is just not being honest.",1702315186,1702315186,False,2,0,0.478878229856491089,2,True,False,False

STORY:

We basically got what we wanted: an interesting continuation of Cal's journey 5 years after the events of Fallen Order. No spoilers here, as you have to experience it yourself and then rate it. I give the story an 8/10.


PLATFORMING AND MOVEMENT:

Huge improvement. Travelling around the map is alot easier than Fallen Order's. The verticality may be confusing sometimes, as some objectives blend in or may require you to go a very specific path to reach places. Same thing, no spoilers. It's 10/10


COMBAT:

The difficulty of this game is 3x harder than Jedi Fallen Order's. Enemy attacks are unintuitive and sometimes hard to read. For a souls-like game it's a good thing though. We have 5 different combat styles and all are universally good for specific situations, and you can change them to fit your current needs. I did my first playthrough on Grandmaster difficulty, and this time it really requires Sekiro level of concentration, except the enemies have almost no set rythm when fighting them, making it a pain dealing with especially droids. 7/10 for me, as some parts of the story were almost impossible on the highest difficulty.


CUSTOMIZATION:

A big improvement, as in Fallen Oder you could only customize the poncho and cal's scrapper outfit color. Here, we have many different outfit sets, and most of them look good. You can change Cal's hair and beard now aswell, and also have more customization options, like changing how polished your lightsaber is, or color specific parts of your saber to a different color. They definitely listened to the feedback regarding this section. 10/10


GRAPHICS:

Optimization aside, if you play on mostly highest settings, the game looks stunning. I played on an RTX 3070 Ti paired with i5 10400f on 1440p with high settings. The fps were acceptable; stable 47-70 fps. Ignoring optimization, this gets a 10/10. If we take the fps drops into account though, I would give it a 7/10.


OVERALL RATING

I give Jedi: Survivor a 9/10. It exceeded my expectations, since not many games deliver a good sequel. I recommend the game, but not for 60$. Wait until a sale drops, then buy it. You won't regret it.",1702303563,1702303563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Time has passed so I thought I would give it another go and can report that as of today and patch 7 I have been having a blast. Performance is much improved, the introduction of DLSS a godsend. It's not perfect but looking back neither was Fallen Order.


Old...

This is frankly awful. From the first stuttering logo you are presented with a warning that it runs better with a controller - and yes using the keyboard sucks, for a start dodge is bound to TAB that only someone with 3 hands could use in conjunction with the ASAD keys, and yes using a mouse also sucks because there appears to be some kind of acceleration or smoothing applied which cannot be turned off and mouse sensitivity also changes depending on whats going on on screen (though this may just be the tanking frame rate). The menus cannot be navigated properly with just a mouse - where players are forced to select options with the mouse and then use key combos to change the options and apply them. Trying to use the in game map is also a nightmare because again the controls are completely unintuitive (have any of the devs ever used a mouse and keyboard?) 

Once in game the performance tanks, I thought I would be on the safe side and start with medium settings all around but even with that and a 2080 super, an 8 core cpu, 3000MB/sec SSD and 32GB RAM it was a bit of a slide show. FSR does not work either, and regardless of what settings are applied the overall image is extremely soft. As you probably know there is no DLSS, using Nvidias in built driver image scaling does however work, just, but not enough to make the game enjoyably playable.

As a fan of the first game this is hugely disappointing to say the least, I have been waiting for this release eagerly and am honestly thinking about getting a refund, regardless of whether or not they patch it to work.

the thing is, the game is genuinely incredible. super emotional story about running away and being pushed to the brink and all the characers are SO well written. i kept thinking that i beat the final boss and then a new twist would happen that made my jaw drop, and it made for some of the most hype moments and the most gut wrenching emotional scenes i've ever played in a game. all the clone wars stuff especially connected with me, since i grew up with it- specifically the ""Clone Wars"" tentacle guy, it was so cool to see one of those again after all these years

on top of that, the combat feels so smooth and responsive with so much room for player expression with all the stances and upgrades. and the game just KEEPS GOING with more planets and they're all superbly designed... the issue is that the whole time, cutscenes are hitching constantly, audio desyncs with animations, models are just slightly misaligned, and of course the game runs terribly on all of the big planets.

the biggest surprise for me was that i stopped caring about collectibles because i found an outfit, saber, and blaster that i liked, so i ended up skipping all those in postgame and just focused on side quests. i dont know if thats a positive or a negative

def worth playing if you can run it, but if you can't, steer clear

I have a 3090, I9-11900K and an equally impressive motherboard w/32gb of ram. So this PC is no slouch, but I've reached below 30fps while exploring the open world at Epic settings, with barely any change playing with quality settings to find a sweet spot.

Technical:

A lot of frametime stutters in almost all locations ESPECIALLY Koboh. I played on a 5800x and a 4080 and got good framerates with dlss + frame gen on highest settings and ray tracing in 1080p (around 120-180 average except on Koboh where it was around 70-100 fps ). This seems fine but the problem is the horrendous frametime inconsistencies all over the game making it impossible to get a consistent and smooth experience. Loved the first game as I played it long after its release meaning the fps and smoothness of the game was good and had really nothing to complain about. 

Played on patch 7 and had around 10 crashes but no major gamebreaking bugs or glitches. 

2/10 

Story:

Really enjoyed the story nothing to complain for me was fun, planets where beautiful enjoyed the different stances even though I did not use some to much. The saloon was also a nice addition to the game even though I did not spend to much time in it. 

8.5/10

TLDR:
As of patch 7 ---- You will never have a smooth experience but if that does not matter to much and it is not horrendously bad get it but only when it is on SALE.

Score: 6/10

STEAM PLEASE ADD SO THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE THIS GAME A POSITIVE REVIEW PLEASE MAN. MAKE IT SO I CAN GIVE THIS A 6/10. HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE.",1702236127,1702236163,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Still no apology or explanation as to why the launch on this platform was nothing less than disastrous. EA have got our money and they don't care. I stand by my original review below as to how brilliant the story and gameplay are, unfortunately the performance has completely ruined what a lot of us were waiting four years for, and paid good money for. Only purchase this on console if you can. Guess I've got to watch the YouTube movie of cut-scenes to find out what happens on Tanalor now?)

First, let's address the elephant in the room- the game's performance. Like most of us on here, I absolutely adored Fallen Order and could not wait to explore the next chapter in the story. Despite the initial negative feedback surrounding the game's release, curiosity and spoiler fear finally got the better of me and I just went for it. The lagging started during the superb Coruscant intro, but was never quite bad enough to put me off. ""Perhaps the game is just settling itself in"", I naively thought. 
Enter Koboh. The frame stuttering went into overdrive, and Cal would often fall through solid floors into inescapable positions, forcing me to close the game. Two or three patches/weeks later, I returned and started the game from scratch to see things had only marginally improved. Ignoring my better judgement, I pushed on with the game through my sheer love for the story and characters. The stuttering actually improved once on Jedha, as well as on the Shattered moon and Nova Garon. However I would constantly dread having to return to Koboh's large, open areas where the performance drops off a cliff edge. All whilst having the graphics on the lowest settings. Fallen Order played beautifully on max settings on my trusty Nitro 5, and the graphics on Survivor aren't particularly superior in any way. The worst bug of all arrived at the worst possible moment- Cal appeared as a different (and very important) character during a crucial cutscene, completely ruining what was supposed to be the most emotionally charged moment of the game. Inexcusable. 

After almost completing the main story, the latest patch has now prevented me from having enough disk space to continue and finish the final boss fight. So here I am, uninstalling the game with no idea of what happens in the end, with the vague hope of revisiting it in a year or two when the PC port has finally got it's act together. As far as I am aware, EA/Respawn have issued no apology whatsoever as of yet, which is a rubbish way to repay loyal fans and customers to be frank. You guys had four years to make a game that functions...

A quick, separate review of the game itself: in a nutshell, superb. The gameplay and combat have improved massively upon the original, in particular when it comes to the new lightsaber stances and the wider variety of enemies. The dual-wield and crossguard stances are particularly fun to use. The different planets and space stations are wonderfully crafted. I especially enjoyed the beautiful shattered moon with it's moving asteroid fields. Perhaps my only gripe here would be that too much focus went into Koboh, leaving the other planets feeling a little rushed and empty. A ""return to Coruscant"" mission, perhaps to the old jedi temple ruins for example, would have been great and could easily have been integrated into the plot. The neat little stealth section on Nova Garon should also have been in the first half of that planet, before Cal unleashes all hell. Despite it's unnecessarily big size, Koboh really is stunning and the puzzles within the old republic chambers add a nice touch, as does the lucrehulk rescue mission.

The story is solid throughout, with the main plot twist being a stroke of genius. The character arcs of each of the Mantis crew members follow fascinating and entirely logical courses, and the romance between two certain characters adds emotional intensity and complexity to everything that is going on. The main boss villains are, like in Fallen Order, always challenging and charismatic in their own ways. Dagan does feel a little out of place visually, with a hairdo that belongs in a Kojima or Final Fantasy type game. But the whole sub-plot with him and Santari was a nice and refreshing way of expanding Star Wars lore and blended in well with Cal's story.

Fallen Order was the best thing to happen to Star Wars since Rogue One- the raw emotion and classicism of the original movies, combined with the spectacle and non-stop action of the prequels. Likeable characters, a complex antagonist and the feeling that you are literally immersed in this universe. Star Wars distilled to perfection. Survivor's challenge lay in continuing this standard whilst expanding possibilities and opening new doors (The Last Jedi tried and failed spectacularly in this regard). I am happy to say that Respawn have done a great job, and in many ways have outdone themselves. I just wish I could have played this one right through to the end.

Final verdict: Magnificent game and a fitting sequel to a modern classic. But DO NOT BUY for at least another few months or longer, until the PC port issues are resolved. And please, Respawn, please-  don't make us wait another four years for number three!",1690240322,1702233729,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Spoiler next sentence** It would have been better imo for Dagen to backstab instead** as to flesh out his character more, and i hate children, so screw the song they sing, ghost star or whatever the heck it is is so annoying.
I found the worlds alright (Jedda = dub, Coruscant = dub but rather boring area excluding the intro area. A place we had seen in the Prequels or clone wars or the like would have been cool, Tanallor was lackluster, Koboh is a waste of time. In fallen order, I really loved Kashyykk, Illum and Darthomir, Bogano gave off Koboh VIBEZ but worse so yeah. The worlds in general were rather small apart from the big 2 which had shitty obnoxiously open areas.

Fuck them plants. Fuck them currencies, I want to only deal with chests, not random coins and shards and tiny things to spend. I loved scoova though, he a real one, but where is his hyperdrive??? Lukerholk was cool but Venator was cooler in first game on whatever world that was.

Once more, FUCK BODE's DAUGHTER. Hope she suffocates in space or something.

It would have been cooler to see more of Cal with Jaro Tapal, but alas. Also, him going from an escapee on a pod to a scrapper would have been cool.

Merrin is wifey material on god so W Cal moment pulling her. Probably only one of the few good female protagonists in current pop culture.

I did 100% fallen order on xbox without any difficulty or googling locations/what to do etc. I was stumped a couple times in this game, especially with the plants having wisps that are green on green so my colourblind ass looks over them. (Sidenote, I hate people picking ancient on premier for that reason), I needed to do cruddy farming and waiting to get the plant area. I did in general need all the holomap upgrades to unlock everything and all those random shards and crap, making it far more efficient to tick off each area/world to 100%.

Holotactics was a very cool gamemode and fun for a sidemode, but a guide/roshambo tactic list would have been nice, I just spammed the scorpion dude and AT-ST to beat most rounds.

There are still game breaking bugs, glicthes a plenty and a host of performance issues. Fortunately most can be fixed or mitigated. If you want to run it on max graphics you need a beast of a machine. Oh and it takes about 5 minutes to launch for pretty much everyone.. 

Still underneath it all is a good game. I think Fallen Order was a little better. It definitely had better pacing.
Combat sometimes feels worse for the simple reason that Respawn does not really know how evading works. Souls-like games almost universally know that if the player presses dodge, you dodge regardless of what you were doing. Most of the time anyway. In Jedi Survivor not so much. If you are in the middle of an attack animation you will not move an inch until said animation is finished. Stupid I know. It does the same thing with blocking. Took me a long time to stop making 3 attacks because by the time the third one was half way through its animation I would get slapped in the face. 
So, 2 attacks - wait - parry - 2 attacks - wait and so on. 

All in all. A good game that has seemingly had the standard EA post launch funding of pennies on the dollar. If you want Star Wars then wait for a sale, get it for 50% or lower and be prepared for plenty of fun but with more glitches and bugs than a $70 game has any right to have.

I Initially avoided Jedi Survivor due to the controversy surrounding its performance at launch. After having performance issues with Hogwarts and The Last of Us at the start of the year, I decided to pass on this.

Having been disappointed by Starfield, I needed a game to fill the Science-Fiction shaped hole that game left me with so I picked Jedi Survivor up on sale. I can say performance seems to be a lot better now compared to its launch state. I average 128 FPS on full Ultra with the above specs. There is still some lag when the game tries to transition from the game into a cutscene, so often, the first few seconds of a cutscene is ruined as it tries to catch up.

I never finished the first game as I was foolish and thought I could do it on the hardest setting on my first try. This time around I went for the normal difficulty and the game still provides a solid challenge. The combat is incredibly fun and I'm loving the new stances. The customisation is also improved and I have Cal looking like some fancy Victorian Ninja with a Samurai style lightsaber XD.

I'm yet to finish it as I've been distracted by other games, but I find it to be one of those games that's very easy to jump back into after some time away which is rare for me.

+ Nice power from BD ! but sometimes, used two much (one times is cool, second time is Ok, third time is f... annoying (bno spoiler here ;) 


On the ""Cons"" side
+ Boss combat is very difficult from the very first , the mecanism to downgrade the difficulty is more than welcomed for dudes like me, no way I pass some bosses in a mode different from ""Story""
+ On Steam, I finished the game WITHOUT a single achievement popping ... this does not feels right 
+ On Steam PC : I lost the PS COntroller Icons because of a steam upgrade, hanks to the community to gezt them back 
+ Powers from the skill tree feels useless against bosses 
+ Confusion is a great tree but a tremedous lot of adversaries are droids ;) 
+ To many times, the difficulty of the fight is the number of adversaries , and the targetting mechanism is faulty to me, force powers works again basic troopers or droids, not big guys (droids and raiders) 

Overall very good game polluted by stupid annoyances which are easy to fix or remove 
Plus the trophy stuff totally bugged on steam and the shader optimization poppin at EACH start, not to mention that the game do not detect a GeForce 3070Ti .... weird

The game is absolutely gorgeous and one of the best looking games out at this moment. The combat is the same as Fallen Order just better and more refined in every way. The open Castlevania esq world is fantastic and very well done. The extra combat stances are very well done and all of them are viable and fun and have a lot of good variety to their playstyles.

Single Saber Stance: The most used and iconic stance. Balanced with middle defense attack speed etc. If you want a stance thats a jack of all trades master of none type then this is the stance to choose. It has a lot of attack variety with jumps dashes throws and combos and is good for single and medium sized groups.

Double-Bladed Stance: If you want to take on large groups and be a flurry of death like Darth Maul then this is your stance. Some don't like this stance, but if your against a lot of blaster fire there is no better stance than this with its ability to deflect all blaster fire to everyone in the area. This stance is fast paced with the best defensive ability in the game. It is very fluid with how you can change attack combos at anytime and essentially have an aoe around you when you attack due to the extra range of a dual bladed saber whipping around your body.

Dual Wield Stance: This is a pure offensive high risk high reward stance with a low defensive ability. However it makes up for its lack of defense from its raw power and force parry ability. In the beginning before you upgrade it can be a little lackluster, but once you start getting some skill points into it it becomes a weapon of mass destruction able to contantly throw your saber on repeat. It  has an amazing attack combo variety that will let you deal with any size of group effectively once you master this stance.

Cross Guard Stance: The Kylo Ren. This stance along with the blaster stance are the most unused stances unfortunetly. Not because they are bad just have a much higher learning curve to them. This stance is very powerful and great for any enemy with a higher guard as it can decimate someones guard in just a few swings including some bosses. Now this stance is slow and has a small combo, but it makes up for it by having a great defense and the ability to stun, knockback, or even smash certain enemies in the ground. This stance is best for single and small groups of enemies however with its wide sweeping arcs even larger groups will fall at your feet. Now this stance will take some getting used to since it is so much slower to use than any other stance. If you favor parries and high damage this would be the better stance for you.

Blaster Stance: The bounty hunting Jedi we've always wanted. Okay this stance is a literal blast with how you can blast your enemies in the face with a gun along with being able to fire your blaster during your saber combos dealing extra damage. You'll need to do a little bit of micro managing with this stance since you only are able to build up blaster shots is by hitting people with your saber WHILE USING THIS STANCE. The playstyle is more akin to using a rapier sword, its a fast stance with lower defensive ability, but you have a blaster so shoot the weakling in the face widdle their numbers down hit and run build your blaster shots up until your left with a more managable enemy group size. The main downside to this stance is that the force saber abilities are replaced with blaster fire instead and to get better charge shots you need to complete all the bounty hunting missions which at this time are bugged as hell to the point you cant actually get the pucks to buy those skills.

Bugs: Jedha is very unoptimzed and will be the main point of the game where the  game will crash very often. 
Bounty Hunting is broken so you can still find the bounty hunters in the world and defeat them, but you will not get any of the puck rewards from Caij leaving the blaster stance feeling very lackluster since all the extra abilities you need to buy with pucks. If you do not rest at your meditation point the game will not save and you will have to redo everything you did prior to resting which can cause a lot of problems. There is quite a bit of stuttering in the game though after the first few patches i personally havn't had many if any issues at this point.",1686886798,1702193947,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is why you would play this game. It's a jedi sim souls like and it's good at it if that appeals to you.

Visuals: 10/10
Easily one of the most stunning looking games of 2023.

Sound: 8/10
Not bad, but not good enough to leave an impression but that said, it is star wars, and doing audio up to the standard Star Wars sets in general is good enough to warrant an 8/10, not just a 7.

Optimization: 6/10
Technically i'd rate it as more an 8.3 now but at launch it was unplayable, and these people need to learn to stop releasing broken games. I didn't even consider this for game of the year because of it, and I would have otherwise.

Story: 4/10
I could not care less about the imperial era of star wars it's so overdone and how Bode acted at the end makes such little sense it's just dumb. Like sure it had some good moments, hence why it's not a 2/10, but yeah, it's bad.

Characters: 6/10
The main cast was great and well voiced but most of the side characters made me want to join the dark side to shut them up.

Animations: 10/10
Easily one of the best things about this game. Especially Greez. Well done.

Maps: 9/10
The maps design here is superb. From software levels of quality and even better than fallen order. It's just a 9/10 because I've seen better and there are more than a few moments that have left me critical of what I've seen.

Overall 8.1/10

The developers really tried to give us a fun game, taking what made fallen order good and expanding on it, for example a choice of 5 lightsaber combat stances that all feel different and unique, amazing scenary and views, a incredibly fun bossfight with [spoiler] merrin using her nightsister powers to fly around this giant machine as is destroys the temple [/spoiler] , new methods of smoothly traversing the world, a hub and customisation options ect.
However the negatives unfortunately outweigh the positives. 
Firstly the terrible optimisation giving awfull performance on a decent midrange pc even after multiple so called ""performance"" patches (a single modder did a better job then the entire dev team but even with the performance mod ""may the performance be with you"" it still runs poorly) 
the story was rather lacking and had some major flaws with a unsatisfying ending [spoiler] a whole lot of switching between cal whining about how he must fight the empire and how hes getting all his friends killed and a repetitive but unmeaningful recalling of dagon and his old jedi friend.
 i did however enjoy how cal was struggling with the darkside and dipping into it while resisting being corrupted and turning sith
however the last ark/ending was atrocious cals jetpacking gunslinger sidekick and best friend suddenly turns out to be a sith that no one could sence kills a jedi and betrays him- you then hunt him down and kill him in front of his CHILD daughter WHO IS COMPLETELY OK WITH HOPPING ON A SPACESHIP AND BEING BEST FRIENDS WHITH HER FATHERS KILLERS- roll credits...

The textures don't look as polished (especially the spaceships, with no specularity maps for shine on them to make them look like metal AT ALL) and the colour palette and shaders are all over the place (Cal's hair turns from dark auburn, to gold, to comedy bright red to dark brown and even black at times, even if he's not in the dark.) 
The devs even started running out of ideas, giving you busy work to do on planets - like side jobs, which is always a bad sign. Filler is filler because you lack creative ideas of how to flesh out your story.

And even if I had the lowest graphic settings known to mankind IT WAS UNBEARABLE and my PC isn't that bad, so with an average of 15 frames per second I made my way into the second area where it droped to an average of 5 frames per second wich made the game not just bad but UNPLAYABLE. In that moment I felt deep regret and really missed the 70 euros i have thrown out the window.

And in this review I am not talking about the story (wich is probably not that bad) or the gameplay (wich is nearly the same as fallen order), I just want to protect you from this madness of a game and not going through this like I did.
But if you want lag, bugs, motion sickness and countless hours of unbearable pain go ahead, that would be the game for you.

Edit: in 2023 it is still a completly buggy and lagging game do not buy on pc EVER !!!

We got teased with mind blowing worlds, fights, graphics, animations e.t.c. What we got was an un-optimised mess. This was on the release day of the game - April 28th, 2023. So, let's skip ahead months to December 9th, 2023. Has it improved? Is it more optimised? Well, below I will let you know.

[h1][b] My issues/Cons [/b][/h1]
⚫So first of all, let me explain this. My PC is WELL beyond minimum/recommended specs. It can support RAY tracing beyond your wildest dreams. Now, let's get to the matter at hand - I started up the game. Enabled all my settings. Turned Ray Tracing on. The game was a STUTTER fest. It was a CRASH fest. Several times in my 1hour and 55 minutes of playing I must have crashed 5-8 times in an hour. Here is the error I kept getting: EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION reading address 0x00000102144455d0. If anyone knows how to fix this, PLEASE, please can you help. (MY PC SPECS ARE ON MY STEAM PAGE)
⚫From time to time I noticed buggy animations on OTHER characters that are NOT Cal Kestis. BODE, the guy with the jetpack, when he removes his helmet... his hands gltiched faster than the FLASH could run. His jetpack also seemed to have come off of his back. The ""7th"" sister also managed to use her lightsaber without doing ANY animations at all. Fantastic game design EA. 
⚫I was told that the MICRO STUTTERS had been, somewhat, fixed. Yeah, ok. They have been fixed A LOT since launch day and you can actually play the game somewhat but I feel like this was a bold face lie told to us by EA. It still microstutters. Not all the time but its VERY annoying. 
⚫The AI, YOUR friends, stick to you so closely when you have to do jumping puzzles. BODE from the first mission AREA with his annoying JETPACK would not GET OUT OF MY FU**ING way when I had to climb. He just hovered there facing a wall I had to climb on. It took me 10 minutes to push him out of the way. Here, look for yourself: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3109174675
⚫When I reached the FIRST planet you manage to explore after your ship gets damaged, I was able to reach the TAR, opened up the shortcut and then my game crash's on me instantly. Why is this bad? Every single time I reloaded the game it took me 5 minutes to pass the ""OPTIMISATION"" screen and then I found out I had to do that ENTIRE segment all over again. 
⚫So I found out that one of the reasons I am crashing is because of the BIRDS FLYING. here, have a look yourself: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1774580/discussions/0/3828665650630021009/?l=french&ctp=2

EDIT: So about the MICROSTUTTERS, turns out the game actually has almost NO microstutters with RAY TRACING disabled.

[h1][b] PROS [/b][/h1]
⚫The game looked very good from what I was able to play and experience.
⚫The combat was very fluent and it felt fantastic when you mixed up your combos (well, from what you have at the start of the game)
⚫The audio was done to perfection in my opinion.
⚫The game has a plethora of LORE for you to read in the Star Wars Universe.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
I sadly, cannot recommend a half-assed game like this, STILL. I wrote a negative review day 1, and again... 8 months later, the game is still poorly optimised. I think... this is the last time I trust EA with ANY game that I buy. They clearly do not care about the quality of the games they are releasing.

This has game of the year potential. Really great story telling and combat mechanics! If only it wasn’t for it's massive performance issues. And finally, after several months, there were no more performance issues.

Jedi Survivor really makes you feel like a Jedi who has survived. One thing I love about these Star Wars games is the atmosphere, I love the buildings and the settings. This was a good game. The levels can get a little exhausting, but overall a good experience. I can't wait for the next one. This sequel better than original ''Fallen Order"".

Don't watch last three movie Star Wars from Disney, better you play this game and the original.

One more thing, Rick the Door Technician is the my favorit boss XD

Thought I'd give it a try, I mean, sure the launch was terrible, but issues must have been ironed out by now, the previous game was great, and it's only 30 bucks.

DLSS is almost useless because the game is completely CPU-limited. Tried frame gen to get consistent 60+. Nuh-uh. They didn't bother tuning it at all. Every time you move the camera, Cal's head breaks and it looks like the worst ghosting you've ever seen. Subtitles break too, and the menus, and feet when walking up the stairs. They get all fragmented and messed up. It's a joke.

And then you've got the stuttering for dessert. Forget what smoothness means, because this game will remind you it's a barely functional piece of shit every 10 seconds with shader comp and traversal stutters. This happens regardless of settings (still stutters on low), DLSS, or frame gen.

If you can look past these technical issues which are still present, the gameplay and exploration is really damn fun if you enjoy any souls-like style of game (Dark Souls, The Surge, Bloodborne, Elden Ring etc.) mixed with the Star Wars universe.

Technical issues still experienced so far:
- Had a couple of crashes in ~5hrs of gameplay which are very annoying as they reset progress back to the last meditation point AND you lose everything you did after it.  Meditation points are a bit too far apart for this not to be an issue.

Also it's a very bad PC port.  Performance is pretty awful and although I appreciate a lot of the options being present to remove a lot of the console-centric settings (like disabling 'hold button to do things' and what-not, there is this annoying camera shake in every cutscene which cannot be removed even when putting BOTH camera shake settings to 0%.  IDK why they insist on doing this in video games (and movies), but it's absolutely horrible so most of the time I hate watching the cutscenes because of it.

Lastly I don't know why it has to 'optimise for your PC' for at least 2 minutes every time booting up the game.  Again, just a junk port unfortunately.

Just finished the game. Was honestly one of my favorite Star Wars games released in recent memory.

One SSD later, a Black Friday binge and a multitude of updates from EA, Jedi Survivor has become one of the best games I've ever played. Runs smooth on medium quality, only one or two glitches so far but only had to exit to main menu to resolve them. The bulk of my additional 19 hours is hunting for more clothes to put in my closet on the Mantis and getting some awesome shots in photo mode. I rescind my negative review of the game, props to EA for fixing what was a hot garbage.

Anyway I've got it on 21st of November on sale for about 38 buckaroos and it was a great timing because couple of weeks before that I've finished Fallen Order on pc as well and guess what. It has been worth every single cent I've paid. Just for the record I'm running it on i7-6700k (yes 8 years old cpu) and 3070ti in-game settings maxed out in 1440p and it held 60fps most of the time with occassional hickups.


After finishing 100% of Jedi: Survivor I can say one thing, it took Fallen Order and expanded on every single element. Characters that were tasteless in Fallen Order? Fixed (Even Cal who I really didn't like in the first game). I certainly don't care about customizations but if you do hell you have some serious content to unlock. Combat system is the good ol' but upgraded with 9 skill trees, yes 9 (5 for weapon skills, 3 for force skills and 1 for general character development) so you have the freedom to choose which weapon type suits you best. Sound design and music is spot on just like in previous game but what's added is countless dialogues between enemies and I really took my time to just listen before I engage, so great immersion upgrade as well. Graphics fidelity is overall great and map designs are great as well so there is always something to see or something to do.

Now lets talk content. There are 6 locations or planets if you will (1 humongous, 2 large and 3 small) all of them are different and all of them are visually great with some awesome vistas to see.
Just like in Horizon Forbidden West you are not stripped of your skills from the game which is greatly appreciated and it only underscores that this is in fact a sequel even though if you don't want to play Fallen Order both of these games are start to finish standalones without cliffhangers or open endings and can be experienced like that.

So now to the technical side. Fallen Order had stuttering all over the place, Survivor has it somewhere but not too often for it to become unbearable and it has some places with fps drops but I cannot say 100% if it was the game or my rig. What I can say 100% on the other hand is that you don't want to turn ray tracing on simply because it will cause you to lose 20 fps and the effect on visuals is marginal maybe mainly because this is AMD sponsored title.
During my 60 or so hours in this game I've encountered 1 or 2 texture glitches, couple of weird clothing animation behavior and 2 crashes.

The core issues are two. 1 the combat and 2 the side content.

1. The fundamental issue here is that this is a game that breaks its own rules in combat constantly. It has that slow , deliberate  high committal combat  that dark souls is known for. But you will be facing  a half dozen to dozens of enemies all of which can shoot through eachother and attack through eachother.

The game wants you to parry but more often than  not the enemy you want to parry is hidden by a blob of goons all clipping into eachother.

The bosses are even more annoying because many of them are stun immune for what seems to be arbitrary reasons. one second a hit will stun them. other times they will just power through a light saber to the face while starting some ultra ridiculous combo.  The boss fights were not enjoyable because of this. They were more of a chore I wanted to get through than they were fun.

2.  90% of the side content is pointless, you can collect fish to fill a fish tank, collect plants to fill garden. neither do anything.  Plus the game continues the rather pointless persuite of populating most secrets and chests with  color swaps , and skins for cal and his light sabers. something I wager most people ignore.

Its alot of fluff that pads the run time needlessly.

Platforming still remains a big part of the game and does feel a little forced when compared to Fallen Order. There are optimization issues. The game was borderline unplayable at launch. Recent patches have improved performance, but there is a way to go before it is fully optimized. I prefer to game at 1440p and consistently get between 70-90 FPS on Max settings with RT on. Turning RT off will obviously result in higher FPS, but I like the eye candy. When playing in 4k my FPS does take a hit. With some areas running under 30 FPS. 

Overall the pros out-way the cons. If your fine gaming in 1440p or 1080p I feel like the game is great and definitely worth getting. If your gaming in 4k, just understand that optimization issues will heavily throttle your FPS.

I didn't collect all collectibles, because there's just too much of it.

However! This game deserves positive reviews. Yes, the PC release was wobbly and not too good, but after a few months worth of patches, it's not only playable. It's smooth. I've only encountered a few position glitches and a random rancor walking on air once. 

I play games for stories told in them. This game had me interested and gripped me from the beginning until the end. There's character development, people fighting for their ideals and learning to live with what mistakes they have made. Furthermore, there are awesome fighting scenes.

Beautiful graphics, and typical console souls-like gameplay, but they offer a nice variation on the preferred play style with the 5 different combat stances.

Also, Merrin. Nuff said. 

All in all, a solid 9/10 for me. The last point missing is due to preference for games, really. I'm not a huge fan of souls-like games, but the story is worth every hour spent on this.

That being said, this game is not without fault. I played this game well after it came out. I patiently waited seeing as how many people were complaining of performance issues. I was lucky enough to not have any visible moments of poor performance during the entirety of my time with the game.

I think the game has improved over it's last entry which was already pretty phenomenal. Without taking the story into account this is one of my faves of the year. However the story is where my issues largely stem from. It's hard to talk plot without spoiling a lot of stuff later on down the line, so from here on out is story spoilers and my gripes with it:

[spoiler]Unfortunately for myself, the biggest twist of the game was spoiled for me early on into the game when i simply tried to google search who the actor was that played Bode. Because of this every time he was involved in a cutscene I was looking at him with pretty intense scrutiny (that being said, I'm only human and could have missed things). The major twist of the game is that Bode is a secret, hidden Jedi who has learned to blend in amongst the empire & rebels alike and is making a life for himself as a double agent in the galaxy.

Back to the beginning, you are try to get information from a corrupt Coruscant senator with the help of Bode and a bunch of crew members who die almost immediately after being introduced, with only you and Bode being the lone survivors. Looking back at the cutscene in which you, bode and your one other member are flying out of Coruscant and only you seem to make an escape, Bode seems to be off, but nothing really noticeable beyond that. By the time he comes back into the story he seems ENTIRELY devoted to your cause, willing and able to help you out, asking very little in return.. Almost the entirety of the plot revolves around a Jedi you find healing in a Bacta Tank named Dagan Gera. Immediately after freeing him he reveals that he had betrayed the Jedi order and that his intentions were finding and resettling on a hard to reach planet where they could train a legion of Jedi to overthrow the empire and basically cleanse the galaxy. He very very much seemed to be set as the main villain of the game, especially since the entirety of the plot stemmed around beating him to get to this hidden planet. But when you defeat him and slay him at the end of the second act, the story seems to have plenty left in the tank.

This is where Bode comes back into the game. Immediately after defeating Dagan, Bode confides that he has reservations about restarting the Jedi Order on this hidden planet, as he only cares about the safety of his daughter. Something that feels like was intentionally hidden until this moment. This now becomes the obvious set up for the bounty hunter type character to selfishly betray the rest of your team. All of this i can understand, he is looking out for his daughter above all, and wants to go to the planet by himself to save her from the cruelty of the empire. BUT WHY DOES HE KILL ENO CORDOVA ON HIS WAY OUT? for everything the game set up, that seemed ridiculously out of character when he very well could have just left them all in the dust and fled.

Immediately this begins a chase sequence that ultimately concludes with a lightsaber duel when Bode reveals he is a secret jedi blah blah blah. When you get knocked out upon losing the fight, it cuts to you playing as Cere, Cal's Jedi mentor, where she defends this ancient Jedi temple from the Imperial invaders... Of course, this sequence concludes with the inevitable fight against Darth Vader. I had expected they would put this game, and hell, i was even looking forward to it. I cannot understate my extreme disappointment from the developers to make Vader look this f***ing weak. Really? with each passing cutscene in the fight he looks weaker and weaker and only manages to beat Cere via complete fluke when she had the upperhand the whole time? Nah, I can't accept that. This man is suppose to be the most terrifying force of nature in the history of the Sith/Jedi and he BARELY beats Cere, a Jedi who has only been seen in the previous game and this? No. I simply do not respect their decision to make that Canon. f*ck that.

after this 100% tomfoolery, you go and do what I will say is one of the cooler sequences in the game, when you sneak into the Imperial base to chase after Bode. Just before finding him, it starts one of the more interesting cutscenes in the game. I applaud Respawn for their attempt at something a little more dramatic and interesting here, although it somewhat misses the mark. You find Bode's daughter Kata in Bode's apartment and begin to question her about her dad. The sequence would take long to explain but it is phenomenal. Once Bode enters the scene, I'm not 100% sure whether or not he is trying to deceive Cal or convince him, but he says something akin to ""hoping Cal forgives him and that they can work together again"". This confused the hell out of me, because this scene would have 100000% worked if Bode didn't kill Eno Cordova on his way out. but instead it just feels like he is bullshiting. Ultimately the scene is bookended with Cal giving in to dark side and calling upon amazing force powers to chase after Bode. The sequence is fantastic, because there were many moments throughout this game where i found myself saying ""Cal isn't really coming off like a light side Jedi as much as one of those Grey Jedi's  or even like Anakin before he went to the Dark Side.

anyhow, the game culminates with You and your crew managing to find an alternative route to the hidden planet, Tanalorr. Once their, you have the final battle of the game against Bode. I feel like with some slight adjustments to the story as i had mentioned earlier, this battle would have been an amazing end to an amazing game, but it felt like it came up short. Again, you try to convince Bode to give up and come back to the light side, before a lightsaber battle ensues. During the battle, Bode gives in to the Dark Side and force pushes Kata accidentally, which is an indicator that he has lost himself to the Darkside, which ultimately concludes with Cal disarming Bode, and then after a few moments, Cal - in what i view as doing a dark side move - shoots Bode several times, ending the conflict once and for all.

the game then concludes with what I assume many people might not like for an ending, but 100% works for me, and would have hit better if they did those small adjustments to Bode's character as previously mentioned, but Cal looks on as they give a Jedi cremation to Cere, Eno Cordova and Bode. As time passes by, Cal looks on, everyone leaves the site in a fast forwarded scene, but Cal stays and looks on at the funeral pyre. A feeling fell over me, that the future for our 'hero' is unclear, that in what I can only assume will be the final chapter of Cal's story will be a inner battle between whether or not he will give in to the darkside. I hope Respawn can execute that without flaw, but after seeing them fumble Bode, I have my reseverations. [/spoiler]",1701894003,1701894003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were some random difficulty spikes that I think could have been handled better, but the combat is solid. You have 5 different stances to use and they are enjoyable. The traversal feels good and the shortcut system always feels satisfying too. I didn't like the story but the voice acting and mo-capping were very well done and carry the game. As long as you don't think about character motivations and roll with what's happening it's enjoyable enough. Overall I had fun with the game and it wasn't buggy on my PC which I heard was an issue at launch.

-------
I have issues with the story and will be getting into full story spoilers. 
[spoiler]First the game opens with us finding out the OG team disbanding because Cal is too ""obsessed"" with fighting the empire. They make it seem like he needs to just go on a holiday and there's more to life than the fight... Except he's a Jedi being hunted by the empire so this makes no sense. Additionally Cere and Merrin abandon him and then just go and join/make a resistance and don't tell Cal about it. Again he wants to fight the Empire and is one of the most valuable weapons against the Empire so that's just dumb. 

The game also won't stop telling us about how great Merrin is and I found her to be the most boring bland character in the game. Outside of magic she has nothing going for her. Her magic powers are god tier until something actually happens in the plot and then she's useless. The romance between Cal and Merrin felt forced and I didn't feel any chemistry between the voice actors at all. Dagan Gera is a 2D villain that makes no sense and is underused. He's mad at the Republic for betraying him but they are gone and he knows this. He immediately wants to kill Cal who wasn't involved with them so again just 2D villain stuff. 

I liked Bode but by the end his motivations also make no sense... he wants to go to an uncivilized planet with his daughter and live there alone? With her tiny backpack being the only thing she brings? Also his daughter's reaction at the end is the least human thing I've ever seen.  The only person you care about dies and you don't react and just chill with the people who kill him. The game has a problem telling characters' stories and has an emphasis on them doing what the plot needs them to. There are still some fun moments and well done scenes but this reoccuring issue took me out of the game. [/spoiler]",1701799316,1701829873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite generally being very sensitive to tech issues, and despite the tech state being far from ideal, I found this game so engaging I soon forgot all about its troubles and found myself lost in the story and the gameplay.

The combat gameplay is not going to win any awards, for the most part it is a worse version of most melee action games in the post-Souls era. But the game is diverse enough so that never becomes a problem: between traversal puzzles, physics puzzles, different stances and memorable set pieces, the somewhat shallow combat never becomes a problem. I think the overall gameplay loop, considering all its diversity, is a lot better than some other highly acclaimed offerings this year.

The story is incredible, if you are into Star Wars. There is a lot of typical Star Wars fantasy fluff in writing and would-building and it can detract from the experience, for sure. But if you go into this one without expecting hard sci-fi and instead expecting a galaxy-spanning space fantasy epic, you will not be disappointed. The story is emotional, satisfying, easy to follow and has a couple of good twists.

The only problem I personally have is that compared to Fallen Order, the facial animations and VAs aren't quite on the level. Trilla Suduri mo-cap and VA in Fallen Order several years ago raised the bar very high and I don't think anyone in Survivor is even 75% as good. Which is a shame, as that was something that truly stood out in FO even when compared to industry's best titles today,

All in all, this is a game that is very easy to recommend to all SW fans and to gamers who don't mind an occasional gaming equivalent of ""burger and fries"". It is not going to win any awards, but it is satisfying, fulfilling and doesn't overstay its welcome. I've finished the story in ~40 hours with a ~80% completion and wasn't bored for a second of it. 

More, and it'd probably turn into something greasy and unhealthy, like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry games.
Less, and I'd probably be left slightly hungry and slightly disappointed with the money I've spent (I got it at -40% last sale).
So personally, I think this game is ""just right"" and absolutely worth considering, if you are already done with all the other big titles that came out this year.

[b] Performance [/b]

Admittedly, I got somewhat lucky. In closed-in spaces I got around 60 to 75 fps. I took a chance knowing the performance was bad for most people and got the better end of the stick. It was still a struggle however. The updates have helped the game significantly for my specs but I doubt this will be the case for most users. The game mostly revolves around the planet Koboh. I remember seeing a lot of people saying once you get past this area the performance improves significantly but the lion's share of the game takes place there and that is where most of the performance issues are. I never got above 45 fps in the open areas of Koboh. 

[b] Story [/b]

Jedi: Fallen Order's story always felt tacked on to the Star Wars universe to me. It felt very safe and not too involved with the larger story. So much so that I can only remember a few specific story beats from the game. Survivor completely turns this around with involving planets and new enemies from both the shows and the movies. It feels like what is happening in the universe is actively effecting Kal's story. It is paced great and with set pieces that are amazing spectacles that will keep you playing for hours on end.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

Right off the bat you get to keep a lot of your core abilities from Fallen Order and through out the game you will get new ones such as a dash through shields, grappling hook and a special grappling hook. These allow you to unlock new short cuts and explore new areas of the worlds.

Kal's arsenal is also improved with new lightsaber stances. There is the original single blade and dual blade as well as dual wield receiving its own stance, so all the star killer fans can live out their fantasies. Two brand new stances are introduced with the single blade and blaster combo and the cross-guard. Each one offers a unique play-style but I found the blaster and dual blade to be the best for handling almost any situation.

Most of the main traversal in the game is fairly easy with only a handful of slightly more challenging areas. Survivor remedies this with very difficult secret challenge areas. One of which made my intelligence feel so respected as a player I am going to add a spoiler tag because I think you should experience it yourself. [spoiler] One of the challenge areas has an instant death wall that alternates halves sporadically as it moves toward the player. You need to navigate an obstacle course while avoiding the wall of death as it sweeps past you over and over. I initially thought that there was a pattern to the alternating halves and I needed to memorize the pattern to make it through the puzzle. I thought I was figuring it out with one attempt where I got further but quickly found out this was dumb luck when the path I was taking became less and less successful. I began to believe the alternations were random which meant the course was impossible without being extremely lucky. And I was right, they were random. There was no pattern, next thing I figured that there had to be away past the wall that I wasn't seeing. Perhaps I had to jump around or hide behind some form of cover from the wall. Over and over again I sprinted as fast as I could trying to get past. Sometimes I got a little lucky, most times not. Until I decided to stop and observe. And when I stopped, the wall stopped alternating too... This was the moment where I felt the game had greatness tucked away inside it. It never told me (at least that I saw) that the wall alternated only when I moved. I had to figure it out on my own. I have no doubt that some of the more patient players figured this out immediately but for me it was an incredibly engaging experience. If more of the game was like this it would be one of my favorite games of all time [/spoiler]
The game has lots of extras secrets where it asks more of you as a player to solve its puzzles and those are some of my favorite parts of the game. 

Unfortunately I just cant recommend it. The performance issues on a big game like this with a new big price-tag are unacceptable. I recommend picking it up when it goes on sale down the road.

Took me about twice the time of Fallen Order to get all achievements and collectables. Story is solid, maps are much more open which lends to more exploration than the previous title. Performance fell in 2 areas, but for the most part seems to be okay compared to all the complaints on Launch.

I will say, I bought it at 50% sale and got way more than my money's worth. Is it better than the first title?

However, my experience with the game left me more disappointed than a moisture farmer on Tatooine.

One of the most glaring issues with Jedi: Survivor is its abysmal performance. Despite wielding a formidable Ryzen 7 3700X paired with a powerful GE 3080 that effortlessly handled Cyberpunk, I found myself navigating the game in a stuttering mess. The sudden drops in frames per second mid-movement not only hindered my precision but also made the entire experience feel like navigating through hyperspace with a faulty hyperdrive. It's a shame that a game with such potential is plagued by technical issues that should have been addressed.

The combat mechanics, touted as a central element of the game, turned out to be disappointingly wonky. Facing opponents with the ability to execute one-move kills left no room for error, turning every encounter into a frustrating exercise in overly defensive play. While it may be argued that this adds a touch of realism by not portraying Jedi as invincible beings, it detracts from the enjoyment and fun that should be inherent in a Star Wars game. Furthermore, the inconsistency in opponents' power-move charge times only added to the frustration, making it difficult to predict and adapt to their attacks.

The storyline, billed as a captivating journey through the Star Wars universe, fell flat. Instead of an engaging narrative, the game was filled with ""MacGuffins"" – plot devices that served no purpose other than to trigger the next set of events. The story lacked depth and failed to captivate my interest, leaving me questioning the choices made by the developers. Additionally, the inclusion of Clone Wars droids with their incessant and mind-numbing chatter felt out of place and did little to enhance the overall experience. It was a puzzling decision that further detracted from the immersive quality that a Star Wars game should deliver.

In conclusion, Jedi: Survivor falls short of expectations on multiple fronts. From technical performance issues to lackluster combat mechanics and a flat storyline filled with unnecessary plot devices, the game struggles to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe.

Thought I might try NG+ for a little while. After downloading the entire 128G, I went to play it, and now my computer is SLOWLY downloading the EA app. It has been about 10 minutes now and I am at 7%. At this rate, it will take me longer to get the EA pp installed than it did to download the game itself. Seriously, WTAF?

Update 1: Crashed on me three times today in less than an hour. Keep getting: 
LoginId:[redacted]

LowLevelFatalError [File:Unknown] [Line: 686] RetCode = Adapter->CreateCommittedResource(Desc, GetGPUMask(), HeapProps, InitialState, ClearValue, &NewResource, Name, false) failed at D:/depot/r8branches/r8release/Engine/Source/Runtime/D3D12RHI/Private/D3D12Allocation.cpp:1411 with error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED

I've played about 14 hours at this point, and all 3 crashes were in the same area, so I have now played through this same area 3 times just to have it crash again in between save points.

I'll wait for another update before trying to play again. This is ridiculous.

Edit: After disabling Ray Tracing, I was able to get through this area and play a good bit longer. Much smoother experience, and really didn't look much different without RT. Also noticed that I can't easily change the display resolution. I was unable to see the full screen when looking at the map and some of the menu buttons, so I changed to a different resolution, but to do so I had to switch to windowed mode and use the keyboard/mouse to select and apply the change. Trying to use a controller would not allow me to actually apply the edit, so it kept reverting back. Seriously, who quality controlled this game?",1684707693,1701569179,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

They also pad out the game way too much with enemy gauntlet type encounter where they’re waves and waves of progressively difficult enemies where if you mess up you have to do it all again from the start—and this happens way too often.

Another issue is this game suffers from Skyward Sword syndrome… unlike the first one where you see and explore several different unique planets, this one mostly revolves around just three planets you have to revisit over and over again albeit going through different parts of it, but it grows aesthetically super stale.

Finally I found the story to be significantly weaker than the previous one. There are certain daring things it does I respect it for but the execution of those is debatable as well. But the writing is far worse in my opinion with cliche or on the nose dialogue, predictable twists, and a premise that we’ve seen before a thousand times. Oh, and the villain(s) were far worse and less interesting than Second Sister was. The only interesting thing about it is that it delves slightly into High Republic stuff which was interesting.

The problem is the story, gameplay and graphics are so damn good. But I cannot recommend this game due to how fucking frustrating the Crashing and low fps has been. Its caused me to have to redo hours of progress due to the crashes.

If you can manage to get this game working, a general negative is the constant backtracking when you get a new ability if you want to enter an area on your first/only run. It is boring and annoying. Its just a way to artificially pad the game.

Overall it would be a great game without the crashing / performance issues. But I cannot recommend this game due to these issues, which are the same issues I had with Fallen Order when I was running my 1070 spec.

With my CPU being slightly under the recommend and GPU, RAM over recommend specs the game ran at lowest 55 FPS up to about 80 FPS which would be a problem if it was like a battle royal or something, but for me with this story based game I had no issues at all. There was one re-spawn bug at one place which sometimes loaded for a long time but I am sure that is fixed now.

I recommend everyone with around the recommend (not minimum) specs or above to buy it and try it at least.
The people writing they have 15 FPS on 4080 and stuff are either playing maxed graphics, lying or bought some china ass computer.

I have to say there’s a really great game below all the technical issues, and I’m sorry for those who cannot have a decent play through because of this.

I must be amongst the fortunate ones, as my experience has been good enough - not flawless but certainly not game breaking. So far I’ve had 0 crashes and very few bugs. The only hassle is the occasional stutter, but overall it’s OK.

My specs are not that great, asus m15, RTX 3070 8GB, core i7 can’t remember the model, 16 RAM and NVME SSD. I’m able to play 1440p with DLSS quality and almost every setting ultra.

The game runs pretty good now on an rtx 2070s at 1440p, high setting with DLSS quality, averaging 70-80 fps, sometimes droping into the high 50s. Now the negatives, the story is pretty boring. They decided to put the high republic era lore which is pretty new and disliked by the fans, idk why they couldn't just do more clone wars era tie-ins and lore like the previous game. The combat is pretty scuffed and i know it's souls like combat but still and the parkour animations look kinda bad, like they are missing frames or skipping them, they don't look fluid at all like in AC or Titanfall.

Then steam came with a recommendation before the game started. I did not have any problems with playing on mouse and keyboard. I find the fighting more difficult in this game compared to the first one, and got stuck in some animations, so it was impossible to parry, or evade from some attacks. 
I only experienced minor bugs and glitches, but when i came to the level where i have to play as another character, it struggled to load in as her. I was still playing as Cal. Had to restart steam and the game a few times, to make it work, but got some more bugs after that as well.

I went in blind. I only knew you could have the saber as well as a pistol, and had seen some of the movements like the dash in the air.
I did not know anything related to the story, and it was a intriguing story with some surprises.

I was wondering what they could put on the table to make it feel like a new game, and not just a story expansion. They have two new stances, so i think there is a stance for every type of gameplay, but i felt the normal stance with a single normal light saber was weaker then the others. 
This game is also more open world, whereas the first game felt like the planet had one main route from a to b, with some explorations, this has an open world as a central part, and different routs to go from there to wherever you want. I found it a bit more confusing to read the map, because it is big with separate levels, and a lot to explore.

They even have side quests in this game, that will improve the character or help the saloon in different ways. You can find a diver that will help with the aquarium in the saloon, musicians that will play music, you find, or buy in the store. There is one set of mini game  where you can play something similar as to what they play in the millennium falcon, which reminded me of ""dejarik"". The characters you then scan in battle, are playable characters in that mini game. There also is a garden on the rooftop.

The climbing and movement is now improved as well, where you have a grapple pistol and are able to dash in the air. It was interesting, but with all that and being able to squeeze in tight places and use some walls to jump up against, almost like climbing it made it more confusing. It is difficult to know where to go since not all of the special walls or tight places has marks on them, so i found my self walking in to what i thought was a tight squeeze or tried jumping on walls that was not climbable, and with the dash you are able to reach stuff far away. Some times so far it is difficult to know you can reach it by jumping.

It is a good game. Might be difficult and have a lot of mechanics to learn. I recommend playing the first one for the story and to learn the beginning mechanics before advancing on this game with even more mechanics. I don't think the game told me enemies re spawn after i rest in the meditation spots, but i knew from the first game.

First and foremost; EA forces you to download their launcher and of course it defaults to launch when you start your PC. Even if you disable it as a startup program it still runs as a service. Switch this to ""Manual"" in services so it doesn't run every time you start your PC. Seriously, we are so sick of these publishers forcing us to use their launcher when we've already purchased the game through a storefront. I was very close to refunded before even trying the game due to this. 

Performance: Overall, performance has been stable with a stutter here or there. The exception is in the massive open area on the hub planet. This place has very inconsistent performance. I imagine this is due to them using the engine and full graphics designed for a linear short rendered game. Once you move into a linear area, the performance clears up. 

Gameplay:
The gameplay picks up off the last game with some immediate improvements. The first one is how much more fluid the movement is. Combat overall flows well. The enemies aren't as difficult as the previous game. I set my game to Jedi Master out the gate and found it a bit too easy especially considering I've beaten the original game at least 4 times with once being on the highest difficulty. One might think ""this lower difficulty is probably from Cal becoming more powerful."" No, the enemies are easier, parry window more open, you can take more hits, ect. Speaking of which, you immediately feel that Cal is now an experienced Jedi. I was going to lose it if you start the game and for whatever reason lose all your powers. But that's not the case. You start the game with double jump, wall run, and all the basic Jedi powers. You have both single and double blade out the gate and unlock dual blade during the prologue / warm up opening. While on dual blade... it's good, but I can't get over how stupid Cal looks while running with dual blades. It's weird; but I imagine they did it so that blaster reflection is more fluid while sprinting.

Graphics:
This game of course is gorgeous. All the textures are top notch, but the lighting is really where this game takes the cake. We have more areas to hold our light saber up like a light and it's a true light source based on the color of the saber. It's breathtakingly beautiful. 

Story:
A solid story is not make or break for me as honestly, I don't play games for stories and half the time I skip them. This game has a good enough story that I haven't skipped once. It's engaging but not exhausting.

But the game runs like a one legged horse in a tar pit. When I'm just standing there, it does 66 fps. Fine. I'm cool with that. Even 30 is fine, I'm no snob. But then I start jumping, and fps drops to 2. Literally 2, I enabled a tracker a checked. This on Nov 30, 2023, after they released several patches. I bought the game on sale, and regret it.

What's worse is that the first several hours of the game didn't have any performance issues. It wasn't until I got to a sort of town thing, 6 hours in that the incredible suttering slowdowns started. And not even as soon as I entered that zone - not until I ran around doing a quest thing explored for a bit, left, and came back to the town. And turning down graphics settings does not help - it may even have made it worse. Restarted the game in case it was a memory leak problem or something - nope, still runs worse than a broken down chrysler on fart fumes.

My computer is not bad. I've got a 3070, 32gb of ram, and 8th generation i7 cpu. CPU is a bit on the old side, but good enough for every other game I played and above their minimum requirements.

As I write this, the game is using 11gb of ram and 6 gb of vram, and 50-60% of my cpu, despite me just standing still. Amusingly, the game immediately fills 2gb of vram as soon as you turn it on, just during the splash screen. Then it fills another 2 when it says its compiling game files, which it does every time you launch it. Then you load a save and it fills another 2.

PERFORMANCE: 4090, microstuttering, can dip down to at low as 30 fps and be as high as around 170 fps with Quality DLSS and Frame Generation. Odd graphical glitches occur randomly and texture popin in noticeable.

DIVERSITY: Uglified Woman. Most characters who interact with you are Asian or Black women. Very few male characters, this includes historical characters. Women characters are also icons of virtue and very capable. Merrin can basically do anything you can do. Can be distracting, was for me.

GAMEPLAY: feels quite good, however some gameplay elements are locked away at seemingly trivial story beats even though they affect your gameplay style in combat. The game could use a training mode where you can curate the number of enemies and have unlimited force resource to train with, otherwise putting points into combination skills depends on you practicing in the field, which seems like a small change that could have been implemented. The new stances system is uninteresting, I have most of them, 1 missing I believe, but I am most of the way through the story at this point and I don't really like any of them. Perhaps that is just my experience. The skill points that you choose don't feel like meaningful changes or upgrades to your game play pattern ,but that may not be an issue for you if you choose to spend your points on increasing your survival or force stats. I choose to go the combos route.

STORY: The story is no where near as strong as the first game. It is perhaps actually the weakest part of the game. The most thrilling segment was the very beginning while you are on Corosant. It is quite linear, but allows you to experience a high stakes situation. The tension practically drops off a cliff after that where things just don't seem to be a big deal in terms of urgency. The story doesn't demand it. To speak further about the story beats (no spoilers), in the original the story is akin to a coming of age story where Cal is figuring things out about who he is and what he wants to do with his life. In the sequel he is learning something else, but the stakes are no where near what they felt like they were in the first game, and the events seem leisurely. Hard disagree with others who claim its a better story, it's not. It is barely interesting at all and kind of feels tacked on at the end. There isn't a romance in the story either, but that is fine, since there wasn't really one in the first game either. 

EXPLORATION: This is the strongest point in the game, if you like exploring the world and traveling at your own pace, you will have a great time, in fact, it feels like the game was made for you. Nothing bad to say about it.


CONCLUSION: The game is not a 9/10 insane story that should be getting a near perfect score from reviewers. Not much has changed or been upgraded from the original. Developers seemingly phoned it in on new and interesting changes from the original formula. Exploration and combat are still great, but the new stances leave much to be desired. They do not feel interesting or like they fit in rather than tacked on and the skill tree system feels practically useless as well. The maps are bigger, but doesn't mean its better. 

The story feels like it drags on, padding to increase the length, mostly because there isn't much interesting to focus on and neither are the characters. Merrin for example was quite interesting in the first game, but there is no romance in the sequel to make her a more interesting character and she seemingly has nothing to develop inherently in herself, she is just there because she was in the first game. Cere and Greeves seem to serve similar purposes, they serve as points to reflect back to Cal his experience in the story, but they don't inherently seem to be necessary for the story to take place. These characters seem like they just happen to be at the right place at the right time to see Cal again. All in all, this amounts to a story that is uninteresting and falls far behind his predecessor in this department.

In conclusion, the story is poor, the characters are uninteresting, I am not sure what Cal is supposed to be learning or struggling with even though I have been told what he is supposed to be struggling with multiple times, its not believable. The gameplay is good, but lacking in augmentation, and the exploration is great. This game is ultimately held back by this and, like i have said many times now, the story. If you aren't looking for a good story, and you just want to play some star wars, this game is great.

Overall the actual game itself is fantastic, it has a fantastic story, good characters, and fun gameplay. The planets and art style is great. This game is truly an amazing Star Wars game. 

However, this game is held back by very VERY poor optimization even to this day. It still has plenty of bugs as well. Every other location outside of the main Koboh area runs really well, but even with a 3070 and a Ryzen 7 Rambler's Reach still chugs for some reason. Its quite pathetic that a AAA studio like Respawn can only launch 7 updates in 7 months whereas the Lords of the Fallen devs can pump out a few patch every week and its their first game. There is so much passion from the artists, writers, and actors that its sad to see the downfall of the game comes from the engineers being incapable of optimizing the game on PC. If you're fortunate enough to own a PS5 or Xbox Series X and are hesitant about the PC port I would give the game a shot on those platforms because I heard they run and look better there.

TLDR: This game is an absolute must play for any Star Wars fan, however the optimization and bugs are still an overarching problem.

It makes me sad this game isn't sitting at overwhelmingly positive. It's the best Star Wars game I have played in a long time, and I've played them all. It's one of the best AAA games I've played for awhile. Whoever they have working on this series is doing a great job. The game actually *feels* like Star Wars again. It's reminding me of the old school Lucas Arts stuff we all loved. It gives me hope for the future of Star Wars again. 

Great sound, great level design, and fantastic story. It brings a lot of lesser known lore to the forefront and adds some great stuff to the universe. I'm probably around half way through the game, but so far it just keeps throwing cool stuff at me. Tons of variation and play styles to mess around with. And they got rid of that stupid Poncho too.

I can't recommend this game enough! Although you absolutely MUST play Jedi Fallen Order before playing Jedi Survivor. Otherwise, the details in the story will not make as much sense.

Amazingly rich story, heart wrenching/warming plot twists, and new game mechanics that blew me away on many occasions. The fight mechanics alone are awe inspiring, and don't get me started on the customisation! You can customise practically everything about Cal, Cal's lightsaber and BD, similar to Fallen Order, but now with SO MUCH MORE! For spoiler reasons, you can play the game to find out the full extent of the customisation options or Google it.

The smallest details in this game are just amazing - if you pursue every conversation, explore every corner and eavesdrop on all the enemy conversations (I recommend having subtitles on), then the jokes and quips are enough to break out smiling every time. I massively appreciate the colossal effort the game devs put into the game, so those details will not go amiss.

This is probably my current favourite Star Wars game, having just bumped Fallen Order off the top of the list and has beaten even Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga.

There's more of a focus on lightsaber wielders in combat, there's a bigger focus on movement and parkour abilities, there's fucking BOTW Shrines which bring in a bunch of puzzles to solve. The game looks so good with the scenery, often times in my playthrough I'd just screenshot a view just for the sake of taking a picture of the amazing landscape. Side Quests are a big part of the game, ranging from helpful gestures to point you towards something you might've missed to full on faction takeovers of old areas to spice it up. There's truly a ton of more love and care put into the game, like there's SO MUCH optional dialogue you can check out with NPCs and ""pre-combat"" enemy conversations, of which Cal will occasionally chime into. I think one of my favorite moments in the game was early on, when an unsuspecting enemy is talking about the great view, after you beat him up Cal makes a comment to end the enemy's monologue, to which you are then able to actually inspect said view where Cal then does realize that it is, indeed, a great view. It sounds weird, but I am very glad that the performance is, in my opinion, the only bad part about this game, because shoddy performance can be fixed over time, it can be improved through updates (it should've been good from the get go tho don't get me wrong), but a bad story, bad combat mechanics, bad graphics whatever, are much harder to fix, and I am very glad that none of those are an issue.",1701236641,1701236641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
I like the game, story, and concept. The puzzles are ok. Combat forms allow multiple ways to play. Building the town, teams, and order concept is amazing. The customization aspects are cool. I even like the taming/mount aspect.

Cons:
Constant glitches, crashes, stutters at certain points in the game. It's not unplayable but I am constantly worried that I have to save at every meditation point I see not because of my health but because of worries the game will crash or freeze. I've gotten stuck in walls more than a few times, which is a bit annoying considering the sheer amount of jumping puzzles. Other times, the wall run, wall grab, etc mechanic just doesn't work at all--like the game decided not today. These times are usually followed by certain buttons not working. ""Hit the attack button"" -nothing- ""Bedlam raider laughs"" -button still not working- WTF game? Restart...continue until the next glitch.

This game is the perfect sequel, and I can see that the amount of work and effort put into this game deserves more praise. I found this all out through 40fps consistently across the game.

The only thing I hate is the FPS. But just like getting used to 60fps from when you usually play 144fps. I've done that but for this game. I've gotten used to the game with 40fps which only took a couple hours.

But I would prefer over 59fps asap Respawn. thank you very much.

EDIT: Frame Generation is such a game changer, not only did it double my fps but I also discovered that RAM speed also caused an improvement which now makes the game run so much better. A bit unfortunate Frame Generation is only a Gen 4 Nvidia Graphics Card feature though.",1682815574,1701175699,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Several bug fixes have been released since the game launched and I´m no longer running into any major problems while playing. Anything else really isn´t that much of a concern for me honestly. 

What I´m really interested in when I look at the reviews of a game is the game itself. And for me, the game delivered. If you´re already familiar with Jedi: Fallen Order, you know the combat system and world design. (If not, then what are you even doing here?? This is a sequel!) Both have been greatly expanded and improved upon and left me more than satisfied in every gaming session. Instead of two there are now five individual lightsaber stances, each with its own skill tree. (you start with the skills you acquired in Fallen Order, by the way; you don´t have to ""relearn"" anything.) It´s also the perfect mix of familiar and new planets for me, and the old ones you get to see from a new perspective. The story goes into a little different direction this time, but I liked it a lot and it kept me thinking for a while even after completing the game. 

A piece of advice for anyone who usually skips optional NPC dialogue: please don´t do this here, especially late in the game / during post-game cleanup. They did something really good with this in my opinion and I´m keeping this vague on purpose. It left me with a feeling I didn´t have in any other game before, despite it only being a side aspect.

It also offers a good chunk of High Republic content for those of you familiar with or interested in the era. It doesn´t spoil anything from the books or comics, and on the other hand grants a slightly better insight if you know (part of) them. Both groups can enjoy it here. 

For the completionists among you: the game offers 53 achievements in total, and most of them aren´t too tedious to get. There is some grinding involved, but nothing too annoying and I found the specific tasks varied enough to keep me engaged (unless maybe you insist on finding all collectibles as well, which I did. I´ve had worse, but it wasn´t the most fun, either, but don´t worry, no achievements are tied to this and you can get the map to 100% without it, if I´m not mistaken). Don´t worry about locking yourself out of anything, the game allows you to travel back anywhere you like after the credits and there is a New Game+ option for subsequent playthroughs.

Overall, I´d definitely recommend this game. It allows you to immerse yourself in a mystical journey in the Star Wars universe while also having fun gameplay and a thought-provoking story. And it´s up to you which aspect to focus on: story/role-playing, combat, exploration, or collecting.

I would endure basically anything to experience a story in the SWU where I can be a Jedi, explore cool worlds, and fight the Empire. But this game has reached my limit. Between bad writing, cheap animations, and, worst of all, optimization so poor that major combat sequences are essentially unplayable, I cannot stand this game. I would suck it up if the only problem were that the characters were poorly-written cartoons. But if I can't even kill a giant frog monster without frames and inputs dropping faster than battle droids, then what's the point. 

Do not buy this game when it is on sale, do not buy it at full price. That is all.

Edit: I've now finished the game, having refused to waste seventy dollars. My only addendum is first, that the performance never improved (I resorted to minimizing all graphics settings and playing with all other apps and programs on my computer closed down, and at times it was still unplayably stuttery), and second that the combat system is painful. It's fairly restrictive - as far as I can tell, it uses some sort of list of conditions (is character facing enemy, is character in range, is enemy posture lower than some value, etc), rather than say a hitbox-based calculation to determine if something hits or dodges or whatever. This results in extremely inconsistent combat experiences, enemies and characters sliding wildly over the ground, being hit or grabbed seemingly from meters away, and wide open attacks completely missing. They made a one-on-one swordfighting game fairly successfully, but then make you fight giant monsters and groups of enemies, and of course it doesn't feel great.

Even I'm thinking, ""Well, you don't have to write a review for it, you can just keep it to yourself."" But for some reason I just really want to. So if you liked this game, please don't read this.

First off, I'm not sure if it's just me, but when it comes to the difficulty, the best example for why I think it's artificially hard is when you're up against a normal Stormtrooper, once they start charging up their shot and you try to jump over it (like a lot of Jedi would...), their aim just snaps up and shoots you right out of the sky, even though it makes no sense and is just there to annoy you. The character's aren't very well written, nobody's really that interesting, a lot of the characters just feel artificial, in that they're only feeling certain emotions because the writers thought it would be interesting, and most of the random NPC's you meet just don't feel like you'd see them in Star Wars. The bugs are really annoying, like when I went through a really long 15 minute section, and around the end I had to let go of a grate to try and land in a tunnel just below, only for the game to glitch so I couldn't let go, or do anything. And because this game relies on manual check-pointing, I had to do the entire section again. I don't mean to go after anyone, but I just can't understand how people could enjoy it, especially with the boring open levels. To me, even without any bugs, this game just isn't interesting or enjoyable. If you did enjoy it, that's good, don't let my opinion change your mind, we like what we like, it's just that I cannot understand how someone could like this.",1695025244,1701078636,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edited my previous review:
After some reading, I set my shader cache to 10GB and turned off ray tracing but kept DLSS at quality. The game is running pretty smooth for the most part but still suffers from big time frame drops and massive FPS drops that seem to recover quickly but it's jarring to the overall experience. I will still not recommend it till this is 100% perfected and I can play it rightfully at max settings like I should be able to without a hitch. There has also been a patch and a Nvidia driver update that could have contributed to the performance increase. 

I will say the story is rock solid, it's like playing a movie almost, it's so well voice acted and the production value is incredible. It's just a shame that all of that incredible work has been overshadowed by the awful optimisation this game had at release. There are also really odd bugs with electricity graphics on some generators ( the ones you shoot at with BD ) turning into static place holder textures unless I go into the start menu sometimes or reload the level.  No other weird graphical issues in other games like that..

UPDATE
I finished the first play through and glitches/bugs got progressively worse, even with the patches. At one point I could not move forward because of a bug where I couldn't grab a ledge using a mount double jump. Also, several known achievements have not popped up for me. 

It's a great game but if you're an achievement person, the game is currently not worth buying until achievement bugs are fixed. 

Main story line with some exploration was about 30 hours. Performance was never an issue, just the achievement bugs. When I pay $60+ for a game, I expect to get at least 50 hours in and get all the achievements.

Additionally another thing I will stress is you're thinking about getting this game is to play Fallen Order first. Not just for story reasons, but also due to the fact that this is a sequel that improves on so much from the original that it's going to be hard for me to go back to the original.

The moment to moment gameplay is fantastic. I had a gripe in the last game that while the system was overall very polished, there were many times where it felt a bit jank and like deaths weren't your fault and I can safely say whatever fine tuning they did, those moments are gone completely. There's still a few moments where it can feel a little unfair, mainly in regards to being swarmed by enemies and/or being in a very small enclosure, but the combat overall has been perfected. To top it off too you get 5 different stances to choose from in this game compared to the 2 of the previous game and to top it off they all provide very distinct gameplay styles and use cases and I was always torn about which ones I would bring whenever I would switch up the two I could swap between. Another nice touch is that pretty much all of your powers from Fallen Order are unlocked right from the start here which really helps sell this game as a proper extension of the first.

As for level design I'd say there's a marked improvement in that department as well. In Fallen Order it all felt very ""gamey"", levels were levels and all the planets were very straight forward. In Survivor the levels feel much more organic, and while there are fewer planets overall, they're much more involved. A good chunk of the game actually takes place on one planet, with a semi open world on said planet with a lot of fun nooks and crannies. And while it may sound like the environments get really repetitive being on the same planet, this is mostly remedied by a nice variety of locales on said planet which keeps things from looking samey. The open world is also paced out by the few extra planets that are more straight forward linear levels that are a welcome change of pace. Lots of sidequests too that help you get the most out of your open world that are sure to bump a playthrough time to around 40-45 hours.

Exploration is a lot more rewarding as well compared to the last game. While for the most part most of the unlocks are purely cosmetic (another aspect of the game that's greatly improved upon), there are a fair share of goodies that help benefit gameplay beyond the extra stim canisters for BD-1.

Story: I am not the best person for determining narratives in a game. I went in completely unspoiled, the most I had ever seen of even the game itself beyond the vague reveal trailer was about 4 seconds from an ad so I went in about as blind as could be. It was worth it, but it's also not a narrative I'm going to be telling my friends about. Characters are characters, everyone is generally pretty well written, and barring one character in particular I understood everyone's motivations very well. It works for what it is, has some good moments, and there wasn't ever a point where I was groaning. Good length too. I did a decent amount of exploration and clocked in at 28 hours, though I could see this being around 20 hours if you just solely focused on story content.

Overall this is easily a game worth your buy if you were a fan of the first game. It's a shame the optimization has been a bit of a hurdle because this is easily one of if not my favorite game of the year.

Better story, even though the ending is poorly written and rushed and unsavory.

I LOVE souls games and it is unnecessary and so shallow and poorly executed in this series. Only one or two nice boss fights over a hundred or so (Rayvis, Vader?).

Also all invisible walls in fights, some oneshot abilities from the enemies that track your NEW position after dodging (double jump + dash escape isn't enough) feel that the game is hard because it is hardly polished in all the critical and base mechanics a souls-like need to be successful/feel rewarding in playing perfectly and not feel like ""oh no, yet another bug that killed me on the same boss over and over).

It's an EA game alright, release a big AAA license game that inspires from popular genres and not give it any love or respect. At least the story is quite OK in this one, thanks to Merrin's voice actress and Kestis' face doesn't look inbred anymore.

Also, didn't encounter any stutering etc but some fun killing bugs and SO MUCH clipping through objects and untextured matters.

Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?

Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know? Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.

The game is a wonderfully presented follow up to Fallen Order carrying on the story with much of the same great story telling from Fallen Order. The game features a revamped combat system although still similar to the soul's like genre its use of force abilities has been better incorporated from previous games. 

There is plenty of other great ways to spend your time as well given the games bigger focus on a open world allowing more exploration and other side activities such as the holo table mini-game and bounty hunter fights as two examples as well as  other secret areas with unique rewards.

The general quality points are also worth mentioning, the graphics are beautiful and detailed and the audio design is also on point.

The downsides are that the game has had many different performances issues in the multiple versions since launch as well as general bugs and crashes which can affect your overall enjoyment depending on what issues you run into and when.

It's one of them situations where if the game's performance wasn't so bad it would easily have been my game of the year but I'm still a little on the fence with it. Changing settings didn't change the performance ether. I have tried with all forms of upscalling on and off, resizeable BAR turn on, NVIDIA control panel setting changes etc. and the only fix was locking it to 30FPS which caused some animations to look janky.

The game is a very big step up in terms of characters, story and writing, like really good compared to the writing in JFO.

But same cannot be said for combat and movement, it feels worse than JFO and there is more stances, but no fluidity in combat like there was in JFO, movement also isn't that good despite there being more movement options. its just more janky.

Enemy designs are a stepdown too, there isn't enough telegraphing to block to most of the fights with Fauna becomes a dodge game, with very wild flails hitting you in ways that dont make sense and knocking almost all your HP off(especially on GM).

The worlds here aren't also that good or varied compared JFO, which had a lot of distinct environments, here is Koboh, Jedha and a few same bases of empire that's it.

The thing that makes it worst is almost ALL BOSS FIGHTS have mid fight cut-scenes and even on retries, it breaks the flow fucks up camera and made me give up on playing boss fights on GM difficulty, the game isn't refined enough to bother with. And the fact that last act turn in an Arena where you keep fighting waves of enemies after enemies. this is NOT a SOULS LIKE, but it has soul like elements which kind of makes it worse. limited HP and heal with a SHIT TON of platforming makes it very very irritating.

The game is also a little short, i mean main story is shorter than JFO,  there is a lot of extra stuff, which is kinda fun, but not really substantial. 

The game is still not very performative, barely runs 1080p@60 on high.

UPDATE 11/26/23:  It seems my keyboard disconnect issue has been resolved by turning off LED lighting options on the device.  I have tested two separate keyboards with this game and with LED on it will disconnect randomly every few seconds to every few minutes.  I have not experienced the issue with the lighting options off on my keyboard.  Hope this helps someone out there.  

Purchased the game during the Autumn sale and was cautious due to the mixed reviews but I liked the first game and wanted to continue the story.  After install, I gave it a brief play through and was pleasantly surprised that the only issue I experienced were some minor FPS drops.  Then I started it up again later that day and the crashing started.  It's about 50/50 for me whether it will crash after the main menu, which really sucks because the game itself takes about five minutes to load  up.  Do you really want to pay for a game that might take 10-15 minutes just to get going?

Then there's the in game crashes which are terrible and the only saving grace is that there are a decent number of save points so hopefully you don't have to work too hard to get back to where you were when it went down.

On top of all that I seem to have the unique issue of my keyboard turning off and back on repeatedly while playing this game.  On no other software does this issue occur, but in Jedi Survivor it's every couple of minutes.  I will be walking forward and a surprise disconnect will ensure my character keeps walking off the cliff to his death or any other number of mishaps will occur.  

I have tried many different settings and workarounds for these issues with zero success.  I have 7.8 hours in game at the time of this review.  Out of that, I would say about 6.5 hours has been spent troubleshooting and trying different settings within game and Windows OS.  The worst part is that I would even be willing to tolerate the crashing and framer ate problems, but the keyboard thing is impossible to deal with and what's the answer to that?  -  ""We recommend playing with a controller""  

Well no thanks.  I play on PC and have been using keyboard and mouse since 1986 to game.  If you're going to offer a game listed at $70 for the PC, I think the least you can do is ensure it's playable in that environment, which is something EA clearly didn't do and they don't feel bad at all for price gouging consumers on the lemons they've been selling.

It all really sucks because the game looks great and the story line is interesting.  The actual gameplay, when you get to enjoy it, is fun and combat is exciting.   Too bad that's all obstructed by the numerous issues which have plagued this game since launch.  I feel sorry for the people who put hard work into this product only to have it marred by terrible management of the PC port.

- CRASHES ALL THE TIME, like 5 times in a hour.  Some levels seem worse than others.  
- Stupidly slow game load time.  Every time you load the game, it ""optimizes"" itself, then runs like crap.
- Some mechanics, like the roller bombs,  definitely needed more polish

I can't say I had too many issues overall, but maybe my setup was able to brute force its way through the game performance wise (RTX 4090 + 5950X OC'ed).  I played the entire game at max settings, RT on, 4K resolution and none of the FSR junk.  I simply used NVIDIA freestyle to get some sharpening on the TAA in the game and overall the entire game was smooth sailing.  My only complaint is this game should have had DLSS 2 and 3 with Frame Generation for 4 series nvidia cards.  There is no reason to exclude this from the game considering it is UT4 engine unless AMD told the studio to exclude it, which is dirty marketing.  The Frame Generation alone would have made the game smooth as butter for anyone with a 4xxx series card to overcome the CPU issues with RT on.

NOTE (edited):  They finally added DLSS 3 and Frame Generation.  Gave the game a few tests and it is smooth as butter overall (except when there is a traversal stutter).  Wish it was in this state when it was released, but better late than never I guess.

If you are on an nvidia card, be sure to force ReBar ON for this game using nvidia inspector, improves performance and has no issues in doing so.  Helps overcome CPU limited scenarios with RT on in this specific game.

All of that being said, I enjoyed the game overall and the story as well.  It made a lot of improvements over the first game (which I really enjoyed) and the open world in spots was not too random to distract you from the main story.  I really hope a sequel is made for this game!  Such an enjoyable series of games so far.

Star Wars Jedi Survivor, the latest addition to the Star Wars gaming universe, is a breathtaking experience that surpasses its predecessor, Jedi Fallen Order, in every way imaginable. From the vast and immersive landscapes to the meticulously crafted characters, this game is a testament to the dedication and talent of the developers at Respawn Entertainment.

One of the standout features of Star Wars Jedi Survivor is the awe-inspiring beauty of its landscapes. From lush forests to desolate desert plains, the game often feels like an open world begging to be explored. Each environment is crafted with incredible attention to detail, transporting players to a galaxy far, far away like never before. The seamless integration of exploration and storytelling creates a sense of wonder and immersion that few games can match.

Respawn Entertainment has taken player feedback to heart and improved upon every negative aspect of Jedi Fallen Order. The gameplay mechanics are refined and polished, offering a seamless blend of lightsaber combat, force abilities, and platforming. The controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing players to unleash their inner Jedi with precision and grace. The challenging difficulty curve strikes a perfect balance, rewarding skillful play and strategic thinking.

The characters in Star Wars Jedi Survivor are nothing short of extraordinary. The protagonist, Cal, and his trusty little droid companion steal the spotlight with their endearing personalities and unwavering determination. The attention to detail in their designs and animations breathes life into these characters, making every interaction feel genuine and emotionally resonant. The voice acting is top-notch, further enhancing the immersive experience. The game effortlessly weaves humor and heartfelt moments into its storytelling, creating a captivating narrative that keeps players invested from start to finish.

Another commendable aspect of Star Wars Jedi Survivor is the ability to customize Cal and his droid. The game offers a wide range of cosmetic options, allowing players to personalize their journey through the galaxy. Whether it's changing Cal's outfit or customizing the droid's appearance, these customization options add a layer of personalization that enhances the connection between the player and the game world.

I can't express enough how much I love Star Wars Jedi Survivor. It's a testament to the skill and passion of the developers at Respawn Entertainment. Despite the game's relatively short development time, the final product is a masterclass in game design and storytelling. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to step into the shoes of a Jedi and embark on this incredible adventure.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a true masterpiece that surpasses its predecessor in every way. The breathtaking landscapes, improved gameplay mechanics, detailed characters, exceptional voice acting, and engaging storytelling combine to create an unforgettable gaming experience. The ability to customize Cal and his droid adds a personal touch that further deepens the connection with the game.

MY OLD REVIEW:It's outrageous and unfair that the people involved in the game design, music, animations and script are all marred by the horrendous performance of the game itself. Unreal engine4, nvidia, respawn's dev team I am not sure who to point fingers at, but the result is all the same with ""AAA"" titles: put the product out before it is actually done. Investors that push game release time over quality, burn in ******* ****. 

I feel this way because my game has crashed MID CUT SCENE and then when I continue the game from the latest save, it PROCEEDS after the cut scene and there is 0 way (that I know of at this time) to re watch the cut scenes. I literally replayed the intro because I missed the post-senator capture cut scene due to a crash. Without that scene, the next sequence is CONFUSING for people who need story to back the immersion of the game. 

The lore is important to me personally (good or bad) because I am invested in this universe and if the game is only going to use 50% of my cpu and gpu (which i spent a **** ton of money on) and not give me above 50 frames in a good hallway, then that defeats the purpose of upgrading my rig and purchasing ""AAA"" games. 

Do better gaming industry. 

(everything else about this game is incredible, but I do not recommend a purchase at this time unless you like error windows every 20 min)

It is not like other games where you have to start over with your journey, but it actually feels like the continuation of Cal's journey and the roller coaster of emotions he carries. Not just with himself and his past, but also with his companions.

The missions are good. Even not having a fully open world experience doesn’t feel wrong. The music, as always, is top class. And the acting, it’s too damn awesome. Cal’s character really grows from one game to the next one, and every turn you take with his story really blows your mind.

It’s been a while since I enjoyed a game of Star Wars like this one. I do recommend it since it feels different to other previous games, but at the same time doesn't make you feel alienated to the SW world.",1700932387,1700932387,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Since the follow up patch, it's improved and plays much much better now.  

Technical aspects aside, the game improves on every aspect built on from FO.  Bigger worlds, more detail, more signs of normal life instead of abandoned areas.  Expanded combat options, environmental navigation and side quests.  A story that doesn't reset you at square one like so many open world sequels rely on to force you to re-learn all the skills you had previously.  A story that also raises the stakes while connecting to the old story in a great scene/fight.  

It's pretty much exactly what I wanted to see in a sequel.

Yet this game is broken. It's genuinely unplayable. The developers and publishers have had 7 months now to fix it, and they haven't. Instead they've focused on trivial issues, not the game-breaking issues affecting tens of thousands of PC players around the world.

Please, people, do NOT buy this game even if the deluxe version is on sale for $30 (1/3 normal price). It's just not worth it for 2 hours of partial gameplay before the game completely breaks on you and prevents you from progressing any further in the story.

I have a 6800-XT Graphics card, a Ryzen 9 5900X CPU, and 64 GB of RAM. I have what I believe is a high-end computer and it is more than what is recommended to be able to handle running this game. On the lowest settings with no ray tracing or anything on, I am getting, at best, an unstable 60 FPS and my GPU is being pushed to 100% utilisation within 10 minutes of loading any save, which should not be happening.
On top of that, my game is crashing every single time the unskippable cutscene for landing on the second planet, Koboh, occurs. I am hardlocked from playing past the first planet, the tutorial planet essentially. I paid $60 to be able to play a complete, unbroken AAA game. The only reason I have 6 hours in this game is because I tried troubleshooting it to no avail after my refund was denied after playing for 100 minutes.

So unless you rush to the second planet and don't bother to immerse yourself in the world or environment and skip dialogue and story cutscenes, then you will likely think the game is fine so long as you have no issues with low fps, clipping issues, and visual bugs. Why? Because the tutorial area is probably the only place that's been given the development time it needs. Again this is a AAA title that's been out for over half a year now. And that starting area takes, on average, 2 hours to complete by design to prevent refunds.
So unless you rush and ignore the story entirely, by the time you are able to find out if the game will work for you or not, it's too late.

And the thing is, it's not like this game-breaking bug hasn't been known since launch, because it has been there since launch! And they STILL haven't fixed it despite literally tens of thousands of people complaining and reporting issues with it on the PC port!

Mind, I want to play this game. I want to enjoy the story. I want to immerse myself in it. I want to support the developers and game creators. But how can I when I can't even play the game I paid for?

Seriously, if you really, really want to play this game, buy a PS5 and play it on console. They clearly don't care about the PC port and focused entirely on making it a console-only game. Maybe Denuvo has something to do with this, or maybe it doesn't. Regardless, I very strongly urge you all to not try playing this game on PC as it is oh-so-very and irredeemably broken to the point of being unplayable.",1683940082,1700907662,False,1,0,0.478947371244430542,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the game started having issues again further into the second world. As soon as I reached a more vast area, the fps dropped again, stutters started happening again, graphics went down again somehow despite me not touching any setting (I have no clue what's happening here, but I swear the graphics look horrible and pixelated all of a sudden, I suspect there might be issues with the shader compilation or something). Mind you, the game is still playable for me, however it's pretty annoying on the eyes. It's wild cause while my laptop is no longer on the high-end spectrum, it still has pretty good specs (I satisfy the recommended requirements of the game) yet it's not enough for the game to run decently.

I was willing to let it go if it was just a problem of the first world, but this seems to be a consistent problem. The game is clearly either incomplete or badly implemented, either way it's unacceptable for an AAA-game sold for 70 bucks, but I guess I should've expected it considering that it's EA. On top of that, it seems that PC players are getting the short end of the stick in the last few years with these badly released games. It also seems that companies are cutting back on proper beta testing and are using the audience for beta testing against their will instead. There's no other explanation. 

I'm a bit disappointed cause I really loved the first game and couldn't wait to play the sequel. At this point I don't think I can ask for a refund as I'm on 5+ hours of gameplay, and I was going to play the game mostly for the story anyway, so I'll just play the game on 30 fps and suck it up I guess. Mind you, the gameplay is awesome, and so far I've seen a couple of improvements in the gameplay (the best one so far for me is the fast travel between meditation circles like in Tomb Raider, god bless) and a few positive additions that I'm excited to explore further, but it's a shame that the game is in such a poor state.

[u]TL;DR:[/u] If you're only interested in the story, don't care much about performance or graphics, and are willing to stand a sub-par experience for the story, go for it. However, in the state that the game is in currently, I'd say wait until the game is either on sale or at a better state later on when performance fixes will (hopefully) be released.

[b]ORIGINAL REVIEW (at 2.3 hours)[/b]

There is definitely something wrong with the first world. I had consistently max 30 fps there, lots of stuttering and fps drops, and graphics looked off even if I was on high graphics. Just started the second world and the game improved drastically; fps increased, graphics seem to look better somehow, no stuttering so far. I'll have to see how it behaves in more ""busy"" areas and in combat though, will update the review once I make more progress. 

I'd say if you're willing to let your eyes bleed a little you can push through the first world, it's still playable in my opinion. The game does indeed use a lot of CPU, I consistently had 50+ percentage of use throughout the whole session, and memory usage was also pretty high, but thankfully I have plenty of RAM to spare. We'll have to see if we get any optimization patches, but so far apart from these technical issues the game is awesome.

Even though it's at times frustrating and the system requirements are steep, the overall entertaining gameplay and compelling story make more than up for it.
Play Fallen Order first if you haven't already.


To many, Jedi: Survivor may be one of the biggest disappointments of 2023. A game with much promise, yet riddled with bugs and bad performance. From my experience since release, with currently almost 100h and on my third playthrough, I can say that I haven't encountered any grave bugs, and the number of times the game crashed is still in single digits.
The performance is okay. My RX 6650 has no issues reaching 60fps with high/epic settings @1080p. Ray-Tracing is still fine with 30-40fps. I tend to automatically reduce my settings a bit when I enter certain open-space areas with nighttime shading or lots of dust. This is where performance updates could really improve upon. Speaking of which, while I didn't encounter any big issues, I also didn't experience any noticable performance uplift from the updates. The only thing that happened is that start-up of the game takes forever now (on an SSD), as there's a lot of shader-compiling going on. As always, YMMV.

After all the drama about the tech, what's left? Jedi: Survivor improves meaningfully on Fallen Order, both in story and gameplay. The presentation is top-notch, as is the acting.
The plattforming is never unfair, but at times a bit far-fetched. 
The puzzles are, if anything, too easy. Same goes for combat, unless you play on one of the harder difficulties or decide to limit yourself to only one of the five combat-styles.

Combat is, however, where frustration may rear its ugly head: getting trapped against walls, stunlocks, an evasion-range that is too small (especially in direct comparison to Fallen Order), the odd input lag now and then, and some enemy types with one-shot attacks and/or insane hitboxes on grab attacks.
In general though, Jedi: Survivor manages to get across that feeling of gracefully dancing through or around your opponents with a lightsaber.

At launch I gave this game a negative review and while it is unacceptable to release games in rushed, unfinished and buggy states they at the very least have since fixed the game

I pre-ordered this game but refunded it at release and bought it now again on a Steam sale and my review now is based on the state of the game today not how it launched

Overall the game is amazing, it has a great story, great gameplay, amazing graphics and a vast variety of locations to explore and personally I feel like Jedi Survivor is better than Fallen Order in every aspect

The biggest change is the addition of stances you can equip, this really lets you focus your combat into the style you like the most this time around there is even a blaster stance which is quite strong actually if used right but yet is still balanced and not overpowered

Personally I used single saber and dual wield throughout most of the game simply because these were my combat preferences but all the stances have their unique strengths and weaknesses and they all have very different playstyles so it adds a lot of replayability to the game. The game is also setup with the stances in mind with locations to change stances frequently where they predict players might want to use specific strategies so that is another way to play the game

The new open world structure of the game really adds a lot without making the game feel unnecessarily longwinded or empty. All parts of the game still feel handcrafted and clearly are

Jedi Survivor really innovates and pushes the boundaries upon what they did with Jedi Fallen Order and yet keeps that strong foundation they built in the previous game. They got rid of stuff that didn't work and kept stuff players liked, while changing stuff that people liked but not in the way it was implemented

For example they've really expanded on collectibles making it not just be oh this is something you need to backtrack for to instead being something that is fun and interactive to get. Many collectibles are tied to puzzles you need to solve that are fully optional but reward some useful things from cosmetic unlocks to gameplay related unlocks

They really focused on player optimisation this game by adding a lot more styles and appearances you can unlock for your saber, blaster pistol, Cal himself and for his clothes as well as for BD1

The original challenge of Jedi Fallen Order has remained even though Cal is now more powerful and you now have the new saber stances. But the challenge level has been kept more or less the same by providing challenging boss/legendary enemy fights as well as challenging bounty hunters to fight as well as just in normal encounters you are tossed more enemies now that are really challenging

Seeing the droids from prequels and Clone Wars return is such a treat and they really add so much to the game but yet Survivor still expands on the Empire enemies you will face as well as a new faction. There are also a bunch of new creature enemies to fight

I really found myself struggling to stop playing for the night and go to bed and this game did cause me to have a few sleepless nights where I just couldn't help myself but play all the way through the night.

From a performance perspective, this game feels like it's in an alpha state. Maybe even pre-alpha.

Now i had it crash for the third time in the elevator cutscene, once i got the error running out of memory for graphics. Ok
Crashed again on 1080p and mid presets...
The cutscenes ran fine at release and now not.

There are massive open world areas containing a huge variety of enemies all ranging in difficulty. There is a lot to discover in each area including secret unlocks/collectables and Easter eggs. Each world has some of the best graphics and vistas I have seen in a game so far.

PROS:
- Combat. Vastly improved combat to Fallen Order. It's the same system but with so much more added on top.
- Fantastic story. While fairly self-contained, the story is gripping and real.
- Graphics, beautiful.
- Characters. This cast of characters might be my favourite in Star Wars and given so many layers and complexity.
- Music. Holy crap the soundtrack is INSANE.
- Cast. Incredible acting, particularly from Cameron Monaghan, Debra Wilson, and Noshir Dalal.
- Little tidbits. Developers embracing memes will never not be amazing. From boss fights, to cosmetics, I was smiling the entire time.

CONS:
- Stability. I'm averaging about a crash each play session. While annoying it's not *terrible*, just make sure you save often.
- Performance. I have a decent rig and it holds up mostly. There are elements of pop-in, loading graphics, and the occasional frame stutter, but it's mostly a smooth experience.
- World. Instead of several decently large worlds, you get one MASSIVE world (and I mean massive), one large, and three small ones.

  That aside... Please play this game!! I played the original about 4 times, maybe 5 and this one I have already played twice and I will definitely play it again and again. Why? The story is stellar. Like nothing I have seen from a AAA title in the better part of a decade. It sucks you in with familiar characters and you get to see them grow in an actual character arc. Also, some of the twist and turns it throws at you are really well played out and don't come off as forced or lacking in sound reason which so often seems to be the case in modern story telling. 

 The combat picks up right where you left off and it just dog piles on with great new moves and combo potential and I love the styles they added... pistol and saber being a favorite. It does a great job with the power curve, you don't feel OP'ed at any point in the game and the boss battles are very well thought out and memorable.

1. Waited for the stupid EA app to install. Massive lag spike (>1 fps) in the main menu and splash screens. Then waited for it to ""optimise game files..."" Then it crashed during the opening cutscene...

2. Rebooted the game. Managed to get into the actual game. Froze again within the first 15 mins of gameplay (during which I was handcuffed...)

3. Disabled the EA overlay (which I didn't even realise was running...) and changed from borderless windowed to fullscreen. Froze again in the exact same spot...

4. Didn't even get into the game this time. Changed all the graphics settings to low, skipped the opening cutscene and got frozen on a black screen...

5. Turned off the Steam overlay, made sure to not touch ANY buttons during that bit that froze me the last few times, and it actually worked!! ... for about 10 mins. And then it froze again...

So I guess I'll refund it and wait a year or two...

Looks like a fun game though. Hope I'll be able to play it one day.......",1698222995,1700797972,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was running a 3060ti and although the new patch 7.5 helped fix some of the lag spikes , the game still runs poorly. There are lag spikes from as the moment you start , and it only gets worse as you progress towards bigger enemies and groups. Jedi survivor is a great game, with amazing polished combat that is refined from the original, Its just the performance which is still a major issue for PC gamer who have a decent or even high settings setup. If you have A PS5 or another console i would recommend getting it there. In PS5 The 7.5 patch allowed players to have 60 fps and a optimization setting which removed raytracing. However if you still have it on PC removing ray tracing and putting it to performance mode can help keep you around 60 frames. but by any means if you can get it on console,  DO NOT GET IT ON PC.",1700785547,1700785547,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

(update 11/23/23: still needs loads of work for stability and enabling basic advertised features like RT on a single planet STILL being broken...but it has improved.  Some.  Everything below still stands, as well as the not-recommended review)


game is marred by crashes and requirements to change graphics settings based on what part you are playing and how much the engine can do.  its most basic settings on a 4090 and 12900k still get you crashes and errors.  turn rtx on here, not there...restart when you adjust anything...it just gets tedious and boring to get working.  sitting thru shader compilation is not an issue to me on any game, it is meant to lessen stutter and speed loading and reduce pop-in...but this game just simply does not improve at all with shader comp.

the story is excellent, battles and combat are awesome, theres secrets galore.  but you cant enjoy anything they made because it will not be a playable experience until maybe september (theres gonna be lots-o patchig required is what im saying).

You are granted with the most of the skills in the first game -for instance, reflecting blaster bolts while sprinting and BD-1's hack abilities- from the start so you don't need to relearn the whole stuff. The game is build upon progression. Even though you find Cal stronger and wiser than in the end of the first game, you still learn new things and improve throughout the game, which doesn't bore you and still does feel original. I can virtually see no major imperfections regarding the story and the mechanics, it is absolutely perfect to say the least.

Well, the gameplay is unfortunately not so perfect as the game itself, there are some significant performance issues but it doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, for me at least. I'm using a Hp Omen laptop with i7-13700hx, RTX4080 mobile, 32GB RAM, and 2TB SSD and i' having on average 60 to 90 fps on high settings without ray tracing because ray tracing brings way less than it takes. I've tried on epic and medium settings and find high to be the midpoint for fps and quality. The least fps i get is around 30 and it is still perfectly playable. The RAM usually goes around 15 to 19GBs depending on the current workload of the pc. One thing i've noticed is that when im using the holomap on mantis the fps drops to 10-15 and it lags, yet i can still choose where to go. I think all these are as they are because the game has just been released, after some patches i hope it will run way smoother.

To conclude, the game itself is perfect and excells at being a sequel to an already succesful game. Although you may not get the best performance out of it, when these performance issues have been dealth with, which almost definately will happen, i reckon you should just go, buy and play this brilliant game.",1682719128,1700775397,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

For everyone familiar with the DMC 5 story, i strongly believe that removing DENUVO will fix all these problems, EA is just too greedy, they are willing to sacrifice their game and its performance in order to stop the few ohoi savy laddies sailing the seven seas with a black flag. FU EA.

The story is on par with what you could expect from a movie and the music adds to the delightful experience - including a sparingly use of classic themes used at just the right times for the most impact.

The only part I felt held it back was the occasional glitch and problems with ray tracing leading to a few crashes. Hopefully this is to be ironed out.

I liked wider variety of styles, though I don't understand the limitation to have only two at once (lore-wise, not gameplay-wise). I'd prefer lightsaber forms (I-VII) over most of these styles - no game adapted them except KotORs (to my knowledge), so it would be awesome to finally see it.
Maybe in the next game, perhaps.
Since I like the universe I also enjoyed hunting most collectibles, they also offered more interesting puzzles to solve, though I find Fallen Order ones more interesting as they involved some backstory, an in-depth background. Make no mistake though, there are LOTS of collectibles in Survivor.

This game brings back all the elements that made the first game great in the first place and dials it to an eleven. Lightsabers have never been more customizable, your drip can be on point as you die repeatedly to the various faunas that really make you question your title as a Jedi. 

Also, there is so much more to do beyond just exploring. The mini-games also have intriguing dialogue and interesting mechanics behind them, it makes exploring feel all the more rewarding. The combat is unbelievably fresh and insanely satisfying, especially when you unlock additional powers in later chapters. 

Overall, if you like Cal, lightsabers, and drip - it's a must have.

The patch corrupted a file and as a result failed to install which didn't become apparent until I'd tried to update the game at least 12 times, validating files and clearing caches in between. Once it did actually update, it performed the same, and crashed within 5 minutes of loading the save. Literally was jumping across platforms and it crashed. Fantastic update there...

Specs for performance comparison:
Ryzen 7 5800x3d
ASUS TUF 4070ti
64GB DDR4 RAM @ 3200MHz
Game loading from SSD
Playing at 1440p, Adaptive Sync, Epic Preset, HDR on, Raytracing off

I preordered the game, so I had no way to know ahead of time how terrible the performance would be on launch. I tried to play it and gave up after less than an hour. I saw the response and decided to wait. Eventually forgot about it due to work and other games. 

Just came back to it yesterday and found the performance to be better, but still not brilliant, dipping to high 40s in some specific cases, which is pretty abysmal for my machine, but I can deal with it as it really only matters if there's stuttering, of which there is minimal. There is a bit of shoddy game design in two early bosses in the Rancor and Spawn of Oggdo, where they give very little time to react and their tracking is near perfect, so you need to have near perfect timing, or just do chip damage (especially Oggdo).

The issue is that it's there's more bugs than an ant hill.
- General oddness here and there regarding enemy movements
- Grabbing onto walls that you shouldn't be able to, only to not be able to let go
- Got sent flying across a room once for no reason that I could see
- Random invisible walls in the middle of open fields
- Dodging sometimes having absolutely no effect, and getting hit anyway

But this sort of stuff was kinda just the jank that I've come to expect from EA. What absolutely killed the game for me was two save game breaking bugs.

The first was that for no reason while walking around in the wilderness on the first planet, the game crashed so hard that my PC needed to be hard rebooted. When it finally came back, my save file was corrupted, with apparently no backup available, despite a backup being present in the save folder. I cannot get a clear answer on whether or not the EA app supports cloud saves, which really annoying, because when I first ran the game after having not touched it in months, it asked if I wanted to use my local save or the cloud save? Even if they do exist, there's apparently no way to force them to sync, so that save is gone. And I should point out that this is a known issue in this and one other area, but no fix yet.

The game crashed again, requiring a reboot again, triggered by buying the first skill upgrade during the tutorial so, yeah good. Started again, completed the tutorial and got to the first workbench only to find that my preorder and deluxe content was missing. Found the fix (disable, run, quit, enable, run again), and moved on to the first planet, only to find that the game reset my level ups, priorite pickups, and stims. So I lost resources because the game just decided I did.

So my options are: Continue the game in a nerfed state with who know what other random penalties I didn't notice, or start again for the 4th time in less than 24 hours and hope that the game doesn't screw me over this time, with no way to predict what might happen next.

Thanks EA, you absolute travesty of a company.",1691411596,1700725294,False,5,1,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False
1774580,151261886,76561198000650119,0,5,3382,0,3382,1687704684,"The performance is definitely a sour spot for the game. It is very embarrassing that they released the game in this state as they fumbled a great game by doing so. However the game builds on everything the first game designed itself around. There is far less backtracking and if you do need to backtrack, they've put in dozens of shortcuts to make it quicker.

The gameplay is a definite upgrade through from Fallen Order. The variety of weapon stances and enemies keeps the game interesting, as they've massively increased enemy variety and tactics. Additionally the customization is far more deep between the lightsaber configurations, your outfit, your skill point distribution, and which 2 stances you wish to run around with.

If you liked Fallen Order's story, you'll likely enjoy Survivor's story. It isn't one of the best pieces of Star Wars storytelling but it is very solid, which tracks with Respawn's track record.



An odd change was that the last game had 4 planets of fairly evenly portioned content while most of the content in Survivor is on one specific planet with brief 1-2 hour detours on 2-3 other planets. Aside from the minor 1-mission side content, the Fallen Order had the forests of Kashyyyk, the wetlands of Bogano, the rocky mountains of Zeffo, and a mixture of swamps and mountains for Dathomir. In this game, you have the scientific facility of Koboh's Shattered Moon, the desert ruins of Jedha, and Koboh. Koboh is largely rugged cliffs and valleys with a dark swamp area, desolate spires, and caves. There is some imperial bases and military bases that work as differing scenario in the game but the overwhelming majority of your time will be on Koboh, as Koboh is the main hub and several story areas connect to Koboh. So while there may be a bit more diversity in scenario, you will spend most of your time in this one area as opposed to it being paced across these other areas because Koboh has a massive amount of content compared to the rest of the game.

Overall it's a good game that you could pour dozens of hours into and relax or go sweaty, turn up the difficulty, and get demolished by double frogs.",1700725215,1700725215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just as good, if not better, than Fallen Order. Just finished the main quest line @26.5 hours. Still have plenty left to explore. Less locations than the first game (you pretty much bounce between two planets the whole story), but the areas are bigger. Enemy variety is very good. Overall, it is a more condensed version of Fallen Order, which is a good thing imo. Less focused on taking you to every planet in the galaxy and more focused on a immersive, engaging story.

Performance issues seem to be a case-by-case basis. Game ran just about perfectly for me on high (a few things set to ultra) settings without anything crazy for hardware (9900K, 2080Ti, 32gb DDR4). Graphics were beautiful, cut scenes were smooth, and even in intense fights my frame rate hardly ever dipped below 60fps. The only time I experienced lag was each time I accessed the holo-table on the Mantis, which is not a big deal at all.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of Fallen Order. Another solid entry for the Jedi series. Can't say it will run perfectly on your PC given all the difficulties others are having. All I can say is that it ran really well for me and I definitely think it is worth giving a shot.",1700708768,1700708768,True,2,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The new stances are interesting and the fact that you don't feel like you've gone backwards and weak again (like most squeals do) is great.

Yes is would... Providing it's on a sale. After all, if you do get the performance issues then you can always try for a refund.

This game is beautiful, the graphics are stellar and the art style is wonderful, each location in the game has a unique yet familiar style. There is no mistaking that this is set in the Star Wars universe.

The Story is interesting and enthralling, Cal's story continues to be fun and entertaining, with a health dash of Star Wars lore added in and a few minor references to legacy characters sprinkled in to remind you when in the Star Wars timeline Cal's story is taking place. I personally found the story to be solid, intriguing and at times heartfelt and heart wrenching. To the writing team I say, Bravo!

The game play and mechanics are solid and have a good ""feel"" to them, if you enjoyed how Fallen Order played, this game is more of the same, tightened up with most all the kinks worked out. I played perfectly fine on mouse and keyboard.

Overall I really enjoyed Jedi Survivor, I'd highly recommend it to fans of Star Wars, especially if they played and enjoyed Fallen Order. I'd also recommend playing Fallen Order first before playing Survivor, though you could play this without having played Fallen Order, it could be a detriment to your enjoyment of this game if you hadn't already meet the cast of characters from the first game. 

TLDR: It's a great game and a must play for Star Wars fans.",1700696089,1700696174,True,4,0,0.561210453510284424,0,True,False,False

Survivor is a perfect sequel to Fallen Order in my eyes. The gameplay is vastly improved upon from the first game by adding new stances, gadgets, and force abilities, and it also just feels way more responsive compared to Fallen Order. There's tons of unique story and side bosses, and also, an entire bounty hunter side questline to experience.

The story is absolutely incredible. It's easily one of the best Star Wars stories ever told. The characters feel real and have genuine reactions with each other that make you care for them. Unlike the Battle Scars book which read like some weird fan fiction from someone who didn't understand the characters at all. Like Fallen Order, the voice acting is incredible, and I think Cameron deserves some kind of award for his performance as Cal in this one.

I played this game with an RTX 3080 12GB, i5 12600kf, and 32GB RAM on an SSD. I played on Epic settings with FSR on before they added DLSS, and I would get around 45-60fps at Rambler's Reach on Koboh. Everywhere else on Koboh was 70-90fps, and all the other planets averaging between 70-120fps. After several patches and the addition of DLSS, I get ~10-15fps more than before in most cases.

Overall, I highly recommend this game if you were a fan of the first game, or a fan of Star Wars in general as this is probably my favorite Star Wars game now (previously Republic Commando). Buy it on sale and hope you can run it.",1700695774,1700695774,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's clear they have listened to both the negatives and positives of Fallen Order, and improved everything again, I'm sure once they’ve fixed the performance issues this game will be regarded as one of the best Star Wars games out there.

Some things of improvements:
- Planets are more fleshed out and bigger than Fallen Order.
- 2 New Forms (3 if you include Duel being an actual one this time).
- Way more customisation to Cal and not just Poncho colours (yes the Poncho is back).
- Improved Customisation of BD-1 and Cal's Lightsaber. from hundreds of colours and patterns, as well as being able to adjust the condition of the material.
- More enemy factions and variety of enemies (B1s are hilarious as always) 
- Somehow made the already great movement/climbing mechanics feel even better and more satisfying. 


Great New Features:
- The saloon is amazing, you can find people in the world to invite to it ‘more lively, one also gives you access to a new mini game, but Skoova Stev is the best.
- Fast Travel
- Perk slot system to add more variety to builds
- Various creatures you can use to traverse the wider maps.

I would 100% recommended getting this game now if you can tough out the performance issue, if not then when the patch comes through.

[b] The Good: [/b]

- The writing has taken a step up from the previous game. It's still very ""Star Wars"" (""I hate sand.."") but the acting performances come through much clearer and with the relationships we've already built with the characters from the first game, it's very nice to see some character development.

- It took me ~30hrs to 100% explore all planets and complete the game on Jedi Master difficulty. There's a good amount of content to explore in the three main planets, and those open worlds are huge. Much less linear than in Fallen Order. 

- The game settings are much more accessible (FOV slider lets gooooo).

- The enemy diversity is a big plus, between the Empire, Bedlam Raiders, and Fauna there's close to 30 different enemy types, excluding bosses. 

- The worlds feel much more like they exist in the star wars universe, rather than separate ideas forced to fit into the star wars mold.

- The Force Tears are a very fun mechanic, like Subsistence missions from the MGS games. [spoiler] The one where you fight two rancor at once made me pull my hair out [/spoiler]

[b] The Meh: [/b]

- The majority of the game is spent bouncing around two planets. While it makes sense for the story, I personally would have enjoyed a bit more varied locations to explore. 

- While Survivor uses the same engine as Fallen Order, Unreal 4, it does look better in the some of the lighting and animation departments. A lot of work and polish obviously went into that. However, the textures fall short. Plastic-y textures and blown out sunlight are the biggest complaints. Even with brightness at 25%, many times when standing indoors or in a cave, looking out a door, window, etc. the sunlight would completely blow out the visibility outside, which isn't normally a big deal, but makes some puzzles or locations hard to see. One type of the collectibles are only found by finding floating green particle effects, which are very tough to see in bright environments, like outdoors in direct sunlight.

- Speaking of collectibles, there are so damn many. Over 500 including Echos, lightsaber parts, cosmetics (most have a color pallet found seperately), and trade resources, makes most of the game play loop somewhat grading. That being said, if you don't care about picking up every little thing it wont affect your play experince. 

[b] The Bad: [/b]

- I personally didn't have many problems with consistent crashes, Throughout the game however I had constant visual bugs. Such as artifacts and fabric stretching. 

- The game altogether made my PC a space heater, from when I launch to probably 10 minutes after the game closes.

- Hitboxes and input timing can be wonky at times. All the way from dodging un-blockable attacks by dashing into an enemy to my block inputs being ignored. (Partially a skill issue, but worth a mention for how many times it wasn't)

- A few locations are very sparse with the save point locations, generally not an issue, but makes a couple places frustrating. 

- The EA App integration is absolute doggy doo-doo. Launching the game signs me out of EA, the ""background service"" does not close when the game does, EA is just generally a scummy company and it's on full display here. 

[b] The Spoilers: [/b]

- [spoiler] The Bode twist was some masterful storytelling, big plus, never saw it coming. [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] The Cal/Merrin love story would've felt forced in the first game, but their relationship development felt natural inside Survivor's (and Cal and Merrin's) story [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] The High Republic tie-ins were cool, but it still makes me wish for The Old Republic. [/spoiler]

[b] Conclusion: [/b]

Jedi Survivor, at it's bones, is a really great game. If it had a different publisher and was given more time to optimize, it would have been game of the year. But EA's money grubbing hands killed most chances of that. With time, updates, and hopefully expansions, Jedi Survivor could be a really, really great game. 

Overall, I recommend Jedi Survivor, with the exception to wait for a heavy sale before you buy..",1690665554,1700683841,True,2,0,0.529773533344268799,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER!!  Let me just get this out of the way: This game came out buggy and un-optimized, which means it clearly was not ready for release.  At the time of writing this review, there are STILL people having issues with this game.

C'mon game developers, seriously?  I know this is a phrase thrown around a lot for stuff like this, but we don't pay $60 - $70 to beta test your game.  We pay because we expect something to be completed when it comes out.  A lazily hashed together 'We're Sorry' notice is not going to sway the minds of your fans/followers if this is how you treat them.  Plus, this should've been fixed by now, though I suppose EA couldn't give a **** less by this point.  Please stop doing this and keep fixing this game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, with that out of the way, let me give you a run down of the quick Pros and Cons:

Pros:

- Extensive combat system, which is a stark improvement over the last game.
- BEAUTIFUL worlds and atmospheres (AFTER the bug and slight optimization patches).
- Incredible scores that FEEL like Star Wars.  Whoever composed this stuff must be the reincarnation of John Williams.
- More enemies, and much like before, each with their own unique mechanics that require cunning maneuvers.
- Plenty of minigames and extra activities for a single player game.
- NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS.
- An interesting and compelling story following Cal Kestis, who really is more likable between these two games.
- Many achievements for those who want to 100% the game.
- Cool unlockables, gear, and more freedom on customization for Cal, BD-1, and the weaponry.
- The ability to mod the game on the PC version, changing the game to make it even more hilarious/fun.
- Some dismemberment, which is better than none!
- And many smaller details I'm likely missing!

Cons:

- Game required multiple patches after launch (It's still a mess now).
- Optimization is a mess on PC.  Highly recommend you play this on a console unless you have a super computer.
- Slightly awkward dodge mechanic that requires getting used to (Especially after the previous game).
- Requiring the use of EA's launcher.
- And perhaps some other things that I haven't noticed in my playthrough.

The pros do outweigh the cons, hence the thumbs-up for this review.  However, again, this does not excuse the state in which the game came out in, and the state it's in now.  If you're a Star Wars fan, like me, and are willing to bear through the issues, there really is something special to be had with this game.  If you're an average-Joe looking for something souls-like to fuel the addiction, I would suggest playing something different until this gets fixed on PC.

Its far and away better than Jedi Fallen Order with each world being much larger with more to discover, more to fight, and see. The combat compared to Fallen Order is also so much better and much more varied, as you would expect with more stances and the inclusion of a blaster. The increased amount of customization of basically everything, from your clothing and its colors, to hair styles, beards to the blaster and the increased amount of lightsaber parts and to top it off, BD-1 gets parts to customize as well which is a welcomed inclusion. 

I did enjoy the story, it didn't feel pointless like everything we did meant nothing in terms of achieving anything. There were parts of the story that I could see a mile away, but despite that, they still had some impact. I felt the game had good length, even if you aren't trying to find everything. New Game Plus is another welcome inclusion, and I understand certain aspects of things not carried over, as it would break the flow of the game and actually just outright break the game.

I would recommend the game for sure, but do keep in mind it does have performance issues, so if you can get past the occasional crashes and frame drops and stutters, you will find a good and enjoyable star wars game with good gameplay and a good story.",1700677623,1700677623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're on the fence about diving into ""Jedi: Survivor,"" let me share my experience with this stellar game. As a fellow gaming enthusiast, I believe this title offers something special for both Star Wars fans and gamers alike.

First off, the story is a standout feature. It's not just a run-of-the-mill narrative; we're talking about a well-crafted plot that showcases complex character development. As you progress through the game, you'll find yourself deeply invested in the characters' journeys. This depth adds a rich layer to the gameplay, making every decision and battle feel meaningful.

Speaking of gameplay, it's as smooth as it gets. Transitioning between combat, exploration, and story sequences feels seamless.

This is a very poor launch, especially for the first part of the game.

The first 2 hours you must persevere through an extremely poorly optimised planet, I have since then moved onto the second planet of the game and my framerate seems to be much more consistent and enjoyable.

Playing on a 3060ti and a Ryzen 9 5900x I assumed it would run fine. Unfortunately it does NOT for the first 2 hours. The game itself is not bad at all, it is super fun from what I've played so far and as a massive Star Wars fan I love the combat, characters and everything about the world, but with the poor framerate on a pretty good PC it is quite disappointing.

I really hope they give the game further updates but with EA being the company they are I don't know if we can trust them to fix everything. 

I knew to expect the day 1 Negative reviews, as all throughout the night of launch, the speculation of people crying and winging about not having a constant 144fps in the game was insane. If you are willing to play through the start of game at a poor framerate then move onto the rest of the game and enjoy it at a good framerate then you should purchase it.

If you are running anything below a 3060, it might be harder to justify the £60 price tag, it might be better off to pick up the game when it is on sale or if the bugs get fixed in the next few weeks, however the PC version of the game isn't the only version with problems, PS5 and XBOX Series consoles have been reported to have bad stutters and frame drops. 

Try to ignore the haters, after all it is a Star Wars game and there will always be someone complaining about it, let alone the fact EA is behind this title.

Once I have played more of the game and if the framerate issues get solved I will come back to add to this review.

After finishing the game and actually getting 100% achievements, I can say that if your machine is able to run this game then I will suggest playing it as they have made performance better (however still doesn't run like it should -_-). The game has a great story that is engaging and it has twists and turns that are not predictable, it has fun lightsaber gameplay that is refreshed since the previous game with all of the new stances and the customisation is stellar compared to other games in this genre.",1682690961,1700663280,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Now, to actually review the game itself. I genuinely enjoy this game so much more than I even truly expected to. I have always loved Star Wars ever since I was a little kid so I was stoked to see a new game come out. I also really enjoy souls-like games, so the fact that this game combines two of my favorite genres ever is awesome to begin with. 

I think they did a fantastic job getting that signature souls-like feeling while also having the fun, suspenseful, interesting original story from a pre-existing universe. Aside from the Souls games themselves I think this game is a masterclass in what a souls-like can be. Obviously the performance issues suck and made a lot of people dislike the game, but I think looking past that to the gem of a game under it is important. The voice acting is great especially from Cameron Monaghan, and the art/vfx are stunning in almost all instances.

The story's cool, but I wished it connected more with the movies and shows. Cal's character growth and his thing with Merrin added depth, though. And those nostalgic cameos and music hits? Gave me major Star Wars feels!

The combat's great, but I hoped the lightsabers would feel even more powerful, slicing through enemies like they do in the movies. (some of them)

The combat is also super fun with a broad selection of stances to accommodate different play-styles.

Now 5 months later I bought the game on sale and played through it till the end. I experienced only 1 or 2 minor glitches my entire play-through, all of which being graphical, the game-play was flawless. I don't have insane PC specs either. 

After experiencing everything STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor has to offer, I can truly say it's a fantastic game. This game had made some fantastic improvements to it's story, mechanics, graphics, combat etc compared to it's predecessor STAR WAR JEDI: Fallen Order. I would go into to detail but honestly I think it's best you buy it and play it for yourself spoiler-free like I did. All my issues with the game itself are far to minor and nit-picky to mention.

Though I praise this game for how fun it is, Game Developers should NEVER be forced (or consider) to release an UNFINISHED GAME. I only had a good experience because I waited FIVE MONTHS AFTER RELEASE. These companies are getting way to comfortable releasing unfinished games to make a dead-line or a quick buck. Just delay it. I'd prefer a late game than an unfinished one. Take the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for example. That game was delayed AN ENTIRE YEAR OF IT'S INTENDED RELEASE and it turned out fantastic as a result. Because of this games terrible release it's basically stripped it of it's spot as a GOTY Nominee. I wouldn't expect it to win but damn the Resident Evil 4 !!REMAKE!! beat it to the nominee's. Not that RE4 Remake is a bad game (it's actually super fun) but damn it's gotta hurt losing to a game that was initially released in 2005.

7.7/10 - Buy it on sale, it's not worth that $100 price tag. But if you do manage to get it on sale. It's 100% worth your money.

**Disclaimer: This review focuses solely on the game's content, characters, and the emotional impact it had, without addressing performance issues or bugs.**

Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a game that has touched my heart in ways I never expected. It's a breathtaking journey filled with moments of joy, excitement, and even tears. I feel compelled to share my experience with you, as it has truly been a transformative and emotional ride.

From the very first moments of the game, I was immediately captivated by its immersive storytelling. The characters came to life before my eyes, and I found myself forming deep connections with them as if they were real people. The performances were so genuine and heartfelt that I couldn't help but be moved by their struggles, their triumphs, and their unwavering determination.

The world of Survivor is a marvel to behold. The attention to detail in the environments, the rich lore, and the stunning visuals transported me to a galaxy far, far away. I felt like I was a part of this vast universe, experiencing the wonders and dangers alongside the characters I had grown to love.

But it wasn't just the grandeur of the game that moved me. It was the intimate moments, the quiet conversations, and the profound connections forged throughout the journey. The game delves deep into themes of friendship, resilience, and the power of hope, reminding me of the profound impact we can have on each other's lives.

There were moments when I laughed with pure delight, moments when I cheered with triumph, and moments when tears welled up in my eyes. The emotional depth of Survivor is unparalleled, and it resonated with me on a profound level. It made me reflect on my own life, my own relationships, and the power of perseverance in the face of adversity.

As I reached the end of the game, a bittersweet feeling washed over me. I was elated by the incredible journey I had taken, but I also felt a pang of sadness knowing that it had come to an end. Survivor had opened my eyes to the beauty of storytelling and the power of immersive gaming experiences.

In the end, Star Wars Jedi Survivor is not just a game. It's a transformative experience that has left an indelible mark on my soul. It has reminded me of the power of empathy, the strength of the human spirit, and the importance of cherishing the moments we have with the ones we love.

If you're looking for a game that will make you feel truly alive, that will immerse you in a rich and vibrant world, and that will touch your heart in ways you never thought possible, then look no further. Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

May the Force guide you on this unforgettable journey.....",1700644696,1700644696,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Now that it's out of public beta.... I mean been release for a while (sarcasm). The bugs and technical issues have been fixed. 

So its both cheaper and in a better overall state. 

As to my actual review.

Story is decent and while I personally liked the first games plot a bit better, that IS a personal preference and this Jedi Survivor is by no means bad.

Gameplay is (now) much better than the first game, it's a bit sharper and more responsive. In addition to this the powers, challenges and several other aspects of the game have been expanded on.

Soundtrack .... it's Star Wars... as long as they put John Williams on repeat I am happy.

Voice Acting is well done, and to a AAA standard.

Some ""Pre Order"" and ""Deluxe Edition"" BS, so it looses a point for that, but no MTX crap beyond that.
As a side note, I would skip the Deluxe Edition, the cosmetics aren't worth $2 let alone the ~$20 in my opinion and the game itself has plenty to collect, many of which are more impressive than the cash-grab ones.

While I am normally biased in favour of any Star Wars media, this one just sucks.

I appreciate that it is a lengthy single player game, rather than multiplayer-only or best-as-multiplayer, as so many other EA games. I appreciate getting to play as a jedi and all that, BUT:

* Double-DRM. Why the **** don't they adopt a more consumer friendly approach to DRM? I bought the game on Steam, why do I also need the EA launcher to run alongside it? DRM could easily be handled server side between Valve and EA's APIs, but no.. we have to be reminded that it is an EA game. Don't worry EA - I'm more than aware that this is one of your releases, don't need the launcher to recognise that fact. It unnecessarily complicates the use of Big Picture mode for one, as well as complicating playing the game on Linux through Proton. There should be a law against this double-DRM nonsense. Imagine needing to install the EA, Epic, Ubisoft, 2K and other launchers on a Playstation or XBox... so why torture PC gamers? We bought the game on our chosen platform, we can prove it, so now leave us alone. No need for a 2nd or 3rd launcher. 

* Performance tuning is abysmal, just like the previous instalment: Jedi Fallen Order. It's just lazy software development. All the Sony Playstation PC games run flawlessly and often even look better than Jedi Survivor, yet frame rate is all over the shop with this untuned rubbish. It gets better with DLSS/FSR enabled, but this game is way too resource demanding for the fidelity it delivers.

* Graphics fidelity is a mess, textures glitch way too often - or even consistently. Example: Wearing the Tactical Outfit with Cape will see BD's legs clearly going right through the fabric. Or riding the Spamel on Jedha, the way the legs (don't properly) connect with the ground is just too distractingly ugly.

* Horrible camera automation, it almost proactively sabotages the player.

* The amount of climbing and battling of fauna. It gets really tedious, really fast. A bit of climbing, sure. A few monsters here and there, sure. Not this crap. I want to fight the empire, not the Discovery Channel.

* ...

The story isn't too bad, a bit predictable but not bad overall.

Verdict: Have other developers develop Star Wars games from now on. Keep the writers, ditch the publisher and programmers. I recommend watching the story on YouTube. The game itself is a mess at its best, and abysmal at its worst.

I have to finish this game as I paid for it, but I really don't enjoy it one bit. Tedious, messy, rubbish.",1700626249,1700626249,False,56,12,0.640432119369506836,0,True,False,False

I started playing after patch four came out and in terms of performance I have had no crashing and some stuttering, but otherwise it's remained fairly consistent. The only times I notice real frame drops are when I tried streaming on discord but I'd assume that speaks to the strength of my PC rather than the games performance. 

This game feels like it was made by people that love Star Wars. Every NPC I've come across so far has felt very lively and charismatic (looking at you Skoova). I've had lots of fun with the side objectives of the game like finding plants, helping catch fish, playing holotactics, etc.. The only NPC and side quest I think is weak is Caij and hunting the other bounty hunters because I feel it's tedious after the first four bounties to have to go to a different planet to find just one. Caij, to me is just bargain brand Cad Bane, wearing a similar style of clothing that made me excited upon seeing the hat but then sad realizing who was wearing it. 

The combination of narrative moments that unlock abilities has been done better in this game than it its predecessor. I always thought the moments where Cal remembers his training to remember his force abilities was strange in the first game but I think they hit a good combination of combining narrative and gameplay mechanics  this time around when Cal learned the air-dash ability. I thought that a flash back to a life lesson Cal didn't understand at the time works better than remembering that Cal's master taught him how to double jump.

The game ran ok on my rig (passable FPS, bad drops and stutters here and there), was fun to play when working, but there are errors and in my case on screen errors that literally say error in the game in place of text!

It is scandalous that this level of incompetence is allowed to stand in PC gaming, releasing unfinished and broken games is getting tiresome. It is no wonder people wait for Steam sales as we are treated like dirt.

Respawn has lost all my trust, it may be EA who dictate releases (maybe), but I do know, I will never buy a game from Respawn early again until there are glowing reviews and a sale on.

They of course know their game is broken, they have play testers and the devs are not stupid, but the game is released anyway.

Don't buy, wait a year or two, maybe it will be fixed then.

Maybe Valve can up their own quality control and play test themselves so that studios stop releasing unfinished games.",1692899956,1700619846,False,14,0,0.613701045513153076,5,True,False,False

Whatever they did broke it on a 1660 Super. Guess no chance at 100%ing this until I can afford a new 8Gb+ graphics card.
Now it goes into the ""Do not buy"" pile.

Update

I figured out the problem for the out of memory error.

Restart your PC, then get in game/continue your progress, then as soon as you stand up, immediately use the meditation point to re-save your progress. My guess it's something to do with the update to the saving system causing some errors.

Now there's been some UI updates for 16:10 displays, but most screens are still not updated for this, and it seems that they might not, which is a small annoyance.
Still not a perfect game, but it got close :)

=====8<========

Ryzen 7 5700G (32Gb) with an nVidia 1660 Super (6Gb). 1920x1200 resolution.
Running on medium works fine (obviously no raytracing on a 1660). Probably not hitting 60fps most of the time, but it's more than playable.
Hope it gets patched/fixed for all the other people who are having problems, so beware about buying this until it's confirmed to be fixed.

Edit: Now that I've finished it, some thoughts;
This game came out at least 3 months early. EA NEEDS to learn to not launch broken games.
Checked my frame-rates (after the first patch at the start of May) and I'm getting between 30 and 75 (caps at 75 due to monitor frequency and vsync).
The story is a little all-over-the-place at times, but is still good overall.
The character moments are pretty damn perfect.
Some of the gameplay elements are not well explained. For instance, you get the ability to pass through green barrier shields later in the game, but nowhere does it tell you that you can also go through red barrier shields at a specific location, not even in the codex or a hint.
The open world design has the usual problem of feeling a little empty, especially with how big each of the planets is, but at least they give you mounts to make travel quicker, and lets not forget FAST TRAVEL :)
New Game Plus adds some perks to make the game a little harder and to mix up the enemy selections, but these can be turned off.
16:10 screen ratio has the in-game menus cut off on the sides, which is annoying but doesn't break anything.

Final Thoughts:
Only buy this full price if you have a high tolerance for some small bugs/glitches, but also can handle frame-rate fluctuations!
Otherwise, buy on sale or once the patches fix the game properly.",1682696542,1700613201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fortunately, I have not had a single crash or freeze and have not encountered a single gameplay bug. The gameplay itself is so much better than the first one (Fallen Order). The combat is better, the enemy variety is far grander and more interesting, map design is more interesting, the world environments are much larger and there are a lot more side activities and random places to explore. The story and characters are more interesting too. The puzzles are SIGNIFICANTLY less annoying than the last game. If they can just get the performance right, this will be a very worthy successor to Fallen Order as it is better in every way.

UPDATE:  I have made it to the second map where my FPS is completely normal so far, running at a locked 72 fps with about 70% GPU utilization, so likely can go about 90+ FPS unlocked. It also seems there is something very wrong with the FSR2 ""disabled"" setting. When I have FSR2 disabled, the game looks like a blurry, low resolution mess, but with it turned to ""Quality"", the game looks much sharper and crisper, more like it should. Still overall, seems the game has pretty bad anti-aliasing no matter what setting, even with it set to Epic. I recommend leaving FSR set to Quality no matter what as it seems very bugged otherwise.

Like the other reviews, I am unable to get a stable FPS. I have a 6800 XT and 3700x and get about 57 fps at most, often dipping down to the 40-50 range. Lowering graphics, display settings or utilizing FSR2 changes nothing. The problem seems to be that our GPU's and CPU's are not being utilized fully. I am averaging 30-60 % GPU utilization, with about 10-11.5gb of VRAM being used up on the 6800 xt, and about 10-11gb of RAM as well. CPU utilization is only at 20-30%. So clearly there is a lot more hardware available to be utilized, it's just not being used. Really sad as I feel a lot of the PC community had faith in Respawn as a developer, and this is going to hurt them. 

Please devs, piece of advice: All the patching you are doing now, and doing over the next few weeks and months, needs to already be completed BEFORE you launch the game. That's how you gotta run your business. You guys are losing out on millions (MEELEEONS) of dollars because you are going to get shit on with a red page of steam reviews, and rightfully so. Literally, LITERALLY, the solution is to already be at the stage you would be at 6 months from now literally TODAY at LAUNCH.

Respawn really knocked it out of the park with this one. Everything about the game made me just never want to stop playing. The aesthetics, soundtrack, and gameplay were all spot on. The few gripes I'd had with the first game were almost entirely addressed which was a welcome surprise. I had a blast exploring the environments and exploring different playstyles.

The story often kept me guessing and I was well and truly invested, though I will say one character relationship in particular (if you've played you know what I'm talking about), felt a little bit abrupt and forced. I wish they would have taken their time and had more small moments leading up to the main event.

Nearly all of my problems with the game came from difficulty spikes and the endgame.

I played on the hardest difficulty, and most of the time had no issues, however a handful of boss encounters had me tearing my hair out for at least an hour each. All of the encounters leading up to the boss would feel so easy that I felt woefully unprepared for facing the boss when the required timings became much tighter. I know that this is a key piece of the soulslike genre, but I was just frustrated by the inconsistent difficulty, to the point that on my first playthrough for a few encounters I just changed the difficulty so I wouldn't be pulled out of the story and experience too much. Some boss encounters just felt like luck whether they would use an insta-kill ability on me or not, which is not how I want to win, I wanted skill to prevail, not RNG. 

There is also the issue of an encounter in the second half of the story where you play not as the main character, but a side character instead. I was extremely frustrated by not having the option to go explore side content to cool off after a half hour of failed attempts, and my inability to level up further and invest skill points into areas where the character was lacking. For a game that has you heavily invested in building up your character, throwing all of that away for a few encounters was a bit jarring to me.

When I got to the endgame I was eagerly looking to 100% the title, and moved into New Game + to do so. Several achievements were broken for me and I had to replay the game multiple times to reset some progress and try again at getting it to pop. A few of the playspaces were also a bit too sprawling without much content to fill the spaces in between after the story had been completed. Backtracking to find missed collectibles and mini-bosses got a bit frustrating as in many cases there wasn't a way to skip annoying parkour or round-about sections (though the addition of fast-travel was very welcome).

- Performance hiccups (I'm running on a Vector GP66 HX Laptop with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU)
- Too expensive, and will not pay $20.00 for a deluxe upgrade with only a few cosmetics changes

If you have bought the game experiencing performance issues, I would wait before the 2 weeks before requesting a refund. They should patch it prior to then. If they don't...well then EA (yet again) deserves it.

I would write about the game, but any enjoyment I start to get is interrupted with a crash. I attempted to look past the performance issues and push forward. This game is, by far, the most unstable game I have played this year. I've played a lot of K-T games this year, so that's definitely saying something.

I am fortunate enough to have a 13900k, 4090, and 64GB of DDR5 RAM, The game still can't maintain a solid 60fps, stutters constantly, and still has stutters when changing areas. One of these areas being during a platforming section where you have to jump onto a zipline. What god awful timing for a consistent stutter. Does it ever get any better? No, it doesn't get any better. You start the game on a linear path and might wonder what everybody is complaining about. Once you get to the open world segment, all these issues explode in your face.

I'm not sure if the performance issues or crashing are worse now. Bad performance is one thing, but I cannot progress in the game because the game decided to only save a meditation points. That would be absolutely fine if the game did not crash constantly. Most of my playtime is retreading ground I have already covered. The shortcuts do not help because you have to reach them to be helpful.

This game is currently in a god awful state. If you think PC gamers are being performance snobs, then feel free to buy it. It takes over two hours to get to the point where the game starts to crash consistently. This game should not have been released in this state and I cannot recommend a game you can't play.

EDIT: The game crashes on the ending every time still even after Patch 4. Worst port of 2023 by far.

EDIT #2: Crashing has been fixed as of Patch 7 (9/5/2023) and framerate is much better. Be warned, my HW is a 13900k, 4090, and 64GB DDR5. So this review is only for people with too much money to burn.",1683051714,1700605359,True,0,0,0.57544630765914917,0,True,False,False

This isn't a downside, however it does lose some of the games magic that it had. this does  let the devs make the world a lot bigger, since you can fast travel from meditation point to meditation point. the addition of stances is a welcome one, since it opens up how you fight your opponents. the story is a little worse than the first game but still enjoyable (with some decent plot-twists). the saber/blaster and BD custemising is enjoyable and fun. not that impactfull but that doesnt matter.

[hr][/hr]

Downside:
the only complaint i have with the game is how it handled one of the major cameos. in the last game a Vader cameo was absolutley amazing(i felt a shiver down my spine during my first playtrough). The game tried to replicate this with another cameo of some sorts from another character from the movies, but it didnt have quite the charm. I wont elaborate to save you from spoilers but it wasnt as good as the first game. only complaint and didnt hurt my enjoyment. And of course the pc optimisation isnt good. i had a decent 40~50 fps all round(2060, ryzen5800X 16GB RAM) and for me it didnt crash once.  sometimes around Pyloon's Saloon i had 30 fps for a sec but thats about it

After going back and playing the series' first installment, it was made immediately apparent what game-play and quality of life changes were made in Survivor; from the addition of a fast travel system, to a fun list of new lightsaber stances and abilities, to a more intuitive feel to the game's overall platforming, just to name a few. 

The game allows you the freedom to explore the open-world setting, without it feeling like a chore or isolating you from the actual story. The random chance encounters with roaming AT-ST and imperial squads give the game a more dynamic feeling and really help to build an atmosphere of a galaxy-at-siege by a brutish empire. The story is incredibly captivating and some of the best canonical Star Wars content we've received in years.
