It has the usual downside of ARPGs though - which is that you can just build for armor + life steal or life regeneratiuon and facetank everything in the game with no skill involved whatsoever.

- Itemization and loot suck. Almost never any good loot. Still used level 5X gear (vendors-farmed) on my level 100 character because i never got anything better, and it's common to have level ~10 items on a level 50 character. There are level-locked top quality items like % damage reduction gems that almost never drop and once past their level, they don't drop anymore outside of consumable maps (that are not always available for sale) with variable levels purchasable from vendors, in which said items have even less chances to drop. Only ever bought level 92 gear from vendors (that have to be farmed by rerolling them, like many things in this game, which is dumb and not fun) while already level (and fame) capped for a long time because the game still would not drop any useful item despite hours and hours of farming, and i only bought it for the superior enchantments it could have, because it is also far weaker than my level 50 set. Stats suck. 2 out of 4 are basically useless. Character building sucks overall. Cookie cutter build or nothing. The items have tons of multiple requirements as minimal stats to have to be able to equip them that are impossible to achieve, so usually any not-too-bad item is impossible to equip because they have higher requirements than what is possible for the character to have

- Without save editing, characters are locked in their difficulty (in singleplayer), playthrough number, and skill points attribution past the 3 last ones. Difficulty and playthrough number, when the online was still working, were splitting the playerbase (in 4 + 6 possible attributes), this not counting mods which further affects compatibility (they required the same mods with the same load order)

- Mobs are super overpowered, have much more range than the player character, and one hit kill off the screen, even with ""melee"" attacks because they charge or leap, and typically the game will only display/spawn them right next to the character (they can also be hidden back for multiple possible reasons, at which point the game disables the ability to hit them), so preemptively attacking from afar does not help either, and no, running in irregular circles and/or back and forth quickly does not prevent them from one shotting. The game also has a lot of traps (and mostly hidden by the screen being very dimmed, or just not being dispayed) and overall unavoidable attacks, and the character dies instantly all the time. The reviews who praise the game are from people using mods, only played the early levels in easy difficulty, or just lie. Farming low level maps with level 40 mobs for these low level essential damage reduction gems (that never dropped), my level 100 character with health-buffed level 92 armor and epic weapons was still being one shot by mobs being spawned on it, but was generally not one shotting them. Many mobs can one shot even a tank character with a single crit. there is no balance, and the Elite difficulty (but not only) really shows that the developers did not bother with it, and likely did not play their own game, or made it so on purpose. Many bosses are literally impossible to beat and require being instantly one shot by unavoidable attacks, often instantly when entering the boss arena (this also happens with regular mobs), dozens of times and coming back to damage them for ~1% health over and over for dozens of minutes, for 1% exp and no loot. Among the worst bosses i have seen in a game. Paid reviews back then and reviews from unknowledgeable or wrong players don't mention it, but the reality of this game is that our character is constantly dying and doing runs back against the mobs to try hitting them before being one shot again. It's not a matter of skill or game knowledge, it's a huge game flaw. most likely the developers knew they messed up and did not give mobs health regen, even to bosses, because it would have made these issues very apparent early on

- Abilities suck. They are boring, their animations are locked and are way too long (longer than it takes to die, even with huge cast speed upgrades) and the pacing to acquire upgrade them is WAY too slow and unimpactful. The combat is sluggish, floaty and annoying, especially with melee characters

- The pet is useless outside of sometimes taking aggro and, rarely, using summon spells we give it

- Controls are unprecise and bugged. The character often does whatever it wants, regardless of inputs. The mobs constantly push away the character with huge area of effect attacks, while the character is not yet in range to hit them, so there are looney toons situations where the mobs will just repeatedly push the player character away and be unable to be hit, unless multiple items of knockback reduction are equiped, which are rare and mean passing on other bonuses/item sets. The mobs are also running very quickly and tend to walk away from melee, which results in the stupid player character having to rely on slowing effects, or have to step forward and strike miss over and over for a long time (sometimes over 10 seconds) until the mob decides to stop moving

- Opposite of QoL and ergonomy. Inventory management is shit. There is almost no space in inventory and chests. The game throws tons of useless stuff that may or may not become useful at some point, including items for other classes than the character looting it. But there is no space to store it, even less manage it in a practical way. Globally, anything in this game requires an insane amount of time for no valid reason even for the most mundane thing. Want to send pet to town ? Wait 2 minutes for it to come back. And fill your inventory full of junk before it comes back again, anyway you got no space left due to things to carry. Want to enchant your gear ? Spend your precious no-job leisure time clicking ""reroll world"" in the ""make lan game"" (because of course you can't do it otherwise, unless you spend your time teleporting everywhere to force reloads each time) and explore the same zones over and over and over and over again until maybe you find an npc and maybe said npc is the enchanter you need and maybe it will give you the 3 pile of random enchants you need on item(s) that maybe have the 20%  crit upgrade for 50% bonus maybe on a good roll with the gold you spent dozens of hours farming out of over a dozen pieces of gear and if not then you can remove all 3 enchants at once (not separately) and try your luck all over again. And it's not an issue during leveling, because they are so expensive that even 1 roll is not affordable for any item worth being equipped and costs several hours of grind.

- Some achievements require mods. I'm not sure, but i think that one requires having a mod being installed. The achievement for beating the campaign in hardcore is impossible without mods/cheats, at the very least in elite difficulty mode, but likely veteran too, but it's maybe possible to do it by doing only the end boss in elite mode by changing the difficulty with an internet/lan game, altough the buggy controls, glitches, and badly scaled and designed traps and monsters may very well still just one shot the character regardless of difficulty

- Multiplayer is not working. It used third party-controlled servers from runic which are offline (but of course them and Valve kept the money). There is also a ""firewall issue"" bug that started happening for almost everyone a few years ago, players have issues playing even in lan mode",1511627741,1708767217,False,0,0,0.474836438894271851,0,True,False,False

Worth picking up for a little fun but dont expect to get very invested. 

Pros - 
Fun ARPG combat despite being very basic
Fairly balanced with decent build variety
Good amount of content for todays price
Harder difficulty with hardcore mode is an actual challenge
A few pretty cool easter eggs in the game

Cons - 
Not being able to fully respec is just aids and shouldn't be considered a 'feature'
Objectively bad story
Bad writing
Bad voice acting
Endgame content is bad with little variety

However, after finally buying the game for peanuts on steam and realizing how dead it is and how few people will end up reading this review anyway.. I decided to not recommend it for a few major reasons.

First off, the art style is great.  It still looks great, the characters, enemies, armor sets, spell effects, and all of that all have held up amazingly well given how old it is.  Secondly, it still runs like a champ because it was hardly demanding back in 2012 as far as hardware requirements were concerned.  Thirdly, the soundtrack is basically Diablo 2's OST, which is only great if you really like a sort of bootlegged version of Diablo 2's soundtrack in Torchlight II (because that's what it is and it does it without even trying to differentiate itself).  Now lets get to the crap bits.

This game's balance- for an action RPG specifically- is all over the darn place.  Lets just get it right out of the way, melee builds SUCK.  They are horrendous on anything above normal difficulty unless you stack obscene amounts of defensive items, specific armor sets, or the really good shields that don't really drop till mid-game or sometimes a lot by Act 2 or 3.  The only two fun classes are Embermage or Engineer, and though I think the concepts behind a berzerker class are interesting on paper, in practice- they suck and get regularly K.O.'d on Veteran or higher difficulties because you are constantly taking damage.  The only way to survive is by being a brick house tank, or a glass canon Mage, otherwise the other class that is more or less kind of uninteresting is the ""Outlander.""  These play like your typical Assassin/ Bowazon builds from Diablo 2 and are boring for the most part as most of your tactics involve kiting large groups of enemies and spamming stuff to slow them down or increase your critical damage exponentially in order to kill mobs more quickly.

A.k.a. when two out of four of your classes suck- you have balance issues.  Then you have issues with class specific builds, like how two-handed Engineers are usually better late-game than sword and shield Engineers.  Or how Embermages are basically clearing whole screens by level 14 and are the only way to win some of the special bonus challenges that randomly show up on maps.  Speaking of which, there are like two or three that aren't even entertaining, one being a maze, and the other being ""poison all the spider nests.""  Where the challenge comes from being unable to click on the poison due to the number of enemies surrounding you- wow so challenging.  Some of the other ridiculous ones are ""protect the crystals before enemies destroy them"" a feat usually easier with- you guessed it- the Embermage spamming spells that clear enemies from your visible screen.

Honestly, I've played through the whole game and never really wanted to do its version of New game plus, because there really isn't a plot and the replay value is limited by your own patience.  The other option is basically resetting your character or something like that.  The end-game content isn't really that interesting because not unlike Lord of Destruction's added Act, Torchlight 2's semi-finale Act ALSO goes on forever.  Its also inadvertently schizophrenic, like they just crammed way too many ideas in.  Like, ""Oh lets make a jungle, but its also like a forest area, but then its also a boggy swamp with fire pits and zombies!  Oh and lets add witches, and werewolves!  Wow, and hey lets also throw in like a totally out-of-place village that was taken over by Werewolves with spooky journals for the player to read!  Wow and then lets copy-paste the battlefield from Lord of Destruction while we're at it, and then make the entire ending area a bunch of scaffolding over lava with robotic evil dwarves or something.""

Like holy crap- what an unfocused pile of garbage design.  Torchlight 2 is still the best Torchlight title, and is still a worthy Diablo 2 clone, but it has loads of problems.  I only occasionally play when I have some free time, and its mostly with a couple of friends from time to time on hamachi or something.  Personally I wouldn't recommend buying it with only like less than 500 people playing on average.  Diablo 2 is still pretty active though.",1704721567,1704722467,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a dungeon crawler with open spaces, has big randomized maps to explore, secret places to find, lots of loot and different enemies, good skills to choose from but hard to actually decide without a doubt that those are what you want for optimal gameplay, socketables, a good pet that goes to sell your stuff and brings some consumables that you can order him to bring back, a multiplayer mode similar to single player (bring your friends with you to smash those bastards).

But there are some stuff that i hate in this game: enemies hit boxes are huge, and if you want to attack a particular enemy in a group, you will mostly fail, or when you want to move by clicking in an open space where there is an enemy somewhat close you will start attacking him because of the huge hit box (and then you die because you couldn’t dodge enemy skills).
The difficulty scales with numbers, not actual good groups of enemies with a strategy, in particular boss fights, when most bosses are not the real threat but the overwhelming numbers of enemies that spawn or are summoned or divided; and magical damage is what will kill you 85% of the time (i mean instadeath, like.... bam your dead in 0.08 secs) even if you are prepared with magic resist (like only fire resist). Sometimes it feels just too easy and for a long time, and then BAM you’re dead, and bosses are easy but you just died in the middle of 50 enemies and you cannot reach the open area you want, to zone them. Like most games nowadays, they didn’t work on AI, they just spam abilities even if they don’t see you and the above stupidity to compensate for the lack of programming.

Runic Games' 2012 attempt, despite the studio's closure in 2017, deserves admiration for its commitment. Torchlight II, though lacking a distinct identity, provides a lasting and satisfying Action RPG experience. The addictive compulsion for exploration and loot aren't enough to give the game a unique personality but they do provide for some good fun. While not revolutionary, Torchlight II excels in executing established traditions, leaving a lasting impression for most.

Torchlight II intertwines its narrative with the original game's events, leaning towards predictability and very stereotypical characters. While it doesn't introduce groundbreaking innovations to the Action RPG genre, the game excels in executing established mechanics with precision and being fun. Departing from the dark dungeon aesthetic, Torchlight II opts for vibrant environments, appealing to newcomers and younger audiences.

On a personal level, it delivered a greatly enjoyable experience, I can see how this easily secured a spot among the top gaming experiences of its release year in 2012. Capturing the gameplay of Diablo II, Torchlight II provides a solid foundation with quality gameplay, flexible functionality, and UI tweaks for a more modern experience. While showing signs of aging as an older title, it remains a sturdy representative with multiplayer features, an expansive upgrade system, and a wealth of worthwhile loot, all help compensate for the occasional repetitiveness.

That all said, does this game have a place in 2023? It does. While I've also been playing Diablo IV, I've noticed Torchlight II is so approachable if not almost casual. It isn't simple or easy, but it is more simple and easier than what the modern Diablo or Path of Exile experience is like. It's certainly not is fantastic looking but it will play on pretty much any hardware. As I said in the opener, if you've not tried a Torchlight game, this is the best one to pick.

It also happens to be one of my all-time favorite games. You owe it to yourself to play this great Runic game and see why it is so highly rated. One awesome feature is that you can play this game in Offline Mode, a great way to pass time when having internet issues. It contains great character classes, very fun skills to use, and so much shiny loot to pick up that your head will explode. Also, don't forget about the fishing for all your pets needs. :)

It just gets better with the addition of the Steam Workshop now that there is a great amount of content that has been converted and updated using this format. While it does suck that you can only run the game with a total of ten active mods, you can have steam workshop track and auto-update fifty mods in total. Thankfully, skilled users have become quite successful at releasing compilations that help bypass this limit and enhance your gaming experience with lots of active mods. =)

Another great feature Runic added is that the game separates your vanilla and modded characters into different folders and saves. This makes it very easy for you to play your vanilla characters online with others for those purists out there. Then you restart your game in mod mode and play with your friends online using your modded characters. If you're modded toons are like mine, they will be custom classes such as ""Necromancer"" and ""Warlock"" from the SynergiesMOD by Salan or ""Ninja"" and ""Ronin"" from the Far East Pack by Zyph.

I can recommend a nice list of workshop mods that play very well together and enhance your game even further once you have beaten the standard version of the game. It's what I use when playing online or offline to help me relax, unwind, and clear my head from design fatigue. The link to my very popular Steam Workshop Collection ""S.E.B."" can be found down below.

[b]TIP:[/b] I highly recommend that if you play modded games online with your friends that you can manually synchronize your game mods and the mod load order beforehand to eliminate most problems. The easiest way I've found to do this was simply sharing a screenshot of the ModLauncher window so everybody could make the necessary changes There are some mods that do not work well together or online, but we've been able to play the vast majority of them in different combinations as long as we followed this tip.

[b]TIP:[/b] While the Steam Cloud sync tends to do a good job overall, sometimes it can fail and override your local copy of your saved game with an outdated version from the Steam Cloud. What I've done is keep a secondary backup of my saved games so when that happens, I can easily replace the cloud copy with my current local backup. The default location for the Torchlight II saved games is at ""My Documents\My Games\Runic Games\Torchlight 2\"". You will want to back up the ""save"" and ""modsave"" folders regularly especially if you play the game frequently in offline mode.

Hopefully, someday we will get an HD remastered version of this classic gem. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy Torchlight II and adding new content to it while waiting for Torchlight Frontiers to release sometime in 2019. =)

=====================================================
Linked Below is my very popular Torchlight II Collection ""S.E.B."" that adds tons of new content, features, and classes to this already great game.

I started this back in 2018 or so- and I think because of the massive amount of ARPG's that were on the scene at the time Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo 3 etc. - I quickly became disinterested. Was glad I came back to it eventually in 2023. This game is truly great, and you can see the love and care the devs put into it. While at first I think I was taken back a bit by what I thought was probably a game for children- the story while simple- and a nod to  Diablo 2 definitely has it's charm. The classes are all unique- albeit some seem to be just better than others. Engineer definitely has the highest survival while Berserker felt like I was constantly getting one shot by a cheap trap, or cluster of elite mobs. I've never been the elitist type- so I don't even think about Hardcore Characters in these games. (A better way of saying I'm Iron/Bronze at these things, no shame.) The environments are immersive and colorful, it has an awesome soundtrack, I love the art style. The small gripes I had can easily be worked around from a slew of MODS- adding things like a respec potion that The Switch version comes standard with. Honest I just really kick myself for not picking this up sooner back when there was probably a much larger online presence. From my Google Research, it seems as though people still come back to it- and I think that says a lot in an era when gamers/streamers jump from one new thing to the next within a few month time span. That or I'm just getting old. Probably the latter. If you haven't, definitely check this out for at least one play through.",1699568556,1699568556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Improves upon TorchLight 1 in almost every way save the prudish decision to nerf almost any piece of armor resembling shorty shorts, a bikini top, or a skirt. (There is no ""sexy class"" stand in for The Vanquisher this time around.) Originally I had fun with an engineer build but I'm currently playing a modded class (The Warlock) just to spice things up. Regardless if your preference is a berserker fighting monk,dual pistol wielding swashbuckler,mad-as-a-hatter-steam-punk tinkerer,or a spell casting renegade mage you are very much covered! The vanilla classes are all you need but if you want to branch out the option is there!

Torchlight II has the flavor of Grim-Dawn without the overly complex intricacies which may scare away first time initiates delving into this genre for the first time. Thus if you want a more accessible action rpg that is challenging yet more simplistic and straightforward in its' approach this is a good place to start. 

Luckily the catalog of loot is as robust as it is varied. Go ahead and socket star-dust-meteor chunks into your sandals to make yourself a pair of moon-walking Micheal Jackson shoes! Add rubies to your crossbow to make every fired bolt into a colorful particle beam of monster-meat exploding combustion! Torchlight II might as well be a bowl of your favorite nostalgic kid's cereal along with the collectible toy you get at the bottom of the box!

I don't have much in the way of harsh criticism other than the game's art direction and atmosphere are all over the place as you travel from one area into the next. One moment things are ominous and grim-dark as you are hit with unrelenting undead armies,parasitic mind worms,and eldritch tentacled horrors then ""poof"", you are in a much more whimsical and light-hearted location with adorable furry critter merchants,majestic fantastical beings towering over you,and Yoga instructors sitting on their mats doing their daily stretches. 

If I could compare it to anything it would be as if the movies of Legend (The one with Tim Curry as the devil),Dark Crystal,Return To Oz,Labyrinth,Dragon Slayer,Krull,Army Of Darkness,The Reanimator,Van-Helsing,and Never-Ending-Story got into the pod from The Fly then came out as an amalgamation of all those extremes. (If you can appreciate that very ADHD laden pendulum swing between delightful daydreams and foreboding nightmares then you'll be right as rain!)

You know what I'm getting at though,right? There seems to be the unwritten rule all action rpgs must now include a cursed village zone,a dark woodland zone,a barren plains zone,an Arabian desert zone,a deep jungle zone,a subterranean catacombs zone, and a hellish gauntlet zone. The order these come in may vary but the basic gist is easy to understand! 

On one hand you feel like an epic adventurer on a globe-trotting-demon-hunting-safari yet on the other hand it can pull you out of your immersion as the rapid-fire transitioning from one environment to the next gets disorienting. 

The abruptness of it all is jarring when compared to the first Diablo and the first Torchlight that both benefited from keeping events tied to an isolated yet scenic location steeped in its' own lore. It was a very effective way of getting you invested in a small town as well as its' quirky inhabitants. The fact everything was so self contained made it feel personal,consistent,and easier to tie up all your quests.

As much as I love Diablo 2 and Torch-Light-2 for giving me longer campaigns and more of everything, Diablo 1 and Torchlight 1 did certain things better. Aka,less quantity but plenty of quality. I used to not feel that way but as we get older we change our minds about a lot of things! (I should revisit Torchlight 1. I have owned it before but my copy on Steam has practically remained untouched!)

I would also recommend modding it with the following mods - all of which still work despite being compiled for earlier game versions:

Torchlight II Essentials - A compilation of 80+ mods
Bagmod Lite - Improved  Stash
Better Vanilla - ""Make the Vanilla Game Better""
Respec Potion - adds a skill reset potion to vendors

The mods add new classes, new spells, new pets and other improvements.  The game doesn't have the same production values as Diablo II of course because it didn't have the same resources during development.   Graphics are low poly but that's fine,  it's an OLD game with very low minimum requirements.    The game play is on a par with D-II / D-III  I've not bothered with D-IV

The Pros:
1) Combat is satisfying
2) Skills are fun to try out
3) Tons of skills as well
4) Randomly generated Dungeon/ Area is pretty good
5) Tons of Achievements 
6) Supported by mods
7) New Game + system
8) Map system for endgame
9) I can't Imagine a game with this much content are only 2GB in size...

The Cons:
1) Gameplay can get pretty boring after sometime
2) Achievements that makes you to be... Social-able? Damn it
3) Limited class system, result in shorter game life-time
4) Combat can be repeatative

Enemies can critically strike you and will one shot you, because damage on higher difficulties when you get crit is so high basically the only way to deal with it is prioritising +Health and %dmg reduction on gear, it also means that defensive skills or using ranged weapons is a lot easier than melee or offensive builds. This is such a problem that from what i understand nearly every large mod will change the way armour is calculated to actually make it useful and/or prevent enemies from critically striking entirely. 

There are also a lot of ""Noob Trap"" skills in the game that seem good at first only to have a very similar but superior skill be unlocked at a higher level. There are also some skills are just a lot weaker in comparison to others. You are also only able to respec your last 3 spent points and it isn't cheap to do so. 

Aside from those Flaws the game is great. Gameplay is very fast paced even for an arpg and most skills feel fun and satisfying to use. All four of the classes feel fun to play and are viable at least on veteran difficulty, though berserker is definitely the weakest by a good bit. The story is decent and the parchment paper cut scenes are really charming. Overall i would give vanilla Torchlight 2 a 7.5/10. I have not played with mods but i could see some re balancing and new classes easily making this game a 10/10.

Side Note
Don't expect to be able to legitimately 100% this game either as one of the achievements requires you to add 50 friends on a runic games account, amongst other achievements that require multiplayer. Additionally there is a lot of just ridiculously grind heavy and very difficult achievements that make it a really unappealing task.

[i]This ember has some serious spark[/i]

[b]Torchlight 2[/b], the sequel to the beloved action role-playing game, delivers an immersive and adrenaline-pumping experience that RPG enthusiasts will find difficult to resist. Bursting with vibrant visuals, engaging gameplay, and an impressive array of content, this game succeeds in providing countless hours of enjoyable gameplay.

[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]:

Captivating Gameplay: [b]Torchlight 2[/b] excels in its fast-paced and fluid combat mechanics. The array of character classes each comes with unique abilities, allowing players to adopt diverse playstyles and strategies. The visceral feeling of cutting through hordes of monsters while witnessing dazzling spell effects is incredibly satisfying.

Expansive World: The game world is vast and intricately designed, featuring diverse environments and landscapes. From dark and dangerous dungeons to lush forests and arid deserts, every region offers its challenges and secrets to uncover.

Loot Galore: Loot enthusiasts will be thrilled by the sheer amount and variety of items available in [b]Torchlight 2[/b]. The treasure hunt for rare and legendary gear is addictive and keeps players motivated to push further into the adventure.

Multiplayer Co-op: The game shines even brighter when played with friends. The cooperative multiplayer mode encourages teamwork and enhances the overall experience. Teaming up to conquer formidable bosses and share loot adds an extra layer of enjoyment.

Modding Support: [b]Torchlight 2[/b]'s commitment to the modding community is commendable. The extensive modding tools empower players to create and share their own content, significantly extending the game's replay value.

[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]:

Underwhelming Story: While the game's narrative provides a sufficient backdrop for the action, it fails to truly captivate. The plot remains somewhat predictable and lacks the depth and emotional engagement found in other RPG titles.

Limited Character Customisation: Although the character classes are diverse, players might find the lack of extensive customisation options for their avatars slightly limiting.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]:

[b]Torchlight 2[/b] successfully carries on the legacy of its predecessor, delivering an impressive and entertaining action RPG experience. With its addictive combat, expansive world, and a treasure trove of loot, it keeps players hooked for hours on end. Despite its minor flaws, like the somewhat generic story and limited character customisation, the game's overall charm and replay value more than make up for it. If you're a fan of action RPGs, [b]Torchlight 2[/b] is a must-play title that deserves its solid 8 out of 10 rating.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This is for shooting. This is for fun. 

And Torchlight II is damn good fun. 

And no bl00dy always online bullsh33t. No need to cry on forums labelling every game as a DEAD GAME. No need to check online how many people are playing the games I enjoy so that I may find even a shred of fun with them on my own. As if my enjoyment factor is solely dependent on if others are playing the same game or not, which is in plain words DUMB!  

Torchlight II is pure ARPG goodness with official mods support. Whats not to like? The Action part in ARPGs is such a hit or miss in so many titles like Hellgate London, Sacred, Titan Quest or even in newer titles like Chaosbane, Torchlight III and Inquisitor Martyr etc but not this one. They nail the action part which is important because that's what most of the game is about.
You don't even have to be a human calculator constantly searching the net for builds and guides to be able to finish the game or just have fun with it. THE CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP IS BUILT AROUND HAVING FUN WHILE ALSO EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT BUILDS. 
The campaign is varied enough and fun enough to be played and replayed which is better than a stupid campaign which is a repetitive slugfest to play through (AKA Chaosbane) just so i can get to the endgame and keep grinding for fun. This is why I love Diablo 2 LOD as well. None of that endgame jargon. You enjoy THE GAME itself which is built for playing AND ENJOYING. And not suffering through so that you can get to the ENDGAME retardation which is definitely necessary in ARPGS but only successfully builds upon the core game if and only if the base game is interesting enough on its own to be able to afford an interesting end game loop.

In closing thoughts an official full blown expansion to this game would have been nice. But we can always hope for a Torchlight 4 game to go back to its Arpg roots and keeps the single player story driven experience intact without the stupid always online requirements of more recent ARPGS like Diablo 3, 4, Inquisitor Martyr etc. Screw those games that screw the single player crowd with every new release.

You can customize your character's look and abilities to your liking, which is something I found to be really cool. The variety of items and weapons offered in the game adds to the replayability of the game, making it even better. All in all, I can confidently recommend Torchlight II as a great alternative to Diablo.",1427734471,1685762020,True,3,0,0.545942485332489014,0,True,False,False

anyways making a pasta:
Making pasta is a relatively simple process. Here's a basic recipe for making homemade pasta from scratch:

Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
Water (as needed)
Instructions:

On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, create a well in the center of the flour.

Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.

Using a fork or your fingers, gently beat the eggs while gradually incorporating the flour from the sides of the well. Continue mixing until a shaggy dough starts to form.

If the dough seems too dry, add a little water, a teaspoon at a time, and continue mixing. If it's too sticky, add a small amount of flour. Adjust the consistency until the dough comes together in a ball.

Once the dough has come together, knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. This helps develop the gluten in the flour and gives the pasta its desired texture.

Shape the dough into a ball and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

After the resting period, divide the dough into smaller portions, making it easier to work with. Take one portion and cover the others to prevent drying.

Roll out the dough using a rolling pin or a pasta machine. Start from the widest setting and gradually work your way to the desired thickness. Dust the dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking.

Once the dough is rolled out to the desired thickness, you can cut it into your preferred pasta shapes. You can use a sharp knife to cut it into fettuccine or pappardelle, or use a pasta machine attachment for specific shapes like spaghetti or lasagna sheets.

As you cut the pasta, dust it with a bit of flour to prevent it from sticking together. You can also hang the cut pasta on a drying rack or lay it out in a single layer on a floured surface until you're ready to cook it.

To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the instructions for the specific shape or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Fresh pasta typically cooks much faster than dried pasta, usually within 2-5 minutes.

Once the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander and serve it immediately with your favorite sauce and toppings.

That's it! You've made homemade pasta from scratch. Enjoy your meal!",1685480115,1685480115,False,5,1,0.483132898807525635,0,True,False,False

Game looks good and controls feel pretty solid, movement and combat are reasonably tight, still mostly a point and click but it can feel a little more nuanced with 'stand your ground' button + ranged weapons, some movement skills & abilities, and assigning items & abilities to extra mouse buttons. 

Lots of build options and plenty of nice looking maps, dungeons, and enemies with great diversity for the ~35 hour main game. The art style is nice to look at, bright and vibrant -- pretty, interesting, tons of diverse looking builds, lots of flashy abilities and weapons, and doesn't have the 'dark and gritty' feel of some other popular ARPGs.

The loot drops are satisfying and you find a fair amount of unique items and gems so you will be consistently upgrading your character which makes the progression satisfying.

Due to game's age the MP is unusable these days due to some firewall problems and to just hope to make it work you will have to do things like use Hamachi network with your friends to connect. Achievements, however, are set in a way to be a massive time sink and tedium thus if you don't prove to be a true lover of the game then don't on count on managing to sell thousands of items and alike actions to complete it...also there are multiplayer ones thus the above issue applies.

Those glaring issues aside this was an awesome and today still is a very good game. You may remember it was suggested as an alternative to Diablo 3 when it was released as it offers similar to Diablo 2 feel and general design. Even more so considering the music and sound effects which are powerfully alike (I vaguely remember former Diablo devs worked on this title?).
For today's ""standards"" however it may feel lacking there and there. For example the sound while nostalgic is not exactly ""engaging"" and may even feel odd in the carnage. For this issue in particular on consequent runs I always had something to listen to. The Story is nothing spectacular but interesting enough for a first timer. Certainly enough of an excuse to adventure on.

The Bad and the middle part done, let's see what are the goodies... and there's a good bunch!
Stylized graphics make it look great even today and spell effects are still very juicy. Side quests to spice up the journey. 4 classes with 3 skill 'trees' each for lovely variety of gameplay choices. Old, good stat/skill point system and likewise typical systems like socketing. Unique ""charge"" system allowing temporary, massive boost dependent on class (also possible to just ignore it in your build if desired). Also quite unique fact of having a pet form get go - they offer a bag for items, ability to go to town and sell them, buy you potions, cast spells from specific droppable scrolls and be transformed into something that hits harder with fish.
That's just from the top of my head and those hungry for more there is modding support linked to Steam Workshop.

200710,131542897,76561198261326127,0,112,909,0,442,1677761877,"It's 2023. This top-down hack & slash skill tree progression genre is dead/outdated. (Diablo clones are neither RPGs nor action games). I'm saying this as someone who enjoyed hundreds of hours on D2 & D3 during their prime. This genre simply didn't age well (compared to other genres such as metroidvania or turn-based RPGs) and this game particularly exemplifies the problems with the genre. Here are the top reasons why: 

1. The combat: You're spending most of the time staring at your status, skill bar, and map rather than focusing on the actual combat itself. The screen are often filled with a plethora of colourful effects to blind you from actual engagement anyways. And if those colours aren't enough, you have swarms of enemies covering your character. The combat itself isn't action based but RTS-style. The progression/difficulty is solely a matter of number crunching - more difficulty means higher enemy health and damage, progressing means bigger health pool and higher dps. No actual skill required (hence not action). Nothing wrong with RTS-style combat itself. MOBAs inherited that style very well and it works in that context, and in MOBA, RTS combat IS skill based. The issue when it's used in a 'hero go on a quest' game, one is often fighting so many enemies, and the skill trees become so large that you simply cannot see what you do (and it won't matter since you're not fighting other players, but stupid bots that are designed to be much weaker than the character). 

2. The stories in diablo clones are somehow all abysmal. It needn't be, but it seems that devs agree that the allure of this genre is a. the 'monster slaying' satisfaction one gets from spamming clicks and keys; and b. the random spam loot system which gives that satisfaction one gets from gambling/gacha. So stories don't matter if they're totally dumb and cliched. 

3. Point 2 ties in with the shitty world/map design of esp. Torchlight II. It has virtually NO homogeneity between the 'story'/quest line and the world, and the world is just instances from hubs and portals. As such, there is no exploration element in this game (or other Diablo clones, really...) The dungeons are artificial and lack variety. Quests are bland and basically just like any MMOs/mobile games. No brain required. Just go autopilot and click click click. (Whatever you might think about D3, it does this better than Torchlight II, though still terrible). 

4. Given the above points, this is nowhere near an RPG experience (D&D based games like Baldur's gate, Spiderware games like Avadon or Avernum). The elements for ROLE-PLAYING that are lacking are: world coherence and hence exploration; interesting and convincing story; NPCs that are alive, non-linear game progression; autonomy/choices; skill-based combat (whether it's turn-based using strategy or true action like metroidvania/souls games); real character building like actually having a point to being, say, a thief or a mage (rather than: start with a class, progress by choosing some branches in a skill tree that doesn't really do anything other than increasing DPS/the purpose of which is solely to increase DPS). 

The genre was fun ten-twenty years ago. Nowadays it's just a total bore given how far we've come with simply better games that have actual role playing, good story, good world, or good combat. I don't know any game that has all four of these elements, but this game (and Diablo clones in general) have none. I'm not even excited about D4 anymore after playing through three chapters of this. The problem is at the core: the style of game play is just not fun anymore in 2023.

The game runs like a model ARPG. The loot system works well, the inventory management is good, the pets are greatly improved - you can even send them to buy basic supplies like potions and scrolls, so you don't have to return to town. 

The environment is great, music is great, feels very high fantasy, almost to the fairy tale degree. The classes are a mixed bag, but mostly good. The skill trees are done really well, and is the epitome of easy-going enjoyment. Also, the multi-player has worked well for me. 

CONS: 

It's a little aged in the mechanics, but they do surprisingly hold up. The only thing I'd really like to see is controller support, but that's not going to happen for a game that's over 10 years old.

BASE GAME: 

 is interesting for a couple of completions on single player with 2 classes maybe test out the other 2 classes then quit... unless grinding for gear is what one seeks- and this game is HEAVY with trash drops to sell to vendor... anyway story is cute and enough- nothing special just decent and predictable so don't play this for the story unless this is the kind of story preferred. 

It should be noted that one completion of story stops at level 50 before recycling into New Game Plus levels beyond. 

Difficulty available to choose as they feel: Way too easy- Too easy- Easy- Tough with some OHKOs against user. 

At the highest levels- Veteran (the one I said felt easy at first) feels more fair since OHKOs don't seem to be a threat. 

Early in game: Elite feels more fair- until level 80+ when the damage received makes one feel that Engineers are best. 

Perhaps the biggest problem is that the game never does emphasize how important ""damage reduction"" really is... 

at level 120 ( Elite ) it becomes tragic if one ( easily ) misses out on farming the ""Eyes of Grell"" or ""Skulls of Limony""- 

don't forget to find the enchanter who sells sockets... in the Mapworks... who MAY randomly spawn in some dungeons. 

Equipment will work against mobs... not good defense against level 120 Elite bosses- unless one has found ""Boris"" the 

enchanter who ( randomly ) sells big bonuses into user's gear that helps to max DEXTERITY and VITALITY to get a max 

of 75% block ( need shield ) and 75% dodge chance... don't forget a couple of special skulls that give 25% 

missile-reflect chance and a shield that also carries some of that as well... if using an Engineer- Forcefield is an OP wonder that becomes a necessity- at that level... 

But none of that really matters- if playing on Veteran or lower- perhaps Elite without going beyond New Game Plus 3... 

If difficulty and balance are fine: Content becomes the next topic; Tarroch's Tomb only found on New Game Pluses and 

not available in the Mapworks ( wish it was ) is the best dungeon ( maybe the only true waves of foe area )- otherwise 

after beating the story- the only option is to play Mapworks over and over... or farm for better gear- money- boosts. 

O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O 

If that's all this game was- I wouldn't be playing it that much- except... 

MODDED GAME: 

And this is where this game really shines: Synergies- Essentials- Torchfun- Certain custom classes- TL2-Ace- and a soup 

of mods that help various aspects of this game ( it needs re-balancing for Elite ) or sometimes adds some interesting 

weapons ( Sniper Rifles Revival )... that can be fun to figure out how little power is needed to balance... Noddygineering or 

Warbounds if one wants some human partners that can wear gear... I mean just almost everything this game 

normally lacks is usually found among some mods... which do have a slew of problems between some of them- mainly 

not working well together ( that's another story )... If you manage to find the fun ones that work... they are worth it. 

However it is worth noting that games like Grim Dawn and Path of Exile will offer a far deeper experience than any Torchlight Mod can offer... nevertheless this is one game that has some impressive mods which will satisfy anyone who likes a decent hack, slash, and loot game.  

O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O 

Ultimately I'm still playing this game after 9 years because of MODS... and I'm grateful to the Mod Authors who 

( almost all who do this 'cause they like this game or modding and are students or have families and other work ) 

continue to make this fun and worthwhile for players like me... so a HUGE thank you to them and Runic for making this.",1458206599,1674087932,True,16,1,0.637286722660064697,0,True,False,False

The amount of detail on the characters and maps is really lovely, and I think it's awesome that there are so many character design options compared to Diablo!

Also love that there are so many weapon options and skill tree customizations for each class!

Enemies can teleport.

Finally got around to playing Torchlight II.  I mostly enjoyed and even 100%'ed the first game.  This is more of the same but less polished than it should have been.  Like the first game, the enemies get boring to fight after a while and leveling is slow.  By the time I reach the end of a game like this, I mostly expect to one-hit everything except bosses, not have to slog through a bunch of peons.  Half of the enemies can teleport, which makes them annoyingly hard to kill.  The tiny amount of space for inventory drove me nuts, constantly sending my pet back to town to sell all the junk I picked up.  The bosses are reasonably well designed but the plot is a bit thin and largely linear.  Cacklespit was the most intriguing character, but the game didn't explore that path very far.  Disappointed there isn't an achievement for drinking the Sweet-Aide and surviving for the 13.33 minutes.  Didn't care for the cartoon animated cutscenes between acts - they felt out of place with the rest of the game.  The original Torchlight is better because it was a great indie game that came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise.  This is a rehash that didn't really fix any of the original game's issues and adding teleporting to a bunch of enemy types made the gameplay worse.",1673366055,1673366055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

10 years later and there has been 2 Torchlight games to release since this masterpiece came out. Torchlight 3 and Infinite. 

Torchlight 3 is a downgrade in most ways with it it being very childish and just lacking. It could be good, but they took away the violence of the previous games. Trying to cater children. 

Torchlight Infinite is just a Diablo Immortal clone. Lame.

If you really want quality from a ARPG you probably are going to play Path of Exile a few leagues, and you have a lot of other alternatives that keep that 'grim' feel and work well with friends without feeling like anyone is dragging anyone down.

TL2 progression seems very fast but also means that friend who is slow at going over his loot is going to slow everyone down or feel rushed, I could never get a group going for more than 3 sessions because of this. That guy who wants to play on his own to show off some gear but 'not go ahead'? That's almost impossible. That other guy who only gets to play once a week, he's going to be behind unless you only play when he's on which will make it a very slow run.

Despite this the workshop support is awesome and has been for a very long time, but if you want to play ARPGs alone there are simply much cooler options, and if you want to play ARPGs with friends there are options that are less likely to alienate a friend who's pacing is a bit off from everyone else.

The sheer variety of item types (although dubiously distinct, given that some of the names for them feel like the devs were resorting to hitting up the thesaurus for some of the nomenclature towards the end) is impressive at least, along with all the possible bonuses available for them, as well as some minor crafting elements and socketable gear.

There is one thing that drags it down, and that is the precision of clicking required. How many times have you run in circles around an enemy just trying to attack? If you know what I'm talking about, then you understand this complaint. There's also no auto attack, only click and hold. All well and good until the enemy jumps back.

Which brings me to another annoyance with this game: the amount of enemies that make it hard for you to attack them. Not hard to kill, mind you. But for every enemy that will stand and fight, there are half a dozen that will push you away, jump back, flee when comrades fall, etc. This does not make them harder to fight. It just makes them effing annoying to fight. It drags out every encounter for twice as long as you spend half of each one chasing down trash mobs to get in the one or two at most hits in to stomp them.

Obviously these complaints have more to do with melee focused builds, but it's still annoying when a hack and slash becomes a chase and chop.",1672618623,1672618623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't let its cartoonish good looks & humor fool you. This is a very strict/unforgiving game that takes itself too seriously and expects you to grind for countless hours with numerous characters of various classes. Just look at the achievement requirements FFS! However, Torchlight II has solid mod support so you can use mods to make the gameplay more enjoyable / less of a burden. That's a big plus and a reason why I can recommend this game despite its serious flaws & limitations.
[list]
[*] Dumb luck / chance plays a major role during the whole game. You can ""buy"" luck from a unique shady enchanter (Filip) that appears randomly in some maps/dungeons. You'll get 4% increase in ""magic-finding"" (or 13% increase in gold drop  or 9% decrease in fumble chance or 5% increase in XP) per enchantment if you are lucky to get a powerful enchantment. It adds up to 100% increase in magic-finding chance if you are willing to waste 3 enchantment slots per item for 10 items you can equip. Good luck finding the raccoon and getting those powerful enchantments every time on every item though! LOL

[*] Progression is very linear and you don't have any say in the matter. You are forbidden to enter certain maps if you haven't cleared the previous task. You can't really reject a quest and follow a different story path even if you know you will be screwed in the end or the rewards are just laughable!

[*] The number of inventory slots and categories are too limited taking into account the gazillion unique items & sets (most of them are lackluster but still). So you still want to collect those unique items and/or armor sets? Well, you either have to create extra mule characters or use mods to get more inventory slots. In the vanilla game, inventory management takes too much time & effort if you don't like throwing away good stuff and I had to create several characters from each class (Berserker/Embermage/Engineer/Outlander) to be able to use these items. I literally fell asleep during load screens while doing inventory transfer across my several characters. What a snoozefest this is! 

[*] Pets are mostly useless (except for the extra inventory slots and being the bait/cannon fodder) and are annoyingly loud (especially the panther). It's so annoying that I either have to mute all sounds of the game or transform it into a more silent pet by feeding it fish when I am in a town.

[*] You only have 4 active spell slots on your character and 4 on your pet. You have to ""Unlearn"" a spell to be able to learn a new one if all 4 slots are full. The effects of those spells are nothing spectacular and even worse you won't know the actual magnitude of their effects (i.e. if it's worth unlearning a spell or not) before learning it. This handicapped spell system is the worst I've ever seen in an RPG game. IMHO, the most useful ones for the pet is Summon spells; even though the pet & its summons aren't strong they are effective in distracting the enemy mobs/bosses long enough for you to destroy those enemies without taking too much damage.

[*] Legendary / Unique / armor set / useful item drop rates are too low so you will have to grind hard to get them. I have a hard time getting them even with 50%+ increased luck. During my 400+ hours gameplay I got only 1 (one) legendary claw and that was useless for my active character build until I created another one! WTF?! Why does this game keep giving me the loot my active character class can't even use? You are basically coerced into creating multiple characters or playing coop.

[*] Armors, weapons, gems have very strict level / stat requirements. There are spells available to lower those requirements slightly but they are not worth using a precious spell slot for it.

[*] Most of the items you get will be trash. There is even an achievement called ""Trash Magnate"" (Sell 50,000 items). Then I guess it's fair to call this game a ""Trash Generator"".

[*] Enchanters & transmuters are like pseudo-random (but actually rigged) slot machines. Better have a backup of your save files so you can revert back because they will disappoint you most of the time. I am not paying more gold so that those stinking rodents can undo their botched job! Transmuters should be renamed to ""Trash Compacters"" because they will get 2/3/4 of your useless items and give you 1 useless item. A very similar transmuting system was in place in Van Helsing games and it's even worse here. There are no real recipes per se because you will get a random item as a result (except for the health/mana potions). How can you call that a recipe if the result is random? I guess you are better off selling those useless items to the greedy merchants or just not picking them up in the first place.

[*] Town enchanters are useless apprentices. And finding a particular wandering enchanter is very hard. (You can create a LAN game and re-roll the map even if you play solo. The small ""Crow's Pass"" map has a high probability of hosting a random enchanter but it's not guaranteed.)  After getting an enchantment if you click on the green tick and then disengage the enchanter to do something else, the echanters will f*** off the Neverland if you don't engage the rodent again quickly. If you want it to stay in place, press the Escape or Space key before clicking on the green tick. After that you can place a portal next to him so you can revisit later easily. IMO, the luck and socket echanters are the most useful ones in the vanilla game.

[*] Merchants & enchanters charge you extortionate amounts for their shitty goods & services. Furthermore, merchants pay you chump change for your items (mostly trash but even for the good ones). You want to return the item you bought by mistake 5 seconds ago? It's OK, you can take 1/20 of the gold you just paid for it!!! If you are willing to waste a spell slot on it then you can get a very minor improvement in sell/buy prices. If these merchants / enchanters didn't have a thick plot armor, they would go extinct very quickly! Dealing with The Alchemist was a child's play compared to dealing with these scoundrels! Given the option, I would have sided with The Evil Alchemist rather than these ""good"" vendors!

[*] You will have to send your pet several times to town to sell the useless items you picked up in a single map and it takes 2 minutes for it to return unless you use spell slot(s) for Animal Handling. 

[*] You are expected to gamble (buy unidentified items from shady gamblers) to get those sweet achievements. I guess we can also call this game ""Lost Vegas: The Alchemy Edition"" because the house always wins - unless you use your saved game to revert back and get exactly what you want until the gambler eventually resets his inventory. 

[*] To get all achievements you also have to do fishing... thousands of times. Seriously?! Even if you use dynamite this will take ages! I still haven't got this after 400+ hours and I do fishing every time I see a suitable spot in a map!

[*] You can only reset your last 3 special skill points and only if you pay those corrupt NPCs a truckload of gold! AFAIK, you can't reset your stat (strength/dexterity/focus/vitality) points in vanilla game. So you cannot experiment with different builds unless you create another character and grind from scratch. But you can use mods to do all of this easily and for free. 

[*] You can't separate embers from items non-destructively. There are even achievements for this stupidity

[*] I hate multiplayer/co-op but yet again I am being forced to play this way to get all achievements. I guess this will be another game I can't ""complete"" even after beating the final boss multiple times and playing the game for hundreds of hours!

It's hands down the worst ARPG I've played and I'm sure with enough mods it could be remedied, but I don't believe you should need to mod the ever living shit out of a game to make it bearable.

Skills are about as drab and boring as they come with most skills lacking any type of synergy or such blatantly strong synergy you'd be an idiot to not use it(prismatic bolts and most of embermage passive skills being the most glaring). Speaking of skills, the entire point that most people capitalize on is playing how you want and making your own builds which is frankly a lie. You definitely CAN make your own build and get by, but on hardcore elite you're essentially pigeonholed into running 1handed/shield + grell eyes to get as much damage reduction because the game is so anti-diversity on Elite you might as well copy and paste what everyone else does or die to random crits. OH yeah, crits! The joy of being critically hit by enemies is something else. Most other games of the genre have them and it's fine because there are counters to them like DA in TQ/Grim dawn. Here? ""LOL just keep moving, max block out and get as much hp as possible!"" No real feasible means of mitigating them outside of doing what you're already doing and hoping your hp pool is so massive you don't need to worry or care. At the very least, enemies should have a fumble chance the same way the player does. Either way, with how many different games of this genre there are you'd be silly to buy this unless you've played literally every one of them (Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo2/3, Lost Ark, Titan Quest, Van helsing, Last Epoch, Undecember, etc) and you absolutely want at best a mediocre experience.",1669319750,1670280554,False,1,0,0.474085867404937744,0,True,False,False

Torchlight II is an overhead action RPG with random loot (in other words, a ""[i]Diablo[/i] clone"").  Whereas the first [i]Torchlight[/i] game was reminiscent of the first [i]Diablo[/i] game, with a single dungeon under a town to explore, [i]Torchlight II[/i] is much closer to [i]Diablo II[/i], with multiple towns, dungeons, and large outside areas in between.

The character system is comparatively simple for the genre.  You choose a single class, and spend points each time you level up on your core attributes and a skill tree.  Each class has plenty of skill options, and two characters of the same class might be quite different in play, depending on which skills were taken.

One interesting wrinkle is that you have a pet.  This seems like it would be a gimmick at first, but the pet is actually very useful.  He can be outfitted with his own equipment (and even spells), and can be a very useful ally in combat.  You can also load your pet up with loot and send him back to town to sell it all, or even send him to town with a shopping list to pick up some potions while you're in the dungeons.  I equipped my pet with summon spells, and by the end of the game had a little army of skeletons and zombies fighting alongside us.

There are a lot of ways to customize your equipment.  You can have an enchanter add a limited number of random enchantments to each piece, and though individual enchantments aren't terribly amazing, they do really add up when you have a full set of enchanted equipment.  Some equipment also has slots you can use to insert gems, which can add additional bonuses or even new abilities; you can even find random enchanters who can add empty slots to equipment.  It all comes together to a very addictive system that provides you with plenty of ways to customize your character.

Compared with other games in the sub-genre, [i]Torchlight II[/i] has a greater focus on mobility and avoiding enemy attacks.  Movement is fast, whether for your character of the many enemies in the game, and enemy attacks are telegraphed well in advance, giving you plenty of time to move out of the way.

The game is quite easy on the Normal difficulty setting, but it's not ridiculously easy (like, for example, [i]Grim Dawn[/i]).  I'd still recommend Normal the first time through, since it gives you plenty of leeway to fool around with your character build and make sub-optimal choices, though [i]Diablo II[/i] experts will definitely want to start on a higher difficulty level.

The game looks fine and of course runs extremely well.  Some may not like the cartoon style (especially in a sub-genre that is typically very dark and gory), but I grew to like it.  Music and sound effects are both okay, but the soundtrack is unfortunately not very memorable.
[hr][/hr]
There are some tiny issues with the game.  It took me only 25 hours or so to complete the game, but I felt even that was a bit too long.  Repetition and boredom definitely start to set in during some of the multi-floor dungeons, where you typically just fight the same three or four enemies over and over.

More importantly, the game definitely has issues with targeting monsters.  I've never experienced this in any other game in the sub-genre that I've played ([i]Diablo, Diablo II, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Titan Quest[/i]), though I did experience the same issue in the first [i]Torchlight[/i] game.  I'm not sure whether it's due to how many quick, little enemies there are, or due to how fast movement in general is, but I had a very tough time clicking on enemies during the more hectic battles.
[hr][/hr]
However, those are only minor issues in an otherwise outstanding game.  Highly recommended for fans of the sub-genre, and anyone interested in playing a good action RPG!",1668782428,1668782428,True,5,0,0.568632185459136963,0,True,False,False

The game features 4 playable classes: the engineer, the outlander, the embermage and the berserker. Each class has 3 different skill trees to choose from. Leveling up also grants you 5 attribute points (per level) to put into strength, dexterity, focus, or vitality which in turn allows you to build your character as you see fit. Gameplay involves active and passive skills with lots of clicking. And I mean [b] a lot [/b]. 

When creating your character, you also get to pick and customize a pet which serves as your companion throughout the game. They fight alongside you, carry items to sell and even buy goods from shops, You can choose between a wolf, cat, bulldog, panther, papillon, ferret, chakawary, hawk, owl, badger, panda, alpaca and stag. The difference here is purely cosmetic.

The story is spread over 3 acts with varying terrain, monsters, dungeons and of course loot. While the story is supposed to be deeper than its predecessors, I didn't find myself that invested. Which doesn't mean the plot is straight up bad but they could've done more with it. Even so, it's a fun game, that deserves to be played at least once.

So I started playing TL II, and this time around, I was trying to understand and plan my build a bit better. TL II is a lot simpler in that respect compared to POE, with minimal time investment you can make a fun and viable build in TL II, whereas in POE I either had to use other people's builds, or spent a great deal of time planning and trading.

#copypaste
GAMEPLAY MODE 
(standard Hack&slash story + Survival mode):
TL: only standard adventure but there's uh So I call it A mini secret survival dungeon in the new game plus vanilla mode; but with mods, you change the rules!
GD: yes both: Vanilla + dlc.
.
GAMEPLAY LEVELING DIFFICULTIES
(1st difficulty available is ...)
TL: Casual or easy. but uhm, i guess, for example, if u're at level 5 in ACT #2 in Casual mode, u should be at level 10 in normal/veteran mode. yep, that kinda thing.
GD: Normal. personally punishing, like i have to watch couple build guides beforehand. so, at that time, idk about the other benefit of difficulties, maybe better drop loot, idk, im just glad that finally beat the game.
.
DURATION TO BEAT THE GAME
TL: feels short in casual mode. go pick normal mode instead. (or maybe not so many monster in the field, let's go mods!)
GD: Exhausting, It's a long- long- long day.
.
MODDING
TL: has official mod-friendly mode in the launcher. even, it has the editor tool which u can merge the mods to trick the limitation rules u can activate!
GD: idk. it's like we're still in the era of manually replacing files and stuff.
.
COSMETICS
TL: has basic mobile game cosmetic vanilla feature and u can change it in save editor tool afterwards: ""TL2RapidRespec"", though it can't list the installed cosmetic & custome mod. currently don't care too much about the hair/cosmetic styles.
GD: i guess, only through mod.
.
EQUIPMENTS
(both has specified-class colored-level items,)
TL: but with mods, BUT WITH MODS!! U CAN TRANSFER UR lvl.500 ITEMS TO VANILLA MODE!! (my future plan tho. still researching the trick through shared chest.)
GD: support advance crafting for specific equipments. max level 100 (i guess, never been here since get bored easily).
.
PETS
TL: yes, only one: cosmetic only regardless what u choose. u can customize equipment and send them home to sell & buy supplies. mod friendly too!!! look at Co-op section below!
GD: idk. maybe through summon spell from certain class?
.
CLASSES
TL: personally getting bored fast with vanilla. but luckily there's a mod that u can choose in a new game mode only that u can completely have all class skills though is in a new char feature and mod binding too.
GD: support dual class mode, that give us complex build skill system.
.
DUNGEONS
TL: generally randomly generated, especially for mini dungeon (based upon personal playthrough and articles). but wathever, i bet there're some mods for that!
GD: standard the same thing for every difficulty mode u play.
.
MAX CHARACTER'S & ENEMY'S LEVEL.
TL: vanilla: 100 & 120 (until 200 for a new game plus secret survival mode); mod: 500 & for enemy levels, maybe the same as you (not in this mode yet).
GD: vanilla: 100 & idk; mod: idk.
.
NEW GAME PLUS
TL: with mods u can goes forth far away, and u can go back to it with command console tricks and some easy setting from ""TL2RapidRespec"" tool!
GD: u can go back in previous mode, though u can't reset the progress of it, i guess.
.
TOTAL RESPECT SKILL METHODS
TL: no but yes: last 3 skill u choose. BUT, u can do it separatelly with 3rd party tool: ""TL2RapidRespec""!
GD: yes. with some price per skill. (I researched long time ago.)
.
CO-OP
(obviously after allowing firewall rules & enabling general port forward settings in your own router. which basically it just turn it on/off switch thing.)
TL: up to 6 players; there's a companion mod if u prefer to play alone, like ""Brother-in-Arms: Warbounds"", which is good! like u have another player in the game u can decide about what equipment and pet they should have. (and extra 1 character too in it.)
GD: 4 players. there's a companion mod too. but never test it since last time i checked it's in WIP status.
.
FUTURE UPDATES
TL: no: it is what it is. it's a final product for now I guess.
GD: yes: it's still updating.",1667603647,1667603647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are classes, abilities, items. But that's what it had. The story was dull, and I couldn't bother paying attention. I felt like some godly overlord ruling over the peasants with my mighty magical powers. Leaving death and destruction behind as I continued forth. 

Combat is stale and repetitive. When there were monsters, I spammed my powers everywhere. Then I continued on. I increased the difficulty, but it was the same experience. You may look at my hours and say ""Hey hey, you barely played!"" Well, here's my response: I asked my frined if I may play the game and see whether I liked it or not. I liked it at first, but when I came home to buy and download it, I realized that no matter how much I tried. I couldn't convince myself that I liked it. It feels like a chore. Perhaps there are people out there that enjoy mashing buttons 1-9 as well as the mouse buttons. This game isn't for me.

I really wish there was more variety in the spells. They felt excessively bland and dull. Fire, Frost, and Shock. That's all. Maybe the other classes fare better? 

The game feels like anybody could play it without any difficulty. There was nothing to learn, I was expecting [i] some [/i] type of learning curve. Alas, I made an error in judgement.

Pros:
1. The story is great. It picks up where the first game left off: Ordraak is vanquished, and it seems as though the town of Torchlight is safe. But the Alchemist (a class from the original game), succumbing to the whispers of Ordraak's heart, begins a rampage with a goal to siphon energy from the elemental guardians. The heroes of the story are forced to venture beyond the original town and protect the entire world
2. I am surprised at the sheer amount of worldbuilding in a game like this. Unlike the original, where there was just one town and then the mines, this game has three acts of its story, each with unique regions and towns. My personal favorite is the Imperial Camp.
3. The soundtrack is AMAZING. Matt Uelman never ceases to disappoint, and sometimes I just fire up the game to play while I listen to the music.
4. This game is very fun to play because of the great diversity of loot. Gold is always prevalent, but all the weapons and armor are generally fairly unique, with some armor and weapons being in sets that grant you extra abilities depending on how many pieces you have.
5. The classes in the game are very fun and interesting, each with their own playstyle and build. My personal favorite is the Outlander, a gunslinging magic user. Each class has three skill trees, rife with offensive, defensive, and passive abilities that make it very fun to customize your character.

Cons:
My only problem with this game came when I decided, out of sheer stubbornness, to achieve the highest level possible in this game. To do this, I would have to play through New Game+ mode 5 times. No problem, I thought. I'll just enjoy each playthrough. Unfortunately, once you get to New Game+ level 2, things start getting very difficult. The monsters still level with you, but it becomes very difficult to find better gear at that time, and what gear you do find forces you to make very difficult decisions on what to keep or dump. I found myself being regularly one-hit by specific monsters in each region, whose attacks dealt enough damage to kill me unless I had absolute full health. This lead me to constantly be purchasing health potions to keep my HP high, which meant I ran out of gold pretty quickly, which kept me from buying better gear, and.... you get the idea. I ended up putting the game down after a while, just getting extremely frustrated. I guess it's not meant to be played that much. xD 

Anyway, I would say this game is 8/10. It still holds up today, despite being older, and I still enjoy playing a normal game of it now and then.",1667173853,1667173853,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
* Look and feel is imho good and holds up even in 2022. 
* Classes are interesting and each has it's flavor and playstyle
* Most skills are ok but some are lacking 
* A few ways to build each of the classes
Cons:
*Itemization is pretty poor
*Class locked uniques are a big design mistake
*Useless unique items feel even worse
*After finishing game with 4 each class there is very little to do
*Mapworks despite it's intention to be an endgame activity is boring and very repetitive
*Both mapworks and NG+ stop making any sense once you hit level 100
*Not getting legendaries after 100+ hours is just annoying.
*GOLD DROP WITHOUT MODS IS ABYSMAL X_X

All in all. There is a good 100-200hours of fun here if you can stomach the design pitfalls. 
I guess in this day and age when we are attacked by the likes of Diablo Immortal crap this actually feels like a nice game.

While Torchlight 1 is outdated and can't hold up due to a nonexistent story, this one has a story to follow but took all creativity out of the player's hands.

I played the Destroyer in T1, your classic marauder warrior, thing is I did play him as a ranged DPS with multiple layers, instead of the big sword swinging tank he was advertised as and it was a successful playstyle.

Here I go for the Berserker which seems to be the equivalent.
I play for a bit, enjoy the changes, try out weapons and finally get used to a shotgun.
I check my skills to start theorycrafting a build, and over half of my skills are non-functional for ranged play, and even then while I could run some ranged or some 2-handed action even in melee, all of those options would be sub-par to a dual-wielding ""edgelord-furry"" which the """"""Berserker"""""" seems to be.

So it's a nice game to get started with ARPGs if you're not used to the complexity of the other games on the market, and I'm not even asking for the ass-backwards meta-building of Path of Exile here, just that I could make my character have its own variety outside of the flavor-prison the devs have made them to be.",1664201258,1664201503,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I should also note that I tried playing with friends before as well, and it didn't really add to the experience.

This game is what Diablo II should have been - I've made it through the first run through and I never felt as if I was completely under-powered versus the content, nor did it feel like I had made a bad class choice with my first toon. Loot from playing was enough to afford necessary potions for progression and even splurge on random gear every once in a while. 

In contrast to Diablo II, with Torchlight II I've never been stuck in town unable to afford a healing potion causing me to completely lose interest in playing.

The only things I would caution anyone about is the game content is enough to get you leveled about halfway to maximum level the first time through, after which you can repeat the same content at a higher level and/or choose to participate in some custom maps. Also, spending spec points on your character when you level is unforgiving - you can only roll back your last 3 choices, making it fairly pointless to respec. Learned spells are supposed to be available to all classes, yet I found more than a few I wanted to use and learned but couldn't cast with no explanation why.

The game is long enough to be worth your money but not long enough to get bored playing it, which is good. Supports mods, and Steam has an excellent modder community for this game in their Workshop. Supports online play. Graphics are good and so are the sound

Cons: Story line is not very good or engaging. I felt like with just a little more effort story-wise it could have rivaled Diablo III.  Without it, it feels like a somewhat cheap diablo-clone, despite all the pros.

Score 7/10

Torchlight II is a good ARPG (action role playing game) where you level, you loot, and you love it or leave it.  You'll spend time doing quests that dont really matter, picking up a bunch of gear with minimal upgrades and mostly uninteresting qualities, and fighting a TON of monsters.  That's where the game's bread and butter are made

Classes are pretty fun! They aren't insanely complex, the builds are easy to make, easy to plan, and very annoying to optimize.  The visuals are colorful and vibrant and fit well with the overall art direction. Sound is nice too.  The whole production is fairly decent especially for a game this old and at this price.

Combat is alright. Lots of crowd control, big criticals, and great screen shaking smashes. The beginning is a touch rough, but you'l be out of the woods quick and off to the races.  Once you get going, though, not much changes and its just tweaks and optimizations as you grind up the damage curve.

Speaking of grind, this game has none until endgame. You'll finish the story, unlock the post game maps, and VOILA  welcome to item hell. Truth be told, its alright but only just. Not a lot to see or do once you kill the last big bad, but there is enough between the start and the finish that i just cant complain.

How's multiplayer? It works. Maybe.  I played this last during the pandemic and it ran fine, but other reviewers say otherwise. Mobs don't scale well with MP on, and even playing on Hard is not really enough. Also, the difficulty do nothing outside of number manipulation, so don't expect rewards for playing on hard. 

Bottom line: Torchlight II is good/maybe great. It has flaws, its old but gold, and at this price should already be sold. Go buy it, play it and enjoy what it has.",1661256774,1661256774,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Vanilla Torchlight 2 is a very mixed bag of nice ideas botched by awful game mechanics. While the game has great variety of skills and weapons, more often than not you'll find out that the descriptions are misleading and a lot of them are simply not viable for harder difficulties. Due to this more than half of the build ideas one might come up with will go in to the trash just because the skill, stat, weapon synergies one would think that would exists actually do not because of some unexplained game mechanic. The game also severely punishes the player for picking wrong skills by providing very limited skill redistribution leading to most players to turn to mods. 

The game can still be a lot of fun for some simple co-op with veteran or normal difficulties for elite and end game fun one might want to consider mods and cookie cutter builds.

I would recommend however, that you install several quality of life & content mods to enhance your gameplay experience significantly.  The base game is good, but the mods available raise it to a great level.  Mods that I'm currently using in my latest playthrough are:

Synergies Mod
Essentials Mod
Synergies & Essentials Patch
Synergies High Loot
Extra Chunky
Zoomy
Storm Texture Pack v2.4 (parts 1 & 2)

With that mod set, you no longer have to restart with a New Game+ after your first playthrough.  There's enough content to keep going for many hours.  And in fact, it isn't recommended to start a NG+, since Synergies isn't intended for it.

The game is really attentive to detail, where each areas give a unique vibes. The design of the enemy is also very interesting. The down side is that the story line is really not that captivating.

Original review:
This game has the Diablo II's vibe. Here is my comment after playing for 12 hours:
pros: very easy to play. Very nice inventory organization. Items are split into potions, scrolls, and weapons/trinkets tabs. Skills are synergized well, at least for my two-hand-gun class. 
cons: lack a clear story line to attract my attention, all I did was just click click click and read some bubble text from NPCs. Lack of complex but rewarding mechanisms to maximize characters' potential. Instead of easy to play, hard to master, this game is more of easy to play, bland to master.
Overall comment: a good alternative for Diablo 2, perfect to kill your time. Not so good to intrigue yourself. Not an ideal game if you wish to submerge yourself into some fantasy world with a good storyline.",1654921848,1655127239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Very little item stats outside of the core stats (health, base stats, resistances) and even then in very small amounts.
- Enemies have knockback way, way too often
- Even for an ARPG the questline is bad. Too many blatant ""I'll let you pass if you do X, Y and Z for me"" moments in the main questline. There's also two almost identical, fairly lengthy secondary quests for seemingly no reason.
- The status effects you apply on enemies barely seem to do anything, except...
- Armor reduction on hit seems to have way too much effect on your damage, especially as a stat that can only be on your weapon. When I realized that in late game and equipped a gem on my weapon, my damage skyrocketed, almost multiplied by 10.
- On top of the aforementioned knockbacks a lot of enemy designs (shotgun attacks, special attacks' windup almost identical to regular attacks, small enemies in large amounts having a large damage range potentially leading in sudden very high damage burst) make it MUCH MORE punishing to play melee.

Before I start I should say i played it with nvidia's overlay that tweaked colours. The game out of the box feels very washed out and grey and frankly it bummed me out. After the making some tweaks the game looked more vibrant and exciting.

Pros:
-Gameplay action is engaging, varied and exciting.
-Progression is fast but not too fast that it feels cheap
-The multiple class options mean you can great a wide variaty of builds.
-The maps can be HUGE and varied with lots of dungeons to explore.
-The side quests are just as good if not better than main.
-in 2022 this game will run smooth and HD space is < 2gb
-cloud save games

Cons:
-By end game i was level 43. I had expected to be much higher and max out my character more especially when I didnt rush it.
-The engineer is overpowered and so are some of the weapons so you rarely feel need to change gear
-The shop, and merchants are ridiculously overpriced for the items and upgrades they offer. Makes it largely a waste of time and you might as well keep money for quick respawns.
-Some of the quests bugged out and didnt show where you needed to go.

Overall i'd recommend this game if you can get it cheap. I've tried coop but it always felt too chaotic. I think its best played as a chill, mindless SP game.",1652994008,1652994008,True,6,0,0.56031566858291626,0,True,False,False

WHOA.

At first glance, it's hyped up Diablo with colour, lots of gear, lots of explosions, and faster pace. (and let's get it out of the way- this is waaaaay better than Torchlight 3, trust me... if you played T3, try this game, you'll love it and drop T3 in a heartbeat)

But as you play you realize that it's a very polished game with beautiful graphics and the perfect mix of drops and difficulty. You can scream through this game quickly and just destroy everything, or you can go slowly and really maximize your gear and build.

Any character can use any weapon. You choose your skills. Lots of different builds. The game really is forgiving and it isn't too hard to get past an area if you find it a challenge; you can build whatever type of playstyle you like based on your gear and abilities, there's no right or wrong, BUT there are still some builds that are better than others.

PROS
-pet, sells gear for you during your game!
-forgiving game, not super hard, does not slow you down very much (very well balanced)
-great animation, great ability variety, vibrant eye catching colours & explosions
-some complexity- gear, socketing, drops, buffs, pet buffs, etc
-yes, it is ""better than diablo 3""- it is what diablo 3 should have been, with the perfect pacing and perfect destructive abilities/forgiving difficulty
-amazing with friends/multiplayer!

CONS
-maybe too easy sometimes? no barriers? too much loot? YES you can change the difficulty, but you've gotta keep an eye on this or else you'll find that the game is just a lot of ""everything dies too easily""
-more variety- could use some more mobs, more classes/skills- they should just ""go nuts"" and build so much more variety, i mean, why not?
-not many cosmetics- not much difference with what gear you wear affecting how you look, no personal home space to customize, no vanity stuff

YOU WILL LOVE IT. Trust me. Fun, fast gaming, beautiful looking, perfect balance, flexible difficulty.",1427667199,1651334777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This title still holds up very well. It runs exceptionally smoothly on an i3 CPU on Linux, without the slightest lags or glitches. If action-packed hack-n-slash is something you even remotely enjoy, Torchlight II has you covered.

Pros:

- Runs flawlessly on my Mint Linux 17.2-running Lenovo Ultrabook (something the majority of ""linux-compatible"" games i've tried on Steam do not do).
- Has a ""casual-mode"" difficulty level, something i miss in many other games.
- Fast-paced, epic-action-oriented play.
- Largely playable with one hand (important for me, as nerve damage limits how much i can use my left one). Only occasional taps on the keyboard are needed (to switch weapons/skills or use a potion).
- Has single-player support (an increasing number of games do not).
- The pets are truly useful (unlike in some games, where sidekicks just require constant babysitting).
- Doesn't take itself too seriously. Has almost-comic-booky graphics.
- Nice music (and its stored in a usable format under the Steam package dirs).
- No grinding! The character levels along at the story's pace.

Cons:

- At around level 50 (the ""Emberworks"") difficulty level skyrockets. i've died more times in that level than the whole game leading up to that point.
- But other than that, no ""real"" problems.


No complaints whatsoever. No crashes, lags, or other unsightliness (it lagged only very slightly twice, when there were roughly 50 monsters on the screen). Currently approaching level 51, and no idea how much longer it goes on.",1442043003,1651281889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

combat: enemies can even snipe and 1 shot you unless you are well equipped at every level after early game, which is most likely not going to be the case.

gameplay: rng is high, so you get behind in gear and if you decide to farm for it it will take long to get gear that matches your current level. the game is designed to take longer this way.

about the 1-hit-KOs: there are a few such enemy skills and there is no time (or depending on class, way) to react against them. not nice in an ARPG, especially if playing on Hardcore.",1574617861,1649696704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm an old Diablo II player who is always looking for similar games.  I'm in my 50's and my eyesight isn't so great, so I love how the game is so bright and things are super easy to see.  The visuals of the game reminds me a lot of World of Warcraft (The Burning Crusade)  Another game I used to play for over 10 years.  Unlike most games, where the vendors are only to sell junk to; I am completely amazed at the vendors in this game. I am obsessively stalking the vendors to find items I can socket, enchant, and put gems into to improve.  So early on, even if what you want isn't dropped at your feet, you can try the vendor and get something to work with.

  I absolutely love how the companion pet can do more than follow me around in the game.  Send it to town to sell off my junk, and even restock my potions...while I continue to pick up every single thing that drops on the ground.  Thank goodness the gold gets picked up as I walk around or I would be clicking endlessly. 

 The shared stash is awesome!  It quickly makes me create new characters just to use some of the amazing items I find in the game.  I am also a bit of a pack-rat, and making mules to hold all the excess stuff I think is great!

Now the game play...I simply am excited to say is perfect for me.  I love how you can adjust the difficulty and play style  (Casual / Single Player mode).  I am not so much of a multiplayer fan, though at times I do enjoy playing with other family members.  So when it comes to online, I do prefer LAN options.  I've only gotten my characters to the third act and I'm sort of sad that there is only one more act left.  

I'm slowly discovering new things about the game as I play it , and recreating my character because I've been testing their abilities along the way.  This game has gotten me so absorbed, my husband misses his D2 Res partner.",1648986889,1648986889,True,49,1,0.815589666366577148,0,True,False,False

As the title suggests, Torchlight II (loosely) follows on from the events of the original game, and improves upon its predecessor in some meaningful ways. The first game is not required playing (although it will help to familiarise you with some of the mechanics) since the story in this game is largely forgettable.

Made by Runic Games (some of the founders were former developers of Diablo I/II), Torchlight II features fairly traditional ""hack 'n slash"" ARPG gameplay. Much like the first game, you choose a class and begin your quest to save the world - but this time, there is an extra class as well as a more fleshed out skill ""tree"", as well as a far more varied world design (while still colourful, it has largely moved away from the almost entirely dungeon-based system of the original game). Your pet is also much more useful: in addition to the return to town/buy-sell cycle, your pet also has a shopping list (e.g. potions) and can learn and cast spells in support of your main character. The gameplay also goes beyond the normal sword/bow/axe setup and includes things such as hammers, maces, pistols, shotguns and even cannons as part of your potential arsenal. During your journey, upgrades are quite frequent - and the power and value of the enchanting system should not be underestimated (gambling is also useful). There is even a throwback to the Trillbot, if you find all the pieces.

Other notable additions are multiplayer functionality, and the return of mods via Steam Workshop. The original game's mod system was clunky and relied on the use of third-party applications for mod installation and management, while the launcher now manages most of that (install via Steam Workshop, enable/disable through launcher before playing). Multiplayer is available now via LAN or internet play - just bear in mind that online functionality requires a Runic account beforehand.

There are some aspects which I found annoying during my time and some are worth bearing in mind (even though none are true deal breakers):
[list]
    [*]Mana sustain is a real problem for most builds - you will either need to focus on regen or spend time chugging potions.
    [*]Targeting is not great and movement can be iffy - many times I ended up attacking when I was actually trying to disengage or reposition.
    [*]Some of the sound effects (particularly the death effects of certain enemies) get incredibly annoying very quickly, to the point where I turned the game audio right down.
	[*]Pathing, particularly for the AI (pet), is rubbish. Luckily, if you are more than a certain distance away, your pet warps to your location - but its annoying for your own character as well.
	[*]Endgame is lacklustre; while New Game + does add another level of challenge, it is just the campaign all over again with higher levels. Similarly, the maps, while offering some variety, do not really function well as an endgame mechanism (compared to e.g. Path of Exile).
[/list]
The game is solid however, despite what seems a lengthy list of negatives. Somehow though, I found the game a chore to finish and struggled to engage and enjoy the mechanics; I cannot really put my finger on it, but Torchlight II did not live up to the hype for me. It is definitely worth a go for ARPG fans, and you will likely have a better time with it than I did - just don't expect to be blown away.

The blend of steampunk and magic is something that goes well like chocolate and peanutbutter or the beach and beer. The synergy between classes in multiplayer is top notch and something I think about frequently when playing more modern titles. The socketing system was fun and addictive. The gambling and fishing mechanics really stick out to me all these years later. The best feature of all was the pet system where your pet was both your combat buddy and your mobile shopping cart, selling your useless loot and buying health pots in town.

While retaining most of its basic ARPG game mechanics, Torchlight 2 expanded its Steampunk setting and lore. Still, I’d say there’s nothing special about the story. You’d enjoy this more if you focus on wiping out hordes of Netherim beasts and blowing robots up.

One of its big improvements is variety. From the get-go, Torchlight 2 offers more classes: Berserker, Outlander, Engineer, and Embermage. My usual default when playing RPGs is to play a melee-class like warrior or fighter. But in this case, I chose to play as a dual-pistol-wielding Outlander. It also features character customization, which was absent in the first game.

Besides that, the game’s world was vaster. It took me a while to finish this one—or at least, finish it in the time I expected—because Torchlight 2 expanded its world from the first game. I couldn’t play it the way I played Torchlight 1, which was finishing a floor each day (I can barely play any game nowadays for more than 40 minutes). This encouraged me to explore more. I rarely enjoy exploring in video games these days, but this did make me interested to see what else was out there.
I never got to try out the multiplayer, but I didn’t care much about it either. But I was well-aware that it was the main highlights when it came out.

Torchlight 2 is still worth playing today and I’d say that you can skip the first one and play this instead. Simply because there’s not much to say about the story of Torchlight 1 and you can just read the plot online if you want to save some time.

STORY/LORE - 5/5

The original story of Torchlight continues on in Torchlight II as it’s a great sequel to an originally awesome game. You get to choose from new classes with some decent customization options to then meet some of the original characters from Torchlight to kick things off. I enjoyed the animated story sequences to tie everything together and thought this was a smart and creative way to move the franchise forward.

If you stick to the main story and omit the optional missions, it fills in the gaps nicely from where things left off in the original. I thought Runic Games did a phenomenal job mixing things in with fun side missions, quests, and dungeons to do as you explore all the different areas of the game as you progress the story.

GAMEPLAY - 5/5

This is where the game shines as Runic Games truly pushed the envelope to deliver an amazing hack and slash action RPG to the masses. If you grew up loving Diablo, this is basically Diablo II taken to the next level. The tons of abilities, fights, enemies, and bosses are all extremely well done and polished. You can play this game as many times as you want and everything will feel fresh, different, and exciting each time because of how random the encounters and dungeons are.

Torchlight II has thousands of combinations of weapons, gems, and customization options to make how you want to play possible. Whether you want to melee, use ranged guns, fire spells, or use pets to progress, it’s all here. This game has endless replayability to the highest degree and with the New Game Plus option to continue playing with all the gear/abilities you’ve earned, you can play this game over and over and over again while enjoying everything in stride. It never ends and well, that’s a great thing for the overall value you get from Torchlight II.

GRAPHICS - 5/5

For a game that came out back in 2012, it still holds up well to this very day. Everything is cartoony but the graphics look good, especially when you do down into all the random caves, dungeons, and areas to see all the different kinds of levels that were designed with great detail. Each zone looks fantastic, especially the night or rain/snow levels that add a nice ambiance to Torchlight II.

SOUNDTRACK - 5/5

Lots of old-school sounds and music here if you also grew up with action RPGs. You can even hear a very similar tone and soundtrack to anything from the Diablo franchise. Regardless, it goes perfectly while you’re clearing waves of enemies, looting, and killing bosses. Each zone has its own unique sound to it as it’s all brilliantly done well.

MULTIPLAYER - 5/5

Torchlight II is a ton of fun as a single-player experience but is even better with a friend. It fully supports co-op and is super easy and simple to play the game together with someone. Thankfully, it’s a seamless experience that still works even after so many years. I did test this out with a friend and it works perfectly.

FINAL SCORE - 5/5

I give Torchlight II a perfect 5/5 as it’s a classic and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre. For a game as old as it is, it still holds up very well as you can get a ton of fun gameplay, replayability, and memories out of it. Best of all, it has a full co-op mode to play with a friend that’s also into this genre. Overall, it’s just beyond worth it to play Torchlight II from start to finish and even then some. It’s that awesome and will stand the test of time as one of the greatest hack and slash/action RPGs ever created!",1643224433,1643224433,True,7,0,0.607304692268371582,0,True,False,False

Torchlight II is the best from the 3 that have arrived: the campaign is like the diablo 3 one but with diablo 2 mechanics and a totally fresh and different adventure. The adventure is cool, the game is long, the graphics are awesome (comic like, not difficult for the GPU even in the highest level)

You can't become a power house here unless you check guides on how to, which you will eventually do as you wont know which are the best skills to choose but then you can restart your game in plus mode for a harder environment and you wont be a power house anymore.

The bosses! Such good bosses! Dynamic, fearsome and changing... they dont have any flat strategic like some other rpgs I know.

but there are some CONS:
- To get better drops you only need to go to the next section of the map (depending on the quest where you are) and destroy a big boss, thats cool.  (meh)

- To buy better gear... you wont get them... unless you gamble. But... the money needed to gamble skyrockets with each level, so the only way to get your final equipment is finishing the game in the hardest of the hardest difficulties.
or cheating with a console and some files... 

- to be able to reset you skills because you selected the wrong ones you need to cheat and mess some files. So...which are the good ones? if you check that in the internet you will become a power house... lol

- The stones!!! God damn! Diablo 2 and 3 has lots of useful stones and runes... but in here you have to have a whole vault to get some... useless - need to be combined- you wont ever get it again - pieces of stone. Well... with some unique effects yeah but...

- Some classes are too overpowered and some are just to ... evade the mobs?

- The LAN connection is broken... is now an alone rpg, which is still very good! 
(this one is because of windows 10, which stole the ports required for many LAN games, revive Windows XP!!   /end of the riot)

- And the sets... they are impossible to gather and when you gather them... they are the worst... (not like in d2 or d3)

Still with all that. I recommend it because of the graphics and the not listed in here hours (more than 100 more)",1643080202,1643080538,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its not.

Torchlight 2 is still one of the best ARPGs on steam, combine that with steam workshop's 1000 mods, and you have a tailored made experience for any and all ARPG players. No complaints really, graphics still hold up, combat is satisfying, builds galore, plenty to do with or without mods, only real issue is the lack of expansions. The game is constantly on sale for literal pennies, $15 is fair if you're not into waiting, and you support a far better game. Though you support devs that released the horrible sequel, atleast they will see Torchlight 2 being a far better selling game and maybe look back at the formula and try again with Torchlight 4.

just to get soft locked by a weird relationship with knockback. apparently them and physics had a falling out so you just get placed rather than thrown into walls and the omnipresent clutter.
even modding the game to open all skills to all characters made like four sort of maybe interesting if you talked yourself into it kind of builds. bored doesnt cover it. there is such a thing as a fun dungeon crawler but wandering whackamole aint it.

While this has far from the longest playtime I've had of any title (as of this writing), and despite its admittedly repetitive game play, I've never really gotten tired of it either. It doesn't require an enormous amount of time to go through a map (or two or three) and wrap up a few quests, and there's enough action and variety to thoroughly satisfy one's craving for hack-and-slash.

++ Pure hack and slash fun that caters to all types of ARPG fans
++ Game play is incredibly addictive, from wreaking havoc against massive hordes (especially with mods) to the ""ooh, shiny!"" loot factor
++ Plot, general narrative elements, and voice active are serviceable, neither a story-telling masterpiece nor a disaster
++ Nice variety of mods, some of which enhance content and overall game play

The Torchlight series is the weakest of all the ARPGs out there, being inferior to Diablo 3, Titanquest, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Victor Vran and more. Coupled with the weak gameplay and lacklustre graphics, it serves as a filler for folks who are waiting for the next big ARPG.

The game actually has a very light story that feels lacking, but it's much more integrated into the progression than in TL1. The game has a more complex progression outwards into zones and sub-zones that don't make you feel like you are just going down for no reason, like in TL1.

Graphics are improved, there are four classes instead of three, and more pet options.

The skill systems are nice and the combat feels smoother. The charge that you gain and allows you to basically super is kind of frustrating, as it can't be timed well sometimes with trash mobs. It would have been nice if this could be saved and used for tougher fights. But overall, I was happy with my ability to craft a build that worked towards my liking. I wish there was a built in way to respec, as you can only remove your last three skills, but there is a way around it with respec potions, like in TL1, if you want to be able to try more builds.

All in all, not a great game, but satisfactory. The amount of hours I got from one play through are more than appropriate for the asking price.

TL2 is a sequel done right. Basically all strong points from TL1 are present and improved. If Torchlight 1 is a good representative of the action RPG genre, Torchlight 2 is the double of that standard. Graphically the game has been polished compared to TL1, models, ambient, lightning, artwork, everything got an upgrade. The OST, again by Matt Uelmen, continues to represent very well the identity and feelling of the world of Torchlight. The story of the game, although simple, is engaging and a good incentive to play Singleplayer. Besides the story, the game offers a lot of activities for SP, like TL1, custom maps (dungeons), vast world to explore, hidden quest and dungeons, and a lot of loot to gather (too much, sometimes). In short, if the type of game that TL2 is, appeals to you, you will have a lot to play and enjoy, until you get sick of it. And if you're still not satisfied, the game provides GUTS (Torchlight 2 editor), for creating and modifying everything in the game. Be it items, quests, maps, etc.

The game have Multiplayer too. This game is old, i recommend opening the ports for it and allowing it through the firewall. The ports are:
TCP: 4549; UDP: 4175, 4179, 4171
When i enter online, i always get the message about the firewall error, but i can still enter and play with others.

It's not as good as the newer entries like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and the steadily improving Wolcen, but it is well made. Those of you who like your graphics dark and somewhat realistic should try to get a friend who has it let you play just to see if it's too cartoony for your tastes. 

Personally, I've no problem with its cartoonishness. It does have blood-spatter if you want that and you can turn that off for those that don't want so much gore. It is deep enough that they gave forethought to the endgame which is essentially running maps until you've run them all. However, to remedy the routine, the game is moddable and there are plenty of them to keep you occupied until you feel you've had your money's worth out of it. 

TL1 & TL2 are both well made and cheap enough that they are worth buying to play. I have yet to purchase TL3, but the current consensus on that one is to skip it as it was stripped down too much from its original design intent and doesn't measure up to the first two.

Torchlight 2 is the best of them in my opinion and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy the lore of arpg games then I recommend also getting TL1 and playing it first. It's very good, just not quite as good as TL2.",1634201849,1634201849,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautifully stylised characters, great story, solid gameplay. It's got a very World Of Warcraft feel to it with the saturated colour palettes and overall style of characters and mobs. The loot system offers just enough diversity and rarity in items that it feels like every good bit of gear is a worthwhile find, while not leaving you struggling if you haven't found a good bit of one specific armour in 10+ levels.

Skills are diverse in each of the four classes, with three trees per character. Each tree tends to focus on a different aspect of the character, or weapon they're proficient in, and many skills carry over to other trees as well allowing for well-rounded characters that don't just have to specialise in one thing. My only word of advice is to look at your characters skills carefully, as you can only respec the last three skill points spent at any given time. It allows you to try out a skill and see if it fits your playstyle, while the ability to portal back to a town at any point (assuming you have a scroll) means you can respec if it just isn't working out.

I've been playing equally in multiplayer and singleplayer, and the experience is great either way. So whether you enjoy heading into a game with your friends or solo, you'll still enjoy the game. Though one of the big draw cards for me is the fact that multiplayer allows MORE than 4 players. My tabletop gaming group is made up of 5 people and during this covid lockdown we were struggling to find a decent game we could all play, as most games are max of 4.

Definitely worth it if you enjoy the standard isometric hack-n-slashers.

[h1]Where your money goes[/h1]
Runic Games, the creator of the series, is long since dead, Perfect World owns this now.
Pay as little as you can, it won't go towards the developer.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Pretty standard ARPG gameplay:[list]
[*]Pick a class and build how you want
[*]Do quests
[*]Kill enemies
[*]Collect loot[/list]
Unlike other ARPGs, you have a pet that can be sent to town to sell your loot and buy consumables, so almost all of your time can be spent questing.

[h1]Mod support[/h1]
Added some longevity to the game, but in a push to get people to use the multiplayer, they limited how many mods you're allowed to use at once to 10.
To my knowledge there is no way to get around it besides manually merging mods yourself.

I’ve played it twice, once heavily modded through the workshop, and once vanilla. Sad to say, the run with mods was much more enjoyable, but didn’t agree well with steam’s achievements, hence leading to the vanilla run. Overall, it’s alright, inoffensive fantasy action, but it’s very, very repetitive, though I feel that’s to be expected from Diablo-likes as a genre and as a result it’s not particularly memorable to me either. I don’t really remember any particular area, or dungeon, or story beat, it all just blends together in my memory. If you don’t care about achievements, I wholly recommend downloading lots of worskshop content to give some much-needed variety, then it will be a good time.

You cant bind left click to move, since if you do you cant talk to npcs for dialogue or pick up loot and have to bind a button for that which is very inconvenient considering how much loot you pick up. This leaves you with having to move around and not hover over an enemy, cause if you do well guess you are stuck trying to attack them.

Attacks in general are very clunky, with most of them relying on targeting for them to work which ends up just having you stand there missing stuff somehow. In my 2 hours there were multiple times where i just attack air despite being locked onto someone, or try to lock onto a unit, and have my character just walk in a direction that isn't them.

Enemies having the block mechanic is awful, it should never have been added to the game. If you are in low difficulites its a joke, everything dies instantly and you are unkillable. If you are in high difficulites everything takes a little longer to kill and its a bit riskier which is fine, but the 2nd and 3rd zones are filled with gigantic meatshield enemies who dont take damage from your attacks until some random unexplained thing occurs and their shield breaks.

I've played all of them, some of them are a little buggy here and there, some a little more... but my gripe is with Torchlight II.

While the gameplay is nice, the game has 4 classes (up from 3 in TL1 and 0 in Fate games), item sets, endgame maps and a good campaign... there are lots of wrong things with it as well.

Thanks to the soundtrack composed by Matt Uelman and the cartoony graphics, the game has a very nice ambience to it. It's satisfying to play, you can spend an hour here and there slaying monsters and looting stuff... but that's where it ends.

Playing in Veteran (1 difficulty under Elite) has me dying a ton on my ""glass cannon"" Embermage. I have a max life roll on all my items, a bit of resistance, missile reflect and a shield with tons of block, vitality on my gear and some dexterity. Some normal mobs can kill me in 1 or 2 hits, with a dash or a cluster of projectile. Most bosses in maps does no damage compared to normal monsters, traps can one shot you in 0.5 seconds and some are rather hard to see when you're fighting with lots of spells. The game feels terribly unbalanced in that aspect.

Then there's the multiplayer of this game. I tried to play using LAN and Internet, both ended up in a mess of lags, account creation processes, rubberbanding and unfair XP shares. Killing monsters together one of us two would always be 1-2 levels higher than the other. So I ended up playing the game solo.

Then there's the FPS drops. I thought my i5 4670/GTX 1060 combo (meh by today standards, but good otherwise), wasn't good enough for the game. But a brand new laptop with an i7 10750H/RTX 2070 (on par with today standards) doesn't run it any better! A game from 2012! I have slowdowns in most of the purple areas/maps, I had 5-10 FPS for a solid minute during boss fights in maps and the game even froze at times! I'm finding myself having to avoid certain maps because of these lags...

All in all, I wouldn't recommend playing this game unless it's by pure nostalgia, as Torchlight I wasn't laggy as far as I remember and today ARPGs are just more fun in general.",1625406701,1625406796,False,6,0,0.528733253479003906,0,True,False,False

Allow me to start with the bad

Torchlight 2 has abysmal writing, the dialog is dull and uninspiring and even the world is superficial and feels disconnected. Every quest, even main-storyline quests, are simply dull fetch quests where you talk to someone, find the thing they ask for, go back and talk to them again to get your randomised loot reward. There are no unique or memorable side-quests, not even something fun like a chain of side-quests (like the trading-quests in Zelda games). Actually, there is exactly one such a side-quest. There are robot parts which you can go out of your way to collect, it gives you a good loot reward but that's it - it's not particularly memorable. Please don't buy this game for the story or the world, or for a memorable experience, you will be heavily disappointed if you do. 

Then there's the build variety. It's a mixed bag, there are good things to it but overall I find it lacking and had hoped it was better. At the start of a game you choose a class you want to play, each class has a unique fighting style and within that class you can still choose among a few different play styles. There are lots of weapon types and each class has a set of types that they work well with. It's probably smart to focus on one or two weapon types (such as Cannon and 2H-physical melee weapon) and stick with those. If you play at the highest difficulty you'll probably want a shield because it gives you a block-chance. So yea, you do have lots of options and you certainly can find a play style that you like, why am I still negative about build variety? Because skills are very restricted in their design, there are no fun ways to combine skills and effects. Like say having a skill that drains your HP in exchange for damage and a mana-damage converter ability that takes some of your HP damage and drains your mana instead. Or a self-damaging ability that you use to activate abilities that proc on taking damage. Using skills in a way that is not strictly the intended way, but designers allow for, makes ARPGs a lot of fun. In such games you're always on the look out for ways to combine certain effects to give you an edge, it makes your build unique and it gives players this great sense of reward for thinking outside of the box. Torchlight 2 has none of that, you pretty much read the ability's description, that's how you can use it and that's pretty much it.


So what about the good?

First of all Torchlight 2 has excellent mod support, the mods on steam workshop are great. Vanilla Torchlight 2 has a few terrible design issues, such as spell drop rates being way too low (you can go through an entire play through with only a handful of spells dropping) and you can just find mods to outright fix these issues. Mods that add new vendors, mods that change drop rates, or heck even mods that change the entire gear pool. There's mods that add new classes, mods that introduce new pets. There's lot choose and try out. Second great point is multiplayer support. Online play is still fully supported and it's excellent. It's easy to join an online game and make new friends. It'll even indicate which mods are needed to join, if you wanna join a modded game online. 


Thoughts overall

Overall Torchlight is mechanically solid, even if it's not very exciting or memorable. Even with the poor writing and restricted skills and abilities, you will still have fun grinding, making your build stronger and stomping on mobs and bosses. Thanks to excellent mod support, you can go beyond just your build and modify the entire game to suit your play style even better.",1625082165,1625082604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay could have been fun. So what went wrong? Runic Games, that did. 

This is only half a rant about Torchlight 2 and mostly about the company behind it, however these things are very much so good arguments against not only Torchlight, but any game they may bring out in the future.
Torchlight 2 itself is alright. Its main problem is that for lategame there are no interresting & powerful builds. Imagine playing Diablo and finding out that the most powerful build in lategame for each class was using their basic attacks. 
Yeah.. that's TL2.

But that alone would not warrant me writing a negative review. So what really happened?

Despite being played through Steam, Runig Games still requires you to have an account on their website, which you need to link and the password of which you require to play. So far so good. Apparantly some time in the past their database got breached, so google is telling me to change my password. Alright, happens. 
Changing a password SHOULD not be hard after all. Trying to do so, the website responds with ""looks like something went wrong. Please try again or contact support for assistance""? Alright, this too, can happen!
But this has been the case for LITERALLY MONTHS now. The same problem, unattended, for months. 

Alright, maybe they dont know about it. Let's do as the message suggests and contact the support. 
If only it was that easy, right? So using their own official link, the browser detect the site as insecure. You need to manually confirm that you want to access this site and its not a mistake. Promising. Their web certificate is invalid? What else can you mess up as a legitimate company?
So after all this.. how did the story end? In a 403 forbidden response. Like, seriously? You literally cannot even reach out to get their support to fix things. I have a hard time believing they dont know about this. You know.. for example by the fact that no support reqeusts whatsoever reach them. 

So TL;DR: Without wanting to sound needlessly offensive, Runic Games is a seriously incompetent company.
They cant get basic features to work. They leave problems unattended and unfixed for months (or according to some posts, possibly years). They are incapable of implementing support feature that would allow you to either help yourself, or reach out for help.
So why would you expect them to deliver anything better than that in their games? I dont just recommend not getting Torchlight. I recommend not getting ANY of Runic Games software. They seriously need to get their shit together.",1624626524,1624626858,False,6,1,0.606338620185852051,0,True,False,False

Improved on the first game in every way.  Gameplay was better, classes improved, loot improved, etc.  I liked this almost as much as I liked Diablo II.

Not much.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

Beat the game and enjoyed it.  Had no interest to come back.  I do consider this game better than Torchlight III.

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

Seriously, don't play engineer. TL2 has a quite simple skill system, it's basically 3 trees with 7 skills in each, and 3 passive skills in each. 30 skills total. Engineer's skill trees are split between 2H ranged, 2H melee, and 1H/shield melee. There are overlaps, but there's roughly 10+ skills that become worthless once you've chosen a weapon style. Compare this to mage, where you have roughly 3-4 skills that are weapon/element locked. Whoever was the design chief for the engineer should be ashamed. When you've already simplified the game to this point, it's nonsense to have a class that is actually mini-classes instead of a proper class.

playing mage now, far better gameplay feeling from that. 

Last edit: I don't know. The gameplay is... sluggish. Attack speeds are slow, everything is slow. The flow of this game is horrible. After testing GD again..... I just realized this game just irks me with how slow it is. 

Yeah, not gonna bother playing this any more. If you feel normal ARPGs are far too fast-paced, you might like this game, but nah.... not for me.

* the menus/buttons/interactions are from the last century
* the AI is from the last century or worse
* the ""hightmap"" is totally borked
* the items are even worse than random gen from chinese mobile games (""this is a legendary XYZ"" as lore text.. lol.)
* the game is so fricking empty, its painful.
* the achievement are so generic and unrealistic, that somebody probably let a bot decide

[h1]In-Depth:[/h1]
After the somewhat disappointing launch of Diablo III came Torchlight II, the Diablo II you always wanted. Rather than a gloomy feeling Diablo gives you, Torchlight focuses on a jollier and cartoonish atmosphere.

The story follows the Alchemist who is on the search to cure his disease and is destroying everything in his path. You got 3 classes each with three skill trees that all change the way you want to play. Towns offer you a temporary safe haven, where you can purchase and sell loot, enchant items, salvage gems or unsocket items.

The game is fun and fairly rewarding, as the loot system is rather large. There are many bosses to fight and many more unique monsters. The maps are rather large but you will get around them soon enough, as well as find all the side-quests hidden within them. Your pet can sell and buy items for you, saving you the bothersome trip back to town to unload your bags. After a while, however, these large maps might start feeling a bit repetitive and empty and the combat might start feeling shallow.",1419978149,1619994222,True,5,0,0.555373132228851318,0,True,False,False

If you ever were a fan of the FATE series or the first Torchlight, this is a must. Its gameplay is much better than the first Torchlight, but it still keeps the theme and feel.

Combat has been greatly improved, and the classes are more interesting.

Exploration is the strongest point of this game. The visuals are breathtaking for an overhead ARPG. Both the overland areas and dungeons are well-designed, interesting to explore, and visually appreciable.

The only noticeable downside I see in this game is that the first few hours seemed rather dull to me. When I got later into the game, though, it became very interesting. 

Also, the environments are static, meaning they aren't procedurally generated. This isn't really a bad thing -- it allows for much more detail in the levels, and detail I saw. It just means there isn't as much replay value. Once you beat the game, you might not be interested in playing it again.",1398538622,1618876162,True,1,0,0.50069350004196167,0,True,False,False

I had some prejudice against the game without any solid basis – it was just something new, looked something that requires tons of hardtrying and thinking – neither of which I'm inclined to. I also faced some minor issues with the duplicate login, but that didn’t stop me from playing and enjoying the game.

[h1]What do we have here?[/h1]

Here we have, as most of the Steam review stated Diablo Clone/ Diablo whatever/ other synonym to Diablo-related-game. Well, as for me, here we have a game [strike]what a surprise[/strike] full of magic, shotguns and world-saving. However, the world-saving part is not that important here, as the cut scenes are boring, the texts of the story line are too long to read and they are not just unimportant to remember but simply they are just a background to somehow determine why we are here.

[h1]Some boring technical stuff[/h1]

There is no game which is perfect in terms of a cooperative mode. But it is for you to decide: are you going to solve the issues to play the game or would you just find something else which would work perfect at the first glance.
Luckily, the first and only technical issue which I faced in the game by cooperative mode was a duplicate login issue. When that window popped up I just wanted to run away and to find something else to play during the evening, but I decided why not actually make it work?  Yes, there are still so many discussions of how the developers don’t support the game, how they don’t care and so on and so on. Yes, that might not be a good thing, but what is good is to try out a game [strike]HA, PRIORITIES.[/strike]
So, in order to solve the issue I created a second account on the Runic games, disconnected the first account out of Steam’s account and connected the new one. Later, you wouldn’t need all that procedure to do again. Just login in the game with any of the accounts and all of your progress would be counted for your Steam account. So, you don’t need to worry about the achievements ;) 
I’m not sure what is the proper explanation of that, but it works. So don’t put the game into a trash bin if you face duplicate login issues. Just play around with a new account and it is going to be just fine.

[h1]Some gameplay stuff[/h1]

Some games are made for the storyline, but some for the process. And this game is exactly about that. From the first glance the game looked really repeatable by going there-coming-here-process, however the game doesn’t repeat itself. Even after completing the game several times, it still looked fresh and exciting to play. Whether it is a new class to play or even different specs; or some new locations – the game always has something to make you feel interested. New Game+ or to play some additional maps – your journey never ends.
Played it mostly in cooperative mode and I can say that the game is great to play with friends. It could be simple, could be hard. It requires exactly that amount of concentration to chill in the game after a work day but at the same time it is not that boringly easy.
The only moment which I kinda dislike is there is no possibility of full respecing to try out different builds without creating a new character – you can respect only the last 3 skills, which is useless.

[h1]To sum up[/h1]

The game is simple and fun. The game provides a lot of entertainment: killing enemies, multiple side quests even fishing was really well made. [b]Torchlight 2[/b] looks a bit cartoonish, doesn’t have a great story arc BUT most importantly it provides an easy-going atmosphere and fun, so /whisper a few friends and hop on!

My experience in ARPG games is limited to Diablo 3, Diablo 2 and Path of Exile. Did I say limited? That list is ordered by increasing time spent, and I’d rather not know what fraction of my life went into them all. I played and completed the first Torchlight, but since I don’t remember much of it, I have no point of reference.

Torchlight 2 is unlike them all: it’s the only light-hearted ARPG I know. Environments are bright and colorful, most characters are positive, and even the grand theme of the story has more to do with saving than with destroying. Unlike POE and Diablo, Torchlight doesn’t deal with themes of corruption, decay, perfidy, treachery; doesn’t show disfiguration or deformity. This doesn’t mean it’s all flowers and rainbows: there is mass slaughter of monsters and some cartoony gore, making combat satisfying and rewarding. 

I’ll openly admit that the story didn’t catch my ear most of the time. I skimmed through the conversation screens. Very few of them have voice lines, and exposition of the story suffers for it a bit. It doesn’t feature saving the entire world (like Diablo) or multiverse (like POE), but it doesn’t mean the players can see slices of the world in greater detail, or that they get more emotionally involved in the story. Much like other ARPGs, the variety of quests reduces to “travel - kill - bring item”. Nothing else is expected in this genre, and that’s a feature.

[b]Build depth and variety[/b]
After spending >50 hours in Torchlight 2 I didn’t feel like the game had much more to explore. I could try more classes and push into level 100 endgame, but nothing in the skill design, level progression or map names hinted at any great reward at the end. I recommend exploring at least 2 classes, trying mapping, or better yet - New Game Plus. NG+ serves a similar purpose to the difficulty levels of Diablo 2. Itemization system did not drive me to play more on its own. It involves mostly numerical increases, and unique or legendary items have little influence on gameplay.

Unfortunately, 4 classes and few gameplay differences between builds is just very little compared to mentioned ARPGs. There is very little interaction between players. Aura builds don’t feature here, but playing in a team is extremely convenient and a bit easier than solo gameplay. 2-person team can have two town portals leading to different places and can teleport to each other at nearly any time (which has a side effect of nullifying death penalties: you only lose a few seconds, but no gold or experience).

[b]Is it similar to…?[/b]
In comparison to Diablo 3, Torchlight lacks the weight of Diablo world and storyline. The story feels much smaller in scope, not involving the fate of the entire world. Class and build variety is a lot smaller, but since Diablo 3 itself was very uninspired in this, this isn’t a step back.

Where Path of Exile is a kilometer-high burger of tasty things, but assembled in wrong order and with half of the ingredients being strange or repulsive foods, Torchlight is a delicious, simple meal that mostly anyone can enjoy.

[b]Smaller is sometimes better[/b]
The comparison with POE summarizes Torchlight well. Do you long for some satisfying monster-slaying, picking up loot and exploring some new environments, without worrying too much about skill trees, synergistic builds, and carrying on your shoulders the weight of Sanctuary or whatever new level of world of worlds POE is currently at? Only Torchlight can satisfy this.

The game is designed in a modern way, is not burdened with unintuitive restrictions, is technically near perfect and has removed almost all the tedium from ARPGs. The only minor technical frustration is related to the “duplicate login” issue (check the Steam discussions for workarounds). Unfortunately, the original developer has shut down and there is no hope of fixes or expansions.

This also makes it a perfect game to introduce someone new to the ARPG genre – just don’t overdo it, at risk of making an impression that this genre is just simple and boring.",1618419729,1618420084,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You wouldn't even be surprised if you found the monsters having a picnic and playing Pattycake and baking cakes or practicing dance moves. 

At least so far, EVERYTHING HAS KNOCKBACK. So you are constantly being knocked back as a melee character, taking any smoothness of gameplay out of the game. 

There is no real difficulty level. Veteran is too easy if you have the attention span of a bedridden grandma, yet Elite is unrealistically 'difficult'. And by difficult, I mean you sit clicking a boss for 5-10 minutes while spamming health potion, and have to sell normal gear to buy potions. 

This whole game just feels like a slightly 'upgraded' X-men legends, except X-men legends has you playing likable characters. There's nothing to like about a no-story, no skin texture, bubble bath looking 'warrior' whose shouts sound like some generic soundboard clipped off of newgrounds.com. 

I'm guessing some mind altering stimulants + easy difficulty could make this a satisfactory grind for someone who doesn't mind a lack of depth.

And I went ahead and 'spoiled' the game for myself by looking up the late game items. There's nothing unique at all. It's all just upscaled regular weapon effects. So there's literally no 'cool' or unorthodox builds, or even aesthetic builds that even Diablo 3 has the option to do. 

A lot of people also report that putting the game on windowed fullscreen will permanently crash the game, causing you to have to find the config file or reinstall. And the company made millions off of this game and they don't even put in a tiny bit of work to fix stuff like that. This game represents everything that is wrong with society currently, haha.

Yes. Buy it. 

Now, for those who rarely or never played a Hack and slash ARPG, Torchlight II is what you would call Indie gaming labor of love. This has been used as sort of a guideline for any other indie ARPG devs, as it is most likely the biggest and most well defined game. (FATE too, but that's another story).

Buy this if you want to play a game that is challenging, fun and feels complete, because it is.

Big PS : Do NOT buy Torchlight III, it was Runic games' mobile game, but they disbanded ( I think their publisher just dissolved them, but I am not dabbling in hear-say). After that, the publisher just gave the IP to a new studio who rebranded Torchlight Frontier (mobile) into Torchlight III.

Torchlight takes out that Generic loot system, and places it around your character without it being so random as the enemies you can expect to know that.  The great and best iv seen also, there was never a AUCTION HOUSE LOL for this game and it helped to keep the game from grindy gringy aspects.

Compared to Torchlight 1 (which was basically “just” a mine with different levels) it has wide open areas with optional dungeons and quests. The story is still linear but has a greater feeling of freedom.

Progression is fast and rewarding and the different classes allow for a variety of different playstyles. 

I especially like the usefulness of the pet. Sending it to the city to sell stuff is great. Doing it manually would be really tedious. There is just so much loot.

Playing in co-op is also very fun. Great sequel to a great game!

I am not too impressed by the base game. I wouldn't call it bad, but sort of bland. There isn't really much in the way of synergy between items in game and builds, every class spec uses mana as a resource. This doesn't make sense for physical damage dealing characters which limits the game IMO. 

The mods that I am running have taken this game to another level. I wasn't even enjoying the game with mods when I reviewed this a year ago because the mods had just put in more enemies and made over powered classes. It was like being in a Michael Bey movie, all explosions but no substance. The modders to their credit have continued to balance the game and it's actually much more difficult to play now. Classes have been continually balanced and I am quite impressed with their work. You have to hand it to some dedicated nerds doing things in their free time to try and improve a game. 07

Torchlight 2 is a very fun game that is leaps better than the first game. Though I have T2 here I mostly play it on my Switch Lite, so my time played is god knows how long on that device. Since I have it in two places there'll be no prizes awarded for how this review's gonna' swing.


[b]The Visuals: [/b]

Not nearly as dark or as engaging as the old Diablo games, but they look pretty nice. Way more cartoony and blocky, like WoW graphics or something. Effects though are really nice- An Engineer's firey mace slam looks about as powerful as you'd expect it'd be, enemies who take way too much damage explode into meat chunks, etc etc. So while these may not be the best graphics of all time, they certainly don't detract from the fun or anything.


[b]The Loot:[/b]

You're not drowning in the best drops of all time constantly (cough, cough Borderlands 3) which believe it or not is a very good thing. Players would quickly get bored if they had access to all the best gear right away. Your character has a ton of different equipment slots from both hands, head, neck, belt, 2 rings, body armor, feet, friggin' PANTS, and on and on. No shortage of places to slap on your guy, no sir. As an extra bonus most every piece shows up on your character when worn.

One thing T2 does that I really like is have different conditions in order to equip your gear. An example might be a Plate Mail chestpiece that can be worn at character level 20 or a combination of Strength 15 and Vitality 18. This way my Embermage with low strength still has a shot of using some big-ass weapon, provided I meet at least one set of the requirements. It's a great system that I'm surprised wasn't copied to death by every other game like this (maybe it was? I don't get out much..)

Itemization is INTREGAL to a game like this, and many do not get this right. While not on the same level as Diablo 2, the itemization in T2 is loads better than say Diablo 3. In that game you had stuff like ""Strength +603"" and ""Increases Skill X damage by 10,000%"". Constantly escalating numbers like this until the end of time. Wowee. T2 has some interesting item modifiers even towards the beginning, like the ever-useful ""All gear stat requirements -X points"". This is of course HUGE at the start when you don't have lots of stats to begin with and may want to experiment with different weapons or armor. 

Even lowly items can come with an increased chance to find magic items, which means you'll be finding some good stuff sooner than usual. You can even start stacking damage reduction gear right away if you should choose, and some passive skills for your characters can further increase that overall damage reduction (ex. Bulwark).

This game does suffer from what just about every aRPG does when it comes to loot though: Very quickly you'll ignore practically 90% of all item drops since you'll never want to use them yourself. Luckily gold is pretty worthwhile in the game so you can still hoard and sell your stuff. It's not COMPLETELY worthless, just worthless as gear you'll want to equip!

One nitpick I have about the loot is the text color they chose for set pieces. For whatever reason they chose to use blue, which is also used to denote a rare piece of gear. I wish they would've made set pieces have another color, like purple or even a different shade of blue.


[b]The Pet[/b]

T2 gives you an NPC follower in the form of a pet. They can fight, they can use spells even. There are many different types to choose from but from what I can gather they all act pretty much the same way. The best ability for your pet by far though is that you can give it all your extra crap and have it run back to town to sell for you while you're still out killing monsters in the field. This is such a good idea, as constantly using town portal scrolls to sell your junk kind of really messes a game's flow up. 

Additionally, you can give your pet instructions to purchase some small items like scrolls of identify and healing potions. After a brief time (usually about 2 minutes in real time) the pet will return and give you the gold from items sold and anything you asked it to buy for you. This is one of the most unique things about the game IMO.


[b]The Sound[/b]

If there's one thing that really stands out about the game (maybe not in a good way) is that the music sounds almost exactly like the Diablo games. I'm not positive (and don't want to use google to cheat) but the same composer might be responsible for both games. The music itself is GREAT, it's just that since I've played countless hours of D1 and D2 it's impossible for me to not immediately think of those other games while playing this.


[b]The Mods[/b]

Though I haven't used many there are a shitload of great mods for this game available here on ye olde Steamy Workshop. Better effects, Extra classes, extra pets, QoL improvements, you name it can all be had for free. Isn't free good?? 

I kind of wish I could use some of these on my Switch version, but talk about your first world problems eh?


[b]In Closing[/b]

In closing this is a very good and fun game I'd recommend to anybody who even remotely likes aRPGs. To top it off, I believe I grabbed this on a super-deep sale and only paid like $4 for it. You really can't beat that price for what you get.",1614872426,1614873125,True,17,0,0.655090630054473877,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is easy, you just go, hit somethings with a hammer then loot as if it's Dying Light. The skill system is noice. The classes are noice, there are 4 classes which are:

- Enginner the super badass class that blows everyone into guts. Uses mainly two-handed weapons, cannons and shotguns.
- Berserker the maniac spitball that likes to scream a lot. Uses mainly one-handed weapons and shields.
- Embermage the douchy lookin' ""person"". Uses mainly mage weapons of course. (that means wands and staffs.)
- Outlander the badass type class that you'd see in movies. Uses mainly pistols, bows, crossbows.

The quests are easy to complete. GO-KILL-LOOT are what quests are. I'm not sure if there is a storyline but I don't really give a s*** about that. The skill system is not easy nor hard just choose which one helps you the most in battle. The pets are nice they have skins and 3 different items they use...blah blah blah.

My feeling each time has been confirmed upteen times.  The game is buggy.  It runs smoothly and doesn't crash.  That has never been the problem with Torchlight 2.  It's problem is that none of the skills or loot work as advertized and even when it does it is convoluted and hidden from the user.  If you actually test out whether the loot does what it claims, for example perhaps the item says it reduces the physical damage by x amount for each enemy within 3 meters.  It rarely actually does so.  There are some noobs, which I am not, that can be convinced that this is not so because they have modded the crap out of their games and so can be tricked to believe it is the mods fault.  I've seen it on the forums, but that is not the case.  I have never added a mod to Torchlight.  Half the items still don't work as described and the skills have always been buggy.  The only truly reliable enchantment is the attribute increase enchantments.  If you want a better game that has reliable loot and skills buy Exile or Diablo, don't buy Torchlight.  Torchlight is not for those people who like scientists don't just believe what they are being told.

I've played many hours of similar titles, and the Torchlight series in general has been a strong contender. Where the series really shines is in customization of your character and skills. A lot of similar games will let you equip a wide array of randomized equipment, but Torchlight is one of the only ones where you can change your character's appearance (mostly gender, face, and hair) as well. Many other ARPGs won't even let you change genders, probably due to the increased development costs so I get it. You also start with a combat pet (unlike cosmetic pets in other RPG games) and even in the base game there are many options, with even more options for transforming that pet into other things using fish. 

That's all before even adding mods, which on Steam is very easy to do and there are a wide variety of mods for character appearance, classes, skills, equipment, pets, and more. What that means is this game has a very high replay value because even playing through more than once as the same class can be a completely different experience depending on your skill tree and equipment choices.

The story is overall pretty good. It's standard genre fare and takes a lot of cues from the literal grandmommy, Diablo, which shouldn't be a huge shock since two of the lead developers on the original Torchlight worked on Diablo II, and the third lead developer worked on Fate. In fact, combining Diablo and Fate is a pretty good representation of what Torchlight is, from the story to the music to the artwork to the overall mechanics. It's not the exact same story as any of those games, just includes a lot of familiar tropes and the idea that a powerful being is wreaking havoc on the world and you're following it from place to place undoing the evils it has done while trying to catch up and defeat it.

Last thing, I said Torchlight II is the best in the series and that really boils down to game play for me. How does it play? How does it feel? Torchlight I is pretty solid, it was a lot of fun. Torchlight II is even more solid and has a number of improvements in the way the levels and combat flow. Torchlight III kind of gets stuck in this area. I've only played it on console and I'm not saying it's a bad game, it's a decent game, I just don't find myself getting caught up in the story and fighting baddies for hours like I do with Torchlight II.

Final verdict, if you're into ARPGs or think you want to try one and you're eyeing the Torchlight series but only have enough cash for one, Torchlight II is the one to get.",1610823183,1610823183,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Not challenging enough. I've played 4 hours and the game is too easy in the beginning while on elite difficulty. At no point did I find my character having low health. The enemies are not challenging. I'm coming from playing Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing which is much more challenging for a veteran hack and slash player like myself. Diablo III (i'd also not recommend) also was not difficult enough on first play through and I'm not one to play through the campaign a 2nd time with the same character.

- Torchlight II  atmosphere is just not dark enough. I was looking for a Diablo II or Grim Dawn like aesthetic / environment. I also feel that Diablo III is not dark (grim) enough.

If you're like me, a veteran action RPG / hack n slash game, I'd recommend you look elsewhere. e.g. Grim Dawn / Van Helsing series.

As far as ARPGs goes it is extremely deep. While there are only 4 character classes, each has 3 skill archetype, each with 3 passives and 7 active abilities (30 skills to level per character). This creates a huge number of possibilities in terms of building different characters. And I haven't talked about the different weapon types, weapon slots, and even ""neutral"" abilites/spells that ever class can learn to further customize your character. Add on to that 4 difficulty modes, NG+ plus, Ironman, and bonus dungeons and there is a ton of end game content here.
The Torchlight developers are notorious for their generous DRM stance, and I would like to confirm I played the entire campaign with my friend over LAN and it was a fabulous glitch free run.

Graphically they chose a relatively low polygon cartoon style. This helps the game not age poorly, but this is certainly not a ""dark, gritty"" game but it's not trying to be. Sound effects are quite good, though the voice acting and music is anemic.

If Torchlight has always struggled it's in the world building, characters and story. I really have no idea what i was doing except chasing objective markers on a minimap. The town are little more than statuesque NPCs sitting in front of stalls. You don't ever get the feeling you're in a living world, just a big arcade arena with things to kill. 

Mind you it's fun enough, loot drops are fairly generous, and for its price tag it's very hard to go wrong here.",1610321756,1610321756,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

My favorite aspect of this game is that it's fun right from the get go.  You don't have to wait to be a certain level or get a certain skill before things get interesting.  The default movement speed is fast and the first skills are fun and satisfying to use.  There are more powerful skills down the line to look forward to, but it's not a slog to get to them.

The other great part is the item drop rates.  You can actually get good items in a reasonable amount of time, but there are still really powerful items to grind for if you wish (and even those are not that hard to get).  

There are only 4 classes to choose from, but they cover any build you'd want out of this kind of game.  The Berserker is speedy melee, the Outlander is ranged, the Embermage is a caster, and the Engineer is a hybrid of sorts (can be 2 handed melee, sword and board, ranged, or even a summoner).

Runic has done an outstanding job of taking the legendary execution of the perfect dungeon crawling experience that was Diablo and made it even better.  This and the original Torchlight are fantastic clones of Diablo and Diablo II, but don't be fooled, they aren't outright copies.  They have taken the concept of a story driven dungeon crawler and made it their own, while maintaining that feel, playability, and re-playability of the original masterpiece.  This game features all of the essential features like mouse button actions, click movement, and easy inventory, skills, and character management.  The UI is straightforward and simple to use, the hotkeys are practical, and the hotbar effortless.  Runic has added some very exciting and helpful features to the experience like having a Pet.  Your pet, (My pet is a Ferret named Lucy) is the best of companions, a formidable warrior, and a priceless aide.  It has it's own full inventory that you can transfer items to to hold, or to have it scamper off to town to sell all of the items and return to you a short time later, gold in tow.  But that's not all, you can make a shopping list for the critter to take to town and fulfill, so that it may bring much healing and mana potions back to you in the heat of battle.    You  can select the pet's stance, aggressive, defensive, or passive.  Another interesting, (and helpful) addition to the gameplay is fishing. Yes, fishing.  Once you cast your line into one of the many scattered fishing holes, and land you a lunker of a web variety, you can feed that webfish to your pet to have it transform into a large Arachnid, which parades around shooting webs and snaring your enemies.  There are many other species for your pet to transform.  Overall I would have to give it a 9.7 out of 10.  It's simply amazing how well they did when making this title.

Firstly, because you can assign skill-points to any stat you like, it doesn't matter what weapon/fighting style you use.  Secondly, I'm all up for killing the forces of evil, but in this world, you practically kill everybody and everything you meet!  Storming into desert camps full of sleeping ""enemies"" and their dogs and killing them as they struggle to their feet is just wrong!  Cutting a bloody swathe through fantastical creatures in a magical marsh just because they live there sort of suggests you're playing the part of a violent psychopath.  Running back through beautiful landscapes devoid of life and littered with the corpses you left the last time you passed through feels like you're operating a scorched-earth policy against the lands you're allegedly trying to ""save"".

Unique to the series is a pet system which takes care of the usual Scrappy Mechanic found in more ""hardcore"" ARPGs like limited inventory to carry loot and having to teleport to town to sell trash. In Torchlight II, the pet acts as an extra inventory, can be sent to town to sell and purchase items and can assist you in combat.

Pros:

- Loots
- Very approachable
- Easy to learn
- Pet system and the benefits it brings
- Fishing
- Multiplayer comes in LAN and Internet modes
- Excellent Mod / Workshop support

Cons:

- No PvP
- Character builds are kind of generic
- Limited character appearance customization
- Lack of multiple game modes

Torchlight 2 is a rather shallow experience. Puny character builds. Little to no replayability and dated graphics all pile up to be a shadow of the genre. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 are older games and are much more detailed for character development.

Not only that, the dev seems afraid of actually giving something to the players. The loot is crap like 90% of the time, set items as super lame except maybe the top notch ones, AND all powers are in seconds except for most powerful tool in the game, the heal bot. Unlike Titan Quest where summons stays as long as they are alive except for a few very powerful killer ones, and you have plenty of powers that once activated, they remain on some sacrificing some maximum mana to maintain.

A very bad hack'n'slash game. The Multiplayer is not even supported anymore but Titan Quest and Diablo 2 still are just to tell you how crappy the game is. No wonder the team was dissolved.

Do not buy, get your hands on Titan Quest instead, it is a great experience both visually, musically and mythologicaly,",1606508386,1606508386,False,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

Graphics: 10/10 for the game in 2012, this graphics is really cute, less blood, less violent. The effect of every skills are good, yeh and this one is the inspiration for me to disover more and more skills.
Story: 8/10 This game doesn't have a good story enough since it's rpg game when people concentrate in gameplay more but if you try to read the story, you will find it's good.
Items Diversity: 10/10 Do i really have to talk about this, this is RPG, i repeat, this is RPG, of course it has variety of weapon, but what i want to say is the utility of each weapon from each class and its properties.
Mod: 11/10 This is the thing that i like most, and yeah, some good maps, new weapon, new cute pet, new class, new character, ..... you will find all of them in workshop, then give it a try.
Classes: 7/10 (for base game) and 9/10 (for mod)

An expansive skill system consisting of three skill trees in all four of the base classes. Maps are expansive and rewarding to fully explore, and plenty of side quests exist to give  you hours of content, including a post game ""Mapworks"" system, which are randomly generated maps which vary in level. All of these are fully fleshed out, but it gets even BETTER with the addition of the Workshop and player mods. The community have made so neat additions to the game, which only expand the replayability of the game through things like a restructuring of level architecture and generation, new post game materials, new items to obtain, and so on. Suddenly, four classes for me became an overwhelming 64, all with varying movesets and playstyles. The community makes a game, and Runic (god bless them, I'll miss them) knew this ever since the first Torchlight. 

This game takes a page straight out of Diablo 2, as the first game did with Diablo 1. Torchlight 2 blows Torchlight 1 away in every way, and is in my opinion, one of the very few perfect sequels for a game series.

Torchlight II is a really simple and easy to understand RPG with a cool art style and tons of different enemy types and bosses to fight. 

As of the time I'm writing this review I have only played one class (the ranged one) so I cant give input on the difficulty of the others, but so far I have found that on normal difficulty the game has (so far) been FAR too easy. I have probably only died 4 times since I started my first character, and 3 of those times I was watching a video on my phone and just holding LMB. However, this hasn't even lead to any boredom, I am still thoroughly enjoying my experience with this game.

Right from the get-go you can tell that this game is meant to be simple and fast-paced. It doesn't have a convoluted skill tree, or a million different character stats to upgrade. One drawback of the simplicity of the game, is that the loot variation isn't quite up to par with the standard for these types of games. But the variation in the stats that the weapons can roll with, and the gems that you can attach to your weapons and armor to give them various buffs and effects, have you constantly anticipating the next upgrade.

So far the enemy variation has been the feature that has me the most impressed. I can't even tell you how many different areas I've been through at this point, and each area features a fairly decent variety of enemy types. Typically each area has a theme, and the enemies follow that theme. This makes it very visually stimulating when you discover a new area, you'll be excited to see what wacky and cool new enemy types you will encounter. The variety in the enemy models and animations is one of my favorite parts of the game.

Finally, the Bosses. This I believe to be one of the weaker elements at play here. Each Boss feels very inconsequential, they are not typically very difficult to fight, and their move-sets usually contain only one or two more unique attacks than your run-of-the-mill grunt enemy.

It's a very fun and addictive game with fairly well thought out loot system and gaming mechanics.  I grew up playing Diablo 1.. and later Diablo 2.  I have played Diablo 3 for 3 years when it first came out (all the way up to season 3 or thereabouts) just to give an idea what kind of player i am.  I enjoy RPGs.. and experimenting with builds..etc.  This game has builds you can explore and have fun with.  The community here has many very helpful guides as well.

I have only played the Vanilla version of the game so far and still am having fun making builds.  After so many hours it does get a bit grindy.  You might get bored at that point but still well worth the price (esp if you get it on sale) and also for an older game.

Best farmer build I think is the Prismatic Bolt Embermage and get yourself into New Game + (single + not higher) and go farm Phase Beast Challenge for Limoany skulls.  Then the strongest build I have made is the ""Wolf Shaman"" Beserker build... just annihilates everything.

And if you like.. go for the mods.. which I haven't yet.  I mostly play single player..but I have tried co-op which is fine.  I am not a fan of the cartoony style.. but the gameplay is great.  Good Luck and enjoy~!",1604196280,1604196280,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It takes place years after the end of the original Torchlight. The Alchemist from the first game becomes corrupted by the Ember Blight and destroys the town. It is up to you to stop this villain.
It is a typical Action RPG, you hack and slay your way through the world while solving quests.
There are 4 different classes, Engineer, Outlander, Berserker and Embermage. Each class has 3 skill trees. 
Unlike its predecessor it features peer-to-peer multiplayer support and extended modding capabilities.
I recommend to use some Mods, like Synergies MOD to make the game even better.
The story is not really interesting but it is fun to play. The duration of the game is a bit short if you just intend to finish it once.
The soundtrack is good. The graphics are dated.
There are still people playing, but not so many anymore so it is better to have atleast 1 friend to play with (of course you can also play it alone).
It is still a good game and definitely the best game of the Torchlight series.

It'd be nice if I could fucking sign in though.
I went AFK for five minutes, come back to find that I've been signed out of the Runic platform and, of the 3 hours I have in the game, an hour of that was literally just me sitting at the main menu, occasionally tabbing back in seeing if I could sign back in yet. Eventually, I gave up and closed the game entirely, occasionally re-opening it to see if it fixed. It hasn't. It's been more than 2 hours.
I've reinstalled the game, I've changed the password for my Runic account, I've disconnected and reconnected my Runic account from Steam.
Seriously, this is an issue that's been around since the game came out, and no one ever thought to add an external ""log out"" button? According to the replies to others I've found, that's all it takes - is a button in the Runic Account Management page that would allow you to log out, rather than waiting some arbitrary and apparently random amount of time for the server to realize ""oh, wait, this person we kicked for being AFK wasn't even fully kicked out - let's fix that"".

I enjoy the game - but if I'm not gonna be able to play it with friends because of... Whatever you want to call this. Then i'd rather just go back to playing WildTangent's Fate.

With fans being so upset with Diablo III, I have to first say turn here. Torchlight II builds upon the already excellent engine and adds more content, a lengthy campaign, and tons of great loot. The dungeon crawler genre is all about the great loot, leveling your character, and fighting tough bosses. Once you get to the last couple of dungeons you will be guzzling potions like crazy. The game is non-stop action with no breaks. While Diablo III may have larger budget in the millions, a better story, and better graphics, Torchlight II delivers on what the fans want; loot, dungeons, and bosses.

You can pretty much forget the story. It is told in three pieces and isn't very interesting. Something about Nephilim invading the world and you trying to stop it? I honestly don't know. I lost track because the story is broken up too much and told in between three large acts so you forget what happens. What does matter is the action. You can choose between 4 strong classes that are typical for the genre. Mage, duelist, warrior, and a middle ground guy. Each class has a slew of great abilities that you actually won't completely acquire in one play through. I chose the duelist and stuck with akimbo pistols. There was even a perk called Akimbo! There's something here for every type of player.

The loot feels nearly endless and it is actually good. There are boss chests, large chests, and just regular ones spread throughout. You don't have to worry about getting good loot. Of course most of it ends up being junk, but when you beat a boss you will get something good. You can equip rings, belts, shields, leg and body armor, helmets, you name it. You can enchant items that add random stat increases, add jewels, even disenchant items to regain money. There was even an option to use junk loot to create new items like potions. I'm glad there are a lot of options for the main part of the game; the damn loot.

I found the dungeons and enemies to be plentiful and varied. I never really got bored. Each area has small, large, and champion enemies that get tougher to fight. Some times you will be swarmed by over a dozen, but that is the whole point. Every step led to an enemy and I felt the urge to uncover every part of every map. I always found a secret somewhere or a new champion to beat. Doing this helps you level up faster to make the game easier. There are side quests that are fun, and some down right tough bosses. A couple at the very end had to be beaten 2-3 times over which is a challenge all on its own.

When you die Torchlight punishes you with gold instead of lame armor damage. Resurrecting at the entrance is the cheapest option, but doing so in town is free, just inconvenient. The best one is resurrecting on the spot but costs 3 times as much as at the entrance. This really makes you think if it is worth it or not. Usually I only resurrected on the spot in the middle of a large overworld area where backtracking would take forever.

You still get a pet this time around, you can equip armor and other items on it. You can have your pet take your loot back for you, sell it, and now you can give it a list of items like potions and scrolls to bring back for you. You lose your pet for 2 minutes, but this is a life saver. Let your pet do the tedious work while you continue fighting. I found this almost revolutionary for the genre which is already one of the least updated in the gaming world.  If you want one reason to play this, the loot is what kept me going. I wanted to acquire new abilities, and get the best weapons and armor. There is also great balancing in multiplayer which is what most people are going to play.

Overall, Torchlight II is a lot of fun and has all the genre staples that people want, lots of great loot that is dished out often, tough boss fights, and a lot of strong varied enemies. Sure, the game isn't a technical hound, but who needs that for this type of game? The story kind of sucks, but in the end we just want to click away and kill stuff. Diablo III and TL2 are always being compared for a reason. TL2 did everything everyone expected D3 to do and it didn't. For even a fraction of the cost of D3 this game is a steal.",1474613256,1602810942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- 10 skills per Skill Branch as were in Diablo 2
- A lot of skills are dublicates with a bit different mechanic, e.g. Shockmage has Shocking Burst and Arc Beam which are pretty the same channeling short-range spells with a bit differences. I.e. there is almost none ways to make a great combo.
- Skills are pretty simple, no breakthrough.
- Only 4 character classes
- Absolutely line and not interesting quests. However, this is the disadvantage of 70% of Diabloids, yet still, it's here either.
- Not interesting world and fauna

From the Advantages, I would highlight:
- Pets. However, I would expect here more customization, behavior setup, skills, which all are missing. The only stuff you can do is to put of 3 things.
- Spells. Different, passive, and active, spells could be a good combo with the common skills. Yet still, spells aren't much power as have big cooldown and aren't better the skills at all, e.g. mage can spam with Prismatic Bolt, but can once a 30 sec cast three frost lances to freeze the foes, yet still the damage is equivalent.

The bottomline:
While playing this game I felt like I'm playng soulless copy of Diablo 2 + Sacred. It's like the developer just wanted to get the money on the ""franchise"" of diabloids.

PROS: Has it's own personality in art style and worldbuilding, fantasy with a whiff of steampunk and Cthulhu, although the latter has been subsumed by Grim Dawn, which was released a few years later. The pet is a particularly good mechanic.

CONS: Simplistic compared to competitors such as Diablo 3, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn. Simplicity leads to loot lacking flavour, with unique items being simply ""non-unique items but better"" (as opposed to say, Diablo 3 where they mostly have unique properties that can't be found anywhere else).

As you can likely tell from the game's description, this is another Diablo clone.  I would say this specific game is modeled most closely to Diablo 3.  The game tries to make its own mark though by having the range character effectively wield both magic, guns, shotguns, as well as traditional bows and crossbows.  Just like Diablo 2 and 3, the storyline has you traversing the game world stalking a former hero gone mad, which puts the world at risk.  Is the adventure worth it though?  I would argue that yes, the adventure was worth the time, even if it may not be memorable in the long-term.  The story is strong enough to barely carry the gameplay through.  Luckily the gameplay keeps things interesting enough to make the experience worthwhile.  One thing that makes this game stand out is that it is fairly generous with giving Achievements.  If you beat a boss and/or complete a quest or sidequest, you will receive an Achievement.

I finally decided to give this game a try and I can't say that I like this more than Diablo 3. Not only that, but Diablo 3 has come a long way since release and is much better than it was at launch.

Not being able to re-spec is a deal breaker for me, as I like to experiment with different builds. The various skills I tried so far are pretty uninteresting. I'm also not a fan of having to rely on consumables for porting to town and healing (there's not even HP regen when out of combat, it seems). In-game options are also very limited (I'd like to see HP of all enemies onscreen).

As an ARPG, I'm sure it gets better later. As of now, though, I just can't force myself to keep playing.

I can't play Path of Exile or any Diablo game without wondering why I have to keep going back to town to sell things.  Ugh, I want to pick up this loot but I don't want to go *all the way over there* for it. I need  potions, but I don't want to waste a portal scroll... ugh!

Torchlight 2 thought of a bunch of lovely quality of life improvements roguelikes could really use and put most of them into the pet mechanic.  Your pet can not only sell your junk, buy boosts and potions, and pick up loot while you merrily slaughter onwards, it can also tank for you and do extra damage for you.  With an excellent upgrade and recycling system, as well as an addicting gambling system, loot and money is ALWAYS useful whether you're level 8 or 80.  I would have liked more original content to play between level 80-100 but after playing through new game + you get access to some free play maps that let you enjoy your fancy drops and build to your heart's content.

The art style is stylized and has stood up extremely well for its age.  Despite being from 2012 and from a smaller studio it still looks pretty polished and fresh.  There could be more character customization but most gear looked pretty good so it didn't stop me from enjoying the loot progression.

The biggest drawback to this game is the skill system, which only allows you to refund the last three skill points you have spent.  If you accidentally invest too much into a skill that turns out to be a dud or not your style, you're SOL.  However, mods for this game are abound and there are ones available that give you more freedom to experiment with builds and skills without having to entirely restart your characters.

Basically, if you're in the mood for a dungeon crawler, you're going to like Torchlight 2.  It just might make it hard to go back to another one afterwards.",1600575378,1600575552,True,7,0,0.565217375755310059,1,True,False,False

With how much of an absolute shitshow the release of Torchlight III wound up being, it's easy to forget just how solid Torchlight II was. It's not an especially deep game, or an especially challenging one, but it's possibly the most polished and refined incarnation of the ARPG formula we're ever going to see. Every feature in the game is fully realized, to the point of where it's genuinely hard to think of areas where things could be added without disrupting the carefully-crafted balance

Having said that, the simplicity can make it grow stale to ARPG veterans who prefer their games more punishing and rough-around-the-edges, so consider whether you're going to be happy with an ARPG that makes no pretense of being deeper than Diablo 3 whatsoever

Multiplayer's fun, the mods are (for the most part) good, and it's hard to find complaint areas besides the obvious points of ""it gets a bit stale eventually"" and ""it's not especially challenging""

It is more of the same for the most part. The terrain seemed a little more varied and deliberate this time around, and thankfully the enemy regeneration stopped. Some of the bosses were pretty challenging, especially when they and their minions all congregated right on the teleportation pad.

Thank you for the reply.

Unfortunately, there are no developers to reach out to for your issue. Runic games was shut down years ago, and thus there is no one to reach out to or ask about your issue. Hopefully the link I provided will have resolutions from other players, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

This game is focused on gameplay and it is perfect: everything fits together: lot of items, many monsters, great character development with a lot of skills, spells, levels, few attributes and even a pet. It makes this game a bit more complex than some other hacknslay games (especially like Diablo 3). Like in Diablo 2 I had a lot of fun to get the next level to improve my character and feel the little improvements. And it is a lot of fun to compare the items and think which one fits better.

Another big advantage TL 2 has is the great support for mods. So you can change some gameplay mistakes, add many classes and play as you want. I recommend Synergies, Essentials, enhanced retextures, bagmod, and the Far East Pack. There is a limit of 10 mods and it is a great idea, because people are forced to make mod packs, so that users dont need to collect dozens of mods, but just few of them.

There is only one mistake this game has: the story is simple and the presentation of the story is too cheap.

Torchlight has a wonderful illustrated feel to it with a ""Diablo steam punk"" kind of vibe. The story is interesting if not terribly deep. The game is fairly linear with abilities and skills increasing with levels and stronger monsters dropping more powerful magic items (including magic sets that provide more power the more items you have of the set.) Most quests are of the ""go find this item"" or ""clear this dungeon"" type.

The gameplay is fairly easy. I've made level 36 on Normal play and have yet to die in the game, and I'm no expert by any means. While some of the monster concepts are repetitive, many of the bosses are quite imaginative and fun to fight. The manticore threw me right back to my Dungeons and Dragon days. And watch out for the spear-wielding cockroaches in the sewers (reminded me of a short story called ""Seven Days to Topside"").

If you enjoy light-hearted top down RPGs in single or multi player cooperative for a little relaxation, you'll likely enjoy this game.

My friend and I decided to quit halfway through, finally admitting we were simply not having any fun. There are hack and slash games I have enjoyed in the past (Diablo, Silver, VtM: Redemption, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn to name a few…), but this one pales in comparison.

On the one hand, it's a poor man's Diablo 2/3, on the other it's a cleaner, more kid-friendly action RPG without an excessive amount of demonic or hellish aspects to it. But, it's still not exceptionally fun. Addicting, yes, but not...fun. Hard to explain unless you've been in the same situation. 

I've played around 38 hours at the time of this review and I really just can't get into it much further. The story is pretty bare bones and is barely fit to be called a story at that. The artwork is cool in that steampunk sort of way, but even that can't save the game from falling into a mindless rut of mouse button mashing. Maybe that's perfectly kosher for some players, but for me it just wore thin...and my wrists hated me after extended play sessions.  

I will say that you CAN play this on a Mac without sacrificing a whole bunch in the graphics department.

Best way I can describe this game is world of warcraft classic graphics with a diablo 2 pacing (Runic Studios was founded by the schaefer brothers after all who were part of blizzard north). As with any ARPG's don't expect a witcher/dragonage type story here. Your here to kill and loot. 

An excellent ARPG for the loot hunter. I've played vanilla on a GOG version on and off for years. Recently I've fully used mod's for the gameplay this time and its a game changer. In fact I'd even be willing to say it rivals or even surpasses enjoyment I've gotten out of Grim Dawn. 

Heres my mod list and in order. One mod you could switch out is the blood one for boosting multiplayer numbers from 4 to 8 if you want to do LAN or friends online.So download these mods via steam workshop and load them in the mod manager in this order (No crashing/conflicts whatsoever):

10 Mods to use:
+ Synergies Mod (Adds so much especially for endgame, Increases difficulty but you'll get there. Raid Dungeons) 
+ Torchlight II Essentials (A mixed bag of goodies for everything)
+ Bag Mod (More Inventory Space)
+ More Pets (So many cool options including headcrabs, Mini Tyrael and serious pets too)
+ Endless Dungeon (Awesome just to grind and kill without thinking too much. Accessed via the first town)
+ Awesome Classes (Total classes are boosted to 16 instead of original 4)
+ Ultimate Boss Chest (Give much better drop rates and appropriate for bosses)
+ Better Blood Effects because gore is great.
+ Enhanced Retex Part 1 (Graphics polish)
+ Enhanced Retex Part 2  (Graphics polish)

The thought that this game surpasses Diablo 2 LOD is laughable. It does however appear to cater to a very causal ARPG player base, but I found loot in other games like D2 way more exciting and the item and skill synergies added a depth which isn't here in TL2.

Balance is completely busted. Even [b]on the second easiest difficulty[/b], taking [b]one[/b] hit from an enemy at the later stages of the game will drain the vast majority of your health and cause you to pop a health potion - which costs something like 300 gold. Yes, if you get hit only once then you just lost 300 gold, which is a  whole lot in this game - it's the equivalent of minutes worth of finding valuables, going back to town, selling junk items... to the point where you'll be hard--pressed to keep up with potions without vendoring literally everything you find, let alone use any spare gold to buy any other type of gear, enchantments, upgrades, crafting...!

Zones are finite and you'll explore most of them to get enough experience to move on, so just going back to old zones and grinding for more gold, experience, gear is not an option either.

Balance is also busted when it comes to skills. The usefulness of them varies wildly, to the point where you're probably likely to pick one skills to use all the time to the exception of everything else, making the skills trees utterly pointless despite them being awesome at a first glance. In fact, you'd be playing against yourself in trying to theorycraft a build rather than just pick the strongest, most useful skills for the least mana and mostly abuse that one skill.

I'm not one to shy away from a challenge. I have a ""6% of players"" achievement in this game, 7% for Path of Exile and 0,1% on Grim Dawn. It's just that the second-easiest difficulty setting feels like what a  ""don't try this at home"" Nightmare mode would feel in any other game.

There's plenty of mods to delve into and many of them address balance, an abysmal lack of rewards, gold, skill gating, ability points, etc - in fact, making the game easier seem to be the purpose of half the mods in the Workshop. If you're willing to spend dozens or hundreds of hours finding the perfect combination of mods for you, then by all means, go ahead and buy this - otherwise, go in only as a worthwhile study of what it gets right, not as a fun experience.",1554046897,1594879038,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,2,True,False,False

TL2 is a nice loot grind if you're craving one, unless you have Diablo 2 or Grim Dawn -- even PoE, though I'm not a terribly big fan of that. There's a lot of loot to be had and, for better or worse, even a copy of what you'd expect to be the same item will roll with different secondary modifiers. Unfortunately, that means you can't just hope that the final piece of your set finally drops with decent stats, you have to pray to three dozen gods from a handful of different pantheons that it drops [u]and[/u] has exactly the stats/sockets/bonuses you need it to. Though, even if you don't get what you're after, you might be able to use it for a bit until your ideal version drops. Not to mention all the other loot you'll get for your other characters in the meantime...

the grinding is fun and the skill system not really complex. i think it is very pleasant that you can switch between 2 weapons during the fight. Smash into the crowd in a second with the two-handed axe and then switch directly to the two-handed gun and give stray fire.

BEST: what i like most is that the companion can carry items and bring and sell them automatically to the city by mouse click (2 minutes). This allows a nice and long grind.

I also like that weapons and armour not only have a character level of frothing, but alternatively always a skill level of frothing. So you can also use a Lvl 30 axe with Lvl 20 if you have enough strength.

so far i only play the engineer. but there are 3 other classes that play differently (tested briefly). there are a few cosmetic adjustments in character creation. For the companion there are many choices. I am accompanied by a panda :-)",1593632391,1593632391,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It is not a bad game, but it is as blunt as they come. No lore, no story at all, I usually just skim through quests but at least one here an there catches my attention. Apparently I've done over 70 quests, but for the life of me I can't remember any. The final act is 7 levels which are almost identical with no goal or purpose other than make it hard to get to the bosses that are as insipid as the champions before them. Balance is weird, I played as a ranger and my pimped out crossbow (that I took from the gambler, not as drop) was doing in average about 500 per hit, when everything has 1.5k-15k life and fires once at 0.72s and crits at 1.4k. So you need to shoot your a$$ off to clean anything. No auto-loot, you need to put mouse on target it is not enough to shoot in the direction and it quite hard with see the small critters when it is full of mobs, effects, etc, continously getting drops for other classes than mine even from final bosses and this makes for quite a bad experience overall.

the coolest thing about it is that it really has great mod support i think i have never seen something like that for an arpg befor you even get complete new classes through mods for free im not kidding

the combat may is not as good as in one of the others above but the maps are very nice with lot of details here and there a lot of diffrent enemys and items

i recommend two mods and there compatibility patch ""synergizeMod"" and ""torchlight2 essentials"" you may also take the ""map hotkey mod"" if you like me using the map a lot

you dont need these mods to make t2 a good game it is on its own but i recommend it to get even more fun out of it

I am perhaps a bit outspoken in my lack of interest in the original Torchlight. Simply put, I did not find the game very compelling, despite it possesing, on paper, all of the aspects I typically associate with enjoyable ARPGs. The sequel, the appropriately named Torchlight 2, I am sorry to say, fares a bit worse. 

Everything that failed to catch my interested in the first game is dialed up; what little did interest me is dialed down. The main problem, I think, is that the world bores me. It's a fairly rote, by-the-numbers fantasy setting, innundated with the least-imaginative fetch quests you can possibly imagine. The art design is relatively generic, too, so not even the possibility of creative monster designs is there to lure me deeper into the game.

What Torchlight 2 does well is the same thing the first game does well: the core gameplay loop. The different classes are well-polished and mechanically sophisticated, and the minute-to-minute gameplay generally does an excellent job of providing a challenge while still feeling properly empowering. Unfortunately for me, that's just not enough. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I need more than just solid mechanics in a game. I need context. I need a reason to care. A reason to explore the world and to be excited about what I might find next. And Torchlight 2 does not provide that.

Co-op mode has finally been added which was sorely lacking in the original game. Instead of just having a solo adventure, 6 players can now co-op online and this is a very welcome addition as it makes the whole game much more engaging.

The art style is still the same cartoony look used in Torchlight 1 but does appear to have more visual effects this time. The maps are now absolutely huge areas with very explorable open area environments and yes, they are still randomized every time you play.

Unlike the original where you only had the option of retiring your character and passing an item over to a new one, Torchlight 2 now introduces New Game Plus modes where you can bring your beloved character over to replay the whole game with increased difficulties. The game also actively supports modding and be prepared to see the many interesting mods that will be crafted for it.

Downsides, Torchlight 2 has a very forgettable story which i didn't even bother to pay attention to, although the main campaign itself lasts for about 30 hours depending on the speed you play. But then again, story is not really the main point of this game. It is most enjoyable when you gather your friends and co-op together smashing mobs.

Overall Rating: 8 / 10
This is an outstanding Action RPG on its own, and is arguably even better then Diablo 3 which was released in the same year. Fans of the original Torchlight should definitely pick this up.",1357773379,1591405938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What helps set this apart from Diablo II is a lack of synergies, freeing you up from braindead cookie cutter builds, a pet that'll fight with you as well as being able to sell your loot in town and bring back requested supplies so you can stay out slaying longer, and the scrolls.

With scrolls, you can learn unique abilities, teach them to your pet instead, change your pet (temporarily or permanently), or even access a newly generated dungeon from inside your current dungeon!

It looks prettier, more open maps are a good thing, but I find the gameplay to be far less enjoyable (despite the first game getting old quickly).
It does try to improve on the first game. Boss fights are a good idea, but having every boss be a damage sponge that summons endless adds to hide its lackluster mechanics is not a good idea. Having enemies that do more than charge at you is a good idea, but requiring smart positioning and movement in combat with a really unreliable movement system is a bad idea (i.e. I am sick of click to move out of the fire only to be rooted as I attack an enemy not even close to where I clicked). Having a stat system where you're not just putting all your points into one or two stats is good, having a very restrictive viability in terms of your stats and abilities is not a good idea (you're not going to play this game the way you want, definitely not at the higher difficulty). T2 tries to give off the impression that combat isn't just spamming the same abilities over and over like T1, but that's what it comes down to.
Wish they had a better story though or better fleshed out world (something I wanted in the first game), maybe that could have gripped me but nah why add a good story when I can engage with the meh combat for hours and hours.

Really? Wow. In a deadpan voice sort of way.

Not the worst game I've played, not by a mile. But just so average. I was a bit nervous the instant I saw the cartoony, made for kids graphics. Just so meh. Torchlight 2 is the kind of game I play to kill time while waiting for my laundry to finish. Something one does when there's nothing at all better to do. Not deserving of ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews and best debut game awards, not an equal to Diablo II, that's for sure.

I don't get what it is so many people see in this mediocre and boring game. Perhaps it's just that the cartoonish graphics don't do it for me. Maybe I just got tired of my health orb being at precisely half, all the time, no matter what I did. Drink a healing potion and ten seconds later, I'm back to half health, for no reason. Continually. Plus I found that controls were, at times, unpredictable. I don't know why my character would simply charge a huge batch of monsters - Leeroy Jenkins style - half the time I pushed the key I'd hotkeyed for prismatic bolt, or some other power. But it did, then would be unresponsive thereafter. Thrilling.

The more I played, the more it occurred to me that Torchlight 2 is a very average and pointless gaming experience most of the time, and an outrightly frustrating one on occasion, and that it was time to move on.",1586568518,1586569953,False,1,1,0.436330854892730713,0,True,False,False

The 2009 original didn’t do anything to shake up the [i]Diablo[/i] clone sub-genre, and this sequel doesn’t do anything to shake up the [i]Torchlight[/i] formula. The game’s appeal continues to be its varied skill trees and the way the moment-to-moment gameplay manages to be so totally different between its four classes. Sure, there are still balance issues (the Engineer class slots nicely into the Alchemist’s role as the almost inarguable best class) and sure, it might have been something truly remarkable had it taken a few more risks, but the way the game is, it successfully improves in every way on the original game to the extent that it essentially makes it obsolete.

One interesting thing I’ve noticed across several playthroughs is how immediately you’re presented with different gameplay styles. The four classes start with wildly different skills and weapons, and even the game’s tutorial area is packed with low-level variants of just about every weapon type in the game. It’s very much geared at new players, and does a good job of introducing them to all of their options. Even with bizarre abilities like the Engineer’s many summons or the Outlander’s glaives, you’re never really deviating far from the formula set out in those initial levels. All that’s added is more complexity and more things to keep track of; you’re never expected to really deviate from the basics in terms of actual interaction.

It’s actually kind of hard to discuss [i]Torchlight 2[/i] at length, because it’s a game I recommend by proxy of its successful improvement over the original. It really doesn’t do anything new (unless you count multiplayer, which [i]Diablo[/i] had in 1997), but just cranking up the scope of the delightful [i]Torchlight[/i] without losing the charm of its many strange abilities and interesting locales is enough for me to want to keep coming back to it.

CONS: Regular soudtrack, they could be created more different music for different areas. You can't have a consistent summoning character if you like it (it's a pitty). The history is very confuse and nonsense.

On to the actual review of the game, torchlight 2 is a diablo esque dungeon crawler RPG where you pick a class, slay a bunch of monsters grabbing as much loot as you can find, while following a story that honestly is only there to say that you have an objective (not a diss i just seriously never cared).
Gameplay wise, Torchlight 2 stands up well past many in this genre, having many unique items, tons of fun abilities and ways to play, and 4 base classes for you to try out. Other than things that you can control, you get a nifty pet of your choice (including the option for a headcrab) that will fight alongside you and carry items you want to sell, buy things in town for you while you adventure, eat whatever you give it and transform, and even learn spells you find. 
The maps in torchlight 2 are also very rich and fun to explore, granted they aren’t randomly generated so there isn’t a lot of variety between runs, but they are massive and filled with experiences. Including dives into the netherrealms, void beasts, and small little puzzles that unlock different quests or dungeons. Noting there are usually 2 large maps and many dungeons located in those maps per act in the game, there is a lot to explore.
While you explore all these areas, you will notice a large variety of enemies that you will encounter. Most of them even fight differently than the next with not just simple move changes. Higher tiered variations also exist that come with crazy modifiers, like summoning, splitting into more upon death, and the most obnoxious but hilarious being teleporting. Overall its never boring with how many things there are to fight.
Lastly, ill comment on the graphics. Compared to modern computer graphics, it definitely looks aged. But I would never call it bad. The art style they used really does overshadow any lack of graphical fidelity, and it also makes torchlight 2 very accessible to play with friends who might not have a good computer. I know back when I bought this game I played on a really cheap laptop and the game ran extremely well (although it does seem to hiccup at ultrawide resolutions). 
Final verdict is that I fully recommend Torchlight 2 if you are into these types of RPGs. It's fun, accessible, cheap, and can be played on just about anything. 
P.S Only reason I’m finally reviewing this game is that after playing Wolcen I felt bad for never beating this game despite it being such a great experience, and also hyped for Torchlight 3 hopefully this year.

An evolution from the first game that's even more fun to play.

Torchlight 2 keeps mostly the same formula from the first game but improves from it, the main change being the addition of multiplayer to the game. There are some other noticeable changes, like a Charge meter that works differently for each class or passive tomes that occupy spell slots. Besides these, Torchlight 2 is still an ARPG through and through - not as minimalistic as the first game (in a good way), but also not an incredibly long game either. The main campaign can be finished in a few hours, though New Game Plus modes that add a few new dungeons to the campaign and the Mapworks area keep the game replayable for much longer.

The story is decent, the game looks good (even if not amazing) and the classes are interesting, but most of all the game being playable with mods greatly improve the game's potential.

My main issues with the game were:
[list][*]The difficulty spike in NG+ modes. While of course it's expected that the game becomes harder later, the game goes from being a breeze to dying completely all of a sudden because of a 1-hit attack or something that you couldn't even see coming. I lost count of how many times I died during the late game because of monsters causing 1-hit kills or taking damage from seemingly nowhere. Traps in special could use with a small nerf - of course one would expect traps to be deadly since that's the point, but in the late game they deal WAY too much damage. Certain enemies could have their damage potential nerfed as well.
[*]Aggro from pets and summons doesn't work well. Even though I was playing with a build focused on summons and often had over 10 allies to assist me, enemies most often will just ignore your allies and make a beeline for you. This greatly reduces the usefulness of pets and summons in the game. Also, because of this, I never really found any use for effects of increased armor or health for pets/summons since those weren't used most of the game.
[*]I'm also not fond of how summons need to be recast all the time, with most summons having to be recast every X seconds (large summons usually require recasting every 30s). I'd much rather have summons that take more aggro and require recasting when they die.[/list]

Overall, not a perfect game, but still incredibly fun.",1583241089,1583241089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the gameplay and the slight nods to predecessors like D2 and crawlers of the like. Although the game is cartoonish in design it feels great and the story is very compelling. It's easy to get lost in side quests and there's always something new to do. Game controls are simple and the HUD is easy to follow, with controls be similar to other crawlers in the space.

Each class has 3 skill trees to choose from to build your character. You can also cross build from any skill tree to make the ultimate hybrid. An added bonus, you can choose from an array of pets to fight along side you in battle or send them to town when you get to much loot. 

There are permanent portals for quick travel located throughout game. Temporary portal scrolls can be used if you aren't near a permanent portal to travel to town/camp to sale off loot or other places in the game you have already discovered. Temporary portal scrolls can be looted or can be bought in town/camp at one of the vendors that carry them. 

Make sure to fish in the water holes provided. It gives fish that you can feed your pet which will turn them into a different creature for so many minutes or gives you added stat bonuses for so long.  Be careful because some fish will turn you pet permanently into certain creatures.  And you can fish out gear too!

You can play solo, LAN line, or online for multiplayer.  Many fans have created mods on Steam if you want to add more to Torchlight 2.(As for me I play the vanilla version of the game and solo most of the time. If I want multiplayer I do LAN line to play with my family.)

There is tons of loot to to help gear up your character and  pet. There are sets of gear that give bonuses when two or more pieces are worn. There is gear pieces specific to each class. Some gear requires a scroll to identify it. Identity scrolls can be looted or bought in town/camp. Some gear has sockets for gems that add more stats and enchanting is an option. Make sure to keep a look out for the enchanters. You will  find them throughout the game in various areas and dungeons. Have them enchant your gear.  You can equip 4 spells on your character and 4 spells on your pet that enhance game play.  There is also a crafting system for potions and gems to upgrade them into something better.

In town/camp you can store your extra loot in the two chests provided. One for your toon the other to share with your other character you created and play. Unfortunately you cannot share money between characters, so each one you create must earn their own money.

The main mission carries you through all  3 acts along with side missions that can be found along the way that are scattered through the playing zones. Once you play through the first time you will not reach level 100.  You can either play through the main game again or play the map works until you reach level 100. If you chose to play through the main game you can still place loot into the shared chest in town/camp. If you choose the main game you can still go to the map works at any time via portals.

I know I did not cover everything but tried to cover the basics for anyone wanting to know about Torchlight 2 or for those just staring out.  Yes, Torchlight 2 is an older game but still has much appeal and many still play it.  It is one of those games that has not lost its charm for its fans, me included. I always find myself coming back to Torchlight  2. There just is something about it that draws me in.  Maybe it's the simplicity of straight forward hacknslash or how fun it is, or the endless builds I create from the talent/skill trees. Maybe it's the different areas/maps to play.  I just now when I play it that I'm in for endless fun and no headaches.

[ Art ]
The environments, character and monster design was not really appealing. The monsters and the ground colors are so desaturated that it feel like you are playing with cataract.
The animations when you hit the enemy is barely inexistent, it feels like your spells are not doing much, so you just look at the life bar of the enemies and you wait for it to go down, which is pretty boring.

[ Game-mechanics ]
It's good, there is some improvement from D2. I like the pet, you drop more set and rare items. The quests are like quests in your average MMO, they are not really interesting. (But which game has interesting quest seriously ?)

Overall, it was not a lot a fun, nothing to really make want to keep playing and I am going to ask for a refund.",1582281523,1582282259,False,3,0,0.484242111444473267,0,True,False,False

The only thing i took away from this game that it could have been so much.

So much stuff in this game seems useless, like the potion system, you always have enough and the only time you use them is when you almost get oneshot why the effort in adding potions in the first place look at diablo3 they moved away from that concept because it takes the pase out of an ACTION RPG they should rather have added a alchemist profession or add potions that have some use other than heal and give mana and dont even talk to me about the fishing, its the same as in the first one and its as useless as in the first one. I didn even bother to fish EVER.

also why the scrolls the only time you really need them is when you are infront of a boss so you can spawn back there faster when you die, oh and how could I forget the death system in this game is the most useless thing I have ever seen in a video game. In the first Torchlight it made kinda sense because if you would die right before the last floor and you wouldnt revive right there you would start at the beginning AND it cost you exp. In this one its more of an inconvinience than a fully fletched game mechanic they could have just taken out this system and it wouldt made a diffrence.

Also balancing and enemy design. So there are actually only 4 typed of enemys in this game they just have diffrente skins:

first you have the ranged HP taxer. this mob has a 100% hitchance(you cant dodge the attacks at all) mostly ranged but also comes in meele and they are just there so you cant just run through the whole game with low HP. also they have no internal cooldown on attacks so if you teleport into them without seeing them before you just die instantly and cant even react. 

seconldy we have auto aim caster, those guys do the most damage and have like 3 abilitys 2 of wich are autoaim the projectiles just follow you till the end of days and they hit like a truck if you are not a tank, like there is no skill involved at all the best thing you can do is just stand there and take it because if you try to go somewhere else dont be suprised if you pull more enemys and get fucked from them instead.

thirdly we have to big man low damage, those guys are just useless fat idiots that attack slow but also do no damage, Like the balancing is so way off in this game, quick attacks hit like a truck and slow attacks hit like nothing that is just totally illogical. just laizy ass gamedesign

and last we just have the charge get hit die enemys. those guys are just Instalock 1 shot machines if you think you can dodge them by teleporting behind them nononoooo they just turn around mid charge and still fuck you over, also they hit you like half hp with 1 hit and they also have no internal cooldown so they just 1 shot you if there are 2 of them.

So all of this sounds like im just a whiny bitch who dosent know how to play, but you should know that i played on veteran and only skilled HP to 60.

what i dont understand with this balancing is the inconsitancy of boss damage, you have bosses that do no damage at all and die in 2 seconds then you have bosses that 1 shot you with every ability like where is the middleground.

Then you have the loot well hahaha the ""loot"" if you would ever get any, I got a total of 4 uniques through my whole playthrough for MY class but is got a total of 23 uniques for OTHER CLASSES, like BRO the whole point of an ARPG is to get loot and you go ahead and shit in my mouth by making the loot not class specific and giving me fuckall for evey other class like BROOO.

Also the Gameplay is so clunky, you cant even animation cancle a autoattack with an ability you are just stuck there, for a game where you have to react almost immediatly this seems kinds stupid to me. and this is for ALL abilitys not just some every ability have a ""casttime"" so if you thought you would have the freedom of switching between you abilitys on the fly like diablo 3 and have a good fast pace gameplay loop that rewards you for being creative with skill use NO NON NOOO you just stick with one damage ability the whole game and buff that shit till it does more damage than my brain had playing this shit.

This game is repetetive as FUCK. EVER. SINGLE. QUEST. IS. THE. SAME. there is no exception NO exception its always the same: 1. get quest
           2. search doungen entrance
           3. kill boss/clear dungeon
           4. repeat
and that is the same till then end.

Now you must think what about the endgame i bet they have something really cool for us. :)
no its just the same shit over and over fucking DUNGEONS OVER AND OVER and nothing else. You can bossfarm if you want but you have to exploit the game for it or go into ng+ 

BTW i played this game with mods after like 10 mins of normal gameplay beacuse it is just so unplayable without mods, its like haveing no hands and trying to play diablo 3 with feet. its so cippleing.

Fuck dude i just fucking wasted 10 houres of my life with this shit and now im writing a review with 1000 gramma mistakes because this fucking game cost me 10$ and i cant give it back because i played it for too long.

Dont buy it its a waste of time, just play diablo 3 or any other ARPG",1582147204,1582147204,False,5,0,0.476987451314926147,0,True,False,False

 I wish we had a better review system, not just binary ""Yes/No"", because I am very 50% about this game. I'll try to give some reasons.
 Points distribution gives a false sensation of freedom in these games, because there is always a meta build or useless stats for each class, which is super arcaic in my opinion and I'd rather have other ways of creating diversity replacing the stats distribution. We still have the skill build which is great and makes the game diverse.
 Skill distribution is a huge yes.
 Stats distribution is a huge no, arcaic, Diablo 2 like and me no gusta.
 So 50% here.

 Gameplay is good, great, it's on top of ARPGs, but I kinda wanted bigger waves, more quantity of monsters and more variety. Sometimes it lacks the destruction feeling and ecstay I get from others ARPG. The fights may be too volatile, which hit kill from both sides, where it lacks adrenaline longer fights which you keep making consistent stratetic decisions.
 Graphics could be updated a bit, I like the cartoon style, but the skill visual effects are lackluster and in all these years they could released 1 or 2 patches to improve the effects/shaders.

 Story? Never bother to read, the game just didn't get me interested on it any time.

 So it is a fun casual game. But could've beeen a lot better and improved over the years.",1514139021,1581435882,False,2,0,0.448464512825012207,0,True,False,False

It's a typical dungeon delver, but it has some solid gameplay that allows you to build your own playstyle. Although you do select from a preset of classes, the only restrictions on these classes is what abilities they learn; all the classes can equip any armor or weapon, and each class has their own set of abilities that allow them to experiment with those items effectively. 

You can dual-wield any set of one handed weapons, or equip a two-handed weapon in a weapon slot. The game prioritizes the weapons well but odd at the same. you will attack first with the weapon that has the longest range, and then you will attack with the second weapon, regardless of range; if they are similar weapons: 2 ranged or 2 melee weapons for example. When the weapons are not similar, like a wand/pistol and an axe/club/sword, the game will prioritize the ranged weapon on enemies at a distance, and the melee weapon whenever they get close enough; certain abilities can move you within close range of an enemy and allow you to play off of this by attacking from ranged, using the ability, and then attacking up close. There are several other types of combinations like this that work from a combination of abilities, attacks, swapping weapons/abilities, etc.  

I currently have about 8 different playthroughs, each with different sets of abilities and weapon combinations.

You run around, punch things or what have you, and gain levels, attribute points and gear. You have your pet which is a nice, quirky little addition that the series has going for it, and the ability to teach it (and yourself) separate spells that you find in the world. You could make yourself a healing minion master pet if you want to, or you could send the pet to town to sell loot and buy potions. Cool stuff.

But the skills, I don't know. They're dull and often very unimaginative. And they're unlocked way too slowly. First you have only tiny few different abilities to choose from, with more available once you level up, but the path there is so slow. I feel as if I don't get much choice in the beginning. Also, you rank skills up with skill points to make them better, which (to me) makes me even less inclined to try different/new skills, as I know that the less I specialize in a very few skills and the more I spread out my skill points, the less viable my build will be (probably?) down the line.

Many (me included) compare Torchlight 2 with Diablo 2 in terms of skill progression, and from my understanding in both these games you kind of need to have your build already in mind at the very start and then slowly connect the dots until you reach it. I think I found that fun at some point in my life but that's not me anymore. It might be my patience not being what it once was. Of course, you don't have to play that way, but then you would likely also end up with some weak little jack-of-all-trades abomination at the end that won't get very far, because of choices you made in the beginning.

Personally, I do enjoy Diablo 3 (not at launch, mind you) and Path of Exile much more. Both those games are very different from each other, but both - in their very own way - allow much more reactive experimentation, than Torchlight 1 & 2, and the skills you learn along the way often just feel more imaginative.",1580834036,1580834036,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

A. It’s easy to pick up and put down. I don’t often have lots of time to play games. Missions can be completed over several sessions with efficiency because enemies won’t regenerate.

B. The pet feature helps with battle and for running errands. This contributes also to why you get better efficiency.

C. Character development is straightforward and logical. If you want to focus on magic, develop the characteristics for that. If you want to focus on physical combat, upgrade strength, etc.

It's not necessarily a bad thing; the lack of new, or experimental game mechanics makes for an aRPG that's easy to get into, and fun to master, without having to learn whole new aspects of a game. 

The levels are randomly generated, and the loot is abundent. Each class is simple, yet the balance is wonderful; everyone has their own perks. The game has a massive amount of content simply in the base game to explore, even once you've beaten it, and when you get tired of the Vanilla content, Torchlight II has one of the best supported and most extensive modding communities in the Workshop.

Check it out. You will come back to it in a year or two. You'll be playing it for months, weeks, years. And you won't regret spending your money.

If you are looking for a diablo like hack and slash experiance and you do not mind bright and colorful graphic style, you need to play it. It has everything a great of this genre should have, and the music is made by the same person who made tracks for diablo II. Nothing to add, just try it!

If you are looking however for a co-op experiance like me and my gf, be prepared for a huge let down. The lan game is full of desyncs, random drops, and internet play does the same. The game is NOT MULTIPLAYER READY! It is sad, because we reached 71 lvl and wanted to keep playing even beyond new game+.

If you're looking for an ARPG to play through once, this is a fine buy on sale. But if you want to keep on playing for several hours, you can look elsewhere.

To start - the difficulty system. Once you pick one of the four difficulties, your character is locked into that difficulty indefinitely. Casual is too easy and Elite is downright insane. In my opinion, Elite difficulty makes Torchlight II the hardest ARPG in the industry, but not in a good way. On top of all this, it does not matter which difficulty you pick. You do not gain any extra rewards for challenging yourself.

Elite winds up being so incredibly difficult due to two major things; the armor system and ridiculous enemies. The armor in the game reduces specific damage types by a flat amount, with a very small amount of % damage reduction in items. Most ARPGs do this the opposite way. As a result it makes the easy difficulties even more easy and the harder difficulties making feel like armor is absolutely worthless, especially when the difficulty suddenly spikes when enemies decide they now deal insane amounts of damage and one shot crits. Only one character can sustain all this, while also being ranged and having incredible damage: The Engineer. Every time I attempted hardcore, I always died partway into Act 1 or 2. At the end of each playthrough I always had at least 60+ deaths, often more.

On top of all this, the classes, attributes and items are all overall very lame and clunky. Even the most rarest of item types, which has an achievement specifically for them, are laughably vendor food. All this slow hauling grinding while dying repeatedly results in an incredibly unrewarding experience. I found the game to be much more rewarding and exploring all the cool sub-areas and events rather than getting loot, which I will emphasize is why you play these games. If the loot does not make your eye sparkle then whats the point of coming back?

Now normally I wouldn't mind so much if the game has sufficient modding support. Except the game does a poor job at it. First off, the game will restrict you to only have 10 mod files active at once. Why? Are you afraid people can crash their game from modding it like Skyrim? Let them. As a result it has quite literally forced the community into making mod-packs, making your options even more limited unless you want to go out of your way to learn how to put mods together just to get the precise setup you want. Even then, many of the mods I found on the workshop were not impressive. Most are just loot changes. loot buffs, and reskins.  There are class mods as well but I found them to simply repeat the same design flaws as the vanilla game. Even the total conversion mod that's #1 on the workshop is outright terrible due to the possibility of spawning a level 100 raid boss when I'm level 15...",1439689663,1575864149,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game for every single fan of genre. This game support single and multiplayer (Lan and in Internet).

I rate this 10/10. This game support mods for more diversity. 4 difficults of adventure and alot of ""NewGame+"" after kill final boss (each new start is harder then before).

Mindless team of ""Blizzard Entertainment"" (Greedy for money Entertainment) will never create a game better than Torchlight II.

All that being said, the graphical style isn't as nice as diablo. So that may be a thing you may consider. I'm not a diablo fan, but I did play torchlight 2 for 30 something hours. Why? Yeah. I don't know. My friends wanted to play and I didn't have the heart to say no. 

So enough about diablo. Here are the pluses and minuses of this game: 

+ You can play mindlessly
+ It's really easy
+ Gives your pointer/mouse finger a good workout
+ You can play at your own pace

- There's too much meta gameplay. Finding loot and junk and configuring your dude is a total pain. I just want to play the game! Not play dress-up.

You’ve got the first game taking place in a multi-level underground dungeon with 3 characters, a warrior/mage/ranged trio, one of whom gets corrupted by the Big Bad after defeating it and becomes an antagonist in the second game. This game even has an Act 2 in the desert and an Act 3 in the jungle. The finale takes place deep in a fiery dungeon. Despite this, the game’s lore and worldbuilding fall very much short. Bosses generally came out of nowhere and the main antagonists, the Nether, are never explained in any way. I know most people don’t play ARPGs for plot or lore, but I do.

That said, I had a blast playing Torchlight II. It’s a solid and fun game that doesn’t take itself too seriously. The pet feature is unique to this series and is a wonderful addition. I taught my pet cat some summoning spells and it would send its posse of zombies, a skeleton, and an imp into battle. How is that not awesome? You can also send your pet back to town to sell stuff, which is an amazing quality-of-life feature in a game like this. I’m also imagining the vendors in town reacting to a cat routinely strolling up to them with a pack full of armor and weapons to do business.

Unlike other games, Torchlight II has chapters and cutscenes that will make you hungry for more. Each area has it's own specific music track and compliments each area beautifully, cultivating the same feelings in the user as the character would be experiencing in those particular areas. Nearly every item in the game is unique in it's stats, very rarely will you get 2 items with the same name and stats. This addition will leave you doing complex algorithms to decide which loadout might be the most beneficial. Will you choose the item that'll increase your physical defence and mana regeneration or will you choose the other one that'll increase your pet and minion damage and improve health regeneration. Little decisions like these can mean the difference between 400-425dps or 630-650dps.
 
This game is also optimised beautifully so you'll be able to play on a potato pc with decent frames at lowest settings. You can also play with friends or just join a random server, all loot dropped is only visible to you, meaning that you won't have to replay bosses 5-6 times to get the same loot for all your friends (unless you're looking for rare items). There is also the addition of mods, which can be found in the community workshop. Torchlight embraces this and enables you to play with essentially hacks or add new content into the game. Whatever it is, the community have got the mod for you. 

With all these little things thoroughly thought out and still being constantly improved and updated, i'm going to leave this with a strong recommendation and you can usually pick this up on sale at some point for up to around 80-90% off.

On the GOG version of Torchlight 2 I made all the character types available in the game to see which one works best for me and found that I love the Beserker and Engineer the most and is currently putting all my time into my new Engineer I made on Steam's Torchlight 2.

The thing I enjoyed the most about Torchlight 1 was the fishing well thing, I spent hours just fishing and is very glad Torchlight 2 also has it that you can do fishing even in a well in town.

Is it the best ARPG on the market? No, that's [i]Path of Exile[/i], which runs like a dream via Steam Play for the Linux gamers in the crowd. And if you're on Linux, this is one of those (seemingly rare) flawless ports for the platform. The gameplay is very similar to [i]Diablo II[/i], but still manages to feel like its own thing. And let's be real, you're probably playing games in this genre because you love [i]Diablo II[/i] so much. This game scratches that itch more serviceably than other non-free game on the market.

I have one gripe, though: Enemies never respawn (it happened to me once actually but it might have been a glitch), so if your character build has some problems & you feel like you need to grind to level them up a bit, you're out of luck. However, it's far from a dealbreaker for me. This game is good, & even when not on sale the price they're asking is supremely reasonable. I used to think that if a game gave me one hour of playtime for every dollar I spent on it, it was a worthwhile buy. It's very easy to get that kind of value from this game. In fact, you might achieve that value several times over.

- solid netplay: both lan and online multiplayer are well designed
- combat: its good, on the higher end of diablo clones and the monsters are varied and challenging.
- good drop chances on unique/rare items: nearly every dungeon ill end up with blue (rare) or orange (unique) rarity gear, as well as lots of gold and fodder gear to sell.
- lots of freedom for builds. each of the four classes has 3 different skill pages with a variety of actives and passives you can build, and all characters can run different types of gear: one handed, dual wield, two handed, ranged, magic, etc. in addition there are standalone skill scrolls with special utilities, and then the gear itself have different modifiers/bonuses that you can help supplement your build. in addition the gear itself can be enchanted and socketed with extra stats. this results in a very diverse set of builds for each character. in addition, you can also build your familiar as well, as it has 3 gear slots and 4 spell slots.
- robust stat system tied with the gear: vitality, dexterity, focus and strength are applied in a way that makes sense, for the most part. rather than simply locking gear behind level restrictions, there are alternate requirements in which you can wield the gear if you have the necessary stat points, this means you can access top end gear earlier if you build your stats a specific way. this makes progression more natural and allows you to gear yourself far easier.
- familiar system: seperate inventory for pets, allowing you to hold more things. the pet can be sent to town to sell the gear in its inventory as well as buy potions/scrolls. this makes up for the lack of inventory expansion in the vanilla game, its immensely useful.
- fishing: easy, relaxing, no frills fishing system that allows an infinite source of pet augmentation items
- rewards exploration: huge maps as well as maze like dungeons that are filled to the brim with loot and secret areas.
- shared stash system to allow you to twink your low level characters in higher difficulties
- mod support s well as randomly generated dungeons: endless replayability

now here are the downsides, mostly applying to vanilla:

- difficulty in elite scales a bit too high, into arbitrary ""hardcore"" levels of difficulty where all enemies are massive damage sponges that two shot you if you arent building defense, making the game almost too hard to progress if you dont have gear. recommend starting campaigns on normal first so you can load up your shared stash with gear for harder playthroughs
- no inventory expansion
- some of the maps are just big boring open space, ie. the desert stuff
- no way to respec your skills completely in vanilla: this is my biggest gripe, as building into the wrong thing can screw you pretty bad in higher difficulties. you need to mod the game to be able to actually respec anything more than the last three skill points you invested. 
- quest progression is not shared in mutliplayer
- wish there was an ""are you sure"" prompt before you destroy gear/desocket shards/remove spells/etc
- weird glitchy collision things can happen",1566552329,1566552329,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Back then it was new title, and even though years have passed and time has gone by, this game still holds up as being one of the best Arpg's to date. It is very comparable to diablo 3 in regards to the basic gameplay. What really makes this game still shine though is the modding community. Now iNly have users created better loot drops, but completely different playable classes, skill trees, and pets. I'm never disappointed coming back to this title.

Sadly though it lacks updates and support. With that being said, there really is only so much you can do in the game. Once you run through the campaign a couple of times and play multiplayer, there really isn't thT much else in terms of progressing or being challenged. The lack if things like for example seasons in DE was what killed this title for most people. 

Still a great title though and very cheap. Actually, it became a drm free game so if let's say you subscribe to monthly bundles you can actually download it and play for free 

Was hoping for a torchlight 3, but it doesnt look like it's going to happen, which is sad because they made such huge improvements over the first installment I bet it would if been a great game.

It has all of you basic classes from normal top down dungeon crawlers like Diablo, but unlike normal top down dungeon crawlers classes they all have a twist to make them interesting, for example your ""tank"" is an engineer, you give your team mates shields and spawn bots to help them out in any situation. I have played both Torchlight games and i prefer the second though the first is good, i have also played all of the Diablo games and i like both series of games. I'd say if your new to the top down dungeon crawling genre this is a good game to start with; however it isn't perfect i find later in the game once you start NG+ (New Game +) which adds an extra amount of  difficulty but rewards better, it gets pretty easy maybe its just my high lvl engineer but either way it gets pretty easy.

The UI is bad with buttons in they way at all sides interfering with targeting. It is hard to see when you need to reactivate active effects. Damage is not indicated clearly enough to the player leading to unnecessary deaths. You need to take the eyes of the fights and look in the bottom left corner to get an update for your health instead of looking at the fight.

The game also have several irritating enemies that have shoots that can shoot you from outside the screen and who's shoot direct damage instead of projectiles and are not blocked by terrain. This is not how enemies should function in an arpg. In general you should be able to dodge the enemies with you movement instead of relaying on dicerolls hoping you character dodges the shoots for you. Those enemies should be in other types of rpg like Baulers gate 2 where the fights are more tactical and less focus is put at player input.

I've tried SO many times to enjoy this game over the many years since it's release. I can't. I get to about level 15 and quit, every single time, with every single class, on every single difficulty.

This game is so close to being awesome, but it's like it was balanced by people with ADHD or something. Why does my character move so damn quickly? 25 years of PC games and I have a hard time being accurate because my character is zooming everywhere like I've cast Double Speed on myself or something. Can't tell you how many times I've run into the middle of a group instead of shooting them from range, and you have to be so damn close to shoot in the first place that even with my pro-level reaction speed I'm already in the middle of the group of enemies before I can change direction. That's Deal-Breaker #1.

Deal-Breaker #2 is that gear is always higher than my level. What's the point? It's bad enough when gear drops below your level--something that irked me about Diablo and Diablo II--but ABOVE my level? That's worse! At least if a legendary item drops that's a few levels below me, it's still going to help me out. But when a legendary drops that's a few levels above me? I get nothing from that except a filled bag slot if I intend to keep it until I can actually use it. Whose idea was that?

Deal-Breaker #3: The pet. I don't like this system. It's another design idea from someone with the attention span of a goldfish. Can't stand the ""wasted time"" of going back to town, so let's put a system in the game so we don't have to! Endless play! Sorry, guys, but pacing is a thing, and it's an important thing.

Pacing is the root reason why I just can't stand this game. I'm just supposed to keep plowing through enemies, which is why gear drops at a higher level--the idea is that I'll quickly attain that level if I just keep playing. It's like Endless Wave Mode, which gets boring for most people, especially when there's nothing really daunting about the waves. Even on the hardest setting I've never even come close to dying.

Pacing and Balance are severely lacking in this game, and I'm tired of thinking that I'll like it ""this time"". I won't.",1562516895,1562516895,False,2,3,0.428286850452423096,0,True,False,False

To be honest only reason why i bought TL2 at the first place was because i was looking for a cheap replacement for D3 which i couldnt afford. Oh my how lucky i was to get this pure jewel of gaming...

Although it looks like a little like child cartoon with its graphics, TL2 is fantastic addictive and incredible game that will pull you inside its world and make hours last like minutes. Starting from the main story, which is not very long, towards mapworks and finally moding you will have lots of great moments with this game. Single player is great but multiplayer is fantastic. Up to six players i think can play at the same time and every one of them will get its own loot which means no stealing or whoever grabs it first problems. You can trade later your items with the rest of your team. There are 4 playable classes which are expanded via mods. Every class is unique and has its strengths and weaknesses. If you combine all 4 in a single game you will find out the true power of TL2. Sound in game is also quite good and game runs flawlessly even on low end computers. Also i never ever experienced any kind of delays or lags in MP.

Honestly this is one of the best RPG i ever played and for like 19 Euro (also it goes on sale -75% very often) you cant go wrong. And you wont. Give it a chance. This game is a proff that perfect game doesnt need to be AAA title that cost 50-60 Eur..",1358606024,1562164956,True,1,0,0.493103474378585815,0,True,False,False

This game starts off normally besides being a mess with tons of worthless stats, but like the moment you're done with the first main boss, every single enemy becomes unbelievably annoying, and it doesn't help with how clunky the game plays, especially when a group of enemies is present (I have a fucking GTX 1080 with great RAM and processor and it's still a laggy mess when groups of enemies are around). In Diablo III, you could have a screen full of enemies with their guts flying around and physics on every body part, and the game is still running smoothly. At least when (if ever) Diablo III lags, it feels right because a crazy amount of things are going on; in Torchlight, you're attacking 15 enemies and the game is freaking out.

I think the only reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews is because of nostalgia nerds who crank off to anything that's Blizzard-game competition. Diablo III SHOULD be dethroned by now, but every game of this genre I've encountered is trash in some way. Other than any Diablo game, Path of Exile is a close second, it's just so complex and I don't have time to really delve deeply into that game; Diablo III just strikes the perfect balance of casual but hardcore if you want it to be (pushing rifts), without cheap bullshit deaths (PoE is still guilty of that)

Anyway, this game is extremely inconsistent and clunky when compared to Diablo III, which somehow still reigns supreme over this genre despite how simple it can be (I recommend playing it on Hardcore mode for the best experience).",1562045332,1562045865,False,4,1,0.399242252111434937,0,True,False,False

It had so many problems, but the base game was still fun. A few updates later (one that made getting unique armor sets easier) this game has surpassed any and every ARPG.
The good, it is a basic ARPG with its own flair to set it apart from the others.  The game itself takes place after Torchlight and uses all three charters from the first game. This game story, atmosphere and colors are great and makes it better than Diablo 3. You can choose from four characters, male or female and have a pack mule that can run back to the town and sell things you do not need. So instead of getting full on equipment and having to wade back to town, just give it to him and sell it (also the pack mule can buy  potions, but not equipment) . So basically you do not have to ever go into town until you feel like it. It also has the basic dungeons, bosses, secret areas, unique armor and powerful armor.
What is negative about this game? Well if you call yourself a fan of ARPGs and do not own this game. It is worth the full 20 USD because it will stretch for hours. The game is also a bit complicated, but the tutorials are very helpful. It will become easier with more play throughs and just playing the game.
So I fully recommend this game for anyone who wants to play an ARPG, Gauntlet or Diablo like game. As a matter of fact if you want to play a fun game and wants to get in a new genre.
FUN FACT: I built a gaming PC for this game (and Sacred 2) . The game can work with older PCs, but it can still drop frames, even on the lowest graphic settings.

There's three skill trees with passive buffs for your character at the very bottom, and you can unlock any of the skills without having to upgrade specific skills to get one skill you really want. You can also add mods to this game, which range from having more classes to increasing weapon varieties, which is always pretty solid for the community to have. Also, there's fishing in this game, and having a pet companion that can USE SPELLS. Weapon designs are often interesting, and some of the bosses are pretty hard to fight, even on normal difficulty and being slightly higher leveled than them. (There's a few boss designs and gimmicks that I find really cool though!) There's a lot of unique secrets to find, too. I don't really have any complaints or cons about this game since I've only stuck myself with a class that can heal itself when attacking enemies.

[list]
[*][b]Genre tags:[/b] ARPG, Isometric, Loot
[*][b]Value Proposition:[/b] Tons of content extended by steam workshop.
[*][b]BSERC[/b] - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Grim Dawn, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege. 
[/list]
[h1]Concomitant Exposition and Summation[/h1]

[b]Torchlight 2[/b] is a traditional loot driven ARPG. However, some part of me feels like it'll always be seen as the younger brother so to speak in reference to the Diablo series or even the more aesthetically [i]dark[/i] Grim Dawn. Being much more fanciful, cartoonish and boisterous in it's color palette. It seemingly takes on the persona of something less daunting.   

I've heard many scoff at ARPG's citing things as though they should not have an 'endgame' as if the player should not expect the character they've spent the last 30+ hours with to no longer progress after what within the genre are traditionally very lite narratives. Stating that proper MMO's need only this often proverbial [i]endgame.[/i] 

For a genre that is inherently a sort of active real-time loot driven clicker, to deny the similarities between it and how a traditional instance based MMO behaves is a bit of an asinine claim. They are inherently just slightly more repetitive than your average game. All games are repetitive. ARPG's offer repeated clicking, number crunching, finding synergies between abilities, armor and weapons. The very essence of this genre is a glorified clicker. Of fucking course it should have an endgame. I realize Path of Exile is more integrated online but aside from the towns being populated by non-NPC players the actual minute to minute is remarkably similar. 

But that is neither here nor there, I bring this up only to illustrate that after a hard fought campaign with your chosen class; there are a plethora of options available to continue leveling your character. Not only is there NG+ and NG++ but there is also the Mapworks. Which essentially is a place where you can use in-game gold to purchase randomly generated maps often with qualifiers like monsters have increased damage or 25% of your max health is capped. The campaign is about 30 hours give or take and will land your character in the 50's as far as level. With each level increasing in XP reaching a maximum total of 100. There is additionally difficulty levels placed on top of these increasing difficult challenges. 

There are also a ton of mods in the steam workshop. Overhaul mods, class mods, UI mods, custom dungeon mods for use in the mapworks. I personally have an Engineer, EmberMage and a modded class of Dread Pirate I'm currently leveling. 

[i][b]THE GIST
As the genre goes it can be a bit of a grind making it good for a palette cleanser game in between larger perhaps more story driven games. On the other side you can delve very deep into applying gems to sockets and applying enchantments and making good on every bit of synergy you can extending the gameplay that much further.[/b][/i]

200710,50730431,76561198054523075,0,3,7614,0,7565,1627421761,"Over the years I keep trying to revisit this game, modded and unmodded, but it's an incredibly draining experience and the longer I play the more I find myself facing an [i]existential crisis[/i] over how empty the core gameplay loop that underlies every RPG is. Compared to other ARPGs Torchlight 2 has a lot more engagement in its combat, there's no sense of floatyness a lot of other in its genre are guilty of. Unfortunately, every other aspect of the gameplay is a massive chore.

As an ARPG the story is understandably going to be minimalistic. With what little story there is I'd argue the game's overall aesthetics clash with the grim tone it sets up for itself, but that can be ignored. The main gameplay loops I want to look at are the levelling progression, exploration, loot and enemies.

[u]Levelling[/u] 
On average it takes about an hour and a half to level, but the rate of progression in your skill unlocks means a lot of levels will feel unsatisfying. You're stuck with the same couple of active skills at the start of the game until you hit level 30 or so, which makes you feel trapped doing something dull. The higher level skills are quite cool to use, but weak when you get to them since you aren't able to put as many points into them, meaning once you get there you have to wait even longer to use them.

[u]Exploration[/u]
The environments look great, but it's basically wasted because the game does nothing interesting with those areas to give it a sense of intrigue and the camera angle is just a bit off so you can't appreciate a sense of scope of the regions, which ends up making it feel empty. There are no enemy respawns until you reload, so getting from point A to B is dull if you're playing in one session. There's only one portal per zone to teleport to (unless you expend a resource to make your own), so going through an area again whether because of death or a reload makes it more of a slog. Since the zones are so large I felt the need to clear out the map, so even though there are dungeons to spice things up they become more of an annoyance when found sparking interest. The final nail in the coffin is the movement speed of the characters, thinking about how slow it will take to just go somewhere is enough to make me close the game down upon loading it.

[u]Loot[/u]
So for every pack of enemies there might be an elite that takes a bit loner to kill. Most of the time they don't drop anything unique. Credit to the game, they feel a lot more personal than the regular mobs despite only having one or two extra effects and abilities, but all that does is contribute to the sense of disappointment when you get a pittance of gold and a low rarity item for another class. It's the same for big treasure chests at the end of long dungeons. Sure the first few times it spits out screen-filling gold drops it's invigorating, but then the numbers sink in and I realise I just picked up 50 gold and some common gloves. It exacerbates the exploration issue, why spend an hour trudging through a dungeon just for that?

Now with some mods this aspect mostly gets fixed, although it might swing it a bit far in the other direction and make inventory management more of a hassle than it's worth. Still, a lot of the time you find gear for other classes and if you're playing a modded game which adds classes (such as Synergies) the lootpools will become even more saturated with unusable gear. Overall, loot is more of an occasional chore to deal with rather than an exciting part of the gameplay loop.

[u]Enemies[/u]
The one aspect this game does better than any other ARPG is enemy cohesion. You get a real sense for what you're fighting, even when there are swarms of enemies it doesn't become a garbled mesh of enemies and visual effects, unlike newer titles like Grim Dawn. For the most part you feel in control of your character and no other ARPG comes close to feeling like your attacks make an impact as this game does. Also the mechanics of the game are refreshingly straightforward and well-written too, there isn't a sense of hidden mechanics working against you and there aren't ridiculous amount of numbers to keep track of. If there would have been a reason to stick with Torchlight 2, it's these aspects.

What drags the game back into terrible territory are the random mobs that break your difficulty setting and annihilate you relatively early in the game. Torchlight's difficulty scales fairly well, but these mobs are basically certain death encounters unless you play in a really tedious manner (better hope your class gets an escape skill early, sorry Engie). Some can be casters that spell certain death and spam the same spell over and over. Others can just land a stupidly unfair DoT on your with no way to mitigate it. Special shoutout goes to the Hulking Slasher, who blends in with really basic mobs in the second act, but has a high chance to crit you. That crit will insta-kill a character even with high armour and vitality, why this creature never got nerfed in a patch is beyond me. Some people mod giant spiders out of their games, I'd much sooner mod this monstrosity into oblivion.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
So if you're still slightly curious about this game even after all the flaws, the only way I could see this game having a chance is if do NOT play it vanilla. A lot of the community insists on trying it vanilla first of all, but I reckon this is some form of advanced gatekeeping by the community. As it stands the loot drops and level progression alone will break your spirit, especially if you've played anything remotely modern to compare it against. Get some variation of the following mods:
[list]
    [*]A loot drop enhancer, anything that provides more drops than vanilla and maybe restricts the class drops to your current class would work
    [*]Something to make levelling more convenient, anything that lets you unlock skills earlier is a must.
    [*]Base Movement speed increase, unless you like spamming dash skills
    [*]Anything to remove Hulking Slasher
[/list]
The first couple of points are covered by Synergies, Torchlight's biggest mod. That mod might change a bit much though, so keep an eye out for alternatives. I joke about the community gatekeeping earlier, but honestly they have contributed a lot of mods that could salvage this game. As for me though, I need something that doesn't make me feel like I'm transparently going through the motions.",1558317478,1558317478,False,44,5,0.666666686534881592,3,True,False,False

While Blizzard was busy screwing up diablo and making a bunch of crap game franchises that no one cares about Runic games went to work and took everything great from the diablo series and refined it to make a game so well crafted it was ARPG perfection in physcial/digital form.

While the first Torclight is still loads of fun it had a few hiccups such as only 3 classes and each being gender locked. But when Torchlight 2 came to be it fixed all of that and more allowing you a much expanded amount of vanilla classes each with selectable genders and fully customizable facial features in every detail.

Now the story of Torchlight 2 is not some great in-depth saga and it dosent really need to be. This game like most ARPG's is about character creation and questing for that sweet sweet loot drop and that is exactly what this game delivers in the best way possible. Multiple regions each with a unique setting and filled with multiple mini dungeons and every area fully explorable chocked to the brim with lavishly designed monsters to slay and mountains of treasure to acquire. 

Oh and did I mention the end game content yet? You unlock a new central hub area after slaying the final boss which then allows you to buy maps to 2 floor randomly generated dungeons to clear with a massive boss fight at the end of each dungeon rewarding you with not only the bosses drop but a massive treasure chest each time aswell.

Runic games has made an ARPG masterpiece game here that outclasses Blizzard in everyway possible.

... Didn't turn out that way. 

This game falls short in so many different areas
- The zones seem really dull 
- The soundtrack seems to be exactly the same as the first game, with a few adjustments here and there (I actually really enjoyed the soundtrack of the first game. Here, it seems worse) 
- The combat is the same
- The classes are without much flavor, and I actually prefer the 3 classes of the first game more
- Pets are just as useless as in the first game 
- The story... What happened here? I've absolutely no idea what is going on and why I should care

I've installed, uninstalled and reinstalled this game so many times that I've lost count at this point. I've tried so hard to give this game a chance, but everytime I load it up again, it takes 20-30 minutes before I'm bored and exit the game again. The online community seems dead, and the single-player experience is about 50% as good as the first game.

Diablo 3 seemed cool but the pricetag was too much. Then I saw Torchlight 2 on sale on Steam (don't remember, it was maybe around $10 or even less, maybe $5 or something) and thought why not - seems cool. 

I didn't think I would be that hooked with a game because last time I played games was around 8 years ago or smth and every time after that when I have tried to pick up a new game I play it for maybe couple of hours and then got bored (Killing Floor was an exception as you can see from my Steam profile but that is the bought version, in my early 20s I played the private servers/cracked version of that game for hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours).

Anyways, I have around 50 hours of gametime on this game and it was fun BUT I can not get myself to continue playing after the maps were done. Grinding the same dungeons or restarting the same maps - while being procedurally generated is still feeling like I am just doing the same thing over and over - I guess it's fine for ARPG-s as I have understood it is about the loot. However, the main reason I played MU Online for so long is because it was online - I could fight with other people, there were events, the armor could be upgraded to shiny looking etc.

So, what this rambling means - Torchlight 2 is a great value for money. Even though I will probably not play this game much more (I got xbox one s and Path of Exile on that) then $5-$10 I payed for around 50 hours of entertainment was totally worth it.

There are so many similarities to Diablo but so many other interesting things as well. I've listed them down in the PROS and CONS.

TL2 is slightly below Diablo in terms of content quantity... 4 levels are really, really fast to finish.... But for the price, it was worth it.... I am also very annoyed with the creation of another Runic account to link to my Steam account. I would like to be able to transfer my game to another Steam account not the one I bought it with. 

Another pet peeve (which can't be helped) is the feeling of repetition deeper into TL2. You can see copies of Ratlings, skeletons and Brutes appearing over and over again. They just come back with a different name and different skin.

09/02/19: Tried reinstalling and playing an Outlander this time. Feels kind of ""meh"" the 2nd time around. Every quest is enter a dungeon, go down 2 levels and kill a boss. Takes away the initial excitement. 

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Great map design
Quests and story rolled into one. Not all the quests are in the town, some are hidden away in the map, so it makes you want to explore. However, the downside is that you might miss some of these quests as you don't know where they are. E.g. Zephari Envoy

2. Secrets
There are lots of interesting secret areas. One memorable one was ""It puts the lotion in the bucket"" (obvious reference to Silence of the Lambs). I shouldn't spoil how to do it but let's just say it will be interesting to find the lotion.

3. Skill trees
I like the way you can upgrade your skills and that there are so many skills to work with, per character. Each skill is tiered into T1, T2, T3 with a special upgrade at each tier. There are a lot of way to play your character.

4. Semi-Live NPCs
The NPCs give you information on current events which are related to your quests and they don't function purely as lamp posts. I think they could have made it better by making the NPCs come alive even more though.

5. Train Travel
Although a cut-scene, it was cool. I was hoping to interact with the train though. I think that it would be better if we could go onto the train and do stuff on it.

6. Interaction
Quite a few items but not everything. You can break urns, rocks, explosives and barrels but those are a given. Lighting the braziers to provide light was most innovative. I think having levers or switchs that moved big bridges would be quite cool.

7. Knocking creatures off
There are some ways to knock off tiny land creatures, off the terrain and into a pit. Very cool, much better than an invisible ring. Of course, you can be knocked off as well.

8. Pack mule / Pet
I love my pet and the ability to sell items without going back to town. 

9. Spider Mines
I can't believe there are spider mines that seek out enemies.

10. Alternate weapons
Press W. Switch from range to melee. Great move. Change playstyle instantly. *Star star*

11. NPC hunting
You can get more NPCs to help out in the town if you go out of your way to do side quests. Again, a potential pitfall as you might miss them totally, but it's okay. The similarity to Suikoden's hero collection is great.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Bugs
a. Can't pick up items that fall onto ledges
b. Can't shoot creatures who are no more than a few feet above or below you.

2. Murder Hobo
Almost everything is still mass murder. Kill, kill, kill, kill and more killing for any quest. I'm a mass murderer in this game. I've yet to come across a quest without premeditated murder.

3. Stupid things
You are face-to-face with an enemy. However, you can't reach him because of a crack that runs through the floor, dividing you and the enemy. Most retarded. I think a jump would be great.

4. Runic Account creation
Most annoying. I have to create another account just to play online. <------ This here pisses me off.

5. Spell keys
1,2,3,4 are easy to reach. 5,6,7,8,9,0 extremely hard. Would have been better with 1234QWER.

6. Repetition
Ratlings, goo, skeletons repeated. Just with a different colour palette and skin.

7. Fame
What does this do?

8. Content
Only 4 levels. I breezed through them. It didn't feel like there was enough interesting stuff. Just lots of similar level bashing.

[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]
1. Trash drops
I am not so certain about trash drops that just keep on generating a lot of junk for me to sell. Perhaps, something else can be done about trash drops?

[h1] It builds on the original in every way possible.	[/h1]

The tweaks to classic Diablo formula are welcome (you won’t have to worry about pouring points into a skill that gets easily out classed in a few levels; instead skills have tiers so you can never feel set back if you hold onto a skill that syncs up well with your kit. The pets return better than ever with great cosmetic options. As does fishing. There are also nice little events in the game sometimes you will stumble upon a lovecraftian style even involving hooded figures that was my particular favorite. Or you might follow a strange creature that leads to a puzzling world through a right and so on. These little moments add charm and excitement. to the game in between looting and sidequesting.

the inclusion of workshop and multiplayer also makes this an evergreen title. there are so many great mods that add everything from tweaks, to new pets , or even entirely new game styles. it could be the only ARPG you need for a long time, if you don’t mind it's rather classic feel. In a world where RPGs can now come with dodge rolls, heavier storytelling, or completely translated into a Mad Max FPS, it’s hard to dress TL2 as refreshing in the subgenre

It’s a damn shame to see Runic Games go under. they seemed to really capture Diablo for the modern audience. They had a special touch and the got dealt a bad hand.

Pros:
Saves progress anywhere
Good performance on a low end computer
Quick to Level up
Pets can use spells
Fishing has improved
Quest tracking on the side
Varied phase portals
Potions stack high
Big Inventory

Cons:
Some monsters can seem unusually unbalenced compared to others but it's all about strategy with them.
I felt the summon skeleton/zombie a bit lame, they were always so slow and didn't keep up with combat.
Pathfinding for your pet and/or summons need a bit more work.

Little Details
This game is full of little details which makes this a great game, I found Notch's dungeon which is an Easter egg to Minecraft, there are skeletons hanging in cages high up twitching, all the traps made for more interesting immersion, walking bombs keep you on your toes and finally I liked the fact you had tyo shatter the armor first before really daminging an enemy.

From the start, you'll get addicted to the item collection loop: get an item, become mightier, get even better items. Visually, the game is still nice-looking, comparable with Diablo 3, but was low-poly from the beginning. Plus side of that is it'll run smoothly even on low-end hardware and also on Mac/Linux.

Here's what I liked:
[list]
[*] The available lasses play quite different.
[*] Useful pet which supports you in fighting and also acts as a sell/buy courier if you can tolerate its absence for two minutes.
[*] Three different skill trees per class, so you can choose your favorite weapons and playstyle.
[*] Decently long campaign with a good storyline.
[*] High replayability, either with a different class or using New Game Plus which lets you start a fresh game with your high-level character.
[*] Coop mode!
[*] Not only dungeons as in Torchlight I, so a larger diversity in environments.
[*] Item upgrades through gems and enchantments, allowing for endless random attribute combinations.
[*] Many mods available.
[*] Each time you start a new game, the maps change. Some important areas always remain the same, but are connected randomly with procedurally generated terrain and are placed at different locations.
[/list]

And that's what I dislked or missed:
[list]
[*] The Gambler is a nice idea, but IMHO not worth to put money into it. You can cheat by saving before buying from him and just kill the game if you don't receive something valuable, then reload and try again.
[*] Fishing will give you some bonus money if you catch a gold fish, but most of the fish doesn't give your pet that much of a boost. The minigame of clicking at the right time when the two circles overlap gets boring after a few throws.
[*] Just a few side quests which never change between playthroughs.
[*] No fair loot distribution in coop games, so choose your friends wisely. There are just too many item snatchers in public games.
[*] Content-wise, the game is finished. No official DLCs or addons whatsoever since release. Mods make up for this though, but I would've liked to see more official content, e.g. a new class.
[*] When starting a new character, it takes some time for the game to unfold its depth. The first chapters are just simple hack & slay, the interesting spells and abilities require a lot of skill points before you can use them.
[/list]

Despite all those cons, I can really recommend this game to every ARPG fan.

Good graphics, absolutely addicting gameplay with tons of replayability and all the RPG aspects you could imagine, soothing music, and a good co-op mode. Oh, and it supports modding, which the community has definitely taken the advantage of :)

However, it's wost trait by far is the story. It's incredibly dull and boring. The voice acting sucks and is incredibly sparse (only the important main quests are voiced) the story is bland and uninteresting. It's the general run-off-the-mill antagonist/protagonist plotline. It leaves you wanting to close every single dialogue box the moment you lay your eyes on it. The cutscenes however, were nice. (there's maybe a total of 3 or 4 of them throughout the entire story?).

Oh boy does this game rip off Diablo II and WoW.

Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. For instance, I might have enjoyed a Diablo II remake with no alterations, except moving it from sprites to modern 3D graphcs. That would have been cool.

What we have here, though, is Diablo II, with the follolwing changes:

- *exact* same music, even mirrored for each level, but altered just enough not to get sued
- a boring and forgettable story, with boring and forgettable characters
- the moody / dark / atmospheric style is replaced with the cartoony WoW style

Torchlight II is an uninspired combination and artless ripoff of Diablo II and WoW: it's the product of a few of the original Blizzard developers, plus one or two WoW 'artists', getting together to make a game absolutely as cheaply as possible, without any consideration to creativity. It's a money grab.

That's not to say that Torchlight II isn't fun, or a bad game. And maybe most people won't even know about or care about what I just said.

- No respawning enemies. Unless you go online/Lan and check mark the reroll world option, you are stuck with a world that becomes empty and won't refill itself back up. And as it suggests, ""reroll world"" does as it implies; rerolls the enemies and the entire landscape. This means dungeon entrances, shrines, enemies and what not are changed. 
An example is I had a monster shrine immediately off to the left of the 1st desert spawn with a special mob that spawned it that was timed. Didn't kill it in time and the shrine was no longer useable. So the only way to get something like that again is to reroll the world to try and get something like that again.

- No character redos through normal gameplay means. Choosing your name, your stats and skills to an extent (past the previous 3 skills you lvled up) cannot be undone. You screw your character up, welp better restart. You better be damn sure about your build and your character's name and pet. Cause you can't change that after character creation/editing your files (which the game will mark you for doing so). 

-Shallow classes. The only class that I actually enjoyed was the engineer class and outlaw albeit to a lesser extent. The other 2 classes lack diversity and feel so linear with their builds. Embermage and berserker are op/can be, but I find their classes to be boring.

-Pretty meh items overall.

- Lackluster pets/companions.

-No endgame besides newgame +. Like dark souls, but more lackluster due to a lack of good characters, respawning mobs, etc. Idk really just meh.

- Characters and story are pretty lackluster. Nothing noteworthy to say.

Once you invest a point, it's there forever. When it comes to skill point placement, you can only take back the 3 point investments you've made for your skills. Also This feature is what makes players who get further in the game quit or start all over again. It doesn't promote the freedom for players to explore and adjust their builds to make the characters more viable and efficient for high level combat.

 For those who intend to play this game long-term or not quit midway due to bad point placements, i suggest you look up viable and validated builds for proper stat and skill point placement. 

Another thing i’d like to point out (CONTAINS SPOILERS):

When you finish the game, there’s an NPC that asks you if you want to start the game in “+” (plus) difficulty. Listen, and listen well when i say this: DON’T DO IT. DO NOT FLIPPIN DO IT. Why you ask? First of all it will just let you do the ENTIRE story all over again with the SAME monsters with higher levels. —SPOILER  INCOMING—  You’re going to have access to a tower anyway that hands out scrolls used to open portals to dungeons with monsters of higher levels ranging from lvl 40-100+. So going for “+” difficulty would be a complete waste of time.

But here’s the worst part of going for “+” difficulty, other people who aren’t in the same “+” level difficulty CANNOT join the game. I repeat, CANNOT JOIN THE GAME. So if you have friends that you introduced the game to, your character can’t play with him.

Anyways, to wrap this up, I would’ve recommended people to play this game, but because of the issues i’ve stated above, if you’re just a casual player who’d eventually want to go in-depth and long-term, then this game isn’t that friendly for you. You might not see the effects of bad point placements now, but you will later, and when you do, you'd probably feel like quitting, so i suggest ya'll read up.",1545291611,1545291611,False,4,3,0.39989134669303894,3,True,True,False

The most glaring flaw of this game: it can be boring until the second half of the first act. Every time I start a new character, it takes a little while to grind up to a level with a respectable amount of spells, armor, and abilities. This results in a somewhat stale grindfest at the [i]very[/i] early stages of the game. That is [b]ONLY[/b] the beginning. Usually around the latter half of the first act the game picks up pace in a big way--[i]and it doesn't slow down from there[/i]. If you're going to buy this game, come into it with this in mind. There is a several hour hump that new players have to overcome. Frankly, I think all ARPGs suffer from this, but I'm pointing it out for any players that are new to the genre.

[i]And with that out of the way...[/i]

[h1]The Review[/h1]

I've played Torchlight, Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, and many other ARPGs. I think this one is my second favorite (with D2 being my number one). This entry into the series adds a whole new level of complexity and fun. No more slaying monsters solo! Now you can slay with friends. In the same fashion that Diablo transitioned to Diablo2, so does Torchlight transition to Torchlight2. These two games are clearly spiritual successors to the Diablo games.

Every time I play this game I find some new way to play the heroes. There are details scattered throughout this game with love. The developers really cared about this; they made the best game they possibly could and it shows. 

The talent tree may seem simple enough at first, but the possibilities for building your character are only limited by imagination. My current favorite is a wand-wielding, poison-dealing, minion summoning outlander. Who needs akimbo pistols when you have the power of necromancy and decay at your fingertips!? Every class can be played multiple ways, and there is a wide a variety of loot that support these builds.

Speaking of loot... there is an insane amount of it. Various magical rare and unique items drop everywhere! Many of the unique pieces have flavor text too--which is a big plus for me. Some of the flavor text even seems to indicate some of the events that have happened within the TL universe. Various different item sets exist to create potent combinations for defense and offense. 

TL also allows for pets! The pet system took a while to grow on me, but man did it grow on me. Bags full? Send the pet back. Need extra zombies or skeletons in your necro army? Give your pet some zombie/skeleton spells. Need a tank? Pet. 

One of my favorite parts of this game is the new game plus modes. Once you finish the game, you can reset the game with your hero while maintaining all of your loot! [b][u]Restarting the game doesn't just give you the same old campaign you completed though! Each new game plus adds new areas, dungeons, and encounters to the maps[/u][/b] (up to NG+++ I think). The new areas have new added art and even better loot! Some of my favorite areas in the game can only be found on NG+ so make sure you try that out!

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]

I think I could ramble on forever here about all the positives in this game. Despite being quite old now, this game has aged extremely well. The aesthetic allows it to remain visually pleasing where other games (like D3) seem to have faded over the years. 

[b]I highly recommend this ARPG to anyone who enjoys ARPGs. [/b]

I would say buy the game when it has a -75% discount :/",1543954699,1543954699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mods I use - betterbloodeffects, The Endless Dungeon, Fish Details, LurkerHUD, Reduced Normal Drops, Respec Potion, Stash of Holding

I tried my best to only add mods that didn't effect game play to much. betterbloodeffects, Fish Details, and LurkerHUD are all just re-skinned effects, HUDs, or extra information.

Stash of holding allows you to store more items in your chest at town (good for horders)

Respec Potion is what you think but it was actually created by the developers as a way to add optional features to their game.

The Endless Dungeon is suppose to add some extra content once you get to map works - I haven't tested it yet.
