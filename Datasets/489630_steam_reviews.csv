This game has to be one of the best 4x games out there.
Your whole economy is completely directed into fueling your war machine. This much is advertised but understated by a longshot.
For newcommers to the genre, this game is not really a good introductory game as it strips much of the core mechanics that makes a 4x game good to focus only on the economy-combat aspect of it, so you will miss out on much of what the genre has to offer.
However, if you're a bloodthirsty maniac and play 4x games for the thrill of the hunt and the conquest, just as I am, this game is a absolute masterpiece. 
As I said, your whole economy revolves around building your armies to defeat your enemies. Everything from the tiles you grab and techs you research got to be planned ahead thinking about what type of units you're against, from IA players to the planets fauna, both equally interested in both surviving and wiping you out from the face of the planet. This means that neutrals have a territorialistic behavior and its programmed to either scare you out of their designed territory or wiping you from it and IA players just the same, but players do not only stay on a territory, they expand so you gotta be prepared to contest ground with both, sometimes at the same time and on multiple fronts.
In this regard the IA is brilliantly put together, as it measures your power by the units it can see, plan a offensive or counter-offensive stance accordingly, rotating wounded units, running away from flying units they can't reach and going after stranded units or exposed core units in your formation to cripple your offensive. IA players also use defensive structures they build or find in the wild (such as ruins or forests to give them bonus defense against ranged fire, cliffs that they can fire upon your melee units or forests to make use of Fog of War mechanic to ambush you with the Overlook mechanic when you approach) to their best extent. Neutral units also seems to have a ""grudge"" behavior, which prompts them to attack you if you harm units of their band as a defense mechanism, some even going after you as long as you're in their field of view.
Factions are completely unique even if their whole purpose is winning the game through conquest or quest, all of them having different playstyles not only differentiating from one another and also having multiple viable armies to build, either focusing on aerial units, ground vehicles, infantry, artillery and their respective support units and the combination of all of them.
Resources are scarce and found far in between, making use of them requires expansion in one way or another, either by founding new cities or grabbing outposts that can be contested by both neutrals and other players so they need to be defended. The outposts have great value as they give you a faction-wide bonuses but their importance varies according to the game-stage you're in and faction you're playing (looking at you Space Marines) and get better value the more cities you have.

Overall this game is a absolute godsend and it gives me great pleasure editing my review. If you're a 4x fan or loves Warhammer 40k, this game is a must have. I'm loving every second of it. 10/10

Old one:
Great game but the IA has a absurd hatred towards the player. Its actually bizarre on how many times I find myself inside a shitstorm of a huge war on *all* fronts. IA just plainly ignores one another while comming for your sorry butt again, and again, and again, and again. If you have a more functional brain than me you mind find yourself having loads of fun in this game as it requires a galaxy brain to manage 3-6 IA solely focused on wiping you out, but I'm having PTSD just remembering it.
Maybe I'm just bad and I need to get gud, if thats the case I'd love some tips, but I feel like a complete idiot playing this.

* Graphics: Well-drawn 3D model, relatively low-poly but with a lot of personality. Runs well on potato PC, as long as it supports Vulkan.
* Audio: Pretty decent overall, but lacks voicework. There's a mod, but it doesn't yet implement newer factions.
* Gameplay: As another reviewer said, Civilizations 5/6 but there's only war. My only gripe is that early-game units, who lore-wise should be the bread-and-butter, become completely useless later on.
* Story: It's a sandbox game. You can enable a sequence of 5-6 story quests that are unique for each faction. The writing is very close style-wise to the WH40k books.
* Difficulty: Whatever you want it to be.
* Multiplayer: Great fun, as long as you can find someone to play with. Supports hot-seat.
* Dev: Tiny indie team making their own game engine.

Good if you:
- like 4X games, especially ones with the Civ 5/6 style of combat
- think diplomacy is for the weak
- like Warhammer 40K, or want to get into it

- hate DLCs
- think moving around all the units in Civ 5/6 is annoying",1682748495,1708285732,True,1,0,0.50564265251159668,0,True,False,False

There are some really big head scratchers in terms of the overall game design like being unable to delete buildings, and implementing an all or nothing movement system. If your unit has a maximum of three tile moves per turn, you can't simply walk forward one tile to scout the next tile that's in the fog of war, and then continue going to the next tile once you've discerned that it's safe. The game forces your click to be the final amount of tiles that a unit can move, even if they should theoretically have 2 tile moves left. 

This is a bare bones 4X game with a Warhammer 40k skin slapped on to generate sales from the 40k fanbase. I would never recommend this game if you're paying more than $5 for it. And don't get me started on the ridiculous prices for DLC factions.

They took the worst aspect of Civilizations and made it into the entire game.

If you love the combat mechanics of Civilizations. Of moving tens of units slowly around a map, trying to destroy a near-endless horde of enemies, retreating, regaining health, moving out again. Repeat. For hours (first map I played took 6 hours). 
There is nothing else to the game. 
Sure, you have four factions to do this with, but…. That is just wasting your time in four slightly different ways.

The story is incredibly well written in my opinion and I haven't even finished the main story for each of the factions. It ties in Necrons with Aeldari, Tyranids with Mechanicus, and so on. Each of the races has a vested interest in holding the planet and you can follow any of them. There are different play styles for each of the factions but it isn't so different to the point where you need to spend time relearning how to play for each of them.

Many features like diplomacy, trade, society, religion and special resources are missing - makes sense to not have diplomacy i guess, but even the ONLY WAR aspect of the game is badly lacking.
At least the units DO feel kinda different, but the list of traits and special abilities isn't all that great/unique.

The AI will cheat itself a huge army, at the same time your faction quest will spawn a hive of Nids right next to you.
There is no Navy component, all maps feel and play the same. It's not like you need to adapt your strategy based on your starting location, just build your shit on the tiles with the correct bonuses and keep spamming the same troops.

Getting negative resource values will start you down an endless spiral due to decreasing Loyalty, which in turn decreases how many resources you get. So even if your energy farm is up and running next turn, you're still in the negatives due to the stupid Loyalty mechanic. Meanwhile, AI's get 4 fucking cities by turn 50 and seem to suffer no penalty at all. Also, some Achievements don't work properly.

The DLC policy is also atrociously bad - 16$ per faction? And the original game only has 4 factions???

- Races that rely on exploration and expansion are gimped by endless waves of non faction units that are too powerful

Saying that, If I hadn't already played Civ 6 I may have been a lot more impressed with Gladius.  Even though I will give this game a positive rating, because it is actually pretty good, after this is where I'll mostly be trashing on it.

Civ 6 did it much better. I think if this team had followed that model even closer, this game had a chance at greatness. Instead they stayed closer to a Civ game mixed with older RTS elements, while that may sound good on the face of it, if you've played both games and genres, you will see why thats not necessarily a positive in this case. Add to this, it looks like a good chunk of the game that should be included with it is locked behind minor DLCs with unnecessarily high price tags.
While Civ 6 does the same thing, Civ is also a significantly much better game even as a standalone, before you even look at the DLCs.

#1 - Overall gameplay loop is good. It's not as complicated as Civ (it appears to be mostly acquire tiles, put buildings on them, balance it all against resource upkeep, and then build units to fight and win with). But that is maybe a good thing... this seems much more focused on war and balancing yields against upkeeps, and beyond that it doesn't ask me to build wonders or play a game-within-the-game of figuring out social policies to pick, etc.

#2 - Graphically the game is good, but it takes a lot of memory work to remember stuff since this isn't the nice, easy color-coding system of Civ. In Civ, everything orange, or orange-outlined, was production, everything yellow was money, everything green was food... for all the complications of Civ games, it at least had an easy visual schema to what was what. This is not that at all... this looks great, and has a menacing grittiness that works well for the game, but the text is usually just white text with not enough quick symbols at times to know what is what, and the map is great looking but hard to read visually at a glance. Again, looks great, but sacrificed some ease-of-use to make it look good and build the WH40K atmosphere. Not necessarily bad, but a trade-off, at least.

#3 - Units work well. It's intuitive and CIv-like for movement, attacks, etc., and the game actually is a bit deeper in units because there's some amount of asymmetry. Rather than being Hammurabi and having one unique Babylonian unit, in Gladius, you are an entire faction-worth of unique units... some have special healing abilities (Necrons), some have special influence rules (Orks). It works well, but base-game comes with only 4 sides, which is limiting.

#4 - Presentation is a bit clumsy. As Slitherine games go, this one has a rather robust visual presentation quality for once, likely because if you are going to bother with WH40K licensing, may as well lean into the visuals and lore. But the text... the UI and text are very plain and sometimes cumbersome. Dropshadows on text aren't good enough or simply aren't present; a lot of text is a big submenu that is unnecessary (the unit submenus are fairly large and have buttons/icons that are not always useful... the difference between hold and hold-until-healed is obvious. but a single Hold icon with a small toggle-box to click to set it for hold-until-healed could trim down on stuff that is just clutter).


Overall quick impressions:

For $3.99 during the current winter sale, it's pretty solid. It's head and shoulders above most Slitherine games in terms of how visually appealing it is, and the units and factions are well-done.

The DLC though... other reviews say it, and yeah, the game *needs* to be on sale to bother with it IMO, and without the sale I would not have even picked up the base game. I mean, I'm sure part of the issue is the license with GW means they have to do it this way and try to milk the DLC, but if they wanted to do that, at least include 6 factions in the base-game then. It's a bit lame that Tyranids and Chaos are not included in the base-game... kinda fan-favorites there IMO, and if they were included with the base-game, it would make it easier to stomach seeing T'au and a few others as DLC.

In the end, I played Civ 5 and 6 into the ground, and I played Human Kind and the other Endless 4X's. I played Gal Civ. I already played all those and wanted a change of pace, so for the sale price, the base-game is decent. 

But it's still got flaws, even with picking it up on sale. And the DLC model here is just hard to understand... I get what the factions are, but what a fortification pack is, or what a firepower pack is, is a little strange. If those turn out to be extra units, I kind of get it, because WH40K TT is like that where you buy armies. But I also would kind of not get that because this is a video-game and even Civ doesn't have a faction be split across different DLC to get all the units.

Again, kind of a cool game for it to be a 4X turn-based WH40K... but wow, get it on sale if you are interested, because the DLC model for this is bizarre given that the base game's non-sale price is still $40.",1703382111,1703382111,True,16,1,0.657439351081848145,0,True,False,False

Having come from Civ 6 I was initially shocked at how unpolished the game is.  $60+ is an absolute joke, if you pay full price you will definitely feel ripped off.  Especially with how much of the content is locked behind DLCs.  It feels like a money spinning franchise title released on half the budget required, in the hopes that 40k fans will lap it up regardless.

I'm pretty sure I paid less than $5 though and at that price it's a great game.

It's kinda got the bare basics of a 4X game (or at least a hex based city building war game), in just the right quantities to be an enjoyable, uncomplicated build + tactics balancing game.  It requires an engaging and neatly balanced greed (eco investment) vs immediate need payoff that I'm more familiar with from roguelites or RTS than 4X games (which tend to be simple greed is good, despite sophisticated mechanics).

Totally the opposite of something like Civ 6, which is an unintelligibly complicated mess at first, but frankly easy once you've learned how to play; Gladius is easy to pick up and start smashing things, but remains an arm wrestle at higher difficulties even once you've worked out the mechanics.",1702254587,1702254587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All 11 of the major 40k factions have now been released and it never gets old to me. The gameplay is unique in that it's basically everything you would expect from an RTS game only turn based. It's a small team of developers and yet slowly over time they have continued to support this game and add content to the point where Gladius is the premiere 40k game now. I highly recommend getting the complete collection of all DLC, especially when they go on sale, as they really fill out the game and give tons of replayability. It's a really fun multiplayer game as well, so bring a friend! 

Be aware though that this is not a AAA budget title. The art is sparse, the music is mostly the same refrain on repeat, there is no voicework (other than what's been added so far with the fantastic Too Many Voices mod), and modern 4X features like a decent tutorial, map editor, diplomacy, rotating screen, etc. are missing, but you can tell it was made with love for the IP. There are tons of setup options though to customize various play styles and some things are done better than AAA titles, such as unique technologies and tech trees for every single race!

Easy recommendation for devs - more endgame stuff or options to do in case if all enemies are on the brink of extinction. 

1 - terrain and starting new games - even though the game allows you to modify terrain rates 90 % of maps get dominated by lava biome which is difficult to play on
2 - it's REALLY hard to balance the game. If you do a skirmish with teams AI, the enemy will always win if all AI's are set to the same skill level. The only way around this is to overpower yourself or team mates but then the opposite happens / your allies dominate the map which isn't fun either. the other thing is it's very hard to predict how matches go, so I've sunk hours into a skirmish before realizing that the AI would win the match, and it is a foregone conclusion once it starts to overpower you and your allies. 
3 - speaking of balance, I find that if you and an enemy both have the same strength tier of unit, the enemy unit can take A LOT more damage than your units. 

Pros  - the game is a lot of fun when the balance seems even, and with all the expansion packs there's loads of variety to keep busy.",1702014666,1702014666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Turn based 4x. Its awesome.

I have no idea why this isnt being raved about more.
The races feel unique, the action is well paced, and the wildlife makes a welcome change to just build up & charge gameplay.

I struggle to find anything wrong with this game, it just needs more content for me to buy tbh.
If you've ever seen another of my reviews you know how rare this is xD

Basically if you like 4x, this is worth a try. If you like 4x and 40k this should be in your library, tactically rich with options a-plenty! Factions are varied even if they appear similar to start, different tactics favour different races, and they are appropriately thematic (if Lore is your thing) and I find playing each race teaches me something new about my favoured race (Eldar).

For example playing Guard taught me the value of Wave Serpents with the Chimera. They arent just transport, they're a mobile base to protect your troops, and their abilities used wisely is a huge force multiplier.

If any of this sounds good, Wishlist it, and having played after a sale price, I'd happily pay full price and have done for several DLCs.

And then I realized, that there is a game that has been out for 5 years already, yet their creators keep pumping out the new content...

Gladius isn't your standard 4X strategy. Befitting a universe of 'only war"", you won't find Scientific, Diplomatic or Cultural victories. You either exterminate your opponents to their last city; or follow a quite symbolic story line (still within the same map). So, if you're a fan of Civ6 and whatnot, looking for another challenge - I would suggesting looking elsewhere. But if you're a fan of strategies AND of Warhammer 40k - the game is a great pick. There is certain satisfaction in heaviest of armour and titans blasting each other to pieces, while your factories churn out endless streams of new units for the Chaos Gods / Emperor / Greater Good / Omnissiash / whatever else is your poison today.

A quick word about the DLC policy - while it is true that, in regards to amount of content, the game mirrors the practices of Paradox or Creative Assembly, in this particular case i do not have an issue with that. The base game when picked on one of a number of sales costs peanuts and offers you 4 base races, already a good, self-contained fun. The DLCs (which, in a similar fashion, can also be bough for less 10 bucks each) add more content, that does not appear to be cut from the game. This is not ""Ports and Airports""; or ""adding an important mechanic missing from the vanilla game""; or ""a story DLC without which you feel shorthanded"". This are true expansion packs in the old meaning of the word. And if, say, you have no interest in playing with Nids or Weeabos - you simply skip them.

1. There are many game options but the tooltips for each option is severely lacking, you can click a lot things on/off or set to low/med/high etc like in any other game but there's no tooltip to let you know what it does exactly. A lot of things can be worked out anyhow but I find many things I have no idea what the setting actually is/does. Shame really. As the player I should not have to go googling game tips!

2. There is no single player campaign game, there's just sandbox or multiplayer.  This imo is a big loss for the single player, such as myself. Sandbox is great ofc but gets very repetitive quite quickly.

Other than this though I actually like the game a lot. I just wonder how much sandbox anyone can play before giving it up and moving on.

The factions are quite diverse in most of the things they do, from which ressources they use for what and what their units can and cannot do, which partially is thanks to the game beeing based on Warhammer 40k offering a large background to draw from. But this also comes with some drawbacks like the buy in price to have access to everything beeing quite high, but you dont need anything but the base game to already have fully fledged out factions in a good combat game.

Game's even better than in my first review.
+The combat system is solid. I've taught a bunch of new players at this point and I must say the learning curve is steep and rewarding. You really develop a game-sense of when your attack will succeed or fail, or your defense can hold or if you should retreat. Mostly I think it has to do with the intricacies of special properties they've assigned to different weapons and units and the overwatch mechanic. I have watched with pride as noobs I've trained went from tossing in troops artlessly and losing to knowing when to take cover in forests and massacring an oncoming superior force.
+The economy of the game has become very refined over the years. The dev's been active in tweaking this and that in terms of income bonuses and what buildings make produce what bonus resource. For example, they changed up those whole economy structure for the better by making pop housing not use a pop point to be active, meaning the player can have more fun by assigning an extra pop per pop housing to a factory or whatever.
+The factions are great at this point. DE just got announced so I think at this point that leaves the game with, like, the Inquisition as a missing faction. Pretty high achievement with how so many 40k factions just don't make it into the games.
+I cannot stress enough how much fun this is in co-op comp stomps, especially versus tyranids. You can toss in as many AIs with whatever individual difficulty you choose. I just did a 2v5 game with myself as IG and my bro as SM. IIRC we were 1 difficulty above normal. Great challenge. When we deployed together, we had a similar against-the-odds game going practically at all times.
+Co-Op mechanic implementation is amazing. PLEASE don't patch it out. For example, I fly in my Valkyrie (40k Huey helicopter) next to some Ork fools and instead of Guardsmen my bro's ASSAULT SPACE MARINES pop out. In another case, my Heavy Weapons team is sitting on 2 HP and is pinned, but my Bro's Razorback is sitting beside it. I tell the HWT to jump into the Razorback, which bro then orders to drive to safety.
+Oh ho ho, MAN, you would not BELIEVE how nasty the AI is. You're in for a real challenge in this game. It occasionally does a derpy move (lictors moving into the open in LoS 2 tiles from tanks), but over all it means business and is going to try to kill everything you love.

-With all the DLCs at this point, if you don't wait for a sale then you're going to be shelling out a big chunk of change for all the stuff. 
-I play mostly IG and I must say with the unit packs, they have been hit or miss. Chimeras and Rogal Dorns have been awesome, Stormtroopers and ratlings meh, and devil dogs and the shield landing pad thing trash. I figure the other factions have similar experiences.
-Weird faction design in a few places. Thinking again of IG because I have so much experience with them. Infantry guard in this game is a non starter because they have no infantry healing, so you're forced to go tanks or airforce if you're feeling greedy. Which is weird because they gave guard a solid infantry force complete with a tanky brawling unit but no way to keep the momentum rolling with no healers. They gave them the medikits but those only on the riflemen and special ops rifle men, and with 10-turn cooldown it's not doing much.
-Some researches are so low-value I just skip them every time. In fact, knowing what to skip is part of the learning curve if you want to survive the pain train the AI eventually sends your way.
-Neutrals are good for learning the game's combat mechanics, but once you've mastered that spending the first 50-100 turns slogging through them is just a chore. Fortunately, you can nearly turn them off in the game settings, but not completely.
-The biggest, horriblest aspect of this game is the lack of unit customization. You can't. It's very clear in Gladius that weapons and gear are separate entities from the units which equip them, yet you cannot customize what your troops use. Huge letdown because it's some of the best fun you can have in real 40k, which this game is clearly a love letter to. Did you know the Leman Russ tank has 8 different main guns it can equip in tabletop? And those are just the ones I can remember. Even tyranids get customization options in the tabletop; more claws or replace one of the 2 sets with a bio plasma? At this point I wish they'd ease back on DLC and implement some kind of template system for unit production; Select a unit, set and then save its equipment, then cue up those templates for production. Make better equipment increase the cost AND upkeep, and the reverse for worse equipment. That or something similar would really breathe more life into the game than another faction or 1 more unit for everybody. I'd even pay for it.

Overall, great 4x and kind of a hidden gem in the 40k lineup. It's held my interest for YEARS.",1550887301,1699819875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, I very much enjoy this game to fall back on if I feel like playing a Civ/4X game. The city building is very simple to understand however the lack of complexity is a bit of a let down after a few games. Luckily, Each faction has a unique way to play with their own mechanics and units.

However, to experience the game to its fullest... you need the DLC, a majority of it which can get very pricey. So I recommend getting them when it's on sale. This goes for faction DLC (like the Tau, Tyranids, etc.), more so for unit packs that expanded the unit roster of all factions. Also, the workshop can change the experience and even add voice lines to units (it should've been in the game in the first place, imo) which is already a positive in of itself.

I'm approaching 300 hours on this game and I'll probably keep putting more into it. I recommend you give the game a try if you enjoy 40k and/or casual 4X games.",1654902873,1697995018,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It can take a little getting used to (for example, you move in an automatically generated path to your destination, and if you move a unit once you can't move them again even if you didn't use all of your movement. I was used to Civ and kept making that mistake when exploring the maps) but even then it's still a very comprehensive game. What I like the most though, is that every faction has an entirely unique set of units, techs, and mechanics. When I say that, I don't mean that they're ""unique"" because they're reskinned while being functionally the same. I mean everything down to the basic ""starter"" units are very different from the starter units of other factions.

Bad stuff? How expensive the total cost of everything can get. I have every piece of DLC (again, Christmas sale, total bundle was about $70. Without the sale it would have been closer to $144) and I can easily see the DLC that they'll release in the future going ham on my wallet. Don't get me wrong, I love the content, but if you're strapped for cash just wait until there's a lot of stuff in a bundle during a sale because you'll be paying 5 bucks for one unit per faction if you don't.

It has been awhile since I found a good game to scratch the classic strategy game itch. I started to move into turn based as a lot of modern strategy games are more concerned with how fast you can click. Overall I got it free on epic over the summer. I started to play it with friends as it was one of the few games we could play as there was not a 4player coop cap. I was a big fan of civ, and this one seemed similar enough. I ended up purchasing it on steam with all the dlc as there was a sale and I liked it so much.

After playing it, I can happily recommend this game. It not only got interested in the entirety of warhammer 40k in general (I've now started painting models) but it is an easy game to learn and play with friends.

Pros:
-Diverse armies to play as with completely different strategies for each
-Simple to learn, hard to master
-up to 16 players in a game (would be a bit rough but doable)
-very modular from before and during play (can change frequency of tile type and research trees are expansive and simple to figure out)
-continued development
-Can practice w/o enemy armies so you can get the hang of each army
-tons of diverse dlc
-Host controls dlc, so if they have it and you don't you can still get the fun units

Cons:
-Games can be slow with multiple real players which can get annoying (1-2 hrs goes to 3-4)
-Tons of dlc make newer, cooler armies hard + locks army balancing units behind a paywall
-Difficult to get to grips with all the different unit stats/effects if unfamiliar with warhammer/4x games in general
-no diplomatic options (I usually go violent by the end of a civ game anyways so unsure if con for me)

Overall, probably one of my favorite games to just play a round or 2. If interested, buy game during a sale, play a bit as the starter factions, get dlc if interested. I would highly recommend if you like any form of strategy game!",1695659004,1695659004,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Me and my fellows didn't get it. Some of us don't play strategies at all, and some of us play them a lot - yet all of us felt like our actions didn't have a big significance, as the difference between any option you might choose is slim, with little variety and control over the situation. The gameplay feels so slow (that was probably the biggest factor).
I'd even proceed to call this game not a true 4X strategy, but a turn-based wargame which would do more justice to the game and in my opinion would better explain the gameplay to the potential audience.
If you're a Warhammer AND 4x fan - you might try it anyway, as the game is most of the time at an incredibly low price. But at least try it without DLC first.

And at 160 hours i can say this game is very good for a 4x game. I always describe it as civ but warhammer 40k and all the boring parts of civ stripped away. Its all out war, no diplomacy. And its great.

If your a civ fan or just a hex based 4x fan in general this game is 100% worth it full price or on sale. Even with the base games 4 factions theres so much replay value in it. Every game can be vastly different from the last and a lot of that is from the freedom the devs give you in the game set up options. For one, there are a ton of game play options you can mess around with to make games easier or harder. Then you can change the AI difficulties on individual levels. And on top of that you can really customize the game experience. 

Do you want to do a 1v1 against an AI? You can do that. How about a big 4v4 match? you can do that too. How about a 16 player free for all? Yup, thats a thing and any other kind of wacky mix and matches of teams vs teams or even teams vs non teams you can think of in a 16 player limit, you can do in this game. 

Personally, im kind of against this games dlc policies as my only gripe about the game. The factions i can see being sold as dlc even at their price, because the factions add a whole lot to the games replay value so 11 to 15 bucks per isnt that bad in those terms. But special units locked behind dlc? c'mon man. Like i get the units packs and stuff are like 2 to 5 bucks but they really should just be free add ons in my opinion. I know games work shop probably has a say in the devs dlc out, and so does slitherin but its just kind of whack units are paid dlc.

If factions costing near 15 dollars per piece and a bunch of unit packs in order to get the games full experience doesnt bother you in any way, then this game in all other regards is a must have for 4x lovers. Its got everything you could ever want in a 4x game and more. From near infinite replay value to some of the greatest match customizations in any 4x game i've ever played to some of the best AI in a 4x game out there, its worth every penny. Especially if you catch it on sale for like 3 to 5 bucks just for the base game if you have the paitence to wait for a sale to happen.

It can feel repetitive if you stick with one faction for too long but I think this game is probably one of my favorite strategy games of all time. Don't know why it just clicked for me. 

Played it semi religiously and then the sisters of battle update or something came out including this Vulkan support or another something.. 

See, unfortunately i play on Geforce now and for some reason or another more than half a year ago now the service said that Gladius was being patched and to this day it still says it is being patched. So have not been able to play it... like at all. The only way is to revert to the pre dated and un-worked on version of the game that only hosts up to the Tyranid faction. 

Kinda crushed. Tried playing it not on Geforce now but my rig is so ancient without it that it doesnt launch out of the launcher.

The graphics are better than the latest civ, the colors and the overall atmosphere of the game are great and again better than civ's. The system requirements are much lower, this game run very smooth even on an older PC (mine is 8 yrs old). Don't misunderstand me for saying this is better than civ, I like that series too, this one is just seems better in basicly every aspect.

With friends doing some comp stomping, its incredible fun.

You might be wondering why the negative review then.

Well, not only does this game have one of the worst DLC policies I have ever seen (paying the price of Blood and Wine for 1 extra unit for each faction?!) but it is also incredibly unbalanced.

Some factions are incredibly overpowered to a point you have to be actually brain damaged to be able to lose, like Necrons.

Some factions are so weak that picking them is akin to challenging yourself because picking literally any other faction is a better call, like the Eldar.

It also doesn't help that a lot of units certain factions need (like actual arty for Space Marines) are hidden behind horribly overpriced DLCs. Don't wanna pay? Well, enjoy not being able to utilize your faction properly.

The game also has this Endless Legend quest feature and similar to Endless Legend it is put in the game horribly. Enjoy having cities spawned with full armies right behind your already secure lines and since you cannot build roads half of your empire is gonna be destroyed by the time your units make it to defense. And no you cannot presume its gonna be there cause sometimes it doesn't spawn in places like that.

And now my least favorite thing about this game. Playing solo is horrible.

You see this is one of those games where developers could not be bothered to make a decent AI and because of that it has one of the cheatest AIs I have ever witnessed in a 4X strategy game. AI ignores city loyalty (basically making Tau abilities pointless), can go into negatives and still build units, gets units for free, knows where you are at all times, prefers attacking the player over other AI even if they are right next to them and are a much more delicious target, get ignored by neutral AI if the player doesn't directly see it.

And many many more.

This is why playing against AI is only fun in player teams cause suddenly you can focus on one side of the map or go help another player if AI just splurges three turn 300 armies on them at turn 100.

Not fun to play solo. And getting people to play this game with is really difficult cause the moment they taste the solo experience they tend to not wanna return anymore. This has happened with so many people that I am surprised the devs are not doing anything about it but they are focusing on a different game now so I guess they just don't care.

Oh and since factions are unbalanced as hell, any form of PvP is pointless cause most people pick of the three overpowered factions and just win. And if all players pick the overpowered factions, its about who is a turn faster cause there is no strategy in this game whatsoever.

So yeah, get this game if you have friends to play with against AI. Do not get this for any other reason.",1687503469,1687503469,False,146,5,0.83770287036895752,0,True,False,False

Some positives:
It feels really exciting at first - exploring the map and tech tree while fending off enemies. If you love 4x games and W40K, this game offers a lot of fun features, playing as many different factions and roleplaying in one of the greatest universes of all time. 
However, this game suffers from many problems:
BALANCE: In general, and especially depending on map settings, some factions are extremely overpowered while others feel lackluster.
AI: Sometimes the AI is horrible, throwing unit after unit at your vastly superior forces with no chance of winning. Other times the AI plays too calculated, imo. I know this is pretty standard, but I really dislike the idea of balancing the AI by giving it more or less resources -> just make a better AI in the first place. How about different AI play styles, like aggressive, defensive, research oriented, vengeful, etc.? -> This would add more variety to the game.
BASE BUILDING: Gladius relies way too much on base building. In the late game, some factions will cover most of the map just because they can easily expand, while other factions stay with one base from start to finish. Also, I don't care about building bases that cover dozens of hexes. Your home base should be limited to a few hexes and additional bases should only cover a single hex, imo. Base defense is way too important. I just want to see more combat between normal units. Also, base defenses are generally very overpowered as most factions need mid to late game tech to go toe to toe with bases.
FACTIONS: All factions play more or less the same, at least a third of the tech tree is pretty much the same for each faction. Also, the tech tree doesn't allow for much variation gameplay-wise, since there are one to three must-have techs per level anyway.
UNIT EXPERIENCE: This plays a way too big role for a game in the 40k setting. Why do you need to level up Space Marines or Necron Warriors at all? Why are there 10 levels? Having strong single units is the most important thing in this game. Therefore, you have to keep your units alive all the time, which is just extremely tedious.
NO CAMPAIGN: There are no scenario maps and no campaigns. Sure there is a faction story, but they break the game and I have disabled them most of the time.
NEUTRAL UNITS: I don't care about the ""wildlife"" units. I don't want to fight wild dogs or random heretics roaming the map. 
CIVILIZATION COMBAT: This combat system, derived from games like the Civ series, is terrible - especially for a game that focuses so much on combat. The 'Total War', 'X-COM' or 'Humankind' formula would have been much, much better. This hexagon combat style is just extremely limited and leads to boring and annoying gameplay experiences.
DLC POLICY: Overpriced and very little content. You will not get your money's worth - not even on sale.",1685893492,1685893492,False,0,0,0.459930330514907837,0,True,False,False

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option.

- The build menus are lacking in any meaningful design.
- It feels like a stripped down Civ game, more along the lines of Pandora or Warlock.
- The whole of the game feels like a mod, and less of a complete game.
- It takes forever to make any real progress.
- A few wrong turns can destroy your entire game. (I understand this is part of the difficulty.)

+ The reskin is nice if you're a fan of Warhammer 40k.
+ Four unique factions that play quite differently.

= The sounds on some of the weapons are good, others lack power. (Bolters are well done.)
= This is the best turn-based 40k game out there.

Overall, it relies heavily on your love for the series. If you're not a fan of 40k, there is nothing here for you.",1531422289,1685568528,True,0,0,0.667050838470458984,0,True,False,False

i think this game is one of the most underrated 4X, WH40k games out there. It's not perfect, but it is very WH40K: no diplomacy, all combat. You have the ability to ally with other races in the game creation screen if you want, as well as creating teams of enemies to fight against.
The story is rather contrived, it is really an excuse to get all these races on one planet so players can create their own dream scenario. Want to recreate the war on Armageddon? You can do that. Wanna fight the Tyranid swarms? Yup. Each faction does have a quest you can complete, but after a while i turn then off and just make up my own scenario. I may play as the space marines, with an imperial guard and sisters of battle allies, against 4 chaos enemies to roleplay the imperium vs chaos mass battle. I do wish the maps were bigger, though I hear there are mods that fix that. I just don't generally play with mods.
There is immense replayability, though it may not seem like it. There are many ways to play each race, and there are many factors within each scenario that will alter that. Create different teams, experiment with the difficulty of each AI to give more of a challenge.
The combat is fantastic. I have not played the WH40K tabletop, but I know enough of it to know they tried to duplicate as much from it that they could. I feel like each race plays pretty accurately to their lore, even from the strategic, city management standpoint.
I do agree with many reviewers that it is probably a little overpriced, and waiting for a sale is a good idea. I bought the game when it first came out, and so paying full price for a new DLC isn't a bit deal, though if I was just getting into this game, I admit it would be a hefty investment at full price.",1685485407,1685485407,True,2,0,0.508928596973419189,1,True,False,False

How about the incomplete nature of its base game, especially compared to the base game of other 4X turn-based strategy games, like CIV specifically.  It gets boring so fast without the DLC, and I would assume with all the DLC it might feel more fleshed out.  DLC should be made up of some kind of story mode that has some depth and looks like you even put in a real effort to create something with meaning.  So little depth, its sad really.  

I do not want to really get started on DLC practices for this game, but seriously, just pathetic.  A game that is now 5 years old (at least - not sure if there was a EA part of this or not) and still have not incorporated all factions into a Gold Edition or something equal, instead having pricing insanely high for stuff that should be included in the game really, at least the additional factions, the packs and wallpapers and cosmetic stuff could still be considered a valid extra that would justify DLC, but seriously, $14.99 reg for a faction add-in that should be included in base?  

I will not spend a dime on this game, thank god I got it for free, otherwise I would feel regret for having paid for the base game.  It is too bad greed has to be so prevalent and common these days, its a disgusting part of human society, and the gaming industry is no exception.  

I would only recommend this game if you can get it for free, otherwise, I would not waste your time and money on an unoriginal, overpriced, way outdated game just to get some WH40K-like-CIV action.

Update in response to slitherine publisher masking as a developer for the game. 

Edmon, you're not a developer for this game, you're a propagandist from slitherine (the games publisher) whos job it is to run around and post what propaganda you've posted here for 10-20 games, forcing the developers to mark you as a developer and speak for them, says alot about how the 'new slitherine' works,  the developers even dropped you (slitherine) with their new game ""ZEPHON"".

The customers can check the amount of DLCs and their prices and their content for themselves and make their own judgement. Copy of 'fake developer' response that's actually from the games publisher that the company is dropping in their new game --> https://i.imgur.com/tY9cktk.png

As a note from the developers in their new game, they even openly state ""probably less DLC"", anyone can read it all in the steam-thread https://steamcommunity.com/app/1481170/discussions/0/3541546590714371136/

Some of the things that's still missing from the game, game lobby settings (that you have to get mods to get). 

There is no story what so ever (in a super rich story developed universe by GW for 40+ years!) , since every single game is just a sand box map, there are some quests on the map that the publishes calls ""story"" however. lol but hey you can buy 1 story event and add to the events/quests as a DLC! --> https://store.steampowered.com/app/870540/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Lord_of_Skulls/
(Yes I know there is faction quests, quite different IMO from story mode, or campain)

Total lack of scenarios, or premade custom maps with special game modes. 

No diplomacy whatsoever, even thou some of the factions actually in the 40k universe make alliances. 

The game does not handle borderless window mode very well, or as it's called in gladius ""windowed undecorated"" and it glitches often. Any self respecting gamer got atleast 1 additional monitor on the side thesedays. 

No Campain mode whatsoever

Alot of the resource management just feels taken from random run of the mill hexagon game, and was renamed into ""sci fi"" resource instead, feels very low effort

Very low quality tutorial that does not really explain anything useful, or complex/complicated

WASD is not the default map movement keys, but the ""arrow keys are"" - This is a turn based game, that's decided to add ""RTS"" keys, with unit abilities on WASD instead, turn based yes. Thankfully you can atleast rebind thesekeys. 

The games modding/workshop is very limited on the unit/faction side with hard coding (how would they otherwise push DLC unit content pack on you? :) )

Game gets very repetative since there is so few things to actually do in it (So just imagine how it is without the DLC spam that adds new units/variety/factions)

Concept art races/factions are all done 40+ years ago by GW, so you'd think that all the time saved on those things could be used by a game studio too add new/fun mechanics and such since a large % of your game is already finished finished day 1 in development. 

The game is free to test, I'm sure any player that tests will notice the other obvious things, so I'm going to move on now. 

Lets take a look at some of the random DLCs that adds 1 unit per /faction that should be base units from the start.

With these 4 unit DLCs we're up too 20+ euros, for +1 unit/faction per dlc already, and there is 12 more DLCs currently released. So yeah the Full complete game, with all content is somewhere around 140 or something 
I'm to lazy too check the exact price for everything. 

Press the steam link and add it all together, on the current sale it's 77,17 euros in my region, with a 40% sale, so add 40% cost for normal price, and the latest 3 or 4 DLCs are only 15% and the latest 0%

https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/

As always anything that's published by Slitherine, low-normal quality, gatekeeping by slitherine publisher thugs (And various content creators that rely on very good relations with the publisher as a source of income)  that are ""tagged as developers"" pretending to be the studios game developers, pushing hard on DLC for the games that they publish, often missing alot of features and settings that normal indie games even have, bloatware forced game launcher that's just got advertisment for the publishers other games. And ofcourse the most common one severely over priced since they think they are still a nieched genre still, and can charge anything that they want (yes publishers are the ones that usually (with exceptions ofc) dictate both DLC and pricing policy)

Not a very friendly community that attacks people openly in public with insults/personal attacks for questioning the DLC policy in general and specifically 1 unit DLC spam 
https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/3842178984946410488/

I've spent way to much time explaning why I do not recommend this game for various reasons, so no, I do NOT recommend this game. And I hope that my review will help people see that this is a toxic DLC policy that this game have. 


(as a last note I own all DLCs myself they've been gifted too me from developer+viewers that watched me stream in the past, and without getting the content I'd feel like the game would be very empty and I would not have played it the ~40 hours that I have played it)

(as the last last note, someone asked me on my discord what 'stripped content' means, in the way that i used it here is intentionally leave already finished developed units/content outside (or flat out skipping to make the content to have it available to make later on as a super easy cash infusion) as of the ""full game release"" and simply release it later every 3/6/9/12 months or so as DLC content as a sort of free cash infusion for 3/6/9/12/15 euros extra so you can charge for the previous development cycle twice or even in some companies cases thrice by charging for it again at 6,99-9,99Euro instead of once at maybe 9,99-12,99 - With content that they've already finished and did not release while they're working on something else, later on like this studio right now,  they say that they are a very small studio but in the middle of doing alot of work on their entierly new game, several DLCs pop up for this game? - Howso? - Well ofc it was already developed and are releasing on a fixed schedule they're not going to sit with a handful of people and work on 2 games simultaneously and they are probably under contract from their publisher to do so.)


--------------------

The developers have gone into the DLC business model, with stripping content and adding it later on, as a DLC for 5-15Euros, for a few models. 

So want a full game? - Prepare too pay another 150 after you've bought the game.

A decent 4x game that ive sunk a small amount of hours into single player and with varied sizes of friend groups.

If you prefer military victory in 4x games, Gladius is a fantastic game for you.  IMO this is a very underrated turn based game.

Pros:
Huge faction and unit variety
Every faction has awesome end game units
Relatively easy learning curve
The AI will attack your base unlike other popular 4x games
Tweaking map settings is easy and can lead to fun layouts
You don't need to know anything about Warhammer to enjoy this game.

Cons:
No real campaigns, just faction specific quests that can be added to skirmish mode
No water units
Quest text and pregame cutscene's feel a little weak

Overall thoughts:
Gladius has some of the best unit variety I've ever seen in any game let alone in a 4x game.  Took me about 200 hours of playing to just see all of the units this game has to offer.  Units look good and fill a variety of rolls.  Content is continually still being added to this day, so it's only getting better over time.

I initially didn't buy it because of the extremely predatory price scheming, but they had a crazy sale where everything I wanted and all the units to make the game ""complete"" only ended up costing like 20$ so I figured why not, give the game a chance. Boy did I make a mistake....

GAMEPLAY: This game's strategical tactical depth is more or less rock paper scissors, the turns are miserably slow, even on the fastest of game settings, and the resources you have to juggle are just a joke. It took me about 9 hours and 4 campaigns before I realized that I had more or less solved the game and was already beating the AI on the hardest difficulty. This game is a joke. 
STORY: This game has a 2 minute slideshow that gives your faction a mcguffin reason why they are on the planet. Its basically non-existent.
MUSIC: The music in this game sucks, there aren't enough tracks and they are just simple loops with not enough variation.
GRAPHICS: The models look okay, some of them are very round, or cartoony looking. The animations can be downright goofy sometimes or look horrible. At least you can tell what the models are?
PRICING: Now this is the worst part, you get 4 factions with the base game, but you don't even get all of the units. You have to buy different ""unit packs"" if you want access to more strategic options, and if you are someone who wants everything or likes a complete package you could be spending almost 100$ on this pile. 

Final Verdict: 1/10 Do not play this game unless you hated Civ5 because it was too complicated, but wanted to play it anyway. Have about 100$ to just burn away you wont regret, and long hours to actually sit through a game to completion while the AI runs around in circles while you dominate the map with no challenge.",1684570163,1684570163,False,3,2,0.484522223472595215,0,True,False,False

Gladius: Relics of War is an absolute gem for strategy enthusiasts and 4X game lovers. As a fan of the genre, I can confidently say that this game stands out with its addictive gameplay, depth of mechanics, and captivating universe.

One of the standout features of Gladius is its streamlined and focused gameplay. Unlike other sprawling 4X games, Gladius places the emphasis squarely on combat and conquest, which makes for a thrilling and action-packed experience. The turn-based battles are intense, and the tactical options at your disposal are both varied and strategic. From commanding armies of different factions to utilizing unique units and unlocking powerful relics, there's always a sense of discovery and progression that keeps you engaged for hours on end.

The level of depth in Gladius is truly commendable. Each of the four factions available in the game feels distinct, with their own strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. The tech tree provides a plethora of research options, allowing you to tailor your civilization to your preferred style of play. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful relics adds an extra layer of excitement and strategy, as you compete with rival factions to secure these ancient artifacts for your own advantage.

Gladius also excels in its replayability. With multiple factions, different victory conditions, and randomly generated maps, each playthrough offers a fresh and unique experience. Whether you prefer dominating your enemies through sheer military might or adopting a more diplomatic approach, the game accommodates various playstyles and keeps you coming back for more.


In conclusion, Gladius: Relics of War is a masterclass in strategy gaming. Its addictive gameplay, depth of mechanics, captivating universe, and high replayability make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a newcomer looking for an enthralling experience, Gladius will undoubtedly provide countless hours of thrilling battles and strategic conquests.

A disappointing example of Frankenstein game micro payment hell. If you want all the factions this game is over a hundred dollars. Absurd and insulting. Don't buy this just to find all the races are $15 each, extra.

This game costs $128.86 and still has bugs.

NONE of the issues with the original game ever got fixed, it's still miserable. They spent all the dev time on monetization: skins and new races.

I tried to pick this up again, hoping patches and balance may have been addressed.

Set up a large world game with 4x2 allied sides. 

THREE for THREE:

>>>ENSLAVERS AT THE STARTING ZONE<<< 
(even turned to VERY LOW)
MIND CONTROLS ANY STARTING UNIT
No scouting
Setback production
Setback map perks
AI units are immune to it

No fun at all.

*OLD REVIEW 2020*
Some games are a re skin of older games in a slap dash franchise licensed flavor, like this one. A grossly over-simplified Civilization game badly dressed in the Warhammer Franchise License.

This is a game for no one. As a lifelong fan of both Warhammer 40,000 and Civilization I was really excited about this game.

Unfortunately the play experience does not satisfy a fan of either.

The Warhammer themes are a poor match to the universe.  The inclusion of common, irritating AI units, with no connection to the warhammer lore, detracted from the world.  Neutral creaps are a smorgasboard of faction troops, and out of canon things like wandering kroot hounds, vespid, genestealer cultists and chaos cultists cooperate. They are all on the neutral AI side as generic enemy barbarians, it doesn't feel like the Warhammer world.  Furthermore, unit balance is terrible, both among the AI and the faction sides.
Those familiar with warhammer units quickly wonder why Primaris Marines can't seem to kill unaligned wildlife monsters,  Earthshaker barrages can't destroy light ork vehicles and the like.
Common, familiar units in some factions are so far down the research trees one has to play for hours to get even one, or may totally be overwhelmed by the AI before even being able to produce a decent unit.

The DLC packs are incredibly misleading, the Lord Of Skulls, isn't a chaos unit for chaos players. it's an event, which in a single turn can ruin an entire hours long game when it randomly appears in a capital city and destroys it. Seeing it happen once made me regret I ever bought the DLC, I had to shut it off for future games.

The Civilization fan will wonder what happened to most of the robust Civ features like city improvements wonders, road/rail building, technology progression and diplomacy which is just a shadow of the Civ franchise or not even present at all.

Do yourself a favor, skip this soul less corporate Franeknsteins monster of franchise game development and load an old civ game or a Warhammer game you like instead. Leave this one alone.",1587412480,1683915330,False,6,0,0.531226515769958496,0,True,False,False

I enjoy the first two Dawn of War games, and I love Mechanicus, but that's about all I really know from the lore, so the ""storyline"" is kinda whatever to me. The appeal is much more simple; it plays similar to Civilization. But I wouldn't call it a clone. In CIv, your objective is to win, and there are numerous ways to go about that victory, be it culture, domination, tech, religion, ect. 

Gladius makes it simple: in the grim darkness of the far future, the is only war, and the game play reflects that. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING you do is directed towards total domination. Research isn't a victory condition, but rather an important factor towards your survival. And trust me, you want to take your time and really think about how you move your troops in this one. The enemies are meaty and your armor is made of paper in the beginning. 

Gladius may seem like a Civ clone with the domination dial turned to 11, but there is more focus on the unit production and movement because of it. You care a little more about each unit because of how difficult in the early game it can be to pump out troops with the wildlife coming after you from all sides, only to be followed by factions once the wildlife is cleared. To me personally, it's less of a Civ clone and more of a turn-based dawn of war. The pacing a slower and allows the player to explore all their options without being clapped for their lack of experience in the genre. 

I am really enjoying this game, and after seeing the recent support and DLC, I am hopeful that this game will continue to live on, adding more factions and options to their already extremely diverse customization for each map. I even got a copy for my spouse, and we really love to waste hours just playing against AI together. I go with the Sisters or Tau, and they go with Necrons, so if you want some good team up ideas, Necrons and T'au are a team made in heaven. 

Also, I should mention that the game is certainly more fun with the DLC. Unfortunately, the base alone isn't as much fun. I hope this company doesn't do to this game like what we see with many others in this genre, and that's selling heaps of DLC to for us to just enjoy the game. Faction DLC is one thing (I guess) but game features and units should really be free.

Bought the game and the dlc at a sale so took my time to go slow and there was alot of new things ( like eldar portals etc ). Started with a tutorial run which I won it being a tutorial after all. Tried Tau and got stomped late game, probably tuned the army wrong but damm Taus drones and longrange/mech setup was interesting...also loved their city design. 

After that I tried imperium guardsmen and one of the opponents randomed tyranids....11 out of 10 would get overrun again. Guardsmen mix of cheaper infantery and various armours was fun though. Stampeding Tyranids comming over you like a wave was an experience though since they owned nearly half the map. Now to try out another of the 10 factions I got thanks to game+dlc being cheap during sale. Maybe time to try tyranids or have a nice WAARG as the orcs.

Concensus; As someone who playes indies, rpgs and strategy games mostly I found this as a decent alternative to my usual favorites.

It's not a super story rich game, although the game offers little text prompts tied to somethling like 'quests' that guide you through a story, the meat of the game is definitely the gameplay :3

I can recommend this game for fans of the 40k universe and of strategy games (turn- and hex-based).

It is indeed comparable to Civ in certain aspects and probably fit in the vague 4x genre or perhaps more into the ""One more turn"" genre which means you get hooked.

I got hooked to Civ 91/92 and shortly after that I got reeled in by GW when I started to experience WH 40K Epic..... Im born 75 so you got all the parameters. 

This game for me is similar to Civ since I seldom finish a run because the late game tend to be boring. I dont mind since I love early/mid game so much.

Pros:
- Stuffed full of Warhammer 40k fluff and lore which can often be seen in the traits and attributes applied to different units.
- Great soundtrack
- Not too complex but still enough nuance and strategy to make the game interesting. 
- A lot of options available when creating new games.
- Good assortment of factions, units, nature units
- Co-op versus AI is available.
- Not the too simple ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" system common in strategy games. Instead the traits/weapons/morale/buffs help determine combat.

Depends on Taste
-No diplomacy. Alliances set in game creation are permanent
- Attack preview shows the outcome from attacking enemy units (does not take in account of possible overwatch if your unit has to move to attack). 
- Game is grounded to one planet. No space battles or taking over a star system. (Lore provides the reason being massive warp storms)

Cons:
- No true campaign ( Though faction quest turned on can act like a mini campaign)
- Game can be a bit complex for new players
- Some factions and units need better balancing
- DLC (The faction DLC are good and some of the smaller DLC add good things to earlier factions but it is a lot and the cost adds up)
- Player vs. Player with simultaneous turns turned on is a nightmare. Just becomes who can click faster or pre-order all of their units to block the other player. 
- Lack of unit customization in an ip that has a lot of customization( Characters can buy gear that buff them in different ways but unit loadouts are fixed. every heavy weapons squad is missile launchers and every Leman Russ is standard battle cannon, las cannon with side heavy bolters as a tech tree unlock.

Overall take:
If you like the 40k ip this is a must have, if you are a fan of this genre this game is good but the lack of diplomacy/trade and more advanced economics may get boring for you. It's great to play with friends, especially cooperatively when you are in the mood for a more chill game. I would suggest buying the game and it's dlc when on sale, and it frequently goes on sale. However if it's not on sale and you really want it then I would suggest buying the base game and whatever faction dlc you most want to play or the side dlcs that buff the original factions.",1682004274,1682004274,True,9,0,0.602297604084014893,0,True,False,False

On first appearances it comes across as simplistic; your usual run of the mill build x to get y and counter z by using c type thing but it has been nothing of the sort. The AI is one of the best I have ever seen and the 4 base factions are all very unique meaning that there is no one real 'go to' strategy.  Tactics wise it's the same... the AI will quite happily lead you into a sense of false security using only token forces to engage (lure) before reaching a city only to find they had much sneakier plans afoot.  

The only race DLC I bought was the Ta'u because I liked the idea of using influence as a means to an end (controlling other creatures, demoralising enemies... you get the drift - trying to give myself more 'options')  but in my current play through (I've not come close to winning yet on normal) I'm playing one of the base races of Astra Militarum and having a ball. 

There is *zero* need for race DLC's - the base game is fully fledged so you don't get anything extra unless you like the idea of a particular playstyle. What I do suggest is picking up the unit packs or whatever the hell they are called because they add more variety, counters, and defences to spice things up a bit.

THe main reason for my negative review is game breaking bugs, particularly in regards to saved games.  If you load a saved game, it forgets your quest progress and forces you to start back at some random previous quest.  I also had an issue where, when I loaded saved games, the game would lock up if I tried to use hero abilities or level up heroes once I loaded the game.  Basically, you have to play the game in one sitting or it completely screws up your save file.  Games can easily be 3+ hours, so this is a serious problem.

[h1]Gladius - Relics of War[/h1] 
This is a very *crunchy* 4X game that plays more like a turn-based RTS than anything else. Surprisingly fun and strategic (if hard to grok at first)!

But that's only *if* you want a 4X game [i]without[/i] all the boring diplomacy and civic micromanagement.

I mean, why make friends when you can make [strike]love[/strike] war? 💗

[h1]The Good[/h1]
✔️A whooping 10 (ten) factions to play with! The absolute best way to experience the Warhammer 40K universe in all its (grimdark) glory. Just remember: you ain't the good guy here, no matter who you play (unless you play Tyranids — those *are* the good guys).
✔️Continued dev support over all these years (including balance patches with every major DLC by community-friendly devs).
✔️Mod support (when you need to take matters into your own hands).
✔️Surprisingly well-written questlines.
✔️Super clean UI (iconography).

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
❌Worst DLC business model ever. Everything is so extraordinarily overpriced I'm genuinely surprised this game managed to stay alive over 4 years! Seriously, insanely high price of admission. On top of that, DLCs that [i]retroactively[/i] add units (to already existing factions) should've been [i]free[/i] content updates from the start. Faction DLCs, I get. But charging for ""unit packs"" is borderline predatory.
❌Base game factions (Space Marines and Astra Militarum more specifically) lack the animation quality and texture detail of DLC factions. Practically all the non-DLC tanks are static ""bricks"" (they don't *rumble* like all the newer, fancier tanks). SMs Captain in particular is so [i]wooden[/i] it's sad...
❌Intro cutscenes look [i]bad[/i] (they don't measure up to the rest of the game's production standards).
❌The AI doesn't use transports to carry/protect units and heroes don't use items.
❌If your driver lacks Vulkan support, say bye-bye to Gladius.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Totally worth it *if* you intend to play for 200+ hrs (not worth it for only 20 hrs and a passing interest — Gladius is an all-or-nothing sort of deal, I feel). So yeah, it sucks to recommend a game and still tell people to ""get it on sale,"" but such is the case here. 

This thing costs more than any AAA game on the market, for fuck's sake. And that's probably Games Workshop's greed more than Proxy Studios.

But is it [i]good[/i]? Abso-fucking-lutely. Extremely satisfying to learn and master.",1671016666,1680583384,True,2,0,0.54308617115020752,0,True,False,False

God, that is  so on point for 40K; especially the older lore (before Eldar and Space Marines were homies out of necessity). 

At first I thought this game was tough but simple due to the aforementioned lack of diplomacy and trade you'd see in games like Civ. No, the complexity in this game comes from balancing the buildings in your cities, far, far more than other 4X games I've played. The combat also intrigues me more than most other 4X games - I like how I felt like I was fielding an actual 40K army, with units supporting one another, playing special abilities, and watching morale drop. 

And the armies are glorious. The game's base 4 factions are fun. The DLCs? Absolutely worth it. Usually DLC review sections for games are people being pissed about the price, the quakity, the lack of content, etc. Go look at the DLC revies for this game? By and large it's people being like, ""Holy crap, this DLC is amazing and the faction adds so much to the game."" And it's true. EVery faction plays the game differently than the others. Even the king of the gamestyle, Civilization, can't boast this. Yes, Civ's factions all gave some bonuses and unique units, but they don't alter the way you play quite like this game's factions. 

You play the Space Marines, then try the Necrons, then the Tyranids, and you'll see what I mean. 

This is an underrated gem of a game. Warhammer tends to get it's name slapped on a lot of garbage games, but there's a few notable gems, like Soulfire or Vermintide. This one is worthy of being in that small, elite genre of ""Games Workshop licensed games that don't suck"".

I'm new to the 40k world and I was not disappointed. I paid $4 for the base game. Can't go wrong with that. After playing 5 hours in I went back and bought some of the DLCs on sale too! This stuff is too good. 

This game is a [b]GREAT VERSION[/b] of what a grid, turn-based combat strategy game should be. I am a fan of the [b]CIVILIZATION[/b] games, and a long time player, and this is by far better. I only played the introduction/tutorial map for this review. There seems to be no diplomatic, financial or research wins. Just [u]DOMINATE![/u]

[b]I got schooled quickly[/b] on how much strategy planning must take place in this game. [i]It's great![/i] There are a few different ways to manage your main city making the game easier to manage. Meaning, having more than one production type on one grid really opens the diversity of possible strategies. Claiming single grid outposts all over the map adds some type of resource to your economy. Don't think it will be there too long when you walk away as all of the other factions are trying to outpost grab just like you. Even the neutral terrain monsters. [spoiler]A giant caterpillar is smart enough to take your outposts for its nest.[/spoiler][i]Just don't be there when it does.[/i]

[b]STRATEGY[/b] you must have! Since the main focus in this game is combat, you have to plan you moves. No way to think that your one tough squad can auto-explore the whole map like in Civ. 

[b]The soundtrack is phenomenal.[/b] It ebbs and flows with the game nicely. 

[b]Originally put out in 2018[/b] and still getting updates and more DLC means you get your money's worth with this title. The graphics hold up as well. Even when you zoom in to watch the carnage.

There are plenty of [b]STEAM WORKSHOP[/b] items to grab as well. Lots of QoL Mods and many ways to vary your playing experience.

used focus fire to either destroy high priority targets or anything it hits first otherwise to guarantee a total kill
initiated large scale engagements with organization and awareness of terrain features (stealth/dmg reduction from forests/ruins for example)
been able to reasonably assess when an engagement is lost and retreat effectively
used scouts.  idk whats going on in their heads but they seem to be affected by fog of war and are very keen on staying out of my line of site until they spring attacks

I've also seen some jank behavior but it's only once and I'm sure there's an explanation.

Also it's 40k.  There are no voice lines but the soundtrack kicks ass and the sound design is crunchy enough.  the map generation is very granular as well and should be able to generate basically anything you want.

the catch is this game plus all the DLC is almost one hundred and fifty US dollars.  whether its worth it is up to you, but the game goes on sale regularly and I'm pretty sure I got everything for like $60.

If the AI really does pan out to be as good as I think it is then this replaces Dawn of War for me, a game I've been playing off and on for the past two decades or so.

The game contains a single map with multiple quests for each faction.

The factions themselves don't play that differently, it's a really good first attempt.  Perhaps with all of the DLCs downloaded I'll find it more interesting.

The graphics are moderate, some of the weapons, for example, the Necrons do have decent graphics.

The music sound track is decent, although gets repetitive after a few hours of gameplay, you may want to search youtube and have a warhammer music list playing instead.

It should be noted that there are dozens of messages on discussion boards requesting an actual single player campaign with multiple maps, instead of a single map, and there does not appear to be a workshop for user made maps which would alleviate this problem.

As the 40k community is MASSIVE, you'd think they would want to tap into that user base by giving them a place where they could create their own maps.

The devs themselves are LARPing in the community forums as players defending the decision to release a game with a single map, if you continue asking about it, the Devs have chosen to Lock any thread regarding a request for a Campaign and are now actively banning anyone who brings up the topic.

Original review:


Damn ... why?

Game concepts and game progression: GREAT
Unit design and balancing: GREAT
Potential depth of strategy: GREAT
Graphics: GOOD
.
.
.
AI: BRAINDEAD ... UTTERLY, COMPLETELY BRAINDEAD

As you can see, this had me hooked for several weeks well enough to rack up 150 or so hours. 
This game is so alluring, offers so much promise, you will just play it to death for a while, try all the factions, figure out optimal strategies ... until you realize that EVERY friggin game you set up, no matter which mods you install and what your map settings are goes exactly the same way: 
As soon as you encounter the AI, ALL of the AI units (including their allies) will rush to towards the closest unit it can see in a ""stack of doom""-YOLO-fashion and an unorganized, large scale, slogfest ""battle"" ensues for some 10-20 turns.
After this, you basically just clean up the map and kill off single units that will continue to YOLO towards you despite obviously having no chance at all.

The AI ...
- doesn't know the strength and weaknesses of its own units and will deploy them SOMEHOW, even against obvious counter units
- doesn't know how to evaluate tactical strength and will pit any number of available units vs any number of enemy units. Keeping a reserve or maybe setting up a defensive position in an advantageous position? Nope. Sending units around your mainforce to surprise you or take down a valuable city? Nope. After defeat, rallying units until it actually has a capable strike force? Nope. ... you get the idea.
- doesn't know how to expand. It will keep churning out useless cities in crappy postions. 
- doesn't know how to research ... complete unit classes will remain unresearched and unbuilt until maybe the very late game. You will see the AI running around with no armour at all or no heroes at all ... but this is a combined arms game! You cannot really win without certain units and it's not a matter of ""playstyle"".
- doesn't know anything about the game economy. It will not capture resource nodes oftentimes and would much rather spend turn after turn running back and forth to the respective closest enemy unit with ALL ITS units. It will even take units that could capture a resource node ""on the way"" to the enemy and still ignore the resources. 
- doesn't know how to handle the early game ... you HAVE TO turn off or set to ""very few"" the alien, neutral AI units or AI players will suicide themselves forever: ""Ah, good, I got a new basic infantry. I will send it towards those heavy hitting aliens that killed my entire team a few turns ago. I am sure, this time it's going to go well for me."" 
- doesn't know how to play the Space Marine faction at all! Just never let the AI play SM ... you are just completely wasting hours of your life.

It's a damn shame. 
I don't claim to know anything about programming or how to set up an AI but it really seems like at least some of those problems could have an easy ""workaround"" fix. 
(E.g., 
-> hardcode the Imperial Guard AI to ALWAYS build the tank-commander first. As of now they will go for the other support type hero units 90% of the time and then send them out on suicide missions without any support.
-> hardcode the AI to capture resource nodes with a single unit IF IT CAN in close range. Just do it AI. If you are going to suicide everybody you might as well suicide them in service of your economy.
-> hardcode the AI to research basic weapon tech by a certain turn. Turn 100 and you still haven't built a single armory for vehicles? Come on ... )

Conclusion:
Not recommended, sadly. After you get your Warhammer-fix and saw some of the awesome units in action for a while, this will just catch dust in your library because it doesn't offer a challenge.",1619814012,1676463967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Caveat: review is based on the vanilla game as of 2021. I haven't played with the DLC.

Gladius attempts to port Warhammer 40K into a 4X format, based on the Civ V/Civ VI style. It uses a hex map, cities construct buildings in adjacent hexes rather than within their walls, cities have HPs and self-defend with ranged attacks, and there's no unit stacking. The resemblance mostly ends there: Gladius has no trade model, no diplomacy, no minor powers or villages. There are some natural resources on the strategy map which can be captured and eXploited, and also artefacts which function in the same way; they're arguably more important than the same features in Civilization because your options in city management are pretty limited.

One of the factions (Space Marines) doesn't have the option to build cities at all. You start with a base dropped from orbit and that's you, aside from bunkers which you construct next to resources to control them. Despite being a one-city challenge, the Marines are Easy Mode. That tells you everything you need to know about the value of cities in this game. Imperial Guard can build additional cities once they reach the third tech tier, which you'll get to around mid-game. For all factions, additional cities have a large negative impact on Loyalty which translates to a cut in production so severe that building additional cities becomes counterproductive. In the games I played as Guard, including the one I won, I never had more than two cities, and the second city was never anything more than a backwater making a minor contribution. In short, the eXpand element isn't really there.

You start the game with a handful of basic units. Marines and Necron have decent basic units, IG and Orks don't; if you're playing as the Guard you'll find that the game's barbarian equivalents will mostly eat your dudes alive, meaning you'd better not wander too far from your start point. Said equivalents are a weird grab-bag of 40K beasties, including Ambulls, Kroothounds, Enslavers, and Umbras. Yep, you heard me right, Enslavers and Umbras can be easily stumbled over in the wilds. They're a nightmare to deal with in the early game and make the eXploration side so limited that it's not fun. Basic units mostly move two hexes per turn, it'll take at least 20 turns to construct a building which lets you recruit more units, and the recruitment of course takes time. It's easy to get your starting force killed and hard to replace it, which means it ends up sitting around fretting about what's out there instead of exploring.

At least you don't have to deal with the familiar Civ problem of random barb hordes trashing your nascent empire. That's because the randoms never attack your cities (that is, city) and in any case your city is harder than Chuck Norris. With 66 HPs, the ability to auto-recover a big chunk of those HPs each turn, and a two-tile ranged attack which will kill most basic units outright, it's a veritable fortress. This of course goes equally for the AI factions, meaning you have no chance whatsoever of toppling an enemy city in the early game. In fact toppling enemy cities is the single hardest thing you'll do in the game - fair enough, it's one of only two ways to win. The eXtermination element is, of course, present and correct; it's 40K, after all.

Aside from wiping your foes from the board, you can win by completing the game's long sequence of faction quests. From turn 2 onwards you'll always have a quest assigned specific to the faction you're playing. You can often ignore these, though you're incentivised by bonuses to production, research etc. to complete them. Sometimes you'll complete 'em or die, particularly near the endgame. Note that the quests are fixed and linear, so you'll always see the same tasks in the same order every time you play that faction. Some are also time-limited, and this is particularly annoying in the endgame, when you can easily lose to the time limit even though your potted empire is clearly strong enough to win given a few more turns. Civ players well know the frustration of almost completing a wonder or spaceship only to have an AI faction pip you at the post. Thing is, in the Civ games there are ways to address this, like accelerating your own production or sabotaging your opponents. Gladius offers no such options in its questline, it just says '30 turns brah, get on with it'.

So what about the combat? After all, this is 40K not Farmville. Epic 40K is the closest TT system to it, but really it's more like Panzer General than anything else. Unit options are very limited in the early game, moderately good in the mid-game, only really satisfying in the endgame. Terrain plays a major role: forests offer concealment and cover, rivers slow movement, elevation differences create chokepoints, and the fundamental tactic is to draw enemies into overwatch traps. You will have to learn to avoid such overwatch traps yourself before you can make any progress. Many unit types (especially the goddamn 'cron) can regenerate lost HPs at the start of a turn, meaning you have to focus on fully eliminating units inside a turn or be overrun. Morale loss can reduce effectiveness, but units will never break and flee. A force that can just about defend itself in the field will be utterly incapable of toppling a city; you'll need overwhelming force to do that, and often you'll find that once you assemble such a force, the AI will simply give up on any additional cities it's built. Several times I watched in bafflement as a sizeable AI force just buggered off somewhere and left me to stomp one of its cities out of existence. Again, this speaks volumes about the value of cities in this game. Note that you can never capture cities, you can only raze 'em to the ground. The units themselves aren't particularly characterful, and for 40K that's a real problem. You build 'em because you need 'em, not because they're cool to play with.

Graphics are murky. Soundtrack is generic and forgettable. Writing is serviceable rather than good. Overall it's a disappointment, and once I'd won a couple of campaigns I abandoned the game. Had Slitherine included neutral settlements which the factions must capture and then defend, then you could have had a decent blend of two game styles; but they didn't do that, they tried to create a Civ-style Dawn of War, something you really notice when you play as the Marines. Sadly it doesn't really work.

Bottom line: if you dig Warhammer 40k, 4X and Panzer General style tactics, then this game is for you. Seriously my favorite strategy game from the last year or two.

UPDATE - Okay, the update took me a few years but... this is still my favorite strategy game from the last year or two which, considering my original review, makes it my favorite strategy game since it was released. Stellaris would be in the running too methinks but it was released a bit earlier...

Anyway, to add some meat to the bones of this review, Gladius is a unique tactical game with some interesting (but not too taxing) strategy components bolted on. The tactics are varied and fun. It helps that there are a bunch of factions now compared to the handful at launch and each faction feels unique and most play very differently.

However, I've seen it called Civilization VI Warhammer-style and a 4X -- even by the developers in the product description, which in my opinion is a little misleading -- but I think it's only abstractly related to 4X titles. It's still really very much a tactical combat game that aesthetically resembles Civilization VI, but the entire thing is geared fully toward resource-based war with zero diplomacy or economy, which is what makes me see it as a faction-based tactical game rather than a 4X. And that's fine! So far I'm enjoying it for what it is -- another take on the tactical combat for which Warhammer is known. (I still wish we could have a true Warhammer 4X title with civilization development, but I guess for now Total War: Warhammer is the closest thing).

The game has crashed on me twice in the three hours I've played, which isn't very promising considering they've now had years to patch out such things. This is the one bad thing that makes me hesitant to recommend the title, and if it keeps crashing this often, I might end up changing to a negative review.

Edit: Also, I think the developers have a very weird sense of achievements; there's an achievement for EVERYTHING. Literally every few minutes I had one popping up for any basic random action, and at the end of the tutorial map I got like four or five more. I love achievements, but these end up feeling more like participation trophies.",1674541265,1674541556,True,12,0,0.663561999797821045,0,True,False,False

It's a good solid game in my opinion.
It looks good and gives that Warhammer vibe of a Universe at war.

PROs:
* Several Neutral unit types that make exploration dangerous for weak units. These NPCs vary on abilities and character traits.  They are also very good at ambushes and can be in groups.  The level of difficulty is adjustable.  The AI factions of course good at ambushes too.
* Random map generator is excellent with several adjustable game play options that can make each game a very different experience
* Each faction is unique enough to drive different gameplay strategies (strongly recommend getting all the DLC factions)
* Turns (particularly early game) go quickly and actually makes hotseat games enjoyable.
* Number of computer/human players in each game are adjustable, along with AI difficulty, world size and color scheme for each
* The individual units gain experience and the hero units also can gain buffs
* Numerous achievements are available to obtain.  Recommend looking at the game guides from the Community
* Good tech tree progression with lots of options.  The progression speed is also adjustable.
* Hundreds of hours of game play and ZERO crashes
* Quests are included as a game play option

CONs:
* There is definitely a learning curve.  Recommend starting out very easy and ramp up as you get used to the game.  There are several Community game guides available as well.
* There are several DLCs which can get quite expensive even when on sale.  Personal preference: Factions - strong buy, Packs - buy/neutral, Lord of Skulls only if you want the achievement, Soundtrack and Wallpapers - just depends on what your preferences are.  The in-game music is excellent though

I enjoy turn based 4X games ( I have over 1000 hours on Civ 5) and to an extent this game can be fun, however I feel cheated.
I cannot help but feel there was a missed opportunity here, the potential for greatness is there but it is almost as if the developers decided that was too much effort and took a hard pass, then decided to milk the player base for DLC which should be included in the base game. 

Some examples of this are:
1. There are no voice overs - you click on a hero unit and give it orders and its the same as a base unit. There's a small text blurb that appears on the screen "" I serve till death!"" or some such like that but no actual voice acting. .Could have been amazing if it had starcraft level of voice over. 

2. When you look up information on a unit you get the same generic background picture for everything related to that faction, and the units Icon on the screen with a detailed report of that units strengths, no picture of the actual unit, and it's not like they would need to create the image either, when you select the unit, a small 3D rotating image is displayed on the bottom left side of the screen, they could have used this, instead you get an icon. Very disappointing.

3. There is a quest, one quest per faction, there are no variations to this quest based on difficulty level or on which opponents you fight. You just get the one quest. If you complete the quest then you win, so the quest system is in fact a victory condition or way to win, which means there are only 2 ways to win, destroy all opponents or complete your quest. This really reduces repeatability.

4. The Tech Tree - There are 10 levels for to the tech tree, as you progress up the tree you gain access to equipment, buildings and or abilities. However this progression feels unnecessary. You gain access to grenades, then melta bombs, then upgraded damage, or basic transport, then basic tanks, then good tanks etc.  The Research tree is just a way to limit the game play, it does NOTHING to define it, unlike other 4X games like Civ, where each age brings a new level of Technology from stone age to bronze to steel to gunpowder to Armor unis to Advanced Laser weapons giving each age an appropriate feel there is no logic to the Gladius Tech tree other than to waste your resources and time because you need an advanced building or unit that SHOULD be available from the start.

Next is the Base game vs DLC- You get 4 factions in the base game, Space marines, Necrons, Imperial Guard, and Orks. Any additional factions you need to pay for. When you buy a Faction DLC you get a new quest (for that faction only) and the basic 10 or 12 units that faction has. Whats worse is when you buy a Unit Expansion pack it unlocks a single special unit for each faction, of which you only have access to those factions you already own. So if all you own is the base game then the unit expansion gives you 4 additional units, however if you've bought the 5 other faction expansions then for the same money spent you get 9 additional units. Either these additional units should have been included in the base game / each faction or The factions should have been included in the base game and then let them sell you extra units, but they get you coming and going... just seems to be a blatant money grab.

So in conclusion, I like this game, I wanted to Love it but I just can't. It seems like the developers had a good game, then marketing came in cut it apart and tried to sell you each part separately to maximize profits with no thought to the game being complete as a whole. The Developers missed the opportunity to make it great and settled for ""meh"" and the story line writers were told to hurry up there's a deadline and included the bare minimum they could get away with, after all marketing said they would be able to do more as part of some DLC.... there's some chump who'll buy it.

Units are consistent with the tabletop, the lore on point, and it's surprisingly challenging, especially if you make the map too small for the number of opponents.

If you have a hard time at first, make sure the map is big enough.

The game can force you to make difficult decisions about what to keep and what to sacrifice. I found myself enjoying, and hating those decisions. Have not had that experience in a 4x game before. 

The city growth economy can be complicated. In the early game, it makes no sense to build more unit production facilities if you don't generate the resources to make more units. Loyalty and energy can be a landmine in late game.

The quests you get can feel like a punishment. Don't ""start"" anything if you find yourself in a precarious position due to aggressive neutrals or an enemy attack. Sort it out first. Quests spawn more enemies more often than not, in places you do not wish to have them.

Figure out which unit can heal in your faction. It can be important for sustained attacks. For the eldar it's the spiritseer. Get him early!

The items that give armor, health restoration and lifesteal can be vital on your hero units: literally the difference between life and death.

I will definitely say getting this on sale and the DLC on sale helped, seeing how much the DLC is for so many things that felt like they should be included in an update does not help, and I would only recommend getting into it when its on sale.

This is not a pure 4x which was missleading for me untill i tried, i would same the game is a mix of RTS, TURN BASED and 4x. If you are a tabletop gameplay fan this offer a pretty simplefied, but very familar feel to it (its different, but very familar and you will feel at home coming from tabletop). The base game offer iconic factions: Space marines, Orks, Imperial Guards and Necros, other factions are unlocked via DLC's. 

Looking at the RTS warhammer games like dawn of war series, Gladius offers a good experience in combat and units like dawn of war did, but without the control points and with turn times, hero type units a similar also, but here you can build more then one of the same type, but the cost increases by alot after build the first one, gladius same as dawn of war 2 offers 3 different heroes per faction and in same cases those heroes are the same. 

Some pros and cons:
PROS: 
satisfying gameplay offering good mix of economics and combat;
visual style is simple, but looks mostly accurate;
unit variaty is good and offers you different gamestyle of the same faction;
lots of similiarities with tabletop combat.

CONS:
unit and build size could use more work to make the feeling more immersing (i heard there are mods that fix it);
some in game settings and other options doesnt explain what is impacted and you require to google or youtube it;
campaign does not exists, you get quests during your match, but those are just as a side thing and doesnt really offer you a story or a real campaign experience, like for example dawn of war series games did.

But the truth is, the game has evolved quite a bit since then, and so have I. I still think it's a Civ clone, I still think the lack of diplomacy is a net negative, and I still think the environments are a little samey, but with the addition of the Adepta Sororitas and the Mechanicus, the game is starting to really find its sealegs. I'm having fun having gone back to it, and I can't leave a negative review up.

Gladius is a grueling slog akin to the Siege of Vraks, but it gets the details right and it's got some charms that I previously overlooked. As long as you don't play to win, but for the fun of playing and of Warhammer, it's a worthwhile slog. For the first time, I've changed a review to recommended in this case.

My previous snarky review:

Did you ever want Civilization: Beyond Earth but with depressing environments, weaker production values, a thin veneer of the Warhammer 40K universe, no diplomacy or trade, and a constant state of war of all against all? No? Well, this is that. Relics of War is a hex-board turn-based Civilization clone but without the things that make the Civilization series interesting.

Warhammer games are pretty hit or miss, and in this case, it's a miss. I will give it some credit, though--the equivalent of Civilization's ""districts"" in the game can produce their own units and projects, meaning a single settlement can produce multiple things at once, which is a feature that I think is missing from Sid Meyer's Civilization VI.

The game is a generic bore that you will play once and never again. Even the basic factions of the game are incomplete and require additional purchases to get the better units.

Dont be fooled by promotions, even at 90% off, the base game is not worth it as a stand alone without the DLC, for which the price rarely drops significantly, nor to a price that's worth what you are paying for.

The game itself is basic, repetitive and boring. It offers little more than very basic 4X principles with the balance of power generally shifting strongly and irreversibly in the first 10 minutes followed by a long, slow and dull drag to conclude the level.

This game is basically Civilization VI. Except you start from the modern ages (With tanks and soldiers and stuff) and remove most non-combat mechanics (Like diplomacy, culture, etc) and more combat focus, with things like heroes, and you end with this game. It could be fun for some people, and it has some good stuff that I like to see in a Warhammer game, like how each faction is VERY different from the others with their own mechanics and stuff, kinda like the first Dawn of War game.

With such a focus on combat however, the game has very little else going on. There isn't a lot of economic or industrial focus either, it's quite basic. But I'm not enjoying the combat either, because it works like Civilization: you smash your units against each other in the map. I think this game would have been way better if it was less Civilization and more Age of Wonders, with small tactical combats with many units, more focus on exploration and armies, etc. As it stands, and in my opinion, it grabbed one of the worst combats in the 4X genre and focused on that. The end result it's not bad to be honest, it's just not very impressive.

Also, the map is quite ugly. The game describes the world as barren, but it just looks like it because there's very little distinction between tiles. Forests look like barren land or ruins. The outposts all look the same. Overall, kinda meh.",1671839824,1671839824,False,8,0,0.523449599742889404,0,True,False,False

I collect and play the miniature war games even read a couple of 40k Novels. Bought Gladius at a generous discount and played it a lot because it took a lot of play time to decided that I liked it. Even getting all the factions (minus sororitas) and base game for fifty bucks still left me with a dread feeling of buyers remorse. Putting that much DLC in my cart just feels bad.

  But once in game it started checking boxes. The factions feel unique. They nailed the feel of the setting. Battle is tactical and engaging. I really mean engaging, whether assaulting forward or retreating en masse, I'm having fun and every decision matters. 
  The simplified city management is weird at first, but probably the best way to adapt Dawn of War 1's economy to turn based. The simplification keeps the pacing constant. I don't find myself juggling an economist mind set on the battle field or a militarist mindset in the city screen. I highly recommend staying in a RTS mind set while playing. The Core game play loop is very much build base /to make units /to find fights /to establish board control /to hold resources /to build base bigger /to build units bigger /to find fights bigger. This makes the game scale nicely from early game little pew pew skirmishes to late game apocalypse. 
  Your cities serve only to supply troops, no gleaming bastions of culture and science to see here. Think Total War not Civ. Divorce your mind from Civ while playing this game, the only realistic and helpful comparison I make to Civ is that combat is similar but now with 80% less slog. Why? Battle Taxis! Put three to six tiles of foot sloggers into one metal box that moves 3 to 4 times their speed. Air mailing guardsmen all day long.
  Biggest reason you should NOT buy this is the DLC policy. Like I said I picked it up at generous discount and only took factions. It'll take a hundred more hours before I buy the Sororitas and the unit packs can bite my ass. If you're down here looking for a review that'll convince you that this game is worth it I think it is. BUT don't get the unit packs, don't get a faction you won't play (or play against.) I encourage you to buy the game and only the game, unless you're a huge chaos fan. Then just those two things. If you need more wish list it. Wait for that steam sale.

- Particularly fun with friends in multiplayer
- Frequent discounts on game/ DLCs

Cons
- Many factions/units behind paywall (BUT can be relatively cheap when combined with the frequent discounts)
- Some DLC units rather redundant and more 'fan service' than viable strategic supplements
- No unit voiceovers or general cut-scenes
- Single player experience very rudimentary as the story is served in text via mission briefings only
- Map size selection could be supplemented with extra larger types, as even the currently biggest one can get crowded very easily and will struggle if you try to field all currently available factions  at once.

On to the game itself: it's kinda 4X, but not really. This is perfect for me, as I'm bad with managing a ton of modifiers and resources. The focus on armies and combat is also justified by the setting. It's like a stripped down, combat-focused Civ. Or a turn-based Dawn of War 1 with 4X elements.
Some stuff could be done better, like bland interface, lack of any voice acting... but the core gameplay is solid, so I don't really mind that.

What it does better: 
Production: Buildings are produced separately from units, and units are built from distinct buildings. If you don't want to bother with a unit type, you don't need that building. If you want to focus on a unit type, you can speed up production by putting down more of that building. If you are done with a building (even temporarily) you can turn it off. I wish this feature was in ALL 4X games (tired of a factory helping recruit a spy faster and you can't produce a building because you're recruiting said spy).
""Barbarians"": unaligned units will try to focus fire your weak units, they will retreat when wounded, they will take resource nodes, they will attack the other AI factions, there is a broad variety of units.
Faction differences: each faction has some units that are similar (there are anti-personnel units, anti-armor, ranged vice melee), but also units that are quite unique to each faction.
Units level up based on proximity to a kill.

What could be better: 
You cannot destroy buildings you don't want. You can clear a forest, a ruins, but not ROCKS!
There are research options that suck, and there is a ""best"" research track for each faction.
There are at least several units per faction that you would never build, there are best units for each faction.
The ""quest chain"" for each faction is very similar to all others other than the text.
Resources can be wonderful/awful depending on where you start.

What is awful/you will not find here:

The good stuff? Factions that are actually very different from each other in the way those play, satisfying paper-scissors-stone approach to balancing combat, and, of course, pleasing if somewhat generic soundtrack. It fits, though.

Downside? Outrageous DLC policy, when literal core units are being sold to you separately from the game, like. i don't know, Land Raiders for Space Marines. Yes, they do it so.

Adherence to the lore is somewhat of a mixed bag here. On the surface game's ok, but the further you scratch said surface the more questions arise - so just don't do that, I guess. Look at DLCs and a complete pack for full experience, and limit your expectations to a moderate level.

Thats all i can say about it.  Its not bad, nor is it good. It works, runs fine, is almost pretty at times but the average game loop is mostly unrewarding and underwhelming. There is very little depth to the game and despite having 4 very different races to play with at start, it still becomes very stale and generic in the long run and boy does the game get long. The turn system itself is very quick overall, but it still feels like a chore doing everything in it. There is little strategy to which troops you deploy because in the end, overwhelming fire and out-ranging your opponent will still win out. The tile system can be interesting at times and city building has some strategy to it to maximize your resource gains as each race requires its own set of resources to prosper, but thats about as deep as the overall system goes. There is no campaign mode (only ""quests"" that you basically play on a generated map against AI) either so you basically get a bare-bones game that isnt even fun as a time waster.

I got it on sale and even then i still feel like its too little content for the price. Feels too much like a mobile game that was ported to PC, and thats never a good sign. Honestly, if you want a good Warhammer strategy game, pick pretty much any other ones available like Mechanicus, DoW or the Total War series.",1669806032,1669806320,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

It's kind of an OK time waster.  As everyone else has pointed out, it's a 4x game with a WH40K theme.  Unlike the Civ franchise, combat is literally the only focus.  And therein lies the problem, really.  4x game combat usually sucks, and it pretty much does in this game as well.  It's slow, repetitive, turn-based, and visually uninteresting.  Unit creation is also typical 4x slow, and the tech upgrades are occasionally useful but not particularly interesting.  There are some strategic considerations, but it's frankly not nearly as engaging as a Total War game or even something like Age of Wonders 3.

I'm giving it a thumbs up, having bought it on the (very) cheap, because I do sometimes want to load it up and waste a day dominating an ugly, boring map at a very slow pace -- I'm not being sarcastic, sometimes I want to play something slow paced.  Just be aware that, like any 4x game, a single scenario is going to cost you a good 10 hours, which might be better spent in Civ or Total War or the aforementioned AOW3.",1669740215,1669740215,True,20,0,0.728400051593780518,0,True,False,False

As both a Civ player as well as a Warhammer 40k fan, I had high expectations for this game, especially since the rating average was ""very positive"". Having played it now for close to 20 hours however, I have to say it is a very ""old""/outdated feeling game, with very little going for it.

To list up what is not so great about it:
- it is not very pretty graphically, the maps are just plain ugly and bland
- it lacks atmosphere, e.g. it has no story or campaign (which for me makes a huge difference in the appeal, and especially the maps with the solid borders and barely recognizable terrain features are kind of immersion breaking/really make it feel like a static board game)
- the Hero units lack personality, they are just stronger units with special abilities
- it has no real depth (the tech tree must be the most boring and superficial one I have seen in any 4X game, and even the combat system feels like a really dumbed down warhammer 40k experience, no way to micro-manage what your units do, what weapons they use etc...! that was imo the one aspect, where the game absolutely should have brought in more depth in comparison to the obvious Civilization gameplay)

Once you finished it, there is no replay-ability whatsoever, sure you can try out all races, but the principles don't really change that much, just some different units etc.

You can pick it up during a sale for a few bucks, but even in that case, I doubt it is worth your time. There are simply so many other, much better games out there by now...

Computer games in the Warhammer 40k, should be amazing I mean the lore, the grim universe...... It simply does not deliver as promised.

Reason 1: The combat is Civilisation based not tactical based. What do i mean? Well you send your unit to fight another unit and thats it, the combat is a small animation of your unit attacking and thats it.

Reason 2: Heros and the lack of equipment. Heroes are powerful and they can pick up items and the like but you do not really equip it. If you could have a tiny hint of Master of Magic in this title and the option to make powerful artifacts and the like then holy crap that would be amazing but no.... This game simply lazy made, when compearing to other Tactical Turn based strategy games.

Reason 3: Forgot to level your hero well tough luck, I had a hero standing on an outpost and he got attacked a lot but managed to surive without an issue, problem was that when i returned to him he had leveled 3 times but i could only choose to learn 1 ability. Now I have requested a refund so i havent really bothered to explore if level up points is every 3 levels or something, but meh.

If this title had only a hint of Dawn of War 2 conserning heroes that would have been amazing, but honestly this is simply Civilisation with a Warhammer 40k Skin. Thats it.

If you are a die hard 40k Fan and like Civilisation than sure this title is most likly going to be fun, but I would rather get Age of Wonder Planet Fall which does have proper tactical combat, is a x4 turn based game in a sci-fi setting.

-crosses fingers- I hope for a 40k Game that will do the universe justice just like Dawn of War 2.

Bought it again on a 90% sale, without any expansions, and now I can say that it is ""worth"" the money
Still far from a good x4 strategy game, but if you reallly do not have anything else to play then sure.

The voice acting is great, the animations are fun to look at and I enjoy that they tried to make a unique situation for each faction for what is meant to be a similar experience (i.e. necrons just woke up and are mad, imp guard wants is stuck and orcs and other stuff is arriving, eldar are protecting their network, orcs wanna fight, and such). Helps with role playing.

Great entry point for the Warhammer 40K universe, to get the ""vibe"" of fractions. 
Bots are kinda dumb, try to find someone to play with(official discord server could be of help)
The cost is a bit high, try to wait for the sale, unless you are SURE that you will enjoy it in a long-run.
WHY would you enjoy it tho? 
Personal pros:
1) basically a civ game, stripped from everything but economy and war, but they are pretty good as a trade-of.  
2) very interesting offensive/defensive stats system(although armor pen and number of attacks usually is all you need for a good weapon), as well as SOMETIMES strategic tactic system.
3) economy side of things is less unique, but still notably differs between factions, plus the game has decently flexible settings for map generation and some other stuff(it is in general VERY recommended to mess around with those settings for better personal experience, they matter a lot).
4) workshop mods do exist.
5) SOME factions can play with different army comps, which really improves the variety.
Negatives:
1) Other factions  usually have 1 specific style as clearly superior, and a balance is mostly all over the place, to be frank. I would argue that all faction are at least playable(especially if you use fitting settings - for example chaos marines are STRONGLY not recommended at lower game speeds) and overall pretty fun, but yeah, some factions are just stronger, make research before buying expansions, if winrate against humans concerns you ;)
2) Imho, the price tag is very unjustified if you want to play it just solo, both for the main game and expansions.
3) Really loses a lot without expansions.
4) **** that height-vision system for tiles, you WILL get used to it, but it's very backwards, and I am very sad that as far as I know you can't turn it off in vanilla.

Overall still a solid recommendation for all strategy players out there ^_^",1667134760,1667134760,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, Gladius is a really good mix of Civ-style gameplay, and something more akin to Advance Wars, with the unique factions of a StarCraft or Dawn of War. There's a good mix of high-level strategy, tech-tree and resource management, combined with engaging unit vs unit tactics. Games rarely require the kind of commitment that a 4X game might typically need.

Graphics and sound are fine. They are true to the source material and everything is recognisable at a glance. Voice action for the the units would have been nice, as would more engaging animations when units fights, but these are pretty much just details which would have added a bit to the atmosphere, and in the long-run, repetitive voiced lines can get annoying anyway.

The game is also well supported by the developers, with a fairly steady stream of meaningful DLC as well as regular bug-fixes and balancing patches. However, that means that if you wanted to play the ""full"" game today, starting from scratch, the price to get all the DLCs along with the base game is a touch steep. What feels like good value when you've been playing the game for a couple of years on and off might be a con if you're just getting into it. 

Overall, a really fun and well balanced game that offers pretty much everything I could want from a 40k property. As long as the devs keep providing new factions and content, I'll keep giving them my money.",1663858902,1663858902,True,12,0,0.668029844760894775,0,True,False,False

Okay, wasn't that hard to beat DOW3, but you know we had numerous 40K games after.

+ Very respectful of 40K lore with plenty of text, loadouts and units.,
+ Also a great moddability to top all that!.
+ Superbly challenging gameplay.
+ 4 different faction campaigns (which are not campaigns like we remember, but at least these are questlines and quest events) - UPDATED: even more with new factions!
+ Each of the 4+ factions has 100% unique tech trees; something I do appreciate a lot!
+ Allows cooperative team vs AI (a huge +)
+ Allows multiplayer pvp and team pvp (some people are finding each other on Discord for this)
+ Sleek design, great performance on medium computers even with many units
+ Committed developers who answer to modding requests multiple times daily
+ Slitherine staff who has the same commitment

Some flaws:

- lacks persistent carry-over campaigns; you play a map like on Civilization. I would have loved carry-over campaigns.

- texts have typos, especially on translations (such as french) ; stay in english.
 
- 3D modding is much harder than 2D modding, this is a huge limitator to what single people can do.


Some people complain about difficulty. To the Warp with them! it's 40K, it's eternal war, we deserve to have casualties. :P challenging game = great replayability

At first it totally looks AND feels like watered-down Endless Legend/Civ, but there's kind of an art to its simplicity. What they did cut out, they cut out completely; and what they left, they focused in on. Mechanically the game runs like a well-tuned machine. The combat system is WAY more involved than it let's on, but will feel a bit random until you take the time to figure out the method to the madness.

Honestly, the games biggest flaw is that it doesn't explain its mechanics well-enough and what information they do explain is usually buried under different menu chains. Game picks up a lot once you do a good dive or two on the wiki, but play quite a few games with different factions before you do. The wiki is still missing a lot of good info, but the info it does have is makes the depth start to set in.

Factions have TONS of flavor and I doubt they are balanced, but no idea. I play this kind of stuff to try each factions and get a few achievements for it. If you want to know about competitive depth, you'll need a different review. But if you want the kind of depth that makes each ""run"" interesting, this game is fantastic.

Each faction also has a challenging storyline that doubles as the ONLY other victory condition to just murder. The storylines still involve a lot of murder however as they often spawn neutral hostile units. Depending on how these units spawn on top of all the random terrain features the possible problems can vary a lot.

There's also wandering neutral armies that guard key resources locations and rare army-wide buffs, but ownership is king of the hill style and so only the last person to control the tile actually owns them. Tons of light skirmishes even just playing against medium bots.

If anything it plays more like the first Dawn of War games, but just with grids and turns for our aging brains lol",1662352326,1662353346,True,4,0,0.506344139575958252,0,True,False,False

The Wall of text: 

The Good: 
-There really isn't any other 4x games with WH40k on the market, if you ignore the total conversion mods for games like Stellaris and what not (and even those aren't as immersive as you may wish, in my experience). 
-The units are frakkin beautiful (Ex: personally, love the models for Stormravens and Dreadnoughts. I love my boxes, and this is the closest I get to touching 40k models instead of shelling 10k bucks on Forge World models on tabletop)
-The immersion is great. Descriptors for weapons, traits, units and even upgrades give you better understanding of the lore and just makes things more relatable. 
-Its fun, and imho has a lot of replay value due to the little things you discover about each unit and faction every time you play it (ex; at first glance, Space marine vindicators looks straight up worse compared to heavy bolter predator, UNTIL you shoot at a TEQ (terminator equivalents) like meganobs.) Every playthrough is gonna be different, you will find builds slightly better than your last one AND learn more about units and how they interact, because tbqh a lot of people suck at mathhammer. 
-The devs are great. ROK for example, interacts with members in discord a lot, and you can see from balance patches and his interactions with players that he does care about what community says. This in itself is uber rare, and personally one of reasons why I threw money at this game using steam instead of pirating it or what not. 


The Bad: 
-The workshop and mod group are very small. This game has GREAT potential for modding (ex: research to get Thunderhawks, Stormhammer, or even new factions(?)) and whatever modders we have are uber dedicated, but we'll probably never see too many of them because a) modelling is hard and b) playerbase is somewhat small. One day, I dream of seeing balanced titan equivalents just dishing it out in the middle of the map. Probably will never happen though.
-Balance: maybe im not seeing it, but sometimes some units aren't just worth making and researching extensively, such as scout bikers or Vaul's Wrath battery (the new patch just dropped on these though, so we'll see). Plus, the community pretty much agrees the eco of certain factions (SM, or even AM) are bit messy or too slow to get going to be fun, and there are parts where I would even agree. 
-Unit variety: You can definitely tell that some units are reskins of others (see: faction specific snipers) with some new traits sprinkled in. Granted, those are great additions for  the game still because snipers are awesome, but would love to see each faction differentiate themselves a bit. Hard to balance, but maybe for example make SM units have VERY few models (ex; tacticals or scouts have 3 or even 1 models instead of 6, make them take extra dmg from blast or template weapons or something) to make em fit more lorewise and more different from other faction units? But imho, some of these units are bit too similar to each other and would love to see them differentiated. 
-WILDLIFE AI CAN BE BULLSHIT: Now, I understand that with time and experience one can predict wildlife behaviours, but some of the wildlife AI and RNG can really mess up your life and no amount of experience can totally overcome bullshit. Examples include accidentally overwatching and aggroing on turn 4 4 kastellan robots and 2 tech priests with your Guardsmans and getting ur HQ down to half HP (ALL city outputs/loyalty scales with city HP btw), or some other player/AI hit an umbra and next thing you know, it and its friends up aggroing onto YOUR poor FOR because wildlife doesn't care who to fuck up when its been aggroed, just that they can and they will. This does disincentivize playing greedy and rushing (which is fair), but it does feel bullshit when you can't use your brain cell numbers to turn off overwatch and will STILL get destroyed anally by 2 robots vs your 4 guardsman (makes you really regret not getting that commissar now, don't it?). Expect lots of debate in discord and comments regarding this mechanic. 

Finally, the ugly:
-The game and all the DLC's cost 141.86 DOLLARS (in a bundle, normal non-event price). With this price, you can buy masterpiece of a game like Doom Eternal or Stardew Valley-in fact, you can buy BOTH of them. Alternatively, you can buy 2 shitty triple A games like cyberpunk or anything Ubisoft makes nowadays (or buy your family an insanely good meal at Red Lobster) but you see my point. Granted, some would argue that this is technically fair price, especially if you played like 69k hours on it, and I personally think I got my moneys worth (hence the + review), but not everyone is gonna love this game to justify paying 141.86 dollars (I and many other suckers in discord did though lel, some at FULL price when the dlc's were released). I like to think of myself as being one of those whales that subsidise the cost of a really promising but niche game, but a lot of ye are gonna say that I am getting willingly robbed with my eyes open which I will neither confirm nor deny. This is gonna be the nail in the coffin for many of ya considering buying this game, but once we get more workshop content or maybe even rework factions a bit so each factions and units feel much more unique compared to each other, then I feel this price would be a lot more approachable to people. 



So ya, here's my personal TLDR:
Its good.

[b]Introduction: [/b]
There are 2 kinds of people when it comes to Warhammer: The initiated that love to immerse themselves into the rich lore and mythos and the ones that have not been initiated YET! In either case, Warhammer 40K: Gladius – Relics of War is a 4X strategy game. 4X basically stands for Explore, Exploit, Expand and Exterminate. In a typical such game (eg Sid Meier’s Civilization) you pretty much do all of those things, with a usual emphasis on the expand and exploit parts. In Gladius though, the emphasis is almost entirely on the EXTERMINATION! Long are the days where you could play the diplomat, trading and making deals with your peaceful neighbors. There are no wonders here, no particular economy other than the raw planet resources and no cultural paths to pursue. In case I didn’t make myself clear enough, this is war in its purest form and there shall be only one victorious side!

[b]Story:[/b]
Gladius is essentially a seemingly abandoned planet, one that every race has set their sights upon and wants to conquer for their own particular reasons. The bits of story are told through each faction’s ambitions and leave us drenching for more context. What are all those diverse beings inhabiting the planet? What about the relics? Though there is a rich in-game lorepedia featuring anything and everything about this game, the presentation of any story bits leaves much to be desired and it’s all lengthy walls of text that you may or may not look through that much.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Where Gladius really shines is its strategic gameplay and its moment-to-moment decisions. My hats off to the developers in Slitherine Ltd, that have years of prior experience and love for the 4X strategy genre and it shows! The game revolves around knowing your strengths while measuring up your opponents weaknesses. Every single unit in this game (and trust me, there are dozens of them) is unique. They all have different weapons and abilities, both passive and active. They all have upgradeable perks that are unlocked through the faction-specific tech tree, sometimes giving them passive bonuses and others enhancing them with abilities and even extra weapons! There is also another really cool note that makes Gladius distinct from other war games: unit models. Apart from their aesthetic beauty and distinct designs, models have actual gameplay mechanics. For example, a Tactical Marine squad always comes with 5 marines. Each marine comes with their personal gun that adds up to the total firepower of the group. Should a marine die, the firepower is automatically reduced by 1/5 until the group recovers. In retrospect, a unit with 1 model (eg a tank) does not lose power until it dies, but its way more susceptible to damage from the heaviest but slowest weapons! There is a delicate interplay between the unit model count, the weapons that they wield and the damage that they deal. What I find most exciting about this game is that even though there are tiers in the tech tree, I’ve never felt that any unit became obsolete or that it outstayed its welcome. They all organically exist within an army, taking up their strategic position that you will plan for them and doing their grim job always as intended!

[b]Diversity:[/b]
In case you have played any 4X game you would know that the replayability comes from the map generation and the factions. I am pleased to let you know that the map generator is one of the most robust you will find in the market, with different terrains clustered together that favor resources and disfavor others. There are many customization options before you hit that sweet start button and you can mix and match freely before the game begins. You will also find height difference and water to be of utmost strategic importance, as –for example- height may allow you to be safe from melee attacks, or water that is impassible for ground forces but there are also amphibious units and flyers that traverse it without a care! As far as factions are concerned, without even touching the DLC, there is a wealth of WH40K lore and faithful crisp models in every faction! The Space Marines are elite warriors, each and every one of them feel meaningful and stalwart! The Orks on the other (green) hand are ample and expendable. The Necrons are sophisticated metallic soldiers that regenerate and bring terrifying armadas to the battle! The Astra Millitarium, aka The Imperial Guard are the billions of humankind that rely on numbers and on an impressive array of battle tanks for any situation! Each race has its quirks and mechanics, making them way more than model swaps. Very good job portraying them!

[b]Verdict:[/b]
Warhammer 40.000: Gladius – Relics of War is a very good 4X game and an even better Warhammer game! The attention to detail and the care in handling the game makes it an engrossing experience. It does not try to be a civilization style game and it finds brilliance in focusing on what WH40K is all about: WAR!

It's nice to play a game where going to war is the point and as such the entire game is geared towards just fighting that conflict. It's refreshing and fun. 

The different factions really do feel unique. Even ones that seem very closely, such as the various Imperium of Man factions, play differently. It is fun to learn each faction's unique playstyle. Factions that I wouldn't play using minis are still fun to play in this game. Each faction's heros are a lot of fun and compliments each faction's unique playstyle.  

I also look forward to seeing new factions. I hope that the Dark Eldar aren't that far away. I also hope that we see multiple Eldar factions in the same way that the Eldar have more than one faction/army type (Harlequins would be really fun me thinks). I also wouldn't mind seeing more Space Marine chapters (I want Space Wolves and Blood Angels please). The Inquisitors as a faction would also be a lot of fun.

Base game offers 4 factions, each with their own unique themes and abilities. Also, each faction has its own units. And not 1 or 2 unique units (like samurai and zeros for Japan in Civ 5), every unit is unique in it's own way, at the very least they differ in stats and appearance. Each faction also has its own questline, completing which is one of the two ways to win the game next to destroying cities of every other active faction. Completing it is actually the ""hard"" way compared to regular domination, at least if you are not aware what the next stage will bring. And trust me, it can be both challenging and surprising, well sometimes most of the challenge comes from the surprise. While it is not really equivalent of story mode (you get tasks during regular playthrough if you decided to leave the quest active in settings and other factions can and probably will use the occasion to jump you when you get weakened by quest-spawned enemies), it offers a fun read and insight into faction characteristics as well as the situation on Gladius.

As for the DLC, of course it would be really cool if everything was core and part of the base game, but the base game itself with its 4 factions is entertaining enough. Of course it's skill (and some other factors) dependent, but I'd say that completing the game through quest for each faction on normal to big sized map could take up to 10 hours, so it's ~40 at base and +10 for each race pack you decide to get. As for tech ""packs"", you can see the techs blanked out in research tree but personally I hadn't found it especially irritating. Unlike Total War: Warhammer, if you don't own a DLC (or don't activate it in game settings) the AI also won't have it, so you don't have to worry about being overpowered by AI with some neat stuff you don't have due to not buying DLC.

Definitely worth it on sale, once you give it a try and see for yourself whether you encjoy it or not you can decide about the DLC. Base game is definitely playable without them.",1657364049,1657364049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I overlooked this little hidden gem because of its mixed reviews, very bland graphics and varied opinions on its difficulty. But boy was I wrong. This game is addicting. The best way to to describe is that its like Civ but without all the boring economy stuff. In other words if you typically found yourself waging war or immediately fighting in civ, then this is the game for you.You wont find any sort of diplomacy or religion or tech victories. But don't let that discourage you, there is plenty of meat on its bones to keep you entertained for hours on end. 

The basic warfare of civ is child's play compared to this one. Its not overly difficult either as some people make it out to be. You essentially capture resource nodes scattered about the map while dealing with the occasional neutral threat gradually progressing through a research tree, getting new units, buffs to support them, city growth so on an so forth. All the while exploring until you eventually meet your adversary in battle. Learning which units counter what and which plays well to others weaknesses is extremely rewarding and lends itself to multiple play sessions with each of the different races. And yes there is some degree of city management. You have to watch your resources and population in order to keep up with the demands of war. Its a nice little balancing act but isn't too bothersome to get in the way. Each faction is very unique and handles differently enough.So If your a fan of 40k your definitely going to love it. You can also change the game settings to fit your play skill if need be, such as terrain density, the amount of wildlife, game pacing and of course difficulty. 

The only complaints I have with it, if any, are very few. One of which is the gawd awful graphics. The aesthetic is dark, bland and dull and not in a 40k type of way. The textures are muddled and the models are somewhat simplistic. But thankfully this games saving grace is the ability to mod it. It has a good workshop of must have mods that make the game better. You can even edit the code in notepad++ yourself with a little know how. Secondly, and this is just a minor gripe, is the ugly looking UI. It's basic and uninspired like a browser window with no colorful art to speak of.

Lastly, and I must address this, is the amount of content withheld to be sold as dlc. Such as the additional unit packs. Normally I'm okay with selling dlc if it supports the devs but I feel in this case they should have given the unit packs as free dlc then introduced the race packs as paid content. That way you win over the trust of the players enough to warrant charging for bigger more 'reasonable' dlc. I feel like this greatly affected the way this title did upon release and even now which is unfortunate because the game is actually fun. I cant blame them entirely, other much bigger companies have a disgusting practice of selling multiple dlc packages as well such as civ itself. And to be fair other 40k games do this to. All in all this is a fantastic strategy game if you can get it all during a sale and a must have for any 40k fan. I highly recommend it.

Listen here, you apes. The game had 4 factions at release 4 years ago, as well as 20 units per faction. And that's what you get when you buy it without dlc, a perfectly playable game.
But the devs kept working on it during these 4 years, and now it has twice as many factions, and 25 units each. To access these additional content, you have to pay for it. It's only natural, no?

Or what do you think the alternative is? The alternative is that devs abandon the product post release. That's what you want? 

The game is one of the best turn based strategies set in warhammer 40k verse. It plays like civ, except there is no diplomatic or cultural victory, there is only war. This makes the game more simple in many way, and more focused on tactical aspects of 4x games. Some even say it's kinda similar to Panzer General, they aren't wrong.

Considering that this game was published in 2018 and is still getting new (paid) content and free updates (the released a major update in March 2022 and a smaller one more recently), I had to reconsider. Add to that a very interesting game (see other reviews for much more elaborate thoughts on gameplay) and an incredible modding community. 
The first thing I noticed when playing the game, was that units were missing the typical one-liners I've come to expect from warhammer strategy games. For me they add a lot of flavor and immersion. Guess what - there's a mod that adds these for every available faction (including dlc) that is also getting updates to this day.

This game, product wise has many similarities to total war warhammer regarding dlc, but worse in a few aspects.

The problem is that the dlc is segmented in a way that created unbalance and power creep within the game, at least in warhammer you could fight the new factions dlc if you didn't buy the dlc but not here. There are units behind a paywall and even buildings.

I want to support the game since its an indie studio but i'm inclined to simply think they are in the wrong here, the games for the positives has been supported all this years, there is no performance issues or bugs as of me playing but the game doesn't have voice acting at all, the one you may have heard was form a fan mod witch is simply not a good decision to leave such a thing to modders it should not be their job in my opinion, again, if it was an indie game and maybe instead of fragmented the dlc went for a more traditional expansion dlc i wouldn't mind but to rely on mods for something so fundamental as voice barcs for the units… It is simply sad.

The worst part it's that the game its great, it feels great to play, the map and gameplay its well designed and the AI its actually good and it doesn't really cheat with resources or free units.

I do recommend the game, but be mindful, this kind of dlc practices are very dangerous so as a product i don't recommend it, buy it on sale as a complete package but it's going to cost you. 

I think without the dlc you would feel very constrained by the locked units and buildings

I only have the core game but I think that the variety of units is ok, specially if you play the most recent version and not the Legacy one (wich you'll have to play if your PC does not support Vulkan). In the base game you'll get 4 Factions: Astra Militarium, Space Marines, Orks and Necrons. I think each one have at least: 2-4 types of ground infantry, 3-4 types of vehicles, 3 types of heroes, 1-2 types of artillery and a good number of buildings (Yeah I'm guessing 'cuz I dind't played with each one of them yet). Thats more than 50 units, not counting any DLC.

Like Civ there are regions of interest in the map that gives bonus resources (FOR THE EMPRAH!!!), ""wildlife"" units roaming in the map (BURN THE ALIEN!), no diplomacy at all (PURGE THE HERETIC!) and f*cking orbital strikes (KILL THE MUTANT!).

The modding community also helps a lot improving the quality of the game, I have Gladius+ and Too Many Voices installed, totally recommend it.

The DLCs are kinda pricey tho, but I want to give them a try.

But on the other hand, they allow the sharing of the ""pack"" DLC's, as well as the lord of skulls DLC as long as you're in the same room with someone who owns the DLC. That's great, and more stuff like this should be done in more games. Absolutely commendable and I SUPER respect the developers for putting that in as a feature, which they could have very easily not have and forced more people to buy the packs to stay ""Competitive"".

The game has it's issues, and it has it's pros, and the pros might outweigh the cons for some as well as visa versa.

I'll list some of the standout points here in a moment, but if you're looking for a TL/DR Review, I'd give it a 6/10 for the base game alone, and 8/10 when you've got all of the DLC's. They matter quite a bit in terms of content, and I'll talk about that more in depth soon.

Now, onto the individual points I'd like to point out about the game:

• The quest system is a neat idea, but the difficulty of some quests is a bit unbalanced at times, especially stacked with the randomness of the maps and the sheer amount of ""Neutral"" units on the map by default. Sometimes it's as simple as ""Walk 6 tiles away from your home base and capture this one outpost by standing on it for a turn with 1 unit"".

Other times it's ""Survive the 10 max level massive creatures we just spawned ontop of your home base until we say you've ""Won"" which might require you to hunt down and kill every spawned creature for that quest. Some of which might occasionally get mixed in with other similar neutral units and it turns into a really nasty genocide-side quest of creating a wall and hunting every single unit of a specific type, including their generator buildings that make more of them, and all while trying to build defenses against an enemy whose quest was ""AFK a unit next to your base for 2 turns to get a free tank at the start of the game"".

Overall, I turn quests off for my games, which is thankfully an option, but in doing so during the single player games, I realized that there is no campaign to speak of. 

There is a single cutscene for each faction when starting the game that gives you a fairly generic explanation for why you're there. That's your ""Story mode"". A 1 map skirmish against the AI (Or with if you give yourself allies, but that doesn't change the story at all. You can have Space marines working WITH chaos space marines and the ""story"" stays the same. You act as if they do not exist, and they act as if you do not exist, you just happen to not be able to attack each other.

So your options are kind of limited. You either have to follow the questline to it's conclusion with each faction to see it's ""story"" or you get a fairly empty ""Arena"" to amass armies and duke it out Starcraft style.

Don't get me wrong, that's plenty of fun on it's own, but someone looking for an actual campaign of some sort is going to be let down big time.

However, if you prefer your game sessions to last for a few hours, and then be done and start something new? The game will treat you very well if you have the mindset for it in that regard.

Making your own ""Stories"" of why you're ON Gladius is really the most fun you can have with it, even as a fairly ""light"" fan of the series. I'm not out here quoting the codex, but I do enjoy a good ""Blood for the blood god"" scream before diving into battle, and this game is wonderful for that reason. You have a unit that just somehow manages to survive EVERYTHING? Name them on the spot and give them that personality that you see in them. That's a small but AMAZING little touch that goes a long way.

Because honestly once you win, all you're given is a small little text box and your stats. It REALLY makes it feel like just a randomly generated map for starcraft, if that makes sense.

There seem to be quite a few viable tactics to win, but bear in mind that just researching/building EVERYTHING in one game does not seem to be one of them. Also be aware that early tier units do decrease drastically in usefulness over the course of a game, even if you take time to upgrade them so make sure whatever you are building has some sort of current purpose.

The audio is better than I expected but not memorable and the terrain and colors are consistently bleak which, while thematic, can lead to a certain blandness of the landscape and a difficulty telling what sort of tiles or units you are looking at if zoomed out.

In terms of game design, it's a 4X game that doesn't seem especially exciting.  

The game is a real disaster when it comes to visual design.  Everything is full of detail, but nothing's readable.  The units don't visually stand out enough from the background.  Important information is lost in a blur of graphical complexity: for example, one kind of tile damages units who stand on it.  In a well designed game, that kind of tile would be very easy to read, practically screaming DON'T STEP ON ME.  In this game, it's just represented with a kind of hazy red thing that you can easily not notice (and have your units end up getting damaged by mistake, oops!)

The highlight of this game was when I was playing as the Imperial Guard and finally managed to tech up and build a cool artillery piece.  I got it into position, attacked my enemy... and was disappointed when a piddly animation played and barely anything happened.  Nothing like the exaggerated, hyper-violent visuals of the Dawn of War games.  In this game, everything that should end in a bang ends in a whimper.  

3/10, would not recommend, even for diehard 40k fans

The intro barely gives a brief description of how to build on tiles and then sets you loose without giving any recommendations or hand-holding on how to gain a foothold on the small map you're on, what to research first, or what units are good against other units.  Basically yet another game in a long line of games that REQUIRES the player to only play a certain way, research a certain order, and build certain units first to even have a chance at winning.  The best part was for the intro, on the ""easiest difficulty"" they throw the Necrons at you.  Fun fact if you're not into Warhammer lore, these are AI robots that can self heal.  All they had to do was sick a Lord unit surrounded by 5 or 6 regular army units onto my city to win.  They rotate any units out at about half health where they heal themselves, and rotate fresh units in.  I couldn't even kill one single unit of the enemy because they run away unless you can box them in, on a hex grid, which requires a ton of units to do so.  I couldn't even let my city die with dignity once all my units got destroyed.  It took the AI a good 20 turns just to finish it off while a single unit of mine was constructed only to die every 3 or 4 turns.  I'm not new to 4X games, I've played Civilization from game 1.  This game was built by the devs for the devs and screw the regular everyday player for not knowing what the devs want you to do.  GREAT game.  SUPER fun.

They took the simple model many of us played back when, and finally improved on it cleverly. I like Warhammer, but I am not super into the Warhammer-verse.

4X elements have been simplified but don't let that fool you into thinking this game is easy, the combat is quite deep and brutal compared to a lot of other 4X strategy games I've played.
Each faction plays very differently and has a different range of units to select from.
The main problem with this game is with the base factions the game almost feels like a demo.
However if you pick this and some of your favourite factions dlcs up it's really quite a fun experience that id say is a lot closer to nailing the 40K vibe than most games.
Id reccomend this to 40K fans who don't mind a turn based strategy and to people who want a 4X game that's main focus is its combat.

The faction DLCs are overpriced.

Ai is dumb. There is a hex-field thats called wire-weed and it does much damage if a unit stands on it. Well the ai often treats it like a normal tile, and just dies on it. There is an option to control the amount of wire-weed spawning on the map. There isn't one to disable it and even the smallest option generates great amounts of it.  

It has problems reacting to you healing your units  The ai can't deal with healing enemies or some abilitys like on the tyranids hero were there is the passive ability that the hero gains less damage after he gets attacked the first time. 

Then there are things like:
Some races being insanely overpowered like the Tau... Or weak like the spacemarines
Not being able to disable certain things from generating. In this case the wire-weed and the relics. Relics are tiles that give insane bonuses like 10% more damage or HP for the whole army. These can spawn in locations that make them only reasonably accesable by one player. Like on an half-island behind the base of a player were the only real way of reaching the relic would be to kill the player off.

The good:
+ Warhammer
+ Autosaves every round that are usefull if disconnects happen. (Very important for me)
+ Background Music never gets old
+ If it works and if you get a fair and good map it is fun to play with friends.
+ I can manage the individual ai advantages. (Not ai difficulty)
+ Its fun against ai if you manage to balance the odds correctly.
+ You can rename units while and do so in multiplayer while waiting for the other players to finish their rounds.
+ Unique factions that also play and feel unique
+ Great encyclopedia in-game that can easily be accessed. 
+ Tactical combat that is fun
+ really good map-generation
+ You can play with more than 8 players
+ You can give yourself enconomy buffs at the in the lobby to even the playingfield when fighting against pros.

Ok, so here's the deal....like I said above, I do not like purely turn based games with mechanics like Civilization (what this is often compared to). HOWEVER, I love the 40k universe and have been in the hobby for over 20 years (damn...I'm old lol), yet Gladius is simply a game I can't put down! With 54+hrs in game in 2-3ish weekds at the time or writing this, with a full time job, I think you catch my drift; WARHAMMER 40,000: GLADIUS - RELICS OF WAR IS A VERY WELL EXECUTED AND HIGH QUALITY GAME. FULL STOP. Not only this, but the aesthetic and quality of the units/models in-game only serve to further illustrate my point. 

If you like 40k, buy this. If you like 40k but DON'T like purely turn-based, BUY THIS. It has ENDLESS REPLAYABILITY and with all of the base game factions and DLC factions, the replay value increases exponentially as there is enough differentiation between them all to keep you trying to refine and improve your builds.

While very little of 4X is present here, what remains is great gameplay and strategy. If you like tinkering with diplomacy options those aren't here; however you still feel like an emergent faction that gains strength overtime.

First fearing the neutral units (or at the very least, moving with care) until you can amass enough units for your faction and decide to push out. 

Only to run into an enemy that you quickly need to size up in order to determine if you have the right units and/or technology required to defeat them. Remember, with no diplomacy once you've encountered a faction, they are more likely to attack you.


While not every faction, and its playstyle is to my liking, there are more than enough factions to learn and master, or simply pop the game open for an afternoon.


While the DLC is expensive, it can (mostly) be avoided until its on sale, or you're a fan of that faction.

However, two of the unit packs DLC are integral to the enjoyment of several factions: Orkz, and Astra Militarum immediately come to mind) and those are the The Assault Pack, and the Specialist Pack, as they add some much needed units to your factions.


Final note: The mods, specifically from the workshop truly make this a better experience.

The core things that set Gladius apart from a lot of 4x games is 1) it's 40k, and 2) it's all about combat. No diplomacy, no truces, just constant all out wars of annihilation. As fun as I find this mechanic now, it frustrated the hell out of me for hours.

During my first few games of Gladius, I restarted within 20 turns. I'd make a wrong move and lose my starting units, or misprioritize research, or found a second city too early, etc. Because the core mechanic is combat, mistakes like that can be SEVERELY punishing, especially when you are new. I would be lying if I said Gladius did not frustrate to the point of near uninstall a number of times before I ""got it."" But once you ""get it,"" its honestly a really fun game.

With all that being said, here is some advice for new players to avoid my same frustrations:

1. Gladius Prime hates you. Neutral (but very hostile) units are out there and they constitute some pretty serious firepower from time to time. Isolated and beaten up units can pretty easily get swarmed, and the AI is good at prioritizing attacks on weakened units. Avoid separating your starting units and don't try to expand too fast too soon. It is generally better to do a controlled expansion you can hold than a rapid one at the cost of fighting power. Also, neutral entities may not attack you, even if they are in range, but if you attack them first, they will not hesitate to retaliate. Keep that in mind when setting overwatch orders.

2. Resource management is just going to take a few games to get right. Every faction has a different resources they must prioritize, but all have the same general avenue to get them. Cities produce the bulk of your resources so city management and resource management go hand in hand. City management is fairly simple but its difficult to know what to be building. This wouldn't usually be an issue, but the all-combat nature of this game means a few poor turns of resources can be bad-news-bears for your frontlines. Just don't be afraid to restart and learn from mistakes.

3. Research is sort of the same level as resource management. The system is really simple, but it is hard to know which techs to take and when. Again, this just comes down to playing the game, and really a specific faction a few times. Which leads me to...

4. Space Marines. Play the Space Marines. For your first time, there is no better option. They only have one city, which makes resource management a tad easier, as well as having one major resource to deal with (most factions have two). Their units are also generally resilient and powerful, and their ability to use orbital operations makes them a pretty major threat with a lot of flexibility in the late game. For new players I'd recommend playing all of your first games with the Astartes. Feel free to restart if you feel like you are in a bad place, and you'll learn what to do pretty quickly.

A final note is to be wary of the Chapter 1, 2, 3 etc. objectives. While they do give rewards, they tend to spawn a ton of neutral units in your territory which you may not be prepared for. It screwed me up once really bad.

And that's it. After a few successful campaigns and a couple factions I've come to really enjoy this game for all the reasons others have reviewed it for. I found myself, however, quite annoyed by its punishing nature early on, and hope this review will help new players avoid (or at least be aware) of those pitfalls so they don't give up too soon.",1652049411,1652049411,True,59,2,0.824099540710449219,0,True,False,False

I am not a fan of WH. I mean to say I haven't read the books or played any other games, I don't mean to say I dislike WH. 
The factions in Gladius are very distinct. I never felt like I was playing the same reskinned faction. 
The rules can be a little complicated, but complicated is what TBS does. A better wiki explaining unit abilities and rules would be nice.
There are plenty of customizable options for the world you fight on, as well as the faction difficulties.
I disliked the quests as they can be disruptive if you are not familiar with them and expecting them. It is a simple matter to turn them off.
The DLCs for this game are stupid expensive. You can pay $15 for a SINGLE additional faction and there are at least 3 that are not included in the base game. I have not found any good sales on the DLCs either.
Overall I recommend if TBS is your thing. Enjoy!

+ Great combat that relies heavily on terrain
+ Good amount of unit types
+ Mod support
+ Exploration is really fun; lots to discover and lots of danger
+/- Pretty simple in every aspect besides combat, not the greatest 4X out there
+/- The simplicity could be nice for 40K fans unfamiliar with 4X's, but 4X vets may not like this
+/- Strange UI choices
+/- No diplomacy
- VERY pricey, I only recommend this if you're a big 40K fan
- Lots of the cool stuff locked behind DLC, likely the majority of the cool stuff

Would not recommend at full price; If you're on the fence make sure to look into level of simplicity in the research tree, city-building, and resource management. This may make or break it for you, but personally speaking the great combat makes up for it and it's refreshing to be able to focus on the exploration and extermination while only making a few clicks to manage your empire. Just keep in mind you're paying for the setting here as there are a ton of 4X games that are much better than this one, this is a decent 4X game that you likely would not enjoy unless you're into 40K

Buying the game on sale with all the DLC is the best route unfortunately, but once you have all that content it's a solid game. You can get the complete edition on sale for a reasonable price

DLC's to unlock race features like basic vehicules, units, etc is honestly a ""money grab"" attitude that works against the game. With the basic game worth so much to begin with, adding all DLC's (just to be able to play properly) values around 90$. Not to mention that including all of that, which is already too much. The game does not feature a campaign story line towards any race, Space Marines are just generic, no Individual chapters or any other race on that note as a matter of fact.

- Single scenario gameplay which will cut down replayability and get boring real quick
- To experience the game, you have to jump hurdles of pay-walls
- Mods for this game available on steamworkshop help get some value back from this game (Thank you 40k community <3)

If you dig 40K and 4X games, you'll probably dig this. However, if the notion of having to pay for extra factions and stuff sends you into a frothing rage, then avoid this. Me personally, I don't mind paying for some of the factional DLC, but only because said factions aren't in the game at all. Compare this to, say, the DLC for Total Warhammer 1 and 2, where factions are in the game but locked behind a pay wall. Here, you're actually adding to the game, not merely unlocking content.

But then, I paid for a bunch of Total Warhammer's DLC, too, so perhaps I'm just a looney.

So, yeah, this game is Endless Legend or Civilization 5 but with 40K and a greater emphasis on combat and strategy, and it's done rather well. It takes some getting used to, especially for a Space Marines player like myself who found their faction setup a little unfair, but hey, ""git gud"" and all that.

And now, the caveat (a.k.a. my old review from an older computer):

Used to be able to play this game. Now I can't, because it only does Vulkan support for the processing or something, which my computer doesn't have, meaning I'm shut out of the game and the DLC I purchased unless I default back to an older version.

Never encountered this problem with a game before, nor has the internet yielded any way to address it beyond ""Regress back to version 1.2.6"". Thus, I cannot recommend a game that I cannot play anymore. I LIKE this game, I WANT to buy more DLC for it and support the developer's endeavors, but I can't because I'm clueless as to whether the new DLC is compatible with that old version of the game.

So, buyer beware: should they radically change the coding for this game and make it incompatible again, this positive review's going right back to just those last two paragraphs.",1583800170,1647303140,True,0,0,0.629953861236572266,0,True,False,False

 Let us get this out of the way first, the game is way too expensive with all the dlc. Even at over half off, I paid 60 dollars for the full game. At that price, it may be worth it if you are really into this type of game, but I would NEVER advise paying the full 130+ dollars that this would have cost if it was not on sale. 

 The game itself is fun. It probably would have been much more fun back when it was new and there was likely much more of a multiplayer scene for the game. To me this plays like Warcraft 3 TFT would have played  if it had been turn based instead of RTS. This is fun, and there is some depth to the combat, so that is a plus. There is a lot of RNG here as your starting location will determine  how difficult your game is going to be. Get a nice corner spot on the map where you only have to defend one direction, your golden. Get stuck in between two or three other factions, you are going to have it rough. 

 There is pretty much no story or campaign mission here. Yes, each faction does have a series of quests that kind of tell a story, but there is little to no depth in it. In fact, if you are new, I would turn off the quests in the options as the quests tend to be much harder than the actual other factions. 

Overall the game is fun, but it is overpriced for what you get. It may be worth it if you have a group of friends to play with, as the multiplayer can be a blast, but the AI can only present so much of a challenge from a tactical standpoint as it tends to be pretty easy to manipulate. Just put a low health unit that you do not care about in harms way and watch the Ai move to horrible positions to chase down and kill that unit.

Haven't Played Multiplayer! But I can imagine it's really fun with your friends. This game is not perfect but one small problem in both multiplayer and singleplayer is that 1 game can take a long time to complete. You can change the speed of the character but still takes time.

+ Lots of factions! if you get everything you get 5 more with DLC and 9 total. In the future there is two factions left if they are gonna realese them (Dark eldar, sisters of battle)

+ Looks good and sounds good (would have liked vocies for the units) Done justice to the warhammer world.

+ The text story. In the game you can win by doing the story, cool and fun.

+ Hard and challening. 

+ I personally like the economic system in the game. It's smart and fun. It could take some time to figure out but rewarding when you do. 

The worst sin of the game surly have to be the price of the game counting in all the DLC and supporting packs. If you get the game in a Sale it's totaly worth it.

I have no problem with factions being locked behind paywalls, there are other games that do this. What bothers me is that every step of the way in my very first game, it keeps showing me things that require dlc. The game itself seems to be kneecapped, made for the sole purpose of selling overpriced dlc for basic units when games like Soulstorm from like 16 years ago had 8 complete factions in the base game. Similar games like Alpha Centauri had 6 complete factions. This thing grays out the first vehicle in your faction and in red letters shouts that you need DLC to get the single most common and basic mechanized unit in the Imperium. It shows you precisely how many factions you can't play as and locks research in the tech tree but suggests you merely pay more than you paid for the game itself to unlock partial factions.

If I wanted to watch commercials, I'd watch tv. When I buy a game, I expect at least a functional experience, not several reminders per minute that basic parts of the few factions available are locked. This might have been a decent game, before they chopped it up.

HOWEVER!!!
Its pricing schedule is pretty crazy, once you look at the DLC.

First, the base army lists are missing some of the units, which you have to buy DLC to make available.
One big example is the Tier one Chimera for the imperial guard. 
This is a fundamental workhorse of the guard and is in no way optional, as it provides protection, support and mobility for guardsman units.
It is part of the Assault DLC, which costs $7.50.
The other packs of this type are Fortification, Specialist, and Reinforcement.

Now it is worth noting here that EVEN IF YOU BUY A RACE DLC PACK, SOME UNITS STILL REQUIRE YOU TO BUY ONE OF THE OTHER PACKS

So, with the base game missing some key units that you need DLC to obtain, the real cost of the base game looks more like $89.50.

(note, i rounded amounts of .95c up to $1. not a fan of smoke and mirrors in marketing)

The other main DLC type is race packs, which cost $21.50 each.
While races as DLC is fine by me, the price does not reflect the relatively little product you get for your money.
There are 5 of those, for another $107.50
And, just to be clear, ill restate that EVEN IF YOU BUY A RACE DLC PACK, SOME UNITS STILL REQUIRE YOU TO BUY ONE OF THE OTHER PACKS.

Also DLC, Lord of skulls at $4.50. 
This adds a non playable race wandering around the map. 
No real complaints here, although you would think that as the planet is undergoing a serious warp storm that may be part of the fundamental game design.

Finally, some wallpaper and soundtrack, $3 and $7.50 respectively.
The ingame music is pretty ordinary, just generic background noise really.
No observations or interest in the wallpaper.

So, just for interest sake, total cost of the game: $211",1645333910,1645335955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gladius remains a lesser clone of both though and despite some funny clunky graphics and animations (especially with the Ork units) and funny Warhammer humour I can only award 5.5/10 and thus cannot really recommend the game – especailyl if you have better alternatives (and who doesn't).

Why?
Well, you should always ask: 
Is the game worth my money?
Answer: Maybe, if it's only around 3,50€ AND you are a huge Warhammer fan.
Then you need to ask:
Is the game worth my time?
Answer: I would say barely. Also there are many better games and each day (I know, no one wants to think about it but it's true) death creeps closer and closer. So we don't have any time to waste. Why then did I play full games with SpaceMarines and Orks and tried out the Necrons and the Empire and dumped around 80 hours into this game? I think hope dies last always... Also for my beloved fellow gamers I want to write excellent reviews where I thoroughly explored a game to make up my mind.

Back to the game.

The Good:
+ humorous texts, especially (well, mostly) with the Orks
+ clunky unit graphics that are quite fun, especially (well, mostly) with the Orks
+ hex-based strategy ( I love it and you should too)
+ the Warhammer universe is so cool and fun
+ well, the general idea (taken from Endless Legend I believe) of having a resource management with certain tiles you have to conquer to get those special resources is interesting, Endless Legend did a much better job there though
+ actually a lot of content

The Bad:
- you only get to play four factions: SpaceMarines (cool, but a bit boring), Necrons (boring), Empire (interesting, but not so much that I actually wanted to do a full playthrough) and Orks (fun, fun texts)
- you only play on one map, even the hugest map size is basically if I remember correctly something like six by four screens on resolution 2560x1440
- to fill the small map with a bit of life they threw a handful (yes, I think six actually) of different critters
- to fill the whole experience with some more sense they stole the Endless Legend-idea to do quests. Those are rather uninteresting though and pretty much pointless. With all factions I caught myself doing tactically unsound stuff just to get the quests ahead so the whole misery would finally meet it's end
- the game's UI is ... bad. You cannot skip a unit, you cannot cancel a move. So if you misclick you have to reload or just tell yourself ""What the hell, I don't care any more""
- in later stages of a game you command around 50 units. I ended ignoring  half of them so I just could end the game more quickly
- there are some units per faction (I believe like around ten or so) but they don't feel enough and they don't feel significant
- there is actually lots of content like texts and stuff, but it does not feel like much and not very relevant
- it takes far too long to get to the more interesting end game units and then they don't really make a difference any more
- SPOILER: stupid quests, all factions have dumb onslaught quests where a whole army or even a city spawns 8 tiles beside your city – surprise! - and you have to survive for 20 turns yawn

The Ugly:
--- like many other Warhammer games this one is average at best (I am generous here) and aims primarily at making some quick money. The DLC is ridiculous, the core game ist just not worth your time and money.

The Sad:
~ good art work and writing,  so evidently some passion flowed into the units and many texts, it's a waste on this game though
~ it would have been better to pay better attention to the late Fantasy general and just make a chain of maps connected with a story. That would have made the thing much more interesting and could have led to interesting late game battles
~ the decision makers don't know their games history (or they don't care), but many mistakes in this game are decades old and repeating them is just...


So rather get yourself DosBox and Fantasy General or – if it has to be Warhammer, try Dawn of War (which is better but also not super).

Sorry for the bad review, it always makes me sad.

It's just bleh as the game lacks no depth and every race just a reskin with standard 4X RPS issues.  It also drives me nuts this is a perfect EPIC scale game but nope, they still use 40K units and scale.

Specific annoyances:

(1) I really despise (not unique to this game) when the AI prioritized player objects over other AI objects, i.e. you will see wildlife engaged in NPC combat immediately break engagement and chase you down if in range.  You will see two AI's fighting each other, units with one health, and the second they see you both units will turn to engage you and only you.

(2) Rules say AI doesn't get a resource/unit but at ""normal"" but I don't believe it; they grind out way to many resources in a small time.  My gut feels they get both a bonus to economy (i.e. ignores maintenance is my guess), build speeds, and a better starting tile set.

(3) Do NOT waste your money on ""Lord of the Skulls"" DLC as it suffers from the issue most of the ""spawn"" events have, it drops a giant unit in the middle of your backlines with timers you can rarely meet unless you plan for it which you shouldn't have to do.  Unit should just randomly drop anywhere on map w/ no timers or respawn.  Played it once or two, disabled after that and never gain.  It adds nothing.  By the time you can kill it you generally already won the game.

(4) Speaking of which, you almost always win the game conquest prior to completely your faction quests unless you make an effort to just not kill them, i.e. park a unit outside their last building with 1 HP and just keep healing yourself while you compete the missions.  If they are  going to include missions then they should have either made a single player arc with multiple missions / campaign OR made missions that can actually be completed in game AND actually add something .. hell most of the missions aren't even worth the reward and in many cases, negative.",1644950752,1644950752,False,4,0,0.532919704914093018,0,True,False,False

I find many 4x games get a little tedious and monotonous as you expand and have to manage more cities however Gladius seems to avoid this by simplifying the economy balancing act and pairing it with a surprisingly fun combat system. The unique units truly make each faction feel different to play without that ""each faction has a gimmick"" feel. I appreciate each faction having build diversity as well since so many games seem to promote a min max style leveling system instead of multiple viable options due to imbalance. I thoroughly enjoy the game and can't recommend it enough to anyone that wants a combat focused 4x game, you aren't going to win any matches of Gladius with diplomacy. 

Pros:
Warhammer IP familiarity, its a great universe with great art, lore and base mechanics for unit individuality. 

Multiplayer feels fluent with streamlined mechanics. 

MODS, great ones!

Interesting factions that genuinely feel unique and well balanced with great synergy within their ranks.

Combat is quick and the unit synergy/formation is fun to experiment with.

Faction Quests, they are good and fun to pursue.
Achievements are obtainable yet challenging for people that like achievement hunting.

Game Pacing is smooth and makes you want to finish each game.
Controller and Keyboard swap as easily as turning a controller on and I actually enjoy both options.

The Research tiers have great unlocks, I always want to unlock at least two from each tier. 
DLC: there is a good amount of it and you don't NEED it but it is all worth owning

............................................................................................................................

Cons:
Games are long like most 4x games, this doesn't really bother me though since its inherent with the 4x genre.

DLC: its a double edge sword we like to have it but it costs more money. My only issue is adding 1 unit to each base faction in different DLC packs feels dirty. The added factions are great though and if you usually buy all the DLC for games it isn't noticeable. It is worth mentioning though because if you don't like DLC it would be annoying to not have every unit available to the 4 base game factions. Many Warhammer fans consider the DLC units quintessential to the factions; I however feel this actually speaks to how great the lore is and how much every unit available is appreciated.",1644374840,1644375267,True,6,0,0.57803499698638916,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay is solid and it's cool seeing all the units in it, along with lore writeups and other little details. It also goes to lengths to include a lot of units that you see on the tabletop but that don't see in other games... Or it would, if not for DLC.

The base game has 4 available factions, with FIVE locked behind individual DLC packs. It's not even like in Total War games where you can interact with the factions, just need the DLC to play them (Not that I like this practice at all), but they flat out cannot be used in your game if you do not own the DLC. The fact that over 50% of factions aren't even included in the base game is ridiculous and totally unreasonable.

On top of this even in the base factions, a number of units are locked behind DLC paywalls too. Just using Guard as an example as they're my favourite faction you can't even make Chimeras, one of the most ubiquitous and common vehicles in their motor-pool without DLC. The Guard roster has 4 units locked behind DLC (Chimeras, Ratlings, Scions and Void shield generator) where EACH ONE requires a different DLC. So you're telling me to play one of the base factions to the fullest, I need 4 separate DLCs? Hard pass. Other games would just put in new units for free as updates to reward their fan-base for staying with the game. Instead you get a company that's decided to package updates as paid content.

Fun game. Great lore that is interesting and immersive. Really cool factions to choose from. Play with heros, units and cities. I am still excited to see the story progression for all the factions.

CON:
I am going to give this game several more second chances, but something that is a big disappointment is that the AI is just dumb. That results in the AI consistently throwing units at you and defeating them becomes monotonous which becomes exhausting. The factions are also unbalanced and the tech tree does not have any real strategy. The tech tree is just a story progression. Little room for actual strategy which makes for low replayability value.",1642741142,1642741142,False,1,1,0.502954602241516113,0,True,False,False

My gameplay experience was set up a game with medium-dificulty for the 3 AI opponents - survive until it's just me and whatever random AI who've stomped out the other two factions, then I'd get romple-stomped by that remain AI - repeat. Did this until I finally gave my faction a starting bonus and was able to beat that OP'd last-man-standing-AI. 

Then... I did what passes as story-missions (the ""Quests"" - i.e. meet certain simple conditions like accumulate X-amount of resource-Y, or have a skirmish with a specially generated group of enemies - then get a reward like an item for your Hero and get a paragraph or two of ""story"") 

If there were actual missions, and progression; Like unlocking of units as you move from mission to mission, and have cut-scenes for level starts/mid-point level events/level-endings I could totally embrace the series moving in this direction from RTS to turn-based CIV-styled gameplay! 

My only gripe is the insane parsing out of content - buying the other factions is WAYYYYYY too expensive; I bought the base game, and the 4 addition (specialist/assault/etc.) units for like 20 or 25 bucks on sale, and for what I've got out it worth the price ( as of writing this review 68hrs, and it was spend entirely playing as the Space Marines faction - so 3 more to go. Now that i know to give myself the stat boost won't take NEARLY as long to run through the other 3) But 10 bucks a pop for the other factions is a bit too rich for my blood. Maybe if there's a 50%-or-more discount on them I'd pick up another faction or two.

All in all, love it and would recommend the base-game and extra-units on a good sale any day of the week!",1642697201,1642697201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game, imo, should have DLc sharing and it lacks a couple QoL additions you'd think would be implemented during the later Alpha development phase (like tech tree searching, higher caps on pop growth bonuses for the space marines (seriously 120% is nothing, let me get pop growth enough to get 1 pop per turn or no balls), not to mention how tooltips for units before being built really oughta have a super short summary of what it does statistically, I could care less about flavor text, especially when viewing it in the tech tree menu, scroll wheel working in the tech tree menu, the scrapping of buildings *coughcough* research buildings when you have no need for them because you already have everything *cough* among other things) and it may need more optimisation but it's altogether a pretty good game.

Many planet-scale 4X games like Civ, let's be entirely honest, have pretty damn terrible combat, and pretty damn terrible diplomacy, not to mention brain-dead stupid AI. Well, the AI in this might not entirely be smart but they know how to use their units and can give you a run for your money.
This game also just tosses diplomacy out a window and decided to make combat actually somewhat half-decent by giving it a rather nice layer of depth with different traits each unit may or may not have to give them different advantages and roles in combat, with even terrain giving bonuses to damage reduction and rarely even damage dealt to your units.

This game also takes civ 5's ""cities can fight too"" mechanic and instead of conquering enemy cities, you flat-out destroy them by lowering the hp of a city's headquarters unit to 0.

Every faction has its own technologies, units, some have unique economies and most have their own mechanics and no faction plays the same.

I regard it as a less jank, planet-scale 4X version of Dawn of War 1, its just missing the above additions, the dark eldar, the adeptas sororitas (maybe the Adeptus Custodes?) and I'm unsure what else for factions.

If you want to play it, I recommend it.

Just don't bother if you're interesting in modding it, while the community behind modding it is welcoming, the EULA basically says ""lolol GW owns your shit so you can't put mods on the workshop if it doesn't fit with Warhammer"" so if you want to make a TC mod, just forget about it, you're probably better off making it in Civ 4, doing it by scratch or being SOL sadly.
Speaking from experience, because I wanted to make a TC mod not related to warhammer because I'll be honest, the factions could have more difference between them and I have itches for gameplay playstyles none of the factions currently itch and that won't likely ever change.
I can only hope the devs' next project has a less head-in-ass modding policy for their benefit more than mine really.",1607607107,1642234272,True,0,0,0.365697562694549561,0,True,False,False

It's very replayable and the AI is decent to good especially if you consider the AI in most games kinda sucks. Right now I'm not so sure about how the AI performs between factions but they all seem to at least push if they have the advantage and retreat. You still need to give them advantages in numbers though for it truly to be a challenge if you are using your brain each turn, but you can set up the game however you want. For customization, you can pit two AI's against you or change their difficulty (which will give them the numbers bonuses). You can change the wildlife amount and various terrain feature amounts. There's a good amount.  

Once you are in a game you can practice your build orders with the different races and just enjoy absorbing all of their technology choices and other info if you enjoy that sort of thing. Add to that the fact that it is the Warhammer universe with a good bunch of races (with the DLC at least) and pretty good unit options, and it's just a cool game. Not too in-depth with diplomacy (there is none, and who wants it anyway?) , just build up an army with some choice in tech and take control of the map, which is procedurally generated and offers good consideration when moving. For example, forests block sight unless you are adjacent, offer ranged damage reduction, and cost more to move through. 

Turns will consist of picking tech to research, placing buildings in your city to manage your economy, and then most importantly making good tactical choices when moving your units.

For example, as Space Marines, you could beef up powerful hero characters with lots of Influence, little research and requisition, or focus on well-equipped Marines with lots of requisition, middling research and very little influence. Each race has thematically correct abilities* and it pays to have the right tools for dealing with the threats at hand. Some abilities interact with the tiles in better ways than other 4x games, such as how orcs regenerate fast in mushroom infestations. There are somewhere around 700 unique statuses and identifying traits, ranging from the generic ""Flyer"" to faction-specific tiered upgrades to cities.

The pace is excellent. Gladius is almost as fluid as an RTS when you're fast, except when focusing attacks on a single unit- notably a city center. It feels like a good tug-of-war by mid-game, where defensive options are powerful, but the field resources are a big advantage up to end-game. Human opponents would make for very interesting games, or you could optimize your strategy against beefed up, tactically weak minded AI.

Complimenting the turn-based nature, there's plenty of details and fluff to soak up. While not as complex as similar 4x games, it is thematic to the specific 40k scenario, though not without error (an item with a sword icon being called a blade in the name and an axe in fluff, for example). It doesn't present much that is unique or new- nor does it let you- but does well in representing the factions.",1641252586,1641252586,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Even though this is a 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) Warhammer 40 000 Gladius heavily focuses on the last X while lacks in the previous ones. There is not much to explore, expand possibilities are limited (or rather it comes very costly), exploit system is I would say generally good, but nothing special. But extermination is something that you have to put your entire focus on, this makes sense hence in harsh environment of W40K there is only war and only the strongest survives. In the game this means you have to quickly produce as many unit as your production can sustain and attack as fast and as often as possible or you lose. This is actually pretty good mechanics because it drives your attention to the battlefield, strategy and tactics. I would actually love it if it didn't require so much micromanagement - unit die quickly (or heal slowly) so you have to make up this in quantity and when every turn I have to move 10,20,30 or more units it makes every turn exhausting and unnecesarily long. Don't get me wrong, the game is good, really good, if you have patience, for me this is something I play once or twice and get on with it, I enjoyed the game but I'm not interested now in playing again (or buy dlcs) if there are much better games in the genre.

Regarding the DLC.. here is my opinion based off what some other reviews have stated:

I'm not sure if some of you have played a lot of 4x or grand strategy, but it is common knowledge that ""complete"" means complete up until that point. More DLC tends to get added which makes the price of ""complete"" go up over time (check out europa universalis 4.) You're not being swindled by buying ""complete"". More DLC is good, and optional.

The economy isn't that hard to manage once you get the hang of it, and the only reason it's really there is to balance what units and how many you can deploy at one time, because you will get to deploy all your favorite 40K units, and they all feel just as awesome to play with as you think they will.

For those of you who like the Civ games and might be looking for a like game I will tell you that this is not a Civ like game. It is more of a 3x game instead of a 4x game. Forget about expansion. Unless you play the Ork faction, they seem to be meant to expand. Though I have only played the base races, so maybe some of the DLC factions are expansion based.

Why do I say this? Because the game has a feature that punishes you heavily for expansion. The game says you can expand and build specialized cities. That is a joke. If you expand your cities, you will begin a cycle of having to build only energy to support the living space buildings you will need to operate all the influence buildings you need and the energy buildings you need and back around the building cycle you go. So, most of your buildings start to become energy, living quarters and influence, with maybe another type of building here and there. Unless you want such a hard hit to production that you do not care about building influence buildings. Because expanding cities really hits influence badly, and population growth has a negative impact on influence as well. All this means is that you are not really supposed to expand in this game, or the developers would not have punished you so hard and created a pointless building loop if expansion was a desired game design. It would seem to me that if they did not want you to expand, they could have limited every faction to one city like they do the Space Marines. By the way, the AI does not seem to be impacted by this factor. The AI will build lots of cities and still field lots of units as if they are not having to focus on influence.

Having said all of that, there is a mod to remove the influence aspect of the game. Which then makes it more like a Civ like game I suppose. I find this aspect of the game annoying which is why I just spent a lot of time on the topic. You might like it. But this aspect of the game makes it not Civ like for those that might be looking for such a game and read the comments about it being Civ like.

Getting that out of the way, I like the game. I like the fact that you must fight you way out into the map. I like the different units. In my experience the AI is actually smart. It will focus fire on units to kill them. It will focus on support units when it can. It will assault your cities. It does build large forces and will give you challenging fights.

It does seem to have to scout the map like you do so you are not going to get an assault to the back of your city out of nowhere because more than likely the AI has not scouted that route. Unlike other games, like Age of Wonders, Endless, etc. that produces armies out of thin air to attack your city when your army leaves your city and moves a certain distance away, forcing you to keep a ridiculously large garrison in your cities which then limits your expansion army. I am guessing this is all in an effort to make those games “harder”, because they do not know how to make a good AI. That is my guess for this common cheat anyway. This game does not do that. Yes, it will attack your cities once it finds them, and it can be relentless in its assault. But it doesn’t use cheap cheats to do so.

I did like the faction story arcs as well. I thought those were a nice touch. Well, except for the Necrons, which I did not finish.

Overall, I really like the game. You have a 4x4 generated map that does not wrap, you have opponents you must find and exterminate. If you like those tactical games with fog of war, resource management and small to large battles that are a challenge I think this would be a game for you.

This game is not without flaws or need for improvement and I don't really know previous iterations so I can only speak to the game in its current state so I will do a pro cons list below.

Pros:
Fun, This for me is really the biggest factor in the time I have put into it if I wasn't enjoying it there is no way I would rack up these hours. I love how the game plays it gives off a board game kind of vibe and considering I have played most of these hours in multiplayer with my Dad

Maps: This is also kind of a con because the map is entirely random every time so you kind of get to roll the dice on what kind of start you are getting based on the location, as I have continued to play I've learned you can adapt to any kind of start but this requires knowledge of the faction you are playing and what works and what doesn't 

Neutral Factions: To me this is actually a great thing to add to the game it makes it feel more true to the Warhammer environment everything is trying to kill you and despite your best efforts the game finds a way to kill off your units.

Balance: I am still working my way up in AI difficulty but from what I have played of 4 factions they all have strengths and weaknesses. 

Factions: While I am talking about factions mad props to there being 8 playable factions (With DLC) This level of factions is on almost on par with the original warhammer dawn of war franchise where in the last expansion you had 9 choices of faction. I will say even without the DLC there is a nice variety in the factions and I think you can slowly add DLC overtime to spice up life a little bit OR fun fact if the person you are playing with has purchased all the DLC you at the very least gain access to the additional units locked behind some of the cheaper DLCs. This could also fall under a con if you arent looking for a game with additional paid content.

Mod Support: I haven't used any mods for this game yet but I think any game that supports mods is a plus

Cons:
Learning Curve: This game doesn't really have a great tutorial so this is a game you learn through trial and error. I would say I have played a few factions a lot but I am still learning different ways to play them and once a new faction is thrown in or some of the DLC additions it can change the landscape of the faction entirely, okay I am overselling it a little bit the game has a great tool tip system and you can look through pretty much any piece of information in game. But I just wanted to highlight that it really isnt the easiest game to start. 

Time: These matches last HOURS and that isnt even an exaggeration I played the tutorial for 3 hours before I ultimately won against the standard AI. I would say the biggest factor in the time is that it is a turn based style game and in addition to you and the other AI taking turns the neutral factions take turns as well granted it all happens at the same time.

If I could make a suggested improvement for this game I would like to suggest:
This game needs more accessibility options, specifically a color blind mode and I would like to see being able to adjust the color schemes of certain things e.g The color of neutral factions or the color used to separate elevation, if you play Orange this can become damn near invisible when a unit is in the space xD 

TLDR: 10/10 4x Strategy game. So if I had to summarize I am having a great time playing this game, I wish I could get all the DLC right now but it will be a slow build up, this game has been great to play against AI with my Dad even though I spent the first 30-40 hours teaching him how the game works.

[i]Works very well actually![/i]

For me playing [b]Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War[/b] very intensively during a period and having played the Civilization games, especially [b]Civilization V[/b] for a total short of an eternity the thought of making a mix of the two did spring to mind.

[b]Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War[/b] focuses on resource management, city planning and strategy when placing units for both attack and defence.
The units are generally not very strong so you have to put them in squads like 1 range with 2 or 3 ranged units making that aspect covered as well!
The city building is cool too with the possibility to add several buildings to the tiles and also stacking production buildings.
Some units you build are heroes which you can purchase items[2] to. This adds another interesting aspect of the unit development.

I'm not sure how true the units are to the Warscrolls of W40K but they well enough, end game seem to be rather OP for some races at the moment.
The models are nicely done too as well as the aesthetic of the map.
So [b]Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War[/b] got me hooked instantly!
The sound track comes in two packages, the base game comes with a few tunes which are very like the ones in [b]Dawn of War[/b] if you are familiar, the DLC comes with a few more including one which is heavily inspired by a famous MMORPG developed by Blizzard. Anyone been to Stormwind lately?

Currently playing the campaign quests for the different races which brings me to the negative things about the game.
The campaigns[1] are repetitive, possibly because I play them too much having completed one or two per day since I began playing this game.
The base game comes with four races, but left out some of the items and technologies in the technology tree, that's like buying a car which only steer left and you have to purchase the turn right feature later...
The races you buy in the DLCs are complete though.
[h1]About the DLC![/h1]
A warning, the [b]Lord of Skulls[/b] is just plain stupid IMHO.
I disliked it so much I turned it off in the settings...
So if it isn't bundled, read up on what it does and if you think that is odd just leave it alone.

To summarise. If you like Warhammer 40 K and Civilization you will like this game!

[1][spoiler]
The campaigns contains often all of these in order of appearance:
Kill x
Go to 3 outposts
Kill more than previous
Collect artefacts
Destroy one or more settlements
Survive for x

The only thing changing is the story, reference to races and fictive individuals.

A massive army suddenly appears, even though you already had passed by, or had it all covered earlier....

Other than that, the positives:
Music - E P I C
Battles - Do get massive and intense. The Ai is pretty dumb, I feel on Medium and Hard. It just wants to kill your weak units, which is stupid. (annoying at first...) 

Replay Value - Oh yes, you do feel compelled by the emperor and other dark forces to try all the factions out.
They do play differently and Im even tempted buy some dlc..maybe. 

Units/Tech Tree - Feels satisfying and pretty overwhelming at first. I found myself getting annoyed early on, as you encounter certain large units and dont understand how to kill them. You suddenly start wondering where the useful stats are, so you can exploit.... But you know what? Just hammer them, that's the fun.

It's a great game even from its humble beginnings with only Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Orks and Necrons.

Every faction is unique in its mechanics and technology.  So I would recommend the game but...

I would have more highly recommend the game more in the past.  These days if you have an older laptop like mine, the game crashes almost immediately due to some kind of renderer error.

The AI is horrible. If it does manage to gather its forces to attack, which if often doesn't, then it will just come in a massive blob. If you can hold off that attack then you pretty much auto win.

the other problem is the maps. The random map design has been horrible. Maps that are full of water that cause the AI to lock up in points, or large ridgelines that are impassable cutting off large sections of the map. I've multiple games where enemy bases spawn in a chokepoint they can't get out of behind my base or another player's.

It does have ""missions"", sorta, 1 mission track that exists only in text, and these are just objectives to push you through the progression and teach it to you.  It doesn't actually have a campaign for single player in the sense of a storyline progression that you'd expect from the old style RTS games like Warcraft 3 or something.  Arguably this makes sense... the minions of whatever faction you are playing are nameless and faceless in the brutal world of WH40K, but on the other hand without any voice acting and storyline with central conflict, humanization with voice acting and maybe a cut scene or two besides the 1 generic one you get for your faction... you're left with a very hollow experience.

That said, this game is very true to the WH40K universe as much as you can expect it to be given that the canon is too large for any 1 person to comprehend.  It's also mechanically sound and really well done.  I don't want to say ""polished"" because the major kink in the game for me is that I can't speed up/skip the attack animations, and that's annoying AF.  That said, it's a really solid game for what it is... it's just missing that key 3rd leg to the stool that feels noticeably off for me.

That said, it doesn't promise to have that, so, it gives you everything it promises and it's really good at what it does... I just feel like cutting the single player campaign story (ie different maps and such that link together to tell a cohesive story) feels really strongly absent and weakens the game for me overall... but for being an RTS game and a WH40K game, it's top notch... it's just a game with no satisfying level of story.  If that's cool with you, then definitely don't hesitate.  If it's not, it's still a good game worth playing, it's just going to feel like it's missing something important and it won't hold your attention long.

The game is even better than what I expected...recommend it !!! (being 40k is just a bonus)

For everybody else, it gives more combat than Civilization, but nothing special. 

It is a combination of Command & Conquer, Dawn of War and Civilization.

The city can expand it´s territories and can create buildings that produce various units. 
The city also can create buildings that collect resources that is vital for creating and maintaining units.  

With units you wage war on ""neutral"" units and enemy units.

Waging war is the central element, but there is also bonus missions that unlocks and gives rewards. 

You also research upgrades, special abilities, new building and new units.

Gladius does fine as a 4X strategy without the somewhat tedious tech and diplomacy grind of Civ, which I just never enjoyed anyway after just a few games. Base building could do with more attention, and the predictable AI could do with some refinement.

The DLC / content model is the usual gouging up of a GW licence, with digital assets being waaay over-priced. But if you're a 40K fan, then you are likely to forgive that because Gladius does do a lot of justice to 40K's diverse factions.

Be prepared for some very janky animations, annoying voice-acting, total lack of any real singleplayer story or campaign and poor balancing of a skeleton of a core game, with most of the good stuff locked behind DLCs which you absolutely do need. 

If you can swallow that, yes it's one of the better 40K titles around right now, but I'd really wait on a sale, especially since you will want some of the DLCs.",1635791011,1635791646,True,18,0,0.716390490531921387,0,True,False,False

It's a 4x style but with all of the non warfare aspects roughly chopped out and combat mechanics...kind of left at the level of a 4x?  Neat idea but after multiple attempts I can't bring myself to enjoy it.  It also doesn't quite feel like 40k (although I don't have most of the DLC so your mileage may vary).

Starting with the Space Marines, they're bland and severely underpowered.  No matter the difficulty they get outclassed by late game, and even by midgame I pretty much had to turtle to keep my units alive.  In the fluff and tabletop tactical marines are supposed to be the best in the universe at operating and surviving in small group operations, in the game if they aren't well supported they'll get torn apart by wandering neutrals.

The Guard (my favorite in the setting) are a bit better designed and more fun to play, but the limit of playing them in a 4x is just how limited the engine is at capturing the true scale of a war waged by the astra militarum.  Maybe it's ultimately a graphical limitation but I didn't find myself overly shocked or awed by this game's interpretation of the imperial guard.  Ultimately the numbers are just too limited.

There are also easy layups that the developers just kind of ignored, like including an army painter.  I guess it didn't make it because it would get in the way of the story that came up like once and I didn't care about anyway?  

TLDR, it's not a bad game, it's pretty enough and there are moments you see what it could be but in the end it's a bland and poorly balanced 4x that's missing 2 of the x's.",1635644853,1635644853,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Original Review:
If you enjoy the Warhammer 40k universe and you're a strategy gamer then this worth the buy.  I'm hopeful that they will continue to develop this title.

This is a tactical game with strategic elements.  This game does have a Civ feel to it but is simply not Civ.  The tactical choices and placement of your units in battle is the key to this game and what makes it so enjoyable.  This aspect is similar to Battle Worlds:  Kronos, yet more complex.  Research, resources, and exploration are relevant but the key to this game is unit placement and tactical choices.  There is a shallow level of planning and developing your city, but your main focus is on making units and using them.

If they made this game like Dawn of War Soulstice where you battle for worlds and gain units/advantages and build your empire it would probably be one of my all time favorite games.  I've played most of the Warhammer 40 strategy games and this is my favorite next to Soulstice.",1531700984,1634059498,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Game Premise [/h1]

Gladius is designed as a top down 4x strategy game. The four Xs meaning to Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate. The player will choose one side and essentially expand their chosen faction until all other factions have been exterminated. 

In the base game, you can select one of four factions with the other factions sold separately at a rather steep rate if I may add. In your forty dollars purchase you receive the Imperial Guard (the Starship troopers of the Universe), Orks (which are just space orcs,) Necrons (ancient Egyptian terminators), and the poster boys of the series, the Space Marines (imagine Armies of Hulk Hogan covered in 50 trucks worth of metal that fight space devils).

The game is set in the absurd Warhammer 40,000 Universe, a fictional setting of the distant ‘grimdark’ future made for a tabletop war game that gets semi canon rewrites on the occasion while being own by an uncaring company. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The Gameplay can be simply summarized in this gameplay cycle, Research, City Improvement, Unit Production, and Expansion. 
You will research technologies to gain either a bonus to resources, unlock certain abilities, or unlock new units and buildings to produce. City Improvement only serves to increase yields of resources to allow the player to increase the unit production which leads towards further expansion across the map. 

This gameplay style is more akin to a stripped-down version of Sid Meier’s Civilization series of games. Practically everything this game has Civilization has and then some. It is blatant that this game takes several queues from Civilization 5, everything from the hex grid of the map, the non-stackable military units, City improvements, Citizen growth and research. Gameplay can be summarized as simply a Civilization 5 with domination victory only enabled with Warhammer 40,000 painted over top. 

The game does give the strategy level some flavor with each faction by giving them a few unique gimmicks to give more variation between the factions other than the visual aspects of them. For example, the Imperial Guard has inexpensive infantry, long range artillery and abilities to increase resource yields for your cities. 

Though this does go a long way in helping to create more dynamic gameplay between the factions, I believe it needs a little more to become more strategic. The reason why is because it shares the same problem with civilization 5’s problem with combat, you just out produce and drown your enemy in a sea of combat units. 

If I can apply the same strategy to every faction, then there might be something wrong with the factions and how they are setup. 
One thing to add is that the maximum number of ai in the game is 15 with the player being the sixteenth player, so if you like to do a large-scale arena strategy game fight then this game does have that going for it.

[h1] Story [/h1]

Although story in this game is nonexistent, there is enough to explain why each faction is there in a cutscene the lasts at most a paragraph. In short, the chosen faction lands on the planet and must fight and conquer said planet.

Other than that, don’t expect anything story related or anything else that could bring new light to Warhammer 40,000. The game does give little optional quests to your faction which seems to showcase certain abilities but are not required to finish to complete your campaign. 

One little touch I honestly liked was that when you meet a faction in game for the first time you get a little introduction piece written in form to suit the faction. 

For example, if you were T’au and you meet the Chaos Space Marines, they will reference that they are fallen warriors and draw parallels to their own like Commander Farsight. I like that angle they had but its only used in these instances only once. I honestly wish there was more attention to detail like this spread throughout the rest of the game. 

[h1] Visual and Sound design [/h1]

There isn’t much to write about the visual and sound design as the visual design is strictly based of Games Workshop’s intellectual property and the sounds the accompany it feel rather bare bones and is only serviceable. Nothing seems to standout, noting seems to be impactful. For example, when you fire a shotgun, you should get a sense of power from the sound, while the artillery and the sci-fi sound in the game just seems a tad generic.

[h1] Conclusions [/h1]

When looking at the price to content on offer for $39.99 USD, you get the framework to play the game, 1 game mode, and four factions. This would be alright for an indie game but do understand that this game came out in 2018 and is 3 almost 4-year-old game. Games usually depreciate; thus, their barrier entry will be lowered. Not for this game as it a licensed product meaning that it will never drop in price unless it is on sale. This includes the downloadable content that is already overprice for what you get.

Let’s say you play the T’au on the Tabletop variant of Warhammer 40,000. Well, if you like to play them in the game you would first have to purchase the base game then the faction themselves for additional fifteen dollars. So just for those two things alone is fifty-five dollars. That is only with one piece of the downloadable content. To me that is not worth it. 

To add insult to injury if you do not purchase any Downloadable content, you will still them in your game but inaccessible which makes the game feel less whole for what you pay for. There is a reason why a good number of other games hides content you don’t own. You don’t want the end user feeling like their getting nickeled and dimed at every possible second. If that does happen it only devalues your game.

Back to price to content, why is each faction fifteen dollars. When I make a purchase, I base the downloadable content base off the original asking price for the game. going off that each faction should be around six dollars but when it starts asking around a third of price of the game for a single faction that is an instant no.

Better yet when it comes to downloadable content there is DLC for your DLC. Like let’s say you play another faction that is not in base game, you don’t get all units for that faction as their content packs locks away a unit or two behind a paywall. Units should never be sectioned off into separate content packs from their faction. That is scummy, almost Electronic Arts level of Scummy business practices.

Gameplay gets stale very fast after one or two games. Unless you want to play all the factions or have friends to play with, this game will mostly likely be played once and forgotten about. For what it does there more competent games that do it better and at a cheaper price. 

For 40$ you get a stripped-down overpriced version of Civilization, the only reason why you would get and play this is because its Warhammer related, other then that please look elsewhere to spend your money. 

I want to close this on the fact that they sell digital wallpapers for 2 dollars, something you get for free by other game developers and you can’t even leave a review on it. I’m surprised I don’t have to pay for patch notes.",1633119955,1633121002,False,1,0,0.523117542266845703,0,True,False,False

I always wanted to play the table top stuff in some ways because it did look fun before I learned you paint your own guys and how expensive they are if you want to really get into it and make multiple armies.  I cannot paint well as I a medical issue that has a side effect of a constantly shaking hand. I also saw how long the games took and I just do not have that kind of time.

So when I saw this game it kind of struck me as a table top game but on the computer.  So I got it and picked up most of the DLC on sale some came with my purchase of the initial game.  I have found this game  pretty fun I have only completed one whole game where I won.  Not going to lie I had a few rage quits.  I do not enjoy that they added these units that are not on any of the teams you start the game with just to keep the action up.  If there are enough AI opponents that is not a problem.  The graphics are good enough for me but they definitely are not state of the art. The quests are lacking as they are always the same quests if you play the same race over and over you will have the quests memorized quickly.  The UI is ok there are no breakthroughs but no glitches either.  

Over All I would give this game 4.5/5 if you are a fan of the 40K universe and understand why DLC is setup the way it is for this game.  

If you are not a 40k fan and think every unit and race should just be included with the game then probably 3/5  and maybe wait til a bundle sale.

This is a straight forward and well built combat strategy game, City building and management is streamlined to allow maximum unit production with minimal time. You do need to plan your cities well and use a fair bit of forethought but most of the game is big map unit tactics.

Some major pluses for me compared to similar games:

Useful transports; I've played countless strategy games that include troop transports and just don't need them, the maps are too small or the transports too clumsy/weak to be worth it. Here they are amazing and incredibly satisfying to use well. It made me oddly giddy to finally be moving troops around in transports not because a mission required it or I just wanted to force myself, but because they are useful and worth it.

Nothing becomes obsolete; While how often you use certain units may change you will likely use nearly everything you have right up to the very end game, cheap but reliable basic infantry are great always and later techs add additional abilities and better stats for early game units meaning to never have to worry about a game moving past the units you want to use. If you like it, you can always use it.

Dynamic story; This was a major surprise for me but the game gives you story boxes which provide objectives and rewards which adjust to the map and situation you are in. Not only are the stories very lore friendly, but they have the right attitude and were very engaging. I was doing my best to get the next objective not for the rewards but just to find out what happened next in the plot. Additional surprising bonus that you can win the game purely by finishing the story, no need to drag yourself through all the AI to get the ""official win"" which I loved.

Probably others I'm not thinking of but in short it's a well built game with a strong focus, it very clearly knew what it wanted to be going in and focused on mechanics over polish, which I always love.",1632178563,1632178563,True,7,0,0.566798627376556396,0,True,False,False

Literally.

This game is great; it looks amazing, it plays well, there's very few bugs (I've encountered none, but I've read enough patch notes to know they existed.) and there's very strong diversity between factions that makes every playthrough a genuine and unique experience. However, much like the tabletop aspect of the Warhammer 40k franchise, it's incredibly expensive to get everything. I got the game on a 3 digit named site that starts with a G for like $5, so there's that, but paying for all of the DLC whilst simultaneously paying full price for this game is a seriously blow to the wallet of anyone that isn't financially well off. You *can* play without the DLC, but you'll be unable to research and produce units that your enemies still can. Also, when you buy a faction DLC, you don't get all of the units for it. You'd still need to buy the 3 unit DLC's in order to fully flesh out your forces. Don't even get me started on Lord of Skulls; paying $3 just to have a single, neutral boss spawn randomly on the map? Really?

On a side note, if the host owns the DLC, nobody else in the game needs to. So that's kinda cool. Make a friend who's rich, I suppose.

So, yes, I do recommend it, but that's more because I would rate it a 6/10 and that -4 points is *solely* because of the pricing and paywalls. I do feel like this is fixable though, in its current state. So, a few potential solutions:
A. Make faction DLC's the whole faction, i.e. you don't need to buy the specialist pack just to get Dark Disciples.
B. Remove the ability for AI to research and produce units that are locked behind paywall DLC that you don't own.
C. Lower the price over time. Slitherine, you have made over 200 games over the past 20 years, you can't convince me that you *need* this game to stay at a total of $140 USD for all the content. This sort of behavior is why that particular 3-digit site is so popular, and why Call of Duty games staying at $60 is such a deplorable meme.",1631719814,1631719881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(Think Age of Wonders rather than Civilization.)  Units move slowly and are less effective at range (either because they're melee-only or get a substantial damage penalty at distance), so you need to put careful thought into terrain and positioning during battles.  Finishing off wounded units without over-extending is key.  Units get experience points when an enemy dies if they participated in the fight; get enough and they ""level up"", becoming slightly stronger.  ""Hero"" units (Librarians and such) get additional abilities.

Strategically it's a free-for-all.  If you overcommit to one front, another opponent might drop by and destroy you.  Running back to defend your cities is impractical on larger maps because most things can't move very quickly.

Cities generate and consume half a dozen different resources, which you can acquire from the wild or from buildings you construct.  The only path to victory is to destroy all enemy cities (you can't capture them).

Part of the challenge is navigating through the research tree.  There are 10 tiers of topics, each of which unlocks a unit or building, or improves an existing unit or building.  You need to research two topics at a given tier to unlock the next tier.  The trees for the different races are different, some in obvious ways (Necrons have things that Orks don't), some more arbitrary (Orks can unlock vehicles earlier than Space Marines).

The UI has a clean modern look.  There are mouse-hover tooltips for just about everything.  There are a few missing affordances though, like a way to get full details on a unit (such as sight range) without digging through the reference material.  Also, the reference UI lacks a search feature.

Overall: decent game for WH40K enthusiasts.

Here's why this makes sense: if you like this game or not, depends entirely on how you like your tactics/strategy games. Gladius often gets compared to grand titles like civilization, which enjoys a much larger budget and manpower behind it and hence offers more refined UI, nicer graphics and lots of bells and whistles.

This comparison is half right, half wrong. Because the focus of gladius is different. It's the warhammer 40k setting, so no diplomacy, duh. This is a total war game, meaning that anything that is not considered on your side from game start onwards, is an enemy. All you do in this game, and you might hate or love it, is recruit stuff and position it, hopefully smartly, on the map, ever slowly advancing cautiously in hopes of capturing more resource nodes which you oh so badly need to upgrade your settlements and/or build units and of course trying to push back the other human/AI players that creep up on you steadily.

This is NOT a grand strategy game like civilization with combat sprinkled in or like hearts of iron where you make decisions in the grand scheme of things. It's more like an attrition war game where strategic decisions melt into tactics and back again. If you overextend your superior forces and get sorrounded with no cover, you will not find victory today. You first have to carefully plan which ""theatres of war"" to reinforce and then how to smartly advance. Because the AI is luckily smart enough to punish any weak advance. 

If you like that kind of stuff, you'll love it. It's slow paced tactical combat where strategic decisions play a deciding role, mainly because you will need reinforcements and because you have to pick the right battles on the right front. If you're careless, you will absolutely get sandwiched between two factions who, if you had played it right, could have been battling each other with you left to pick off the survivors. You could battle a rival on no-mans land over nothing while you might have pushed into empty territory with precious resources.

The graphics are not great and the UI gets the job done but nothing more. You will not like this game if you're not looking for that special itch to be scratched. But if you got that certain itch, you will feel right at home. The AI is punishing and will not be a goofy very often. Whenever it is, you will be glad.

To loop back to the beginning: this is for you if you like hex-based tactics with overlapping strategy in the sense of research, settlement positioning, unit reinforcements.

The base game includes four of the factions with others available as DLC. The gameplay involves units moving over a hex-based battlefield and destroying each other in offensive movements, or defensive positioning. The player can build settlements to underpin an economy with an attendant tech tree. The tech tree has ten tiers, each with a selection of half a dozen units or abilities or buildings. Unlock any two to open the next tech tier.

Gladius is quite simple at heart with variety only coming in the range of units available to each faction and faction abilities lending some changes to optimal gameplay. Each faction has a story/mission mode - a set of linked kill/build quests leading to a victory if completed. The story sometimes spawns enemy units and so can conflict with a 'total annihilation' playthrough. It can be turned off, or left unfulfilled though.

The units are faithful representations of the tabletop, albeit with some minor inconsistencies. The factions can play a bit differently to each other and certain map settings can suit different factions better. There's a reasonable degree of customisation of map 'sliders' to change size, density, and distribution of resources. The game can take quite a while on, even medium, maps - but the flow is strong. Just one more turn is a real impulse.

It's an easy game to pick up and play. It's a bit clunky and the UI has one or two missing elements, but I've enjoyed my time with Gladius thus far and most turn-based wargamers will be happy playing it for a while until they've gone through their favourite factions.",1629388744,1629388744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A deserted biome, minimum wildlife and sprawling ruins have been thoroughly scanned before the landfall, so the operation began.

A dozen space marine squads, a team of scout bikers and a razorback led by a newly recruited commander Arelius have entered what looks like ancient imperial ruins. ""What in the Emperor’s name did Astra Militarum think when they established a desert colony?"" The commander cursed while making headway before his squad.

The place was quiet all the way through except for some small packs of howling kroot hounds here and there. Suddenly, abrupt repeating wheezing has broke the silence. Green streams of hot plasma overcharged the city horizon. A moment later a detailed report from the scouts has been communicated to Aurelius over the comms. ""Commander, several squads of necrons have been spotted on the outskirts, approximately 5 miles ahead. Their lord is leading the charge into what looks like...rival necrons...""

""Necrons fighting each other? Could they both be after the artifact too?"" The commander pondered for a second. ""Let's take this chance to get into positions, marines, before we...""

A fountain of blood in the peripheral vision of the Aurelius has cut his order short and the firing began on all sides. Green swirling rays crisscrossed with streams of bullet fire, righteous voices of marine sergeants gave regrouping orders and husks of necron metal plating started flying about. The fighting has begun…
[hr][/hr]

Thank you for reading my short story. You’ve probably realized that you just read a description of my first encounter with the Necrons in the game. It wasn’t the first or the last encounter that made my imagination bloom with countless short stories. I dare say if you allow yourself to be immersed in the game and look at exploring, expanding and tactical combat as elements of your own story, you’ll surely enjoy the game to the fullest.

But will I enjoy the game without DLC though, you might wander. In short, it’s [b]absolutely enjoyable[/b] without a single DLC and plays fine as a stand-alone product. Furthermore, to address two common criticisms of the game:
[olist]
    [*][i]“Part of your army is behind a pay wall so I don’t recommend this game.”[/i] Are you kidding me? You don’t recommend enjoying [b]four[/b] available factions with [b]decent variety for 100 of hours[/b]? That’s just silly. Besides, once you’ve thoroughly finished playing those factions, you can always grab the next faction DLC that interests you on [u]discount[/u] and go onto the next conquest. Don’t let yourself get into the entitled mindset of [i]“Since I bought the game, I’m supposed to receive everything that comes with it for free.”[/i] If you want to see a continued development and support of the game, and you enjoy the base game, then buying DLC makes all the sense in the world. Every DLC pack adds something worth your time. Play the base game (yes, it's enough), pick which factions you'd like to play as next and go from there. Anyway, it's cheaper than spending money on one night out.
    [*][i]“The game needs voices. Without them it’s meh.”[/i] The game is perfectly fine without voices. Oftentimes you need to move and order dozens of units on the battlefield and hearing those voice lines would be annoying. They would become [b]white noise[/b] pretty soon. If that doesn’t convince you, think about the game as a tabletop simulator of w40k. There aren’t any voice lines (not to mention special effects) coming out of those plastic models, are there? 
[/olist]
Treat yourself to one of the [b]best[/b] W40K games since the Dawn of War franchise. It’s not trying to be anything like Dawn of War, but it sure as hell gives it a run for its money as a [b]tabletop game[/b].

I thought it was going to be like Civilization and it seemed really basic.  Later I got some DLC as a part of a bundle and decided to try it again and got hooked.  I think you will enjoy it a lot more if you are expecting a more traditional hex based war game rather than a traditional 4X game like civ.  

Although it has some similarities to Civilization, it is really more like someone took an RTS war game and made it turn based.  You have research trees and resources on the map, but for the most part you don't need to build new cities very much.  Building a new city is more like adding an additional base in an RTS - you can get more resources and produce more units, and it also depends on the faction you are playing.  The research is almost all about improving your units and getting new units to produce.  It is a lot different than trying to paint the map with your borders like you often do in 4X games.

The game is all about combat and the factions all feel very different.  There also doesn't seem to be any randomness at all in the combat so it is entirely based on strategy - what units you use, what terrain they are in, what levels they have attained, and what abilities you use.  I think I would have preferred a little randomness in the damage values but I can see where some people will prefer it the way it is.

Obviously the game will be a lot better if you are interested in Warhammer 40K.  If you don't know anything about the tabletop I think the game may pull you into finding out more about the franchise.

As far as the DLC goes, it was initially one of the reasons I quit playing before I later came back and got hooked on the game.  It is irritating to see units you can't research in the research trees, and I would prefer to be able to play against any faction even if I don't have their DLC like how it works in Total War: Warhammer.

This game is so much better than it has any right to be. I can easily see myself racking up dozens of hours in Gladius. It's just such a comfortable game that I can pick up and play basically whenever. I play the game on its own but it's the kind of game that would probably pair nicely with a podcast or album in the background.

The only problem is the price. The game goes on sale for about $10 but the complete edition goes for around $60 due to the expansions having a smaller discount on sales than the base game. Don't pay full price for it all as it will end up costing you over $100 dollars which is almost never worth it for any game. And maybe consider what factions you really want before buying the whole package. It sucks that it's so expensive even on sale, and I wish that the expansions would just be discounted proportionately to the base game. 

Still, I love this game. It's not the best 40k experience but if we think of Dawn of War or Space Marine as being S tier, then I would probably put Gladius somewhere in the A tier. Maybe a bit lower down in A tier, but in A nonetheless.

If you like old school grognard-style hex based war games like Strategic Command, Panzer Corps/General, or anything from SSI in the 90s, you'll *love* this. The game is billed as a 4X and I think this is incorrect marketing. It's a perfect turn-based ""dudes on a map"" style board game. All the comparisons other reviewers are making to Civ or AoW slightly miss the mark. Yes, it's close to Age of Wonders or Endless Legend, but less RPG/story driven and much, much more mechanical.

Remember how in each scenario in Panzer Corps/General you started on a new map with the army you've been building for multiple campaign sessions? This is like that except you start with the same base each time and build that force based on whichever path you want to take. This is influenced by the random map generator, and which resources are around you. You have to balance your research and economy with your ability to produce units right there in the world. It basically condenses an entire campaign of Panzer Corps into a single session over an enormous map.

Game is designed after it's main game price tag, which is fine.
What it does not earn however, is the 50+ bucks in DLC that you need in order to make it a complete game.

Gameplay is good but shallow and repetitive already after 10 hours, it lacks that little extra bit of sparkle that could really motivate all these DLC. But the action is somewhat lackluster, the sound design is okay. There's no voice lines what so ever, nor a campaign. I would've hoped that with that design in mind, they could've done more with it.
It's scratched my Tau itch for a bit but I doubt it'll manage more than that. Lost potential, I feel. Though the DLC practice is really what brings this down, since you must buy the DLC to even be able to face these races as enemies. That's something that not even Creative Assembly does for Total War.

Addition: The game also includes ALL the DLC in it's achievements even if you don't own them, so you will not be getting a big part of them without buying the DLC. A bit of a dick move to me.",1624764692,1625534384,False,4,0,0.513382017612457275,0,True,False,False

1. The EA Way - This is 70% of a game with the other 30% released as DLC. This is blatant and clear by the fact that while playing the actual game, several options (units, research, settings) are greyed out and hovering over them pulls up a tooltip that tells you that you need a certain DLC for it to be available. Now, a DLC should be an addition to an already complete game, but when you deliberately put original game content as DLC, it's just bad practice and spitting in the face of your consumers.

2. Unbalanced - This game is not balanced, certain factions (specifically TAU and other DLC factions) are simply stronger than other factions. A good example would be a comparison between Tau and Necrons: Each faction has several ""hero"" units with active abilities that you can use. Each unit in the game also has 1 action point that is consumed upon attacking, using certain abilities or items etc. The actions performed by ALL Necron heroes all cost the action point, while actions performed by the Tau commanders simply don't (meaning you can use multiple actions AND attack with those units all at the same turn, it is ridiculously broken. 1-2 upgraded Tau heroes can take on an entire army if played correctly). So.... Yeah. That's just one example out of many, and I don't think it is coincidental that the DLC factions are stronger.

3. Obsolete, artificial and ""placeholder"" mechanics - This game implemented certain mechanics that do practically nothing and are promoted as gameplay features. A good example of this would be the ""Loyalty"" attribute if your cities (Which is similar to ""Happiness"", ""Approval"" or other mechanics from actual good games like Endless Legend. but bad). Your cities naturally expand and you cannot halt that progress (you wouldn't want to anyways), and as cities expand, their ""Loyalty"" attribute decreases, which lowers their resource and production output. The only way to counter this (unless you play a certain DLC faction) is to simply build a building that increases Loyalty. Multiple times. This is pretty stupid because you need to expand your city (and research a very specific tech) in order to build those buildings, which then lowers Loyalty again. This is some pretty stupid shit I tell you... Why is this even in the game? Imagine playing an RPG with an enemy that you can only kill with a specific weapon, but it's also the only enemy that drops said weapon - why the fuck fight it in the first place? Why is it in the game if it has no interaction with any other game mechanic? That's of course just 1 example (yet again).

So, a half-assed game with chunks of its core-content sold separately, unbalanced and simulates gameplay-depth by implementing obsolete and useless mechanics. This game is somewhat fun and has potential, would have worked for an early access title (if it included the DLC as actual parts of the base game, because it is) but someone said ""No, we go full EA on this one"" so now we get this crap.

Don't buy this game even on sale and even if you plan on getting the DLC. Just get Endless Legend instead - A good, balanced and FULL GAME made by devs that know what they're doing and actually has DLCs that are EXPLANSIONS OF THE BASE GAME AND NOT SLICED OUT CHUNKS OF IT.

Jesus christ fuck EA and fuck this game. Have a good night Y'all.",1625524939,1625524939,False,3,2,0.55322033166885376,0,True,False,False

4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) seemed like an odd genre for 40k, given the genre's focus on non-combat routes to victory. Surprise surprise, no non-combat routes to victory. That's fine, there's still other ways to feel genre-appropriate - asynchronous gameplay split by faction seems perfect for the setting (Imagine a horde of Tyranids consuming biomass and spreading over the map as compared to a Necron overlord focusing on awakening a single tomb). There are nods to this in faction restrictions and different resources, but honestly they don't feel like impactful differences, and the faction to faction gameplay is pretty same-y. 
The presence of neutral units and locations is another 4X mainstay that adds very little but manages to feel incredibly lore-breaking. Xenos and warp creatures from disparate parts of the galaxy will team up with wild imperial guard and Men of Iron around a Jokaero settlement - it feels cluttered and messy and having all of this on what is supposedly an imperial planet manages to make the universe of 40k feel very small to me. I was half expecting to see Squats appear given how many species got shoehorned into the neutrals. Gameplay-wise, they don't feel as impactful as they do in, say, Civ games, where defeating them can alter the course of your early-game through the acquisition of new research. Here they just... give XP and progress a static 'quest line', if you've researched technologies in the specific order the game wants you to.

Pleasantly surprised by this game and snap-bought all DLC on sale, something I wouldn't normally do after just 4 hours playtime at the time of this review. 

Ever play Civ only to find everything ends up a domination victory just because? (and let's not talk about the AI). Age of Wonders fan, but not digging the latest instalment for whatever reason? 

Well, this is probably going to be a much more fun and dynamic way to wage all-out war. Think of it as bit of Civ-lite, a bit of the latest AoW (with the tech + upgrades/loadouts/tactical procedures), even some slight Warlock vibes here thanks to unit diversity, surprises, and challenging terrain. 

I was fearing a shallow experience, but it doesn't feel the case. The game is nicely streamlined towards the thing that matters - pummelling everything while fighting to survive, also heavily tailoring unit choices and squad composition across a sprawling and hostile landscape. 

It is a refreshing break from the usual city-heavy 4x titles with rubbish combat. Expansion also feels nicely balanced - land-grab bonuses are not over the top, just enough to incentivise the player to fight for objectives. There is also too much going on to just quickly carve your way to an economically dominant position, land is too hostile for that (e.g. how AoW should have been IMO)",1625257825,1625257825,True,15,0,0.681994736194610596,0,True,False,False

What they've done is taken a list of the most generic 4X characteristics, created a game from it and applied a coat of 40k paint. If it wasn't 40k, *nobody* would play it. If you stripped the 40k IP it's just the most generic of generic genre clones.

I bought it for £8 and for that price I can't complain. Definitely isn't worth any more than that.
Mostly it's just uninspired. It's a 4x game stripped of economy, diplomacy, trade, intrigue, and everything else that makes a fleshed out title like civ 5 so compelling. They've not bothered to try and build on the genre at all, so once you've stripped everything away you're just left with constant combat that starts on turn 1 and continues until the end of the game. That's not as fun as it sounds, because there's not much to the combat. You have two to four types of resources depending on which faction you're playing, and even on a really big game on very hard difficulty you'll struggle to set up more than three or four cities before the game ends. City positioning is basically irrelevant. There's no networking, road systems, complementary positioning of cities, none of that. Just a global pool that cities all contribute to. Cities eventually become huge, and you'll always have so many tiles and building slots available that every city can be good at everything.

Visuals are pretty poor, frankly. The game tiles are ugly, drab, dark and there are only four or five types. Unit models have shoddy textures even on highest settings. There are only three kinds of tile blockers - forests, imperial ruins, and wire weed. There are five? six? special tiles you can find on the map that you can capture to get little bonuses. None of them are particularly important and there's no real reason to fight over them. In other 4x games, for example, there can be certain tiles that are so valuable they can be worth starting a war over. What I'm saying is that there's just not a lot going on across the map. Once you've seen one map, you've seen them all.

Music is generic meh. Sound effects are generic meh. e.g. I remember building a necron doomsday ark and looking forward to seeing the massive main gun fire... it's just a muted little *ploop* and a bit of green snot comes out the front of the gun. Gladius is a game that amazes in its ability to adequately tick a box with minimal effort.

Given that you don't do anything besides combat, that's pretty limited as well. Move with unit, shoot with unit. Nothing can move after shooting which limits your options a lot. Overwatch ends up aggroing a load of powerful neutral mobs when you want to just mind your own business which gets annoying.
Special abilities can be useful but aren't hugely interesting. Mostly I find myself using heal and repair actions and forgetting the rest.

The early game is reasonably fun when positioning and the odd heavier vehicle have smaller skirmishes, but the late game is really tedious - The quantity of units on the field becomes completely overwhelming. Almost all units have a range of 2-3 and move a similar distance, the result is the equivalent of mashing your toy tanks together when you were a kid. 

The DLC policy is really belligerent. Seeing locked units blocked out each time I open the tech tree doesn't make me want to buy the DLC, it just pisses me off. There are a few important choices that are particularly offensive - Chimaeras, landraiders, etc. You'll also need to buy many DLCs in order to get all the units. It's just a scummy way to do it.

The base game alone is worth the asking price, there's a ton of content, and the DLC's all add something for a reasonable price too. So on sale its a steal! Other reviews already mention details, so I won't bother. But easily the most fun I've had with a W40K game since Dawn of War. It captures the feel of 40k, and has plenty of lore and unique mechanics. 

If you enjoy turn based games/4X and like the 40k universe I can't see how you wouldn't enjoy this. 

If I had one complaint it'd be the music is very generic, and there's no voice acting (there is screams and death sounds). However there's a mod to remedy the later, and the music is good enough.

Some idiots are complaining in the forums about DLC practice. Whilst DLC you don't own is greyed out in the Research Tree, causing some confusion, none of it was 'cut' content, and all of it has come out later. This is a very small studio, and despite some peoples ignorance to this, people do actually need to make a living.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]HOW IT IS LIKE CIVILIZATION:[/b] City building and city management, research, the style of game map. You do build cities and construct various buildings in them that give you what you need, the population sizes of those cities grow over time (and matter quite a bit) and the cities control tiles which each have ""build slots"" for your buildings you construct.

[b]HOW IT DIFFERS FROM CIVILIZATION:[/b] Some key differences are that you get separate queues for building things (i.e. a standard building queue, an infantry building queue, a vehicle building queue) that allow you to build multiple items in parallel rather than being limited to one item at a time as in Civilization. Additionally, each faction is fully unique. Even though all factions have similar classes of units (i.e. anti-armor infantry or seige engine or anti-aircraft) they are all quite different whereas in Civ there are only a couple unique units per faction. This is a Warhammer 40K game: there is no victory but military victory. Don't let the Civ style map and gameplay elements fool you, there is no diplomatic or cultural victory, you are here to fight.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]HOW IT IS LIKE HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC:[/b] The map is littered with ""outposts"" of various types that provide resources to you each turn. These function like the mines in HOMM and controlling them is just as essential to victory. Like HOMM there are many neutral creatures on the map and earlier in a match you will spend most of your time fighting them for control of the outposts. Every faction is fully unique and has their own flavor and capabilities as well as challenges and weaknesses. You manage a suite of resources that are used to build structures and units.

[b]HOW IT DIFFERS FROM HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC:[/b] There are hero units in the game but you do not form armies around them as in HOMM. In fact, you don't form armies at all. Instead you control individual units in a more Civilization style map. The cities are not static items (i.e. are placed on the map and controlled by players) but rather can be founded during the course of the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

[b]PROS TO THE GAME[/b]
- It has all the 40K factions available and so has a massive amount of content
- The gameplay is quite fun and can be really challenging
- You can set up teams in a match which, for me, makes matches a lot more enjoyable and satisfies my ""What if the Orks teamed up with Chaos or the Aeldari teamed up with the Necrons"" curiousity
- The music is solid and really adds to the game
- The balance overall is quite good, each faction has a way to defeat the others but also has its ""soft underbelly"" that can be exploited
- The hero units are powerful but not the most powerful units in the game
- The DLC is worthwhile and (in my opinion) worth the cost
- You can turn on ""quests"" when playing as a faction which give in game tasks that have rewards, they are a great way to learn how to play as a faction when trying them for the first time

[b]CONS TO THE GAME[/b]
- There is a steep learning curve to figure it out
- Half of the factions are DLC, out of the box you get Orks, Astra Militarum, Space Marines, and Necrons
- The interface is basic and the language translations of text are not always so accurate which can lead to some confusion understanding how certain units or concepts work
- The campaign is mostly just a tutorial to help the player learn the game so the story, while there, isn't particularly immersive or compelling
- The above mentioned campaign is for one faction only (Space Marines) and is the only real ""tutorial"" in the game, so the player is left to learn the other factions on their own. There is help learning them faction through the ""quests"" mentioned in the pros section but understanding that turning on these quests in a quick match acts as a tutorial for the faction you chose is not intuitive

If you dig tactical combat, and unit positioning, this game is pretty good.
Strip the ""big picture"" gameplay from a civ6, put RTS like progression in there, and make it all about fighting, and you get Gladius.

It's pretty barebone, as it only features one quest line for each faction, no meta gameplay, no real campaign, etc. but it still is quite a lot of fun just playing a generated map with 6 AIs on it, and fighting your way to victory. 

On the other hand, it also really shines in 1v1 or 2v2 PvP, or coop vs AI.
Though you need to bring some time to complete a game in a multiplayer session.

I would say, given that this was made by a small team, it is acceptable quality, with very interesting units and combat mechanics.

Gladius is a war-game. 
The central focus of the game has more in common with most Real Time Strategy than Turn Based Strategy games, the purpose of cities is not to spread culture or house population but to create factories and barracks and harvest resources for the sole purpose of making war and destroying your opponent.

I've seen more than a few complaints about the game based on this misunderstanding so I thought I'd make that clear on the get-go.

In addition to this I've seen a few comments regarding the game feeling incomplete without the DLC. I can't really deny that the DLCs for this game add a fair amount, especially the faction DLCs but I think the base game is plenty worth it for the price of admission, on top of that the game and its DLCs regularly go on sale.
In all honestly I don't entirely understand this complaint and I can only assume that these people are not particularly familiar with the way that game development works, especially for strategy games and that for the game to be developed as much as it is, it needs the DLCs, effectively functioning as expansion content, not very disimillar to the likes of the many Dawn of War DLCs to fund continued support and development of the game.



Your primary goal regardless of faction is to control the map and the many resources and features dotting the surface of the titular planet Gladius Prime, the planet having been recently devastated by an enormous Ork Waaagh, leaving the hive cities of the world as nothing but smoldering ruins, closely followed by the sudden appearance of a terrible warp storm, cutting off the world from the rest of the galaxy.

You start each game with only the most basic unit production capacity, a unit to settle your first city and 2-3 of your most basic infantry. From there you need to research more advanced army units and production facilities and produce more units to secure the map and combat the diverse and deadly Fauna that emerged from the smouldering ruin of Gladius, something of a ""greatest hits"" collection of infamous monstrous wildlife in the 40K universe including Catachan Devils, Bastard-space-wasps-with-an-unpronouncable-name, feral kroot hounds, ambulls and the slightly contentious addition of the ancient Enslaver species who guard mysterious artifacts of the Old Ones that can give powerful boons to anyone who can control them.

Each faction has a quest chain with story dialogue and lore details, the completion of which results in victory. The quests can be disabled in the map generation menu if you want to just play a purely conquest driven game, but I recommend playing each faction's story at least once as they do a good job of representing the personality and nuances of each faction and are fairly good 40K stories in their own right.
Be cautious with the quests though as some parts of the quest chain will put you on a time limit to carry out a task or spawn armies and hostile bases that can create a sudden challenge, especially if you're already fighting an AI opponent.


The general design of units and faction mechanics takes a lot from the rules from the Tabletop, as well as a fair amount from the lore of the Warhammer 40K setting. Every faction has a range of units to deal with most situations while staying true to the core theme of the factions and each faction has a set of special Commander units or ""heroes"" to support and lead their armies.


I was going to give an overview of each faction but the review's wordcount is too restricted! So instead I'll just say:

As a fan of Warhammer 40K I think Gladius is absolutely fantastic, the way they capture each faction and the engaging wargame layout of unit design and combat has given me many dozens of hours of fun. If you're a fan of the likes of Dawn of War and have no problems with a turn based format I absolutely have to recommend it with glowing praise.

Updated: Ok I stand by this being one of the best 40k licensed games out there. I beyond love this and am still playing it over everything else in my library. 

The only negative I have for this game, is the DLC/Cost situation. If money is no object to you... well send me some cash please... but your over the only negative. 

The base game was good for what it was when it came out. Before new armies got added yeah it felt a little bare with the 4 factions but it was still enjoyable and unique. Adding in new armies, units, and fortifications has only added onto the amazing level of content in this game. 

Picking each DLC up as they are released since launch, it never really crept up on me how much Gladius cost. But now one of my biggest hesitations of recommending this to all my 40k loving friends is that I feel like they need to buy all unlockable content, and to do so the price is insane. Even bundled up and reduced, the price is still really high. 

Originally this was a cheap game that had 4 high quality factions but under $50.

Now its $100 or more.... but also I can't pick out individual DLC and say ""Avoid that its not worth it"", they all have good individual value. Stepping back and saying ""It'll be worth it to buy everything together"" though when I also know there are more $20 army DLCs on the way; it just makes me hesitate wanting to put my friends in that spot.",1595710346,1623796052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't have any means of diplomacy or trading which is a shame, but at the same time it wouldn't make much sense lore-wise to have for example Orks trading with Spice Marines, I guess.

AI is a bit predictable, but such is the case with most of these games. Higher difficulties just seem to give them resource advantages as opposed to making them play differently.

Graphics are good enough, VFX and SFX are overall decent as well. Sadly there's no voice acting, but fortunately this game has an [b]extremely[/b] well-made mod that fixes this which hires real voice actors. Support that mod if you can, it's absolutely great despite some volume normalization issues.

The factions are diverse enough to make them interesting, balance I'm not too sure about as I'm not a hardcore competitive player. They all feel satisfying in their own way. Aeldari for example are very strong, but also very squishy - kind of like glass cannons.

[h1]Issues[/h1]

Biggest issue of the game IMO is the DLC, a lot of the interesting technology is locked behind a paywall. For example the Chimera tank which is a vital unit for Astartes Militarum is of course locked behind a paywall and the game shoves this fact in your face very blatantly.

Now keep in mind it being a perfect blend with 40K means that it is really [b]war[/b] focused.

So there is not much at all in regards to diplomacy and the city management is not super basic, but it is not Civilization 6 levels of complex. 

You grab tiles and assign production or resource buildings to each ""slot"" which works great for 40K as you want to get to the fighting.

And [b]FIGHTING[/b] is really what you do!  This game has the that perfect constant war feeling as once you start it just never seems to stop. This game perfectly scratches that 40K itch for constant fighting and lots of unit variety. Even the native units to the planet Gladius are dangerous as hell.

I am a huge Imperial Guard fan and this game is the best game since Final Liberation in regards to artillery spamming. There is nothing more satisfying than blasting the hell out of enemies with massive ordinance fire and that is exactly what you can do. The Basilisks are perfectly implemented in this game having an extremely long reach which lets you provide fire support to multiple fronts.

This game even includes [b]RATLINGS[/b] which I thought were a no no from Games Workshop for a while, but they must have been redeemed as they were allowed in the game.

I will warn you that you may want to wait for a sale as there is a TON OF DLC. The DLC when not on sale can be quite expensive. So you may want to just pick and choose what races you want and what new units if that applies.

If you do get it however, you can expect a pretty fun time. 
Going into this, if you're looking for 40k Civ, this is about as close as you can get, but you might end up disappointed. I don't see this as a true 4x. There is no diplomacy, espionage or other such staple features of the genre (though you do get to research new units/buildings/techs). Instead what you get is effectively a turn based wargame with light 4x elements. In keeping with this, the combat is the best part of the game. 

There is plenty of unit and tech variety, everything is modeled nicely and there is a pleasing amount of depth to unit mechanics and statistics. A lot of the actual wargame seems to be emulated here, with detailed weapon stats, effects, buffs and synergies. The races also have their own unique play characteristics. Space Marines for instance can only have the one city, expanding through deployable fortresses that secure map locations and act as defense emplacements. Alongside your regular army, you have recruitable hero units that level, gain abilities, can use equipment, and synergize well with your other units. They are also highly capable in combat, and look cool. 

Long story short, you'll be doing a lot of fighting in this game, and the fighting is cool enough. Assets are great, graphically it's a good looking game, if nothing special, and the audio is similarly good.

Get it if you want a turn based strategy game that evokes 40k well and straddles the line between wargame and 4X without committing too hard to either side. But only on sale + DLC, unless you're feeling generous.",1623101901,1623101901,True,1,0,0.514025270938873291,0,True,False,False

Going into a little more detail:...

I kind of wish the world looked more lush, its just a little too lifeless. It needs brighter colours, some movement, some slightly more interesting designs, like Wire Weed which is boring in comparison to the carnivorous plants referred to in 40k.

Some of the finer details arent clear, like it seems city walls lower weapon range possibly and trees seem to slow movement but unless you go into the in game dictionary(?), which is nice that its there as it lets you look up details on absolutely everything, but Ive seen things like weapon range overlay done better such as in MegaMek where IIRC you can hover over a tile and it will tell you whats effecting your range, so its very clear and contextual.

Not sure how I feel about the DLC, its definitely over priced outside of the regular 40k sales, I picked up the complete collection for $80AUD down from $190AUD, which I dont regret but definitely am not thrilled about for quite an old game now, though its being supported and Im not shy about supporting games like Stellaris who do the same, but yeah its not good when a game can only justify its price when its on sale, kinda scummy.

One thing Stellaris does that it seems Gladius *doesnt* do however in regard to DLC is let other people use your DLC, in Gladius, AFAIK, you cant use a faction you dont own, but you can use the reinforcement packs, and how that works when its the host who doesnt have them IDK.

They should have not been so tight and just let people use the the factions the host has unlocked, so they can get a taste for them and give an easy gateway for people who dont want to spend so much money on a game their not sure of.

Factions do seem pretty unique from each other, and the game makes use of units you dont normally see, and they feel satisfying to use with big meaty abilities.

I kind of feel that with how they limit the number of cities you can have through loyalty penalties, it makes the end game drag on as it gives the AI or other players time to build up to the soft limit, turning the end game into a slow meat grinder.

Also the game ending super units being just a little too late to research, take a little too long to build, and be just a little too expensive to get them out there to clean up the game in a reasonable number of turns dont help as much as they should, but they are really fun.

As my first game against the other 7(?) factions, controlled by easier AI, went past 200 turns, I was ready for a new game and didnt want to chase down the last faction.

There seems to be some kind of weird balancing going on. I was enjoying playing as Tau until I ran into Guard who hit me REALLY hard, specifically ratlings, on TT theyre crap but they basically one shot any infantry in Gladius, and who knows if there are any other units balanced like that, and while its not *bad* because, again on TT ratlings are trash so its nice to see them useful here, it seems like they are just a tad too good, especially considering their stats in Gladius, I dont get how they can one shot Vespid in a forest...",1623040261,1623040261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the best in fact, and i have played them all (and i have played this game for hundrends of hours, don't let the steam number fool you). It is Warhammer 40K, so obviously there is no diplomacy or trade, and it really does not matter much. It is not like in games like Civilization diplomacy or trade are well made... We don't miss much. On the other hand, where this game shines is in combat, and the combat is awesome. It takes Civilization type of 1UPT combat and it enhances it greatly. Battle is very satisfying in this game and there are many tactics to try. Each faction plays significantly differently than the others (to the point that even resources you gather change), so you won't get bored trying different things. The AI is also quite competent in comparison to the competition. And i never felt it cheated much, unlike in other games. It is not the best AI in the world but it does the job much better than most other 4X games in single player, and that's a huge plus cause 4X games tend to take a lot of time (unless you play them in very fast mode) so for many people multiplayer is not an option. Also another important feature of the game is that the Linux port works well and runs on Vulkan, so if you are a Linux gamer you are going to like this.

Some negatives about the game, include the fact that DLCs add a significant cost if you want to enjoy the game fully. The base game contains only 4 factions and lacks a significant number of units from the unit packs. The complete game with all DLC included is a much, much better game than the base game, but that adds to the cost. So i recommend getting this game on a sale, like the current sale that lets you grab everything for 46 euros, at that price, it is a steal in my opinion. Another negative is that the vanilla game does not contain unit voices. There is a free and GREAT mod, ""Too many voices"", in steam workshop, that adds voices and really transforms the game, gives it much more character, and makes it feel even more immersive in the Warhammer 40k world, but it is kinda disappointing that we need a mod for that.

All in all, i wholeheartedly recommend this to people who are looking for a Civilization V/VI kind of game, but focused on combat instead of diplomacy/trade. And obviously to Warhammer 40K fans.",1622817432,1622817432,True,3,0,0.498588472604751587,0,True,False,False

It's of the same worth as a complaint about a lack of diplomacy in Tetris: it belies a fundamental misconception. It's Warhammer, not Friendhammer. ""There is only war"" is a fundamental aspect of the IP, and Gladius is wholly, beautifully in line with it.

Incredibly in-depth strategy. Look at my hours played. Every 50 hours or so, it's like I have an epiphany about how one of the 8 very unique factions play, and it changes the game. 40k tabletop has had 40 years to carve out crazy deep rules-based strategic niches for all of its factions, and Gladius honors this tradition masterfully. [b] Here are my faction epiphanies: [/b]

Chaos- if your streets aren't running with the blood of your own population and cultists, you're losing

Tau- your units, and their drones, have wild synergies you won't fully grasp for 100 hours of playtime (you are as dumb as me btw)

(A note about DLC: this game was made by 2 coders and a writer a few years ago. Every six months, there is a DLC, either a unit pack or a new faction. They include DLC units on the tech tree for some reason, and this makes people angry, thinking there's a paywall for units that weren't in the game until 2 years after release. Don't be fooled, it's a good and fair support cycle)

Necrons- all around good all the time. you will feel so incredibly OP, but in the way that every faction is incredibly OP, so not actually OP but feels like it in a very good way

Tyranids- you will command a massive swarm that eats the map for fuel. leave nothing but bedrock in your wake

Militarum- you will throw wave after wave of your own men at them. if they get sad, execute one and they'll feel better. clog the enemy up with bodies, hit them with artillery from the back, and an 11-gun tank from the middle

Space Marines- you have to play like marines. No wars of attrition, you drop a fortress from orbit right up their ass, follow it up with an invasion force of ""human"" tanks in the same turn, and make them look stupid for not having their army close enough to stop it.

Eldar- glass cannons on meth, better not mess up once. this faction will teach you grouping and the folly of overextending like no other

Orks- you need to fight or your economy crashes and your boyz suck. even if you lose, just FIGHT

Dark Eldar- please dear god give us dark eldar i will fund this myself to make this happen, i will slurp hog as long as you want just glug gug gurk from me for DAYs until its done just give me the chance (pic is me) and give me this faction i beg of you, devs",1614483948,1622616447,True,188,70,0.891694784164428711,2,True,False,False

So this game is a good, solid, game. It's a hard 7.5/10, I'd be tentative to give any more given concerns which have never really been resolved.
In terms  of visuals, the styling is mostly there, terrain is a little boiler plate, it can be hard to tell where hills are etc.
Gameplay is largely good, but after the mid-game it does become a bit of a slog to actually finish the game out, and you often know you will win, it's just a case of how many hours you are willing to put in to do so.
The game is sorely missing vocals- but there are excellent mods for this (which obviously can't be credited to the base game).

Slightly disappointing are the two options of victory conditions: Either finish your story, or dominate the map.

55 dollars Canadian for a bare boned game where you can only play custom matches. there is no story, no campaign. 2-3 games will make you realise how absolute trash this game is and you will find yourself wishing you got a refund before your max 3 hours were up. It absolutely baffles me that this bareboned badly designed game has so many positive ratings. I am forced to believe that the reason why this game has so many positive ratings is because steam was bribed to hide negative reviews.

PLAYING ON EASY MODE: enemies do x3 more damage than you. Can take x3 more hits than your same units and have x10 the economy to be able to sustain x10 bigger armies. So for 15 hp it takes 15 shots to kill them, your same troops die in 2 shots. If you do manage to get the enemies HP low, Instead of dying they run back, move other units forward and you never get to kill a single enemy troop. In FFA games, AI never EVER fight each other. They will move out of fights specifically to avoid fighting each other.

If you and an enemy AI are besides hostile NPCS, they will 100% always attack you instead of them.

The research tree is very linear and there is really only one way to play the game every single  time. 0 strategy involved.

I was a pro ranked player in SC, have played red alert, and many many other games similar to this so when i say this game is bad compared to the others i've played. It really is. Don't waste your money. This is the last time i'll be buying warhammer games.

Edited:

Heroes abilities randomly bug out to where you can't use them.
Enemies deal 12-17 damage vs your 1.5  damage. They move out of fog of war and instantly kill your units before you can do anything since AI plays first always.

Enemies will almost always heal 100% during combat, if they dont they instantly retreat back and push out other units to protect them. So you can never kill any of them even by swarming them. Line of sight does not apply to AI so they know how to move their troops around to avoid taking hits. However, if you run away they know exactly which path to follow to kill you.
Enemies don't seem to have supply caps and simply send infinite numbers on you.

You can only build one unit every 8 turns. so if the enemy kills even one of your units you have instantly lost the war of attrition. Building 2 armouries only builds one troop and doesn't fasten it's build time but the game doesn't tell you that. Once you build the initial 4 buildings you just have to spam the energy and requisition building which is pointless because you end up with thousands of energy and requisition points and cant use more than one unit's worth every 8 turns. (DUMB)

Enemies will mass 20-30 units right outside your line of sight. The moment you move a unit close ( you can't see them) all 30 of them somehow know you're there without line of sight, move up and insta kill you with their 12-17 damage (remember, my units only have 18 health and i only do 1-2 damage to their units). This is on NORMAL difficulty. Their infinite supply cap means they can have infinite armies of 20-40 units without any negative effects. this literally breaks the game. You will play until about round 80-100 at which point a massive army of 40 units instantly kills you and wins the game. BORING.

Calling an orbital Strike does 8 DAMAGE on an enemy unit that has 28 HP. An enemy just hit my unit for 18 damage. Which means the AI normal attack does x2 more damage than my special attacks. How does this make any sense?

My only regret with this game is not having played it sooner so that i could get a refund. Absolute TRASH game. WASTE of time. DO NOT BUY.",1619161900,1619753543,False,1,2,0.332331568002700806,4,True,False,False

Deep tactical combat with asymmetric forces provides multiple paths to victory and some great oh-#*$% moments.  Economic system is not burdensome so you can get on with the fight, it's just deep enough to keep you planning a few turns ahead.  Join up with friends for intense competitive matches or co-op.  Graphics and SFX are solid.  Tech trees are deceptively simple- just a few choices per tier for 10 tiers, but each of those choices has a huge impact on your forces and strategy.  Basically no bad units- just different tools for murderlating your enemies.  Even after 150 hours I'm still in love with this game.  

The difficulty curve is initially steep.  The ""campaigns"" are mostly some flavor text applied to simple objectives intended to teach you a bit about how to play.  It didn't really feel like it was as much instruction as I would have liked.  There are tons of forum posts, articles, and videos that help immensely in getting over the first wall.  Each faction has several ""rhythms"" for various strategies that once discovered and applied help immensely.  You will be challenged to adjust strategies on the fly as you make contact with the enemy, so there's never one ""right way"" to run an army.  Like most tactical/strategic games, understanding the enemy's capabilities and possible counters is extremely important.  With a bunch of factions and dozens of units you'll have plenty to think about while sitting through meetings at work.

DLC:  I get that it seems expensive, but each faction pack adds so much to the game.  Every one of them feels quite different from the others and opens up tons of new toys to play with.  I would recommend starting with the base game and adding a faction pack every month or so (unless you fall in love, then by all means- go for it all!).  Probably wouldn't hurt to pick up your favorite faction as part of the initial purchase if it isn't already included.  I don't have a recommended order for the DLC factions- they're all great!  That said, they feel more complex than base game factions, so maybe save playing them until you get a feel for things.

The Reinforcement, Fortification, and Assault packs are smaller, adding a handful of units to each faction.  While not strictly necessary, the content was well considered and open up new strategies to wreck face with.  If not getting them all at once, I would recommend this order: Reinforcements, Assault, Fortification.

Lord of Skulls adds, well, a Lord of Skulls to the game as an NPC enemy.  It's a bugger to kill and puts real pressure on whichever poor commander catches it's aggro.  This isn't really a necessary addition IMHO, but I promise you'll get some wild stories out of it (especially in multiplayer games).",1619293479,1619293479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every pro has a con associated with it.

I might have refunded it, but I gave it a second chance since I couldn't, and... it was better? maybe?

PRO:
-It's like Warhammer 40k Advance Wars. It's addictive, one-more-turn tactical combat on a hex grid, with a ton of totally different factions and a huge variety of distinct units.
CON:
-It thinks it's Civilization, so the maps are way bigger than they need to be and you have this lame settling/city growth minigame that really takes away from the fun part. Don't get me wrong, I play a ton of Civ 6 and all the Endless games. But this is just the lame version of that. Without getting into it, you aren't rewarded for high yields, you're punished for low ones, and it makes it feel awful.

PROS: 
-The art is beautiful. It's atmospheric, the models are great, the animations are impactful.
CONS:
-Because it's 40k, everything is washed out, and that makes things like tile hazards - ""lose all movement and lose half your health"" sorts of hazards - really fucking hard to see, and while there are some options that help with this (ex. ""cliff boundaries are shown by dotted lines"") they are turned off by default so you have to go looking for them.

PROS: 
-There's a dynamic system of abilities, strengths and weaknesses that makes every decision feel carefully considered and informed.
CONS:
-The tutorial is absolute garbage (imagine if Civ 5's tutorial started you with Venice, or Endless Legend's tutorial started you with the Broken Lords), and there is no actual way to learn the mechanics in the game itself without trial and error. As of this writing I still don't know if I'm SUPPOSED to spend all game every game constantly wrestling with loyalty problems, because the tooltips don't help at all. If I'm really supposed to have 4-5 loyalty buildings per city then that's bull, and if I'm not, then the game's still at fault because it never taught me how to deal with loyalty, and I have triiiied.

PROS:
-There are something like 8 totally unique asymmetrical factions that play completely differently.
CONS:
-Only 4 of the factions come with the game, the rest are $15 apiece on top of the game's regular price tag. Oh, and each faction has units and technologies that are themselves locked behind microtransactions.

So yeah, definitely not going to buy more DLC. I might come back to the game itself later. I might not. There are worse games on steam, but... there are also better ones.

[b] General Summary [/b]

If you're a fan of strategy games, with really decent lore backing it up, then Warhammer 40K Gladius could easily be a game for you. While there is some negatives, these are personal opinions. Generally, it's a positive experience, with plenty of depth and replayability.

Some key things:
-Hex based map
-The map is hostile
-Players and AI take turns
-Like the tabletop versions of Warhammer 40K, it can be unforgiving
-However, like the tabletop, the right strategy with luck, can make for a fun campaign
-I didn't touch the campaigns, choosing to go straight to skirmishes instead, will update if I play the campaigns.
-Expansions are damn expensive considering what you get, but that's the Warhammer 40K branding for ya.


[b] A More Detailed Analysis [/b]

So while I have no experience playing any race except for Astra Militarum (I think that's how it's spelled) I have a sneaking suspicion that only strategy changes, not the core mechanics. When you start a skirmish game, you will be viewing your starting units, which consist of some infantry units and your chosen race's settler/worker unit. Like many games of similar genres, you start by establishing your first city, and then using the given units to explore your surroundings. However, you need to strike a good balance between exploration and defence. Awfully quick, you will come across hostiles on Gladius (the planet the game takes place on, aka, the map) that either see you and your armies as food and/or target practice.

After settling your first city, you are presented with tips leading you to the various mechanics of the game, such as city management and research. The city management is different than others like Civ, in that each tile only has so much space for buildings, and can vary between no slots, all the way up to three slots. The normal everyday basics are there, like food and currency generation, research, and production buildings. This game has a decently increased variety of resources to manage, though. In addition to the normal food, currency and research that all empire management games have, this one also has others based on your race, including loyalty, ore, and others. Some are present in all races, but some are singular, such as the Space Marine's 'requisitions' - which actually replaces food and ore completely.

Each race does offer a different overall play style, such as the Space Marine's 'tall' play style allowing only one city and using a ton of orbital drops to fortify various resource and bonus nodes spread across the map, in addition to calling in reinforcing troops to bring the light of humanity to your enemies. One such orbital drop (on a turn based CD) is the ability to have a ""Fortress of Redemption"" drop anywhere you have vision on the map. I would always use this ability to secure resource nodes or at choke points.

There is zero diplomacy in this game, as it focuses purely on combat. Yes, there is a way to set up teams before skirmish games begin, but other than that, it's you versus everyone else. Including the map itself. The map features come from multiple areas, one such being that this world used to be an Imperium world. So, there are ruins all over the map that offer cover bonuses to infantry occupying them, and block vision past them. Usual water and forest and cliffs that exist in all other such similar games, and speaking of water - there is no navy units to worry about. The map also will have bonus resource nodes scattered about, which give a bonus to various resource production, such as extra influence or loyalty. Lastly, the map is teeming with NPC units, that are all hostile to everyone else. As turns pass, they gain strength, increasing in number and power. So, in addition to fighting enemy armies and cities, you will also be fighting the map.

Oh, and that the game is turn based, each unit has movement points, that are used up depending on the terrain they cross. Some units have inherent bonuses that cancel terrain effects, but all units cannot move again if they have already moved in the same turn, even if you know for a fact that the tile they moved to wasn't it's maximum distance. What I mean is that say a unit can move three spaces - once it's moved, even if it only moves one tile, that's it, you'll have to wait until your next turn to move it again.

There is an amazing amount of mechanics to this game, and a review wouldn't allow me to cover it all in detail, so I will bullet point the highlights.

[b] Racial Highlights [/b]

[u]Astra Militarum[/u]
-weak infantry, strong vehicles
-made for long range engagements, the Earthshaker Cannon be my bff.
-strong fortifications, but have to research to get to them
-easy to lose morale, but have units to counteract that
-can have multiple cities, albiet at a negative loyalty hit
-edicts generally help your cities

I found the Astra to be difficult to start depending on map generation, but from midgame onwards, to be a powerhouse, especially with their immense vehicles. 

[u]Space Marines[/u]
-stronger infantry than Astra (obvs, warplate and bolters, duh)
-most vehicles weaker until late game
-food and ore replaced by single resource 'requisitions'
-single city style, droppable fortifications
-orbital deployed 'skills' such as dropping marines or vehicles onto the map
-race wide 'chapter tactics' give temporary buffs

IMO, the Space Marines were okay, but the one city play style didn't really do it for me, though I did enjoy being able to pretty much slog it out with everything just with tactical marines.

[u]Orks[/u]
-units have an influence upkeep, while other races don't.
-units gain or lose bonuses based on influence, such as increased damage
-cities enjoy much higher growth rate, and HP regen for troops in them.
-a lot of their units gain bonus melee damage (adjacent tile when attacking)

I only played about an hour or so with Orks, so my experience is limited, so not much to say about them, other than they really didn't keep my interest much.

[u]Necrons[/u]
-our fav spooky bois
-can only place cities on special spots on the maps (Necron Tombs)
-considered non-organic by the game, you can spend resources to repair units in the field, rather than waiting for regen or bringing them back to your cities
-food is not needed, ore is used in most cases where food would be instead.

I found the Necrons to be decent, and I really love their lore. They are probably second favourite for me.

[b]Last Words[/b]

I don't own the other race expansions, so I cannot comment on those, but eventually I will update this to include summaries of them when I get around to buying those expansions. All in all, I found the game to be fun, with a decent learning curve and some frustrating npc armies. The game is focused around pure combat, with a touch of empire management, so there is no diplomacy mechanics here. If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k, I'd pick it up, though with the price of expansions, maybe wait until there's a package deal.",1617299033,1617299033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels more like a simplified 4x game, mainly because your goal is to exterminate everything but to me this is a good thing. Build your city and get resources to fuel your army, done. There's plenty of units to use and the 4 main factions (Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Orks, and Necrons) feel great. Now I didn't get the other faction DLC which I will discuss later. The combat feels very similar to games such as Civ5/6 but has enough of other things in it, such as abilities, that make it feel different and fun. Now the best thing is multiplayer. The game does a really good job of you and your friends working together for world domination or all of you killing each other in classic 40k style. There is no diplomacy but I find that playing with friends and having strategic discussions or making an alliance through simple talk to be good enough. Ok, so overall the game is pretty good and I recommend it; but now I'm gonna get into stuff that bugs me.

1. DLC.
 Ok. so DLC for this game is not worth the price. $15 for T'au, Tyranids, Chaos, or Eldar just seems too much. They even ask you to pay $5 each for the fortification, reinforcement and assault pack, and these only unlock units and buildings for the factions. Not cool if you ask me. Overall when it comes to DLC, get it on sale.

2. Voices.
 So the base game has no unit voices. The devs really should've added voices to the units. Instead, you only see chat dialogues above the unit's head and that's all. As a fan of DoW, this makes me sad, because that game had excellent voices. Luckily there's a voice mod you can get and it even works in multiplayer. It just should've been in the game from the start. 

These are just some things that bug me, I find that the whole DLC thing can be a turn off and it can get annoying but I think the game is good enough even without them.

You’ll need to explore a randomly generated map, create and upgrade cities, and train armies to fight other factions while managing a few types of resources.

[h1]The Good[/h1]

•	There are four playable factions in the original release – Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Necrons and Orks. Four more factions are available as DLCs (which I haven’t bought yet) – Tyranids, Chaos Marines, Tau and Craftworld Aeldari.

•	Each faction has their own unique infantry units, ground vehicles and aircraft, which have interesting visual designs.

•	Each faction has a different playing style, for example Space Marines can only build one city but it quickly grows to a massive size, Necron units can heal quicker to stay in the fight longer, while the Orks build up a Waaagh! meter as they attack enemies, which increases damage dealt.

•	You’ll also encounter the planet’s native wildlife, which will attack both the player and AI factions. Expect to see lots of strange looking creatures like giant wasps and scorpions, and floating squids who can mind control other units.

•	Construct various buildings within your cities to generate different resources, including minerals to produce units and buildings, research points to unlock more powerful units and tech upgrades, and every building needs energy to function. A city’s population determines how many buildings can be active, but high population causes disloyalty which reduces how much of the other resources are gathered.

•	Each tile has a bonus to production of specific resources based on the terrain type. You can choose which tiles to place each building on to maximize production, and you can spend influence points to acquire more tiles. Resources are managed on a faction level instead of each city being separate, which means that one city which specialises in production of a particular resource can compensate for another city having a shortage.

•	The biggest difference compared to Civilization is that Gladius has absolutely no diplomacy. No trading, no peace treaties. These factions hate each other, and in the 41st millennium there is only war.

•	Combat is turn based. Only one unit can occupy each tile, but ranged weapons can attack enemies a couple of tiles away, melee units can move several tiles each turn, and some units can fly or use jetpacks to get around water tiles or other obstacles, so I didn’t have many problems moving a large army around the map.

•	Each faction has a storyline to follow where you perform objectives such as research and build a certain unit or city upgrade, investigate a location on the map, kill a specific enemy, or survive a massive wave of enemies, eventually leading to winning the campaign. Victory can also be earned by simply eliminating all enemy factions.

•	The campaigns that I’ve won so far took around 7 hours each to complete on a medium size map.

•	I haven’t had any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate, and the controls work fine with mouse and keyboard.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

•	The combined value of all the DLCs is actually higher than the base game. I’ve played other strategy games (for example Total War) where new factions appear in the game as AI controlled opponents even if you don’t own the DLCs, which provides more variety of enemies to fight against, and you only have to buy them if you want to play as those factions. Sadly Gladius doesn’t work like that. If you don’t own the DLCs, you won’t see those factions at all.

•	Some units and upgrades for the original four factions are locked if you don’t own the Assault Pack and Fortification Pack DLCs, but they still appear on the tech tree in game, which is basically advertising the DLCs while you play.

The gameplay feels very basic: it's fun, but only for short bursts of time. Imagine Civ with the same hex-based gameplay, but focusing entirely on the combat without really fleshing out that aspect too much beyond what Civ already did (I guess adding unit abilities helped). Since combat is hex-based with weapon ranges and each hex represents a fairly large area, most combat involves relatively few units and is over quickly (more strategic than tactical: no real ebb-and-flow of battle or tactical retreats, and other than cities most units don't have a very high HP pool compared to the damage usually being dealt). For a game focused entirely on the combat aspect, the animations and scale of combat is fairly unimpressive. The city management is okay but pretty much boils down to ""keep your resources high enough to maintain your army by building specific resource buildings and expanding to new tiles occasionally, and build new production facilities once in a while"", and the research is exclusively for new unit types and abilities for those units.

Also I have two issues with the pricing model that make it feel exploitative and almost make this review a ""No"":
1. The base game feels overpriced. For $45 CAD you get 4 base factions, and the DLC is constantly thrown in your face (DLC factions are listed but greyed out in faction select, DLC research/units are visible in-game but greyed out with a ""buy the DLC"" tooltip, etc), and the fairly humdrum gameplay mentioned above.
2. The DLC is ridiculously expensive. $20 for each new faction, and $5 for each set of new research/units? It feels like stuff that should maybe cost another $20 CAD for all the DLC in total (so like $70-$80 total for the base game and all DLC), if not just given as free updates to the base game.",1616740707,1616740707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DLC additions like the Tyranids or Tau are fun and sufficiently different to keep the replayability high. I enjoy this game very much and recommend it, especially if it is on promotion. The units are well designed, keep the spirit and character of the original Warhammer games alive and different combinations of units are viable, not just one cookie cutter army. This is really good in my book.

There is one part though that I do not like at all, it is not really necessary and it can be switched off as well, but be wary of the 'quest' event lines for each faction. They are not so much a quest but a series of events triggered one after another, one series unique to each factions story.
The problem with this is that it feels extremely carelessly designed and is simply no fun at all. 

(Example Tyranids: after the first few events, each successive step simply results in a HUGE amount of random units spawning unpredictably which you have to eliminate/survive while holding your opponents at bay - to a point that you will have to have them beaten and locked up to even try. The penultimate 'quest' is to defend yourself and one single unit ( (!) which you can safely hide in a base if you must) while an absurd amount of units of all tiers uncluding top tier units spawn randomly at you which is by itself taxing if you have to own the whole map and defend multiple cities...
Crybaby, get good you say ? Fair enough up to this part. Then the last mission is: 'get the special unit to spot X in 10 turns. My complaint begins when the map is randomly circular with a lake in the middle and the slow unti cannot possibly make it to the target destination at the other side of the map - even if the map was empty (it is full of random spawn top tier units again just like the last 20 turns).

I finished for example the Ork 'quest - same deal random spawns from any old where. I lost my very first game as Imperial Guard because I didn't know these 'quests and a huge army simply spawned into  my newbie base. Fun ? If you are a masochist perhaps...

This is frustrating and seems like the developers didn't really try out their own quests. A sad letdown for an otherwise well done game in all the detail : (

TLDR: Gladius is fun and will last you a long time, just turn of the 'quests' and and play the maps without.",1615316852,1615316852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is very easy to pick up if you already know the 4X strategy tropes.  It does take a moment to understand that you are only outputting one unit of each building type per city per order.  You do not need to know Warhammer's premise and plot, I had not even played paper and pencil Warhammer back in the day let alone 40K.  And still I was fine.  One qualm is that you can have kind of traffic jams between your own and allied units.  Even if another unit is your own unit you cannot pass through another of your own units.  In the late game i had a stack of 6 or 7 ground units that were traversing an isthmus that were unable to clear to the other end of the bottle neck and fan out until like the turn-before-game-end.  So what that really means is, it is going to really pay super well to learn what the aerial transports do, which I was too stubborn to learn.  Another positive is being able to throttle back the opponent AI so it can't eat you alive, you can be tricky and stack your team with more factions than the other side and make them super skilled vs the other side, etc.  So like Galactic Civ 2 or 3 you can tailor how intense you want things to be or not.

After some trial and error sessions, I played as the Imperial Guard, and managed at length to beat back the space marines nearby.  I found Necrons farther out afterward and went after them.  It's all war of attrition, meat grinder stuff, he who has the most units wins.  I didn't find much opportunity to outplay my opponents any other way.  But as I'm fighting the Necrons across the map from my cities, suddenly a story event triggers and a massive army of robots appears at my city gates.  I rush my army back pell mell, but it was a frustrating thing to spring on me.  In all, I found this to be a very plodding game so far.  None of the scale of Civ 5, none of the flash of Dawn of War.  Killing enemies doesn't give a triumphant thrill so much as exhausted relief that they're finally dead.  It's a miss for me.

Update - I came back for the Tau and again for the Eldar.  I'm torn here.  The game's getting better as the races come adding in, but it's still a shallow game.  Progressing from guardians to the Wraithknight was pretty cool, and teeing off on chaos with an army of wraithknights and other heavy hitters was great fun, but I can't see a second playthrough of the single player.

Alright, 70 hours in and here's my review.
I bought Gladius on a sale, Complete Edition was 50 quid.
I played campaigns with the Adeptus Astrates, Astra Militarum, Chaos and Tau all on large world sizes and most flat-out medium difficulty, with some played on easy to get hold of the ropes. 
I'll start with this: [b] this is the closest you'll get to a digital version of the tabletop while it being it's own unique product on Steam. [/b]

Mechanics first, if you play the tabletop or Panzer General-like games, you'll get it immediately. Think of Gladius as a hybrid of tabletop-panzergeneral-civilisation. In short, it seems shallow at first but the moment you get into the nitty-gritty, it turns stupidly in-depth to that delightful point of almost-absurdity. Just like in the original, each faction acts differently from each other from stats to the 'feel'-- with all of them aligning to 40k.

Pace-wise, the game plays out very much like a standard tabletop with the system being mostly taken over by a Civ-inspired 'Resoruce-Food-Science' cycle. Due to each map being randomly generated, terrain-wise no game will be the same and each play through will force you to adapt different strategies. Only gripe I am seeing with the pace is the endgame, where if you do get to the final chapter of a faction's quest line, the difficulty [b] absolutely will [/b] jump from 10 to 100, making it truly (often overly) challenging.

Finally-- the atmosphere. 
I am not kidding when I write this-- [b] Gladius beautifully nails the grimdark atmosphere of the 41st millennium. [/b] 
From the colour palette to the gritty terrain, the atmosphere is front and foremost but most of all, [b] the music is unironically the best soundtrack to a video game based on the 40k universe I have yet heard-- on par with Mechanicus. [/b] 
The soundtrack combined with the game, art direction and HRTF sound option is something that needs to be experienced.

But yes, a glowing review for a game that some call overpriced due to the DLC policy, but in my eyes if set policy will build upon Gladius and add more mechanics, as well as factions-- I have absolutely no problem with paying a little each month for full-blown world updates.

Keep at it, Proxy Studios.

Highly recommend this if you are a fan of CiV, Fallen Enchantress (i prefer enchantress over CiV) or Advance wars.

Pros: all the races feel unique, have unique features and have plenty of units to use, each with its own advantage and disadvantages, many of the early game units still have uses late game!
maps are randomly generated so most maps you play on can be very hard to predict adding an element of unpredictable outcome.
you can influence how the map generates via settings pre-game and alter how much/little of specific features appear on the randomized map, want just arctic snow? max the slider and lower others, the choice is there.

cons: early game is incredibly sluggish especially for some races like space marines or orkz
from what i can tell only space marines seem to have the ability to place turrets (its part of how they gain resources faster) of any kind which means if you need to defend you better have access to a second army otherwise your base is very much easy to access while you attack, several players i'v played against turtle hard because of this.
orkz early game is a nightmare if the neutral enemies on your part of the map are umbral, these units are considered flying and ork early game has practically no ranged units meaning you WILL struggle if you cant rush buggies, this would be easily remedied by changing boyz into sluggas boyz and adding shoota boyz.

overall i'd give this a 7/10
great game, lots of fun, needs alittle more polish and tweaks before it becomes a 10/10 but the devs are on the right track.
if theres 2 things i would add to the game it would be the ability to build defensive turrets on every race (either a stationary unit or a base addon) and random events that can buff, debuff or spawn things to tip the scales of the battlefield (toggle option would make this even better!), stuff like a node has been spawned into the world to be claimed or a psychic storm is ravaging the region for 10 turns reducing movement and vision by 1, etc. events would make the matches more interesting

A$123.45 for the DLC combined even now, 2.5 years after release, and I really think this content belonged in the base game.  It's just not that interesting without it, and it's merely ""sort of good"" with it included.   I already own 80% of that, and the game feels a little incomplete to be honest.  

Good game, terrible value and exploitative sales disposition.  I'll still recommend it, but reluctantly.

-City building is VERY bare bones
-The sound of the gauss rifles is very stupid
-The movement sound of the Tomb Blades is an insanely annoying high pitch screeching sound that is VASTLY louder than the movement sound of any other unit in the game

-No tooltips or explanation for lots of mechanics
-Gameplay is very, VERY shallow, basically just commanding an amount of units that becomes more burdensome and less fun

-Units aren't customizable.
-You can choose your army but no subfactions so all armies look the same (just ""Space Marines"", can't be Space Wolves or Blood Angels. Just ""Tyranids"", can't be different hive fleets). 
-DLC is extremely exploitative. I mean.... just look at it.
-No campaign mode and the ""missions"" make the game very unfun late game.

If you don't find it challenging you can always customize the settings.  There are actually two ways to do this.  You can upgrade or downgrade the AI or you can adjust the leadership of every player.  Providing individual bonuses or minuses for each one.  

My only dislike is that the game only comes half complete.  Having to pay for each race beyond the a measly four Factions (out of 10 or so) Space Marines, Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard), Orks, and Necron.  Then they charge you for each other Faction and at this point only have four more ready at a egregious $15 a piece.  They have Chaos Marines, Tyranids,  Aeldari (Eldar), and T'au.  

To make matters worst they also have three add-on upgrades called Assault Pack, Reinforcement Pack, and Fortification Pack to add a few more features to the original game.  Fortunately, they are only charging $5 for each of these.  

In order to get the complete game you will need to spend $40 for the game then $60 for the additional Factions currently available and another $10 just for the additional units to the first four factions.  That is a whopping  $115 just to get what should have been the complete game straight from the start.  

Having made that complaint about cost, if you are a Warhammer fan you should be somewhat use to this nonsense.  After all they continue to change the game and try to charge you all over again to play the table top version at every new addition.

yes its clunky around the edges (which can be patched out) but the gameplay is there.  Every faction feels unique and plays differently and have their respective weaknesses & strengths. 
the main thing i would ask for is quality of life changes for the player. dont make me set every single inactive building to snooze one by one, have a ""snooze all inactive"" button.  i discovered a bug where if after you move a hero over a trading company and select shop before your game goes to another unit, the store will stay open. if you buy an item while still having the other unit selected the item will just pop out of existance. its kind of a bummer when your last lord needs to make haste to the battle and you end up wasting 200 influence for nothing.
all in all though, its terrific and i can see myself playing it for many more hours, given the devs stay on the course they have shown.

***EDIT 12/7/2018 EDIT***

After getting way more into the 40K lore, I'm left wondering who the hell Astra Militatium is... seems like a missed opportunity to add Tyranids, or Korn w/ his Chaos.  Or maybe theyre adding them via DLC which is kinda scummy but makes sense moneywise.  
Still a great game, if you love 40K & 4X games youll still love it.

***EDIT 4/6/2019 EDIT***

OK, recently purchased Tyranids and theyre damn good!  not $15 bucks good personally but im not gonna kill myself over it. the game is fun with or without them but im just happy theyre in the game xD

***EDIT 3/22/2020 EDIT***

So yeah, kinda predicted both the Tyranids and Chaos coming in on DLC.  Chaos is pretty good, but somewhat stale.  if youre not spamming out marines and giving them the Khorne buff then youre playing them wrong, basically.  Fun but kinda boring tbh.  Just a more complicated Space Marines, with the downside that your units can devolve into worthless fodder.  
I know the Tau is out rn, but im broke so ill reupdate when i get paid and get the Tau and tell ya'll how they are.

***EDIT 1/27/2021 EDIT***

Damn, i forgot i acquired Tau, and now Eldar.  Eldar is the strongest personally simply for the map wide scouting at the start.  you can easily choose a second base spot depending on defensive/offensive/strategic reasons.  Tau plays like an Astra Militarum but with more expendable units (the drones) until you get to your more glass-cannon units.  once you get a few lategame artillery units out you can essentially oneshot cities.",1533008113,1611778081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It took me roughly 80 h to complete one game with each faction. The tactical combat is interesting and reminds me of Rites of War from 1999.

The faction AI plays *fairly* well on Normal and Hard in terms of targeting weak units and withdrawing troops when they are damaged, but isn't that great at prioritizing and focusing fire on a single target or using hero abilities at the right time.

I wont speak about the game because... I still cant play. I bought it 3 days ago and spent something like 5 hours trying to launch it, without success. I have a Vulkan error at launch, even after restarting computer, resinstalling game, and C++ redistribuable, and Direct X, and framework. My computer is recent, my drivers are on date, and my computer launch normally 10 games, recent or not. (LoL, cyperunk, Xcom II, stellaris etc etc...)
So I guess it is more code problem from the game than my computer. 
And I hate error message that does not tell you where the problem is, exactly. 

I sent a message to Nvidia and on community on the game, without solution for now. 

Dont spend 30 € for nothing guys, keep your money. A game that cant ensure you to start is a bad game. 


EDIT : after huge help and 6 hours working to solve the vulkan problem, the game louanched. 
And I still dont recommand it. It took me 25 hours to make only 2 games. You dont have any history, the game is not strategic at all (again fighter are 10 times stronger than shooters, as always in theses universe), and the nature of the place you hae your fighter does not influence a lot the fight : if they have more lvl or if they have more hp, they win. It is just a race for the reserach that make you produce strongest unity. 

Even worse, producing a unity is very long, and game in multi players are rares to find... and even more rare to finish. I dont recommand it.. :(

Go back to dawn of war =)

So i Grabbed this up without much thought with the Tyranid DLC because i Love 40k i love 4X and it had Tyranids. now forget the fact that is is 4X or 40k and even the Tyranids.. this game is just an amazing turn-based strategy. Every faction plays completely different, not the 1,2 different units and a bonus like some other 4X different, but Completely. ever unit in every faction is unique to that faction, the buildings are unique the heroes powers... everything. some Factions even have different resources to deal with than other factions. 

But the real star is the combat. every unit is so nuanced that you never go on auto pilot and i don't recommend qued orders. Units can have multiple models each model has a weapon, and as a unit takes damage the models die which means you fire less weapons. Some units are monstrous or Vehicles and do no suffer that loss but instead are vulnerable to higher damage weapons. Finally almost all units are susceptible to Moral loss, which will weaken them overall. this whole package makes every move important, every decision critical. 

So to recap. I bought this for the Packaging, and i stayed for the game play

I love 40k and it was exciting to play a game that appeared similar to civ set in that universe. It's really cool to be able to use all these units and they generally do what you'd expect them to do if you're familiar with their tabletop counterparts.
The sounds are all great and it looks nice too. There are nice little quest objectives that pop up and the DLC races are well done too.
I've seen a lot of complaints about the DLC but I got it on a sale and I also got some of the DLC (T'au, reinforcements etc). The start of each game is really exciting as you get set up but the longer the game goes on the more I saw it's flaws.

It looks and feels like civ to start with and at first I played it that way. It wasn't long before I realised you couldn't waste a single turn as the enemy AI, even on easy, would ruthlessly and efficiently build up an enormous army from turn one, not missing a single chance to expand.
In the handful of games I've played, as soon as I encounter the enemy with a few scouts I find that they've got a second or even third city before I've even unlocked the unit that allows me to build new cities (which I was trying to unlock as fast as possible).
In Civ I remember having maybe, at max ten units in an army and I could attack cities with a reasonable chance of success. However, in this game the resources are set up in such a way that there isn't really a limit to how big our army can be if you get a few good resources from the start. The AI certainly seems to have no problem building 20 or 30 unit armies extremely quickly.
This leads to another problem. This is a hex based game and as such doesn't lend itself well to huge armies. The map quickly gets absolutely rammed full of units. I just quit a game in which myself and my ally started on one continent only to find that two allied ork armies were settled on the neighbouring continent which was joined by a narrow strip of land at the top of the map. It took probably about 60+ turns to grind my way across the narrow gap because they had built a city at the other end. They churned out units almost faster than my ally and I could throw ours into the killing ground. Eventually we managed to break through and I thought the fight could begin properly in a more open space. Nope, the narrow path continued south around the right hand of the map edge, forcing more of this grindy gameplay until we reached the one decent sized blob of land they had. This land was crammed with cities (about four managed to squeeze in) And literally every single hex had a unit on it (from what I saw from orbital scans).
Another 60 or so turns later and I'm throwing all my late game tech at it, with the help of my allies, but there's only so much you can do on a 2 hex bottleneck when the enemy city spits out a new unit for every one you kill.
I launched some more orbital scans at the back of their base - the bit we had no chance of ever seeing, just to see how far back the army stretched... and yep, another handful of gorkanauts (titan sized vehicles that take an army to bring down) and other high end infantry. Teleporting terminators and heores in just resulted in them dying instantly due to overwatch or, if they survived, dying next turn.
It probably took me longer than it should have for me to realise this was an unwinnable situation and I quit.",1610453269,1610453269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The store page's screenshots appear relatively ugly after using those two mods, though it's not a world of difference — the base graphics and sound, though slight, are a good effort considering the small size of the development studio. The devs seem to have wisely focused more attention on the less resource-intensive fiction that draws people into 40k to begin with. Lore text is packed into this wherever it could fit, and all of it so far has matched the quality of the best 40k books, in my opinion. Even the reasoning behind how all these different factions/species ended up fighting over the same planet is handled well enough to be believable.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2346314901
I completed the Space Marines' intro/tutorial mission and started a game as the Tyranids, a much more involved faction. Most mechanics other than the fundamental nature of combat are modified to fit the race, faithful to the fiction as far as practicality allows; the Tyranids aren't a StarCraft Zerg, but I doubt the design of a Civ clone (or this game's engine) would support such extremes. Designing with absolute dedication to an external ruleset regardless of your genre is part of what hindered Space Hulk: Deathwing, and the restraint against that impulse works here, however intentional it was.

It is indeed 40k Civ, except in that it's much more creative with the factions, and it lacks diplomacy, which I believe is generally considered the most useless mechanic Civ has to offer. This, to me, equates to a version of Civ that's tolerable — in which the world isn't a perpetually sunny realm of bouncy Pixar characters, and humanity isn't necessarily a fountain of hope and rainbows using war as a vehicle for utopic enlightenment, but instead there are mechs the size of small communities fighting self-modifying aliens made of guns and machetes for supremacy over a hell planet, because they're on a hell planet.

I think the only issues I've had have been screen tearing despite G-Sync (fixed by enabling some combination of G-Sync, V-sync & triple-buffering all at once) and the UI being badly enlarged and ugly at 4k (made tolerable by reducing the UI upscaling as much as I can stand). Other than that it's really fun, very 40k indeed, and while there are regular optional quests in-game that serve as combined tutorial/mission/story/reward vectors, there's no formal campaign, so the story and lore are accessible without having to sit through a separate mode of restrictive campaign missions.

The whole map is a battleground and skirmishes start early (keep your starting troops in a pack and be cautious as you explore to let overwatch work for you).  The factions are unique and will somewhat dictate your course of development which is a lot of fun to try and figure out.  There are a lot of options (basically units and buffs) to go about warring on your opponents and you'll have to pick and choose efficiently as you advance through the tech tree.  This allows for different playstyles within each faction as well, as you won't be taking every unit/buff that's available if you want to climb towards the upper tiers.  One match you focus on a particular infantry and then a couple monstrous units, the next your taking armory type units (tanks, skimmers, battlewagons of all sorts) to pair with an aerial attack.  Maybe one of each.  Maybe a few of that one unit the tech tree seems to be screaming buff me and see what I can do!!  So many options!!!

Bugs aside: The game is fun. It is slow and takes some figuring out just like any other 4x/TBS you've ever played. Like any 4x/TBS/RTS you've ever played, if you leave the AI alone too long, it will show up and steamroll you.

Most of the bad reviews are <10 hours of play time, sometimes <5! The reasons I am sticking with a ""do not recommend"" are:

1. The single player only exists in the form of a series of quests wedged into what other turn-based games call ""Single Scenario"" or ""Custom Game,"" and you will never finish it naturally during the course of a game. You can finish it if you drag out your AI match or continue to play after you've won, at which point the grey mobs spawned by the quests pose no threat whatsoever. I'm not real sure what the developer had in mind. Buy DLC probably.

2. The DLC is very typical of the current game market. If it isn't a marquee, triple AAA, mega release, you get the game out whenever you can, however you can, and fix it, add content to it, add features to it as you go. It's just the reality of non-triple A games today. If you aren't ok with this release model, Gladius DLC will have that ""this all should have come with the base game"" feeling to it. I don't like it personally, but I do sympathize with developers. I do keep an eye on DLC that tries to eventually nudge me up to that $60 price tag.

3. A crash that requires a reinstall bug is almost unforgivable. Fortunately for Gladius, I really love 40k. If you don't love 40k to death, and you also have 200 unplayed games in your library and another 200 on your wishlist, this kind of thing is a death sentence.

= Intro =

As a quick glance at my gaming history and library will attest, I'm a 40k nut. Played Dawn of War to absolute death, and had my eye on this for some time now. Picked it up on discount during the Christmas sale.

= Gameplay: 9/10 =

The core game is very similar to older Heroes of Might and Magic games, without the battle layer. You know the drill - build cities, build units, research tech and head out into the world to capture resources, fight monsters, obtain items and of course kill the other factions that are trying to do the same thing. There are 4 available at the start, with more unlockable via DLC.

Combat and movement are both entirely turn based, with units pew pewing at each other until one dies. It all has a nice tabletop feel to it.

At first glance, it seems that only a skirmish mode is available, with you adding enemies, adjusting difficulty and world layout - but there is an overarching quest to each faction, with objectives popping up as you go. It all works decently, and I've already had two late nights thanks to it.

It all works rather well. Tech trees are deep, there are plenty of units for each side - most with a nicely defined role. Combat feels punchy and heroes/high tier units are appropriately powerful. There is something of a lack in static defense option, but this does encourage mobility and tactical thinking - at least until three AI factions decide to attack you at the same time from different directions.

My only gripes here are that some of the quest objectives are incredibly vague. 'Destroy the enemy camp'. Which enemy, what camp? And where? Others will cause a sudden invasion of enemy units, which can force you to reload a save if it comes at a bad time.

Beyond this, the neutral 'wildlife' enemies can be brutally punishing. It's one thing to run into a dangerous pack while exploring - and quite another having a bunch of lethally powerful umbra enemies nearly on top of your base, long before you have the tools to handle them or a bunch of enslavers wander in and steal half your army, before vanishing off over the horizon with them. Fortunately, these can be turned down.

The biggest problem though is the AI. Even after 2 years of tweaks, it's...very dumb. Far too cautious and prone to retreating from battles and scattering all over the map while you destroy their base. The difficulty settings only give them cheats. I'd love to see varied AI patterns, such as aggressive, turtle, rusher etc.

= Graphics & Audio: 6/10 =

This is not a handsome game. Even maxed out, unit models are simple, textures are blurry and effects subdued. This feels like something from a decade ago. 

Scaling is also wonky, seemingly taking it's cue from the tabletop version. There are mods to help with both these issues, fortunately enough.

Audio is...there, I guess. SFX are beefy, but there is almost no unit sounds or banter, which makes everything feel a little hollow. The music is similarly forgettable. 

= Performance and Stability: 7/10 =

It all runs well - a stable 60fps maxed out at 4k, and the AI doesn't take years to make it's moves.

However, I have encountered a fairly frequent issue with infinite loading screens on launch.

= Value: 4/10 =

And here is where things start falling apart. The sheer amount of DLC is pretty nutty - especially when you take a look at it and realize that about half is stuff that *really* should have just been added in via a patch, gratis. The nickel-and-diming is quite something.

Beyond this, the price for new factions is extremely high - almost the price of the base game. 

While, yes, it's fun and all, it does stick in my craw. This is not a AAA game by any means, but if you want the 'complete' experience, you'll be looking at $100 or more. Unacceptable. I'm not sure whether this is a GW thing or simply the devs being a little greedy though - Warhammer games in general all seem to have this issue.

= Overall =

+ Fun tabletop-esque RTS game
+ Always happy to see more 40k RTS games
+ Well realized and varied factions
+ Any game with both Tyrannid and Necrons can't be all bad
+ Excellent, highly tactical gameplay
+ Deep tech and research tree

- Gob-smackingly expensive and petty DLC
- Poor, often tediously cautious AI
- Umbras and enslavers can be anti-fun depending on spawns
- Plenty of confusing, badly written descriptions and poorly explained mechanics
- Some stability issues
- Heroes can be somewhat overpowered with the right items

At the end of the day, despite it's flaws, Gladius is a solid game overall - if a little unpolished. Despite the extortionate DLC practices and mediocre AI, I will likely get my money's worth. That said, I'd strongly recommend waiting for a good sale.",1609198103,1609198733,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The hex map, unique tiles, unique ""relics"" (they're called something different in the game), and turned based gameplay come from Civ. The resource nodes, unique race abilities, heroes, and lack of true builder units/only having combat units is similar to Halo Wars. The native wildlife makes the game like a game of Civ with barbarians turned up a lot. The tech tree is pretty basic and the resource management isn't too overwhelming. One thing that the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining is that tiles acquired near cities can be acquire more to contain more building slots and the same building can be built in a slot next to the same building. Each tile can get (as far as I know) 3 building slots and if one of those buildings is a unit producing building it gets its own queue.

I think for that price it's worth a shot and if you find yourself wanting more there are more factions available in DLC.

The game mechanics aren't all well balanced or well thought out, for example the sacrificial rites of Chaos seem a bit underpowered due to being linked with specific buildings instead of total output, and the whole pops consume food, buildings consume energy, city tiles consume influence, buildings need building slots, cities and pops consume loyalty - scheme easily leads to VERY bad cities that grow and grow but aren't able to really increase their output due to all the different upkeeps if you don't get good bonuses for your tiles, and on the other hand if you do manage to get good features and terrain for specialized cities, your surplus production will be INSANELY good, making for very unbalanced starts.

All the different factions have their own unique feels and the only one I personally have found distasteful to play are the TAU. The soundtrack is simply amazing and all in all this is a very fresh take on the Civilization dominated 4X genre. Games are also faster because cities can't be captured, just destroyed and everyone is fighting all the time.

All in all, a very solid game that breathes fresh air on the genre. Thumbs up.",1608420527,1608420527,True,16,1,0.586675584316253662,0,True,False,False

Yes there is tabletop but as any veteren tabletopper knows, it doesn't exactly scratch the itch.

I know, this is a turn-based strategy game that is nothing like the table top game. Fair enough. But: I consider this game to be the best 40K-adaptation on the market right now (2020.) The factions are fluffy and flavorful and there is enough upkeep and strategy involved to make a 200-turn game feel like a worthy investment of your time.

It's not the tabletop but my tabletop group and I have been playing this as an alternative to our 40K meet-ups and I am here to tell you that it scratches the 40K itch. I am especially fond of Orks and Eldar in this game. I hope they continue to add DLC, I would like to see Adeptus Mechanicus and Drukhari as factions.

The cons all have to do with a busy/messy UI which make the game more fatiguing then it has to be. Sanctus Reach should have been used as the template since for all intents it covers a similar combat situation  with the simple addition of city building. Now for the actual combat simulation, victory requires the construction of force with all  leader types supported by healers along with a balanced infantry/vehicle combat group around them  so the leaders can spend all their action on combat with the healers repairing them. Upgrades for the leaders by the end game period  make them virtually invincible so long as they are in supporting range of each other. By the same token enemy leaders should only be challenged by your leaders with fire support from heavy weapons units. The final point is to pull damaged units back and heal them because the rank upgrades are vital as latter in the game if you don't have those units the opposing troops will simply outclass yours even if you have more units but they are four or five levels lower in grade.

There's no diplomacy, for in the Grimdark future of the 41st Millennium, there is only war. You can still start the game with other AI or players on the same team as you, though.

Sure you can add more factions, races, campaigns in a DLC, but crippling the balance of a strategy game is like kicking the crutches from under a kid with Polio. Shameful.

Also, when I used Astra, I noticed something ridiculously illogical that led to a lot of frustration and me writing my first review on a video game. The MATH is WRONG! For example: 3 basilisks on the same terrain right next to each other with the same exact modifiers firing on one enemy unit (@ lets say 3.0 dmg each per turn) you'd expect to take out the enemy unit with 8 hp. So the first shot was 3.0, great. Then the second shot dropped to 2.5. The third to 1.5--leaving the enemy unit standing with 1hp (7dmg taken). At which point the smart AI moves that unit back for some healing. Rinse and repeat. In a turn-based strategy game, illogical math is unspeakable. What should've been a quick game went from fighting 1 to 2 to all three AIs on 3 simultaneous fronts for 150 turns will drive anyone crazy.

Unfortunately, they also stripped out alot of it's customization. Take for example your basic Tactical Space Marine squad. It's depicted in game as a 5 man combat squad, which isn't much of an issue for me personally. The issue is that they're all using bolters. You have no options to swap in a plasmagun or  flamer. There isn't even an option to add a Veteran Sergeant. They then lose alot of that which really makes Tactical Marines great; their flexibility. 

It's not an issue that's restricted to the SM. All factions are reduced to basically basic armaments. The Imperial Guard heavy weapon team, for example, is restricted solely to missile launchers, which is ironic because they keep making comments about fixing bayonets to their non-existant lascannons.

Putting aside that however, Gladius is a great game. The factions are different enough gameplay wise that you can tell they understand the source material. Amassing half dozen Basilisks to shatter the sky is amazing fun, as is tearing through Imperial Guard squads with Hormagaunt squads. 

The sound design is passable, though you quickly get tired of bolter sounds when Orks are fighting the Space Marines. A lot of the sound effects seem to me to be variations on each other. The music is pretty plain; it does its job, but isn't very memorable. 

The environments are varied enough to be interesting without repetitive, though I do notice the map generator enjoys covering parts of the map with nothing but water.

To sum it up, if you're looking for a 40K Warhammer 4X with a similar level of customization to say Dawn of War, give this a hard-pass.

If you consider yourself a wargamer there is no way you would not like this game because that's what it is. 

Every faction plays differently and you have to figure that out, terrain is a factor, research is a factor, where you put your cities, what you build, how fast you build it, what you research, the troops you create, how many of a certain type, how you use them, how experienced they become.

The map generator is fine. Although I feel the map could have a bit more pop to it. It is often hard to see a cliff, slope, or coastal area you can access water with skimmers from. Map features are generally dull and forgettable. In civ you look at a hex and you know what it provides, in this you see a hex and wonder what the hell it even does, does it have trees? Wire weed? Looks like wire weed, but its not, but i swear it was there.

The AI is dumb. It's not the dumbest there is, but I wouldn't call it super smart either. Orks and Guard tend to do better as AI, for whatever reason. After finishing many games I will browse the map and those races always have hordes of units compared to the other races still alive. Tyranid AI is laughable, they just make 1 or 2 units and they are support units, I forget the names, the floaty brain stem looking things. Generally the AI is gonna just make lots of cities and swarm units. As soon as you happen upon them, be ready for a relentless assault from them. But if you survive that, they roll over (as any player likely would too). The neutral units think you are ghosts until you get too close or engage them, then they come after you as well.

Races feel different, this is very good. Much like Total War: Warhammer II each race has its own thing going on. So unlike Civ, you don't feel so ""samey"" with any faction. Units are also varied. While each races has archetype units like basic infantry, AT, fast attack, melee, transport, cavalry, support, air, and so on... they do have some differences and it feels fine. The downside of the units is that none of them feel so special on the field. You get some giant tank finally and think, ""yea this is so cool!"" and then you start cranking them out and the novelty wears off. The models are good enough but like the terrain, they don't stand out much from each other.

Winning... Option 1, kill everyone else. Just continue to shove units at the AI until they cave in. Isolate units and eliminate them, don't let the same happen to you. Move deliberately, use the terrain to your advantage. This is where the game shines. When armies meet on the field, and through clever use of terrain and unit advantages and weaknesses, someone is the victor. Whether that is the defense holding the line and repelling the aggressor, or routing the defense to destroy the city, it is gratifying. But after your 2nd opponent, its likely you just overrun anything else and such thought isn't necessary.

Alternately, you can win by completing a series of objectives. This is often easier and faster than murdering everyone. It does have some risk though. If you are off fighting some quest units and an AI or player happens upon you or your city, you are gonna have a bad time. Fighting multiple strong enemies on multiple fronts is a bad idea.

Multiplayer is actually more enjoyable than comp stomping BECAUSE you get more of those awesome field battles. Players are far more likely to offer interesting battles than the AI. I have not played much in MP but those moments are rewarding.

Overall, if you like Warhammer 40k it's a good addition. If you like Civ type games but hate being annoyed by ""diplomacy"" and such pesky things, this is better for you. (if you didnt make teams at start of game, there are no alliances allowed)

I would rate the game maybe a 7 currently. If things popped more on screen +1 (the game could use more personality)-- if AI was more clever +1 -- more units and map features +1",1606532969,1606532969,True,19,0,0.703134059906005859,0,True,False,False

When i first got this game i really love it! Easily compared to a Civ style game, but in true 40K style, there is only war. Right from the start, war is the focus of the game and thats not a bad thing. it plays very well into the lore and style of the races in the game now. Fight, keep fighting and win, once you stall out your going to lose, in classic Civ style. Where i start to have issues was around my 15-20 hour mark. The game is very unpolished. Some units simply shoot their guns, they dont aim them. Cities look bland and flavorless with no change to what the tiles u build look. Grey unites or ones with no faction are very powerful and often become a big wall from early game to mid game. that is an issue because they seem to focus on you and your units, ignoring most of the AI's. 
A very common issue that comes up mid game goes a bit like this: explore the map to find places to turn u into outposts. move unites towards any corner, discover 1-2 grey units. move in to fight, find 3-5 more. Fighting a huge army of many different grey factions, AI moves up from the other side of the map. Forced to fight on two fronts because, so it seems, every grey unit moved to this corner and the AI waited for u to fight them to attack. Question: why dont grey faction units fight each other? many of them are beasts or a part of a true faction in 40k, so why can a Tau unit and a mecha unit stand side by side with no isseu? 
What does the moral bar even do? Units dont flee or break even, sure they lose ... DPS? but thats not really an issue for most armies, and even less of an issue for Orks. where moral and fighting are the main focus of the army. 10 unites with low (red) moral? no prob, keep fighting, losing some more boiz wont matter at all. 
Maps can be very VERY big, but you cant really do much to increas the mobility of your army. sure some forces have teleporting or drop poding very late game, but no roads or landing areas to speed up cross map movement? oookkkkk....... 

The game tries to be true to lore and give us some great 40k flair but falls short with unfinished parts and no true depth. some of my ideas to solve these issues are the fallowing: 
Changing the colors of the army (to a few set ones) should change the model of the unites to match. as in Blue for ultramarines, green for Dark angles, red for blood angles Ext. this can work with every faction, and making 4 or so colors the ones that change the models across all factions would not be hard, as reskins are not intensive. In the same vein, adding in 3 or so models for each building type would be amazing for city looks and feel. with that Id love to add in more sense of population. there are no ""ants"" moving around your city, the cities are just tiles with buildings. very plain and very boring. 
Outpost buildings should unlock upgrades and have a building upgrade. So far u just get a % bonus from owning them, walk in and profit. forcing some early research to unlock with the control of key tiles would make multiplayer fights more interesting and force people (including myself) to be more mobile. At the same time these ""outposts"" have no upgrade or building u can build on them, not even inside a city. There should be 2 levels of them, the first lvl can be put up anywhere and the second only unlocks if u control the tile inside a city. Think farm and then factory. 
Lastly the tool tips dont really help you understand what most units do. for instance the thunderfire cannon for SM is described as a ""long range arty support unit"" but it has 2 other abilities that can be game changing and only fans of 40k would know about before hand. the techmarine with the cannon can heal tanks and clear terrain, just like all tech adepts. 

I like this game a lot, but the deeper i get the more unpolished and un finished this game feels. The DLC just compounds this. They force you to buy unites that fix some issues.

I don't know why I hesitated in buying Gladius when it first came out. I like strategy games and I like 40k and if you do too you'll enjoy Gladius - Relics of War. The game developers clearly play Warhammer and love the game - it shows in every bit of unit dialogue, description, upgrade and ability. Gladius is definitely a game for people who've played Warhammer or at least are familiar with the setting. Everything in Gladius refers back to the tabletop, specifically 7th edition.

The game is very combat heavy, there's some exploration, yes, but after the first third of the game you know just about where everything is. There's no trade or diplomacy, so it's all-out warfare for much of the game. The combat is rich and strategic though, there are more modifiers from terrain and units have more abilities than in a game like Civ, so in my opinion the constant battle doesn't become stale.

Just like the tabletop, you will succeed in Gladius when you execute a well-crafted plan: maneuvering your units into cover, avoiding line of sight obstructions and activating your units' abilities at just the right time to maximize damage and minimize casualties. Gladius is a great representation of the tabletop game - it's kind of an endurance match in that respect.

The game is 4X strategy game with a focus on combat rather than city building. A good comparison would be a hex war game like Panzer General but with a touch of Civilization since there is still simplified city building and resource/production management. Game play is fast and fluid.

There is a surprising amount of depth and complexity here for what at first may seem like a simple game, specifically concerning tactics for combat and positioning. In many ways, it reminds me of the excellent Battle Isle games that alas I am old enough to remember. Advance Wars being a more contemporary comparison. 

It's by no means an easy game, especially at the start due to a variety of tough neutral enemies that can ruin your day if you are too zealous with your exploration. The AI seems competent enough having played on normal difficulty. My first game was a 2v2v2 on a large map playing as Space Marines with an Imperial Guard AI ally. Unfortunately they were quickly wiped out by tag-teaming Necrons, leaving me to face overwhelming odds alone. Still, for the short duration my ally was alive I do recall it assisting my units with buffs. In the end, it actually became a fun survival scenario where I managed to fend off the Necron's assaults, seemingly saved by the Orks, who took out one of the Necrons while I focused the other. After working out an effective army composition I snow-balled and ended up winning the game decisively. Once you figure out which units are powerful and how to position them in terrain, you can really tear through the enemy. All in all, a very fun first game that lasted about 15 hours.

As a WH40k fan, with all the additional DLC content for the extra races, there's many hours of replayability here. Hopefully they will continue to add more content for a good while.",1606012805,1606013872,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game has several issues.
1. No campaign/story mode. Sure you can enable ""Quests"", but those are just actions you'll complete anyway. As well, there's several dozen options to a customize game, but it doesn't get past the feeling of repetitiveness. 
2. Biggest issue. The constant unending reminder to ""purchase the DLC"". You easily miss out on half the units  in the game without purchasing multiple DLC. The research tree is horribly filled in with greyed out sections that read ""purchase DLC to research [blank]"". I'm all for purchasing extra content that has added to a good base game, but it's clear that the Devs planned to build the game around missing core content. This includes: units (for all factions), factions themselves, game play settings, and so on.
3. Last issue is the gameplay itself. Every faction ""feels"" the same. As in, I didn't notice a difference really between playing as a Space Marine or playing as a Necron. I mean, I guess the Necrons have a healing factor and can make multiple bases? However, all the units have identical counterparts that fight/move/act exactly the same (unless you pay for all the DLC I guess). 

Honestly, for a good 4x strategy game go to Endless Legend. This game would have been much cooler with multi-unit combat like Endless Legend does.

While it lacks the depth of other 4X strategy games, Gladius: Relics of War is a streamlined 4X game in the Warhammer 40K setting. Like other reviews, I would recommend this to Warhammer 40K fans but if you're looking for a deep 4X game, you can do better elsewhere.

The developer has released additional races since the base races of the initial game.

Current List of Races below
- Necrons
- Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard)
- Space Marines
- Orks
- Chaos Space Marines (DLC; Chaos Undivided)
- Tyranids (DLC)
- Tau (DLC)
- Eldar (DLC)

The game itself has alot of gameplay customization (AI difficulty, Team Setup, In-Game Items, Neutral Spawn rates, etc) to appeal to veterans of the genres and newcomers.
For newcomers, would recommend setting up a game with an AI Partner as you slowly learn the commands, game mechanisms.

I have bought in on sale pricing but would gladly pay it in full pricing based on the content available.

[b]Warhammer Fan Perspective[/b]

The game itself is focused on the city expansion and war mechanisms of the 4X game type. The races play mostly true to the individual races found in the Warhammer universe but there is no in-depth splits within them. (i.e. Space Marines = Generic Space Marines; Chaos Space Marines = Chaos Undivided; Tyranids = No specific brood; Eldar = No specific Craftworld or Faction)

This may put off most fans but i think the approach plays just fine but may disappoint players who wish to play specific chapters or regiments in each races (Khrone/Slaanesh; Dark Templars/Salamanders: Catachan/Cadia, etc)

Most of the unit types (Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Armor, Heavy Armor, etc) are included in the mix but do not expect 100% representation of all available unit types in this game. You may find details of the unit types available on YouTube videos where others have covered extensively what's available and what's not.

The developers have been pushing out additional races and hopefully we can see races such as Dark Eldar or Sisters of Battle being added in as future content.

[b]4X Fan Perspective[/b]

There is no diplomacy or trading mechanic that is found in other 4X games. You may form teams during the initial game setup but that's pretty much it.

That said I have enjoyed dabbling in some strategy here and there such as Age of Empires (which I'm terrible at), Homeworld (which I'm even worse at), and Xcom (which I can actually do alright in). Turn-based stuff is more my speed as I tend to get stressed about the ticking clock of a RTS.

With that out of the way, I gained an interest in this particular game because I greatly enjoy the lore of the 40k universe and decided to pick it up on sale to see if I'd enjoy it. I regret nothing. Proxy Studios really put their best foot forward here and it shows. This is a super fun game for anyone who enjoys Warhammer 40k or turn-based 4x strategy. I personally can't speak to how it compares to others in the genre with my extremely limited experience, but as a relative newcomer, I found this very engaging and easy to get into. The factions are lovingly designed and diverse enough to offer unique playstyles, though I wouldn't say its terribly difficult to learn a different faction like it was for me in AOE. I bought the Tyranids DLC because I enjoy the lore and even own a couple models, namely a Trygon and a Flyrant. The game lists them as being hard to learn and while I can see their strategies as being a be obtuse and counter-intuitive to some, knowing their lore really helped me excel early on with them. 

There seems to be a lot going into the DLC for this game and that makes me extremely excited to the point I'll probably buy the factions I don't even want to play just for more content to enjoy and to support these developers.

Map sizes are tiny compared to any of the Civilization games, and terrain scripting is a joke compared to any of the Civilization games.

It's also more narrative focused. There are objectives to complete and you win the game if you finish them all.

Lets also pretend things like Civ, Age of Wonders, Endless, Stellaris and about five others don't exist to over hype this minimal game.

And you think it's going to be fun cause 40k, but low damage output, minimal looting, neutrals that only attack players not AI and AI with a budget that must be using a black credit card to purchase and the fact it's just down right a boring game leaves you feeling like why am I playing this except for 40k?  

Which there is no answer, because without 40k you wouldn't play this game.  It's still good but too many do it better and this does it at times so wrong.

Honestly, it feels a lot like a Civilization 5 mod that somebody stripped all the diplomacy/trade stuff out of, ramped up the neutral ""barbarians"" a bit, and then added Warhammer 40,000 factions to.  It's not particularly deep, but the factions all try to feel a little different (yet faithful to the source material) and there's a storyline that will likely appeal to 40k fans.

Pricing of the game is bad, but if you wait for a sale it becomes much more reasonable.  And while there's glitches and oversights, it does seem like the devs are still polishing and fixing the game (it's currently perfectly playable, but there's some ""weird math"" here and there still in terms of balance and such).

Graphics are decent enough, but the OST is really good. The units don't have enough unique sounds though (without mods) and it runs smooth, and quick in multiplayer. All told it's a fun game solo and with friends. The devs have been updating it and balancing it pretty regularly which is a big plus here.

The DLCs are shockingly overpriced which is a bit of a turn off I have to admit. 7/10 game to me. Fun and worth a play especially if it's on sale.

Wouldn't be bad except that those are, in general, the only relevant techs in the tech tree. Out of the first 10 ""techs"" I researched, only 2 felt (marginally) relevant.

I don't mind dropping money for quality product, or spending hundreds on well crafted DLC, and I wouldn't mind spending $75 to ""complete"" the game by buying the DLC at $15 a pop if the game were actually well-crafted, but the game doesn't even come close to justifying $5 DLC, much less $15 DLC.

In my opinion

2) the base game isn't even complete.

Let me tell you how a necron game works:

Load the game. Build necrons warriors. Build ore generation to support your necron warriors. Right click the enemy base.

Anything you do other than those 4 points is immaterial to the game. 

An example of something that does not work (and doesn't matter): The Necron Lord has a ""damage"" ability that ""adds additional melee attacks"" to its normal melee attack. It doesn't add extra attacks. It performs a single attack that does less damage than his normal attack. Moreover, it TELLS you it's only performing a single attack in the damage preview tooltip that goes along with every damage action. It's quite unbelievable really, because it means the devs aren't even reading their own tooltips.

To be clear, we aren't talking about a ""bug"" per se: it's working as programmed. It just wasn't finished or tested. Which is my main takeaway from the dozen hours I wasted trying to like this game.

TL;DR: I love warhammer and wanted to enjoy this game, but it's conceptually uninspired, technically derivative, and feels unfinished. You will constantly have the feeling that you are playing with placeholder units, using placeholder abilities, researching generic technologies, and trying to achieve a goal as it was written on some whiteboard in a game developer's office.

This one should have been left on the whiteboard. Save your money.

A challenge to produce a 4X grid style game, where one expects diplomacy to be a part or those games; such as Sid Meier's Civilisation titles. But Gladius has executed all those heretics that propose peace. And so we have a 4X game that demands you  have a domination victory, or not victory at all! But this game has ways around that. Teams can be pre-set before each game and so they are locked to that team. How you set up those team and factions is up to you? Want to put all the other AI on a single team as Tyrannids and you play as the Astra Millitarum? Go for it! It is a very flexible way to set up scenarios the team and faction manager. The Planet setting can also be tweaked to your liking. (#NoMoreVolcanicTiles) You can set up mass open fields or constricted passage ways by lowering land mass and increasing river amount. Although with the latest Assault pack, there are now ways around land choke points beyond aircraft and hover vehicles.

So far, I've really enjoyed the game. It's a turn-based combat game with a CIV feel. Each faction seems to have unique styles and economic systems. 

The gist of the game:
Build and expand your dominion with your war economy and armies
Your economy is usually a mix of 3-5 resources (think the usual Gold, Manpower, Population, Science, etc., just with different names)
Research to the units and technology you need for that game
Carefully move and activate your units for best outcomes
Race to get all the quests done / kill everything

I thought this would be a simple CIV clone, but Gladius is sort of its own thing. In no particular order, here are some features I like:
- There's no trading, political intrigue, culture, etc. You are building your base(s) like in an RTS and going on the warpath. (Note: I do love games with trading, political intrigue, etc., but Gladius is not trying to be one of those games).
- Buffs and debuffs for units. I love that my Hive Tyrant can buff areas of allied units before I assault the enemy. Or my Hive Tyrant can use a psychic scream to debuff the enemy before I assault. Then my Tyranid Prime can debuff the armor of an enemy unit for 3 turns before I begin my assault. Then my Tervigon can spawn Termagants before I assault. Then... You get the picture.
- Whether they be economic or combat-related, most map tiles have strategic advantages and disadvantages.
- Unique tiles that give special bonuses
- Factions are varied and play differently from each other.
- Hero units in with leveling and choosing what abilities to buff.
- Hero units that can purchase power items at trade posts (usually a couple iof trade posts per map).

Things I'd like to see:
- More factions and units.
- Better AI. As it stands, the AI is sort of your standard fare for these types of games. 
- More items from the shop
- More unique tiles
- More and varied quests
- Team quests
- Scenario game types (Do _ within _ turns, Do _ with _ units, etc.)

 All in all, this game could be any theme. I like 40k a lot, so that does color my perspective on Gladius. If you're unsure, pick it up on a sale. No need for any of the DLCs tbh, unless you really love that specific faction. In my case, I picked up Tyranids for half off. I also bought the small DLCs for extra units. These aren't needed at all though. If you like 40k (in general), I still say wait for a sale... though $40 is still fair.",1598023175,1598023306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the copius amount of early-stage DLC and the higher price tag on it is a MASSIVE turn-off. The game only has 4 races in the base game and if you want to unlock a single additional race, you have to pay 1/3 the price of the original game for it.

Only negative about this game is that there is no voice acting but a lot of people mentioned that at release but they'll probably include voice acting when Gladius 2 comes out as this game has been very successful.

This game, along with Firaxis's Alpha Centauri (from 20 years ago), are not only spiritual successors, but both carve out their own unique niches within what is often cited as the ""perfect"" recipe for addictive, cerebral gameplay.

I was a bit worried about the ""mostly positive"" reviews but really I should have been looking at the recent ""very positive"" reviews. The game launched a couple of years ago and it has been in continuous development. For instance there is a review complaining about being too much wildlife. However I found the wildlife adequate and in fact there is even an option to control it. I can only guess that review was done before the option was implemented.

The game has been compared as a cross between warhammer and civilization, but in fact its biggest influence is by far endless legends with a touch of alpha centauri (those weeds are suspiciously purple coloured)

There is a nice base building and research mechanics but Gladius is more combat oriented. You can see some wargames influence as expected of a slitherine published game. There are a ton of units each offering different tactical options. There are assault units with melee attacks, defense units that work better immobile, fast units to recon and finish off or tanky behemoths with massive firepower. Then add a soft/hard target type system on top and three types of heroes with interesting skills. The fact that most units have skills make combat quite interesting. In none other 4x game I have seen terrain having such a big influence. Cover is a massive factor and it will create death zones between cover clusters where two armies are pinned down. If anything I find the combat a bit predictable in the end as there is lots of it and a bit chaotic as it is a battle royale (although you can set up teams if you wish)

The AI is quite capable. It will attack your weakest units and retreat wounded units. There are 7 difficulty levels and I have only beat level 6 (ultra hard) save scumming. This difficulty is already relentless. Turtling is a good tactic in higher levels but you can't do too much of it. There are tactical points in the map that give you extra bonuses, both in resources and combat stats, and they really add up specially in the beginning or with the space marines. You also need space to found good cities in good spots and having diverse biomes in your cities is great.

I got all the DLCs on offer and they are totally worth it that way (a bit too expensive at full price though). All the factions are unique and balanced. All the units from the lore appear and it is absolutely fantastic to start popping baneblades or terminators.

In other words, while this has the trappings of a Civ game, these limitations mean that the game plays more like a traditional tactical turn-based strategy game.  If you're expecting a game that you can just pop a beer and chill out and play a relaxing trade/diplomacy gambit to build up your type of empire, you're going to be disappointed. 

These changes basically mean that the AI plays a bit more aggressively even at the easiest level than you'd expect from a typical 4X game. The game promotes expansion due to this dynamic, so you'll find that the end result of this is that you're going to be in conflict more frequently and the computer can simply just overwhelm you with numbers until you get the hang of the game's rhythm. 

But once you do, there's enough complexity here to make the various tactical considerations you need to make decently complex. After a few lost games you should start to get used to the tactical differences in gameplay and get better at deciding when to expand and when to hold and build up forces. 

The good news is also that the unit design combined with the overwatch mechanic allow for complex baiting tactics. You can really set up (or get caught in) some nasty ambushes.  Expect to get your clock cleaned from time to time.

This is a nicely done game by a small team. At a sale price and bundled it's worth a look. In essence, it's a 4x where the focus is really on throwing out units and fighting everyone else on the map. Which has its moments of fun. 

Graphically, this is well done although the lack of an army painter is a shame. As is the absence of voices for units although there are mods which try to rectify that. 

Really though, it's a perfectly adequate game at what it does. Just can't shake the feeling that if it wasn't 40k then I'd probably have refunded after the first hour. It's a bit *too* focused on one thing without really having the combat system to carry it off.

This is a war game. Yes it has resources to eXploit, a randomly generated map to be eXplored, a goodly amount of eXpansion depending on your race... but most importantly of all the game is about brutally eXterminating the heretic, purging the xenos scum and consigning the demon spawn of Chaos back to the warp infested hell pit it crawled out of! You want diplomacy? Only at the end of a bolt gun. This is 40K and there will be no compromise.

This means that Gladius Prime (the titular planet on which this game is set) is a theatre for all out war. Don't come looking for more, but if war is what you want? This is a tightly developed, deep and rewarding experience. 

In the base game you select from four different factions: Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines), Orks, Necrons and the Imperial Guard (Or Astra Militarum if you really must...). Each faction is asymmetric right down to the way resources are exploited. Units, tech trees and city management all stir together into a different play experience for each faction, and all must be approached on their own merits. More than this it's clear that the game's publisher, Proxy Studios, have a whole lot of love for Warhammer 40K lore in that it so brilliantly models exactly what I'd expect out of the races on offer:

Space Marines are an army of elite super soldiers few in number, which is represented by them only having access to one city (Space Venice if it was a city cathedral bristling with ordnance). However! Research the ability to orbitally drop them from said city to any point on the map in your line of sight? The Xenos will be trembling before your righteous onslaught. The Necrons are regenerating terminators that never stop coming. The Orks are football louts out for a bit of Waaagh! and fungally induced genocide, and the Imperial Guardsman are Zapp Brannigan's very own army of squishy meat shields marching into the jaws of the oncoming Killbot 5000s... better hope they have some heavy artillery backing them up.

While I haven't explored them too much, it seems like the DLC factions are even more varied in their offerings. Hoping for some Eldar-themed aspect warrior action in the future!

As for the combat? Meaty. You will need to research counters, come up with your own synergies and army compositions, but most importantly of all troop positioning and coordination is crucial. There are many natural choke points upon the world of Gladius, and many obstructions to line of sight and movement. It's all too possible to advance your troops through the forest, only to walk straight into a gun line on the other side waiting in overwatch. Troops can level up, and certain Hero units can learn unique skills and equip wargear to further bolster your strategy. This is all aided by a fluid unit selection and movement system that cuts out a lot of common turn based tedium, decent animations and sound design (no acting however, but read the note at the end of this review), and AI that is capable of presenting a meaningful challenge.


Don't drop into the experience looking for a story or campaign. While each race has its own individual quest lines (which can be toggled) and Gladius is steeped in lore, a single game of Gladius is basically a skirmish. It's a vastly customisable skirmish which can be enjoyed solo, with friends or against... but what you see is what you get. Fortunately the world of Gladius throws a lot of hostility at the player from the off, and that coupled with how different each faction is to play (and play against) provides for a good amount of variety.

Finally each game, unless you're playing on a huge map, can be completed in a handful of hours. This definitely lends itself to repeat plays or satisfying multiplayer fun over an afternoon, without any loss of that ""civ progression"" feeling that can make a game like this so satisfying.

One last thing - If you do pick this game up, wend your way workshop-wards and pick up the excellent voice pack mod put together by the community. It's just not the same without a Marine exclaiming ""Faith is Our Shield!"" or the IG Commisar griping at the troops under his command with the threat of a well placed bullet.

While I thought it was a great foundation for a game, I also found it lackluster in several regards, most importantly, the lack of voice acting, the poor faction balance, and the generally lackluster visuals, at least when compared to a game like Civ. 

I am now playing this game with all the DLCS, and the mods Gladius+, Too Many Voices, and enhanced start options installed. These mods are must haves for me, with Gladius+ making the visuals better, Too Many Voices providing excellent voice acting for almost every faction, and enhanced start options letting me tailor my game more to the way I like it, and improving the balance of the difficulty levels (in vanilla, I think hard is too easy, and very hard is impossible. This mod adds a hard+ option that is quite well balanced. 

The DLC factions are great. I think Tyranids and Tau both do a phenomenal job of capturing what makes those factions unique, and they are very fun to play. 

As it stands currently, this game is the best new 40k game I've found. Most of each faction's most iconic units are represented, the game is extremely fun, the developers have done a good and consistent job of supporting the game, and the modding community is excellent and growing fast.

So, what makes this game so fun? Well, the only other tile based 4X game I play is Civ. Compared to Civ, the city building in this game is extremely simple, although balancing the economy well is actually surprisingly tricky. Many times I've overextended, crashed my economy, and gone out of control. You have to be very careful and specific about your economic choices and not rush into anything you're not ready for. The way you get resources from special tiles that go back and forth in control between factions also makes results on the battlefield have very real affects on your economy. 

Obviously, as a 40K game though, combat is where this game shines. Each faction has a unique and interesting roster that plays very differently from every other faction. This is a breath of fresh air from Civ, where the factions all have the same units except for a few. It also feels very similar to tabletop 40K, while benefiting from the fact that faction balance isn't based on which models GW wants to sell. The synergies between different units are very important, and learning how to use heroes effectively to boost your troops is incredibly important. The basic mechanics are simple, but difficult to master. It's very well done. 

This is also one of the very few 4X games I've played where it feels like the AI can actually properly manage their cities and combat. The AI is very good at taking damaged units out of the line of fire, and so properly cycles it's units, meaning it can often have units that are higher levels than yours. It knows how to expand intelligently, and the simple city building and complete lack of diplomacy (which is usually a bore and I don't really miss it) also takes out the things that AI usually trips up on (no exploiting AI factions for extra gold...).

In sum, at this point, this is a great game. There are still thing that absolutely should be improved on, like nerfing Necrons, making the movement system let you make two moves if the unit isn't using all of it's movement, and adding in official voice acting (it can't be that expensive if a random modder can pay for it on his own...), among other things. But I would still highly recommend it to anyone who's fan of the 40K universe, or likes tile 4X games and is looking for a more combat focused one. And I have high hopes that it will continue to get better.",1593455801,1593455801,True,1,0,0.505131959915161133,0,True,False,False

This game gave me *incredibly bad* ""One more turn"" syndrome, and I loved almost every second of it. It was so worth staying up all night playing it. 

True to 40k, there's no unecessary diplomacy, no needless whinging every few turns from AI about your borders or troops or what have you. There is only war. And by the Emperor, does it do war well. Each race has unique mechanics that play into their ability to wage war, to expand into and exterminate their foes. Whether it's the Tau's ability to spam out drones and multiply their forces temporarily (seriously - almost every Tau unit can drop in a Gun Drone every so often as a free action) to the Tyranid's ability to steal vital resources away from opponents with their spam, to Space Marine's orbital drops and fortresses, each faction offers unique and engaging ways to play. Even urban development is interesting, where each time you expand a city into a new hex you get building slots to gain resource generation or unit production, as you see fit in whatever combination you choose. 

Of course, there's seemingly only two ways to win. Either wipe everyone else out, or complete your faction ""quest"" which awards you rewards over time. There are ""Invasions"" where the game will spawn additional non-aligned units to swarm into you and attack you that you'll need to beat back, which can be either punishing or easy depending on where they spawn. This is the one flaw I found - they'd spawn without rhyme or reason as to location, in the midst of my territory while I was waging war elsewhere, nearly crippling my faction. 

The game is chock full of flavor text and *great* writing on par with the 40k novels, and well worth reading. The combat is interesting, and the music and art is on point.

I highly recommend trying each race before liking or not  as you can refund in 2 hours if you dont like it. For units dlcs you can try them if game creator got them. Same cannot be applied for race dlcs. I also recommend skipping Lord of the skulls dlc. If you get in bundle its okey.

LONG VERSION: Uses some warhammer40k tabletop rules and abilities. Each race uses unique abilities after unlocking them on tech tree like Chaos infantry rewarded for defeating enemies gains permanent buffs, Space marines can deep strike units anywhere with vision on the map or Tyranids can eat tiles up to gain resource etc. I recommend trying each race but firstly Necron and Space marines as they are both easier than other races to get a hang on game. Caution the wild life in this game can be brutal. They can wipe your early game army. This is one of the games learning curves. After u learn how to move your early armies and what to build and research though tech tree you can start to enjoy the game more. You can play game at different speed settings too as it changes cost of stuff too.  If you liked the base game and want more you can try to join someone elses game. Unit dlcs work for everybody if game creator got them but this doesnt work for race dlcs. This way you can try units packs before buying. Units packs are not essential as they only add more flavor. For the finisher there is an active discord with devs in it. You can find players for pvp and learn tactics or just give feedback about game. Balance and fix patches are regular and keeps game refresh. Game gets a race dlc or unit pack  roughly around every 3 to 4 months. Giving 5 dolar to unit dlc or 15 dolar to race dlc every 3-4 months seems pretty fair for price point. Hope review helps have a good day!

Lite, meaning that there's no economy, politics, diplomacy etc. The resource management is really straight forward and easy to comprehend. I restarted my game like 4 times over because I got to like turn 100 by the time I figured out something with my faction (Astra Militarum) that I didn't realize and I should of gotten like FOREVER ago. 

The real core of the gameplay is in it's combat, which imo beats out any Civ game as far as unit upgrades and mechanics goes. Each faction has it's own unique story to go with it too, and idk about the other factions but I just beat the Imperial Guard one and MAN that last mission was intense. So is it worth $40? Honestly I think that is a real sweet spot for the amount of content this game has, maybe $35, and if we're being ultra cheap then $30. But $40 is definitely a fair price for this game for what it offers.

The bad:
--Bare-bones content. There are single player matches and multiplayer matches and that's it. The ""story"" is a quest sequence which is optionally added on to regular matches
--The enemy AI leaves much to be desired but does provide an adequate challenge initially
--Lack of unit voices, though I remedied this with a mod
--Finding in-game information regarding the game mechanics is sometimes difficult, and navigating the codex is annoying
--Some noticeable bugs. For example, I've set my color to random and my AI opponent's color to the first available color, and the game set us both to the same color. Beyond that, nothing off the top of my head that substantially affected gameplay

These caveats are the DLC units and factions. DLC factions are not unheard of, you may be able to see that I have put some time into total war warhammer and warhammer 2 and they have plenty DLC factions. But these factions are a bit pricey, 15 dollars plus the base game alone without any discounts gets you up to 55 dollars, if you want every faction (without the extra units) expect to be paying 85 dollars, a bit steep for my taste. Worse is the unit packs. 5 dollars for a single unit per faction, A SINGLE UNIT! I don't see why these couldn't have just been free updates especially with the 15 dollars per faction, for a 40 dollar game the DLC certainly makes up for the lower price (compared to most AAA games). If you are looking to buy this game get it while it's on sale, the recent sale ended not long ago but it's bound to go on sale again and then you can start picking up DLC in particular for a more reasonable price. Also, DLC factions should be included for the AI to play, know now that they are not! Just because I don't own the DLC should not bar me from being able to give the AI control of that faction, if you play a larger map with more AI than there are armies you will have duplicates which can be annoying as it creates a lack of enemy diversity.

That being said, the game itself is an absolute blast.  It was a struggle in the beginning, it's not easy and there are plenty of things you will not quite understand from the get go. But if you put in the time and let the AI whip your butt a few times you will start to figure out the pace and how to be successful and after that it becomes an absolute blast. Each faction is incredibly unique, they each have their own unique unit's that cover different types of combat and they all feel different. For example: The space marines starting infantry are absolute beefcakes, just these hulks that deal and take damage like champs, but the astra militarum infantry will get absolutely melted in a few seconds in you are not careful, and they shoot confetti, but when you amass them in large groups (you will start with more Astra Militarum than Space marines) they can rip through the enemy quite deftly. Then you switch over to the T'au and you will see they are somewhere in between, they shoot like hell but melt at the touch of a pool noodle. 

There's more I could say but the long and the short of it is, if you are a 40k fan and a Civ fan but don't want the overhead of religion and diplomacy this is your game. Look for discounts for the best value especially if the faction you are looking for is a DLC faction and not a base game faction.",1591993589,1591993589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although I do wish there where trade or alliance mechanics w/ the ability to sell resources to allies that need them.

I'd say the game is on par with Dawn of War 1 & 2, while presenting a much larger scale than either of those were equipped to handle.

By default the races available are Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Orks & Necron. With various others, Chaos, Tyranids & Tau (and later Eldar) added via DLC. 
But, speaking of DLC, thats the most contentious point. While the game is good, the DLC practices are a bit... scummy. Individual races are sold at $15 (which may be a bit much for some people) the minuscule DLC packs that add, at most, 1 unit per race (or in the case of the Reinforcement Pack, 4 units & an enemy neutral) for $5 just comes off a nickel & dime-ing. Which is unfortunate because the races prove the devs can produce solid DLC.

I did a partial playthrough with one faction to see how the game was like for the most part and was denied a refund once I figured that the gameplay and mechanics were just a simplified and dumbed down (including visuals at the highest) version of civilization. I do not think this game is even worth the sale amount I paid.

Overall the game is NOT a bad idea.  But the art for the graphics, UI and battles make it pretty dull and uninteresting.

But before I go to in depth on anything. 
 Let me first start on the game PROs
===========================

1. The gameplay
Similar to the style of Sid Meirer's Civilization titles.  With more focus on Building troops to FIGHT rather than managing diplomacy or resources.
Through research new structures & units advance the combat and your faction.

2. Graphics
The graphics on units & structures are great for the Wwarhammer 40k theme.  Even the world is alien enough with bit of lore behind the resources and their uses.  From city ruins to Ork Fungus

3. Naming units
Yes you can name units, characters and buildings to your liking.  

4. DLC for all factions
The original game comes with 4 factions Space Marine, Orks, Imperial Guard & Necron


Now we move onto the Cons.
===========================

1. Graphics
The visuals of the UI are pretty boring.  
There's not real faction style or design to the Interface for the factions.  Even the Main menu looks very lack luster.  Like they just found some greyed dusty image and said ""yeah this is wartorn"" and then Copy > Pasted the Times New Roman font from Microsoft's Word.

The army units are simple cookie cuter copies and don't really have anything exciting about them.  There's nothing about them that makes me think ""Hey this is a kick ass squad"".  If not for naming the units, i'd never know one from the other.

2. Animation
Animation is pretty poor.  The same sort of cookie Cutter style for units going into close combat and ranged attack.

3. Sound
Sounds for special effects, ambiance, BGM, Combat and user interface is pretty poor.  Nothing sounds epic or distinctive to a faction.  There is voice work, but ONLY at the faction intro.  After that it's like everything else is muted.  The most you can expect is a death cry

4. Game Art
Much of the artwork for Completed Research or Help / Info pages are just Copy > Pastes jpegs from previous Games Workshops artwork, found in the codex & rule books. 
There's no original art content like you see in many other GW Games.  

5. Combat
While the games' key element is the COMBAT, because in the 41st Millenia ""There is Only WAR"".  The combat feels lackluster, mostly b/c of the aforementioned CONs.  


Overall, while the game has some fun factors to it and is a great idea for Warhammer 40K.  The execution is lacking & can't keep an interest.  
The overall design is more like a simplified game App.

Was glad to get the game on sale, because if I'd paid full price for all of this I'd be more disappointed than I already am. If this game has taught me anything, it's that Warhammer 40k feels a lot more at home as an RTS and not a 4k game. Or at least, this was a valiant attempt at making a 40k 4K game but it's lacking in several areas that makes it tedious and not a lot of fun over all for me.",1591441526,1591441526,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far I've had a blast with my time, and honestly was completely surprised.  It runs smooth as silk and have not encountered any technical issues so far.

Gameplay-wise, this is a 3x game.  Some might say 4x but it is missing diplomacy options you would find in the likes of the Civ series.  But the 3x that it has it does very well.  All of the typical 40K setting and props are present.  You will find yourself in combat a lot, but what do you expect in WH40K?  It is the grim dark future after all.  

I bought the game during the Skull for the Skull Throne sale, and I SOOOO wish I would have grabbed all the DLC while it was on sale.  I'll probably hold off on buying the Tyranids, Chaos Space Marines, and Tau until the next sale, hopefully 4th of July will have discounts.  But until then I plan on playing more of the Space Marines and then running with the Orks.  

The only gripe I have so far is that I do feel like the factions that are DLC should have been in the base game.  I mean, Tyranids not included in the base game is kind of a shocker.  But I do understand this is a smaller studio and I will buy it to support them in hopes we'll get another game in the franchise of this caliber (hopefully even better) . 

If you enjoy 4x style games and are a WH40K fan this is a no-brainer, buy it.  If you're on the fence, then wait for a sale.  I'm not typically a 4x fan, but I do enjoy WH.

A couple of downsides, though: the music is kind of weird, as I think they were going for an ""alien"" vibe. As a result it can grate on your nerves at times.

as a game for warhammer 40k fans, it works and plays fine, as a 4X game, it is sadly lacking. (Note, nearly all of my time in this game has been me playing as the imperial guard. and therefore might not reflect all races/factions.)

So lets start with,
Explore, it's basic, Off the top of my head i can name off 5 different tile types with only a few advanced modifiers that change how the tile types work, paired with a few basic modifiers, outposts that give bonus resources and an artifact here and there. This gives us a solid base to work with but it's not much more then that, have not seen any scripted events or anything else on the map. They even so kindly add a tint over the map depending on the biome so if your looking for something specific you can just pan through the fog of war looking for the biome tint you want.

Expand. Probably my biggest problem with this game, as it actively works against allowing you to expand. In this game most of your resources are shared between cities you build(capturing is not a thing from what i can tell) with the only exceptions being, population, production and loyalty. The first two are fine but the third one is where it all goes down hill. Each and every building in your city requires a point of population in order to work at full capacity except for two, the one that gives you population and your central building. Those two alone do not require population. Now loyalty.... 0 loyalty is your baseline, anything above that gives you +1% to production/resource generation, anything below that gives you -2% down to a -50%(-25 loyalty). each point of population, gives you -1 loyalty, so time and time again you are forced to divert resources and tile space to loyalty increasing buildings to just off set the negative loyalty generated by expanding your city. Which is made worse by each new city you build after the 1st adding a permanent -6 loyalty to all cities(one population building adds 6 population, one loyalty building adds 6 loyalty). The more cities you build, the harder it gets due to the base loyalty of the city starting in the negatives. 

Exploit, No diplomacy, no trading. Fitting of the warhammer 40k universe in which there is only war, but really makes it harder to fully enjoy exploiting things when your only options are exploiting tiles for resources and enemies when their army is at war with a different faction.

Exterminate, this is a warhammer 40k game. exterminate is the basic ideal of the universe. if it's not you, exterminate it. 

Overall, the game is fun, if a bit of a drag at times here and there. Wait for it and the dlc to go on sale to buy it. Is probably better if you have friends who are willing to buy it and play with you.",1591299448,1591299448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all there is no campaign , so the best that you can do is to play some skirmish games against either the IA or other players. It get repetitive super fast.

The main problem with this game is the DLC and the price tags on them. I get that buying the Warhammer IP and making a game is costly, but the effect looks like horrific money hungry gouging. Do you like the Tyranids, or Chaos? You need to pay for the pleasure of playing as them. Ok, fine fair enough, that is fine. They are entirely new factions, with new units, sound effects, etc etc. But then as you play through these new factions, you will find that specific units are locked by even more DLC. You need the Assault Pack to get these units, or the Fortification Pack to get those. Don't forget about the Reinforcement Pack if you want all of these ones! It is a slap in the face when you just paid good money to buy the new faction. You pay for the faction DLC, you expect to get that damn faction, not face even more DLC prompts. In the end the price tag for all of this is well over the actual price tag for the game!

When it comes to the game and game play... Don't get me wrong, this game could have been great. It has plenty of cool units, each faction has all sorts of different strengths, weaknesses, and specific resources/ways to play. However, graphically in every way shape and form, it looks like a really bad mod for Civilization 5. I have everything cranked up to full, and zooming in gives me fuzzy textures and blurry details, and I don't know if it looks worse zoomed in, or out, and the terrain and terrain features are hard to make out and differentiate. Like I said before, the amount of different models is great, and the animations for them are good, but it honestly looks and feels like a mod for Civ 5, except for the fact that it doesn't play as well. The UI is almost completely the same, with a few minor changes that only seem to make it worse to play.

Cities are hampered by population limits and loyalty, immensely slowing down the speed of the game. You will find yourself hitting the next turn button over and over, waiting for the time when you can finally get the next population, allowing you to move on the next building or unit. Resource gathering buildings don't seem to gather enough, which slows your unit production even further, strangling the number of units on the field. Creating more cities to try and step up resource and unit production only makes things worse, destroying your faction loyalty and all your incomes. Civ balanced all of this out very well, most of these types of games do, but this game absolutely fails at it and pacing in general. Why do the Tyranids have loyalty? Why do the Necrons have loyalty? Why didn't they change or fix this, or even rename it? For the Tyranids, a DLC faction with new ways to play they changed your income to biomass. But they can't change loyalty? This same problem can be seen all throughout the game, with all the factions, little things that eventually add up into big annoyances that I personally am unable to ignore.

The music is very boring and repetitive. With many games I can get tracks completely stuck in my head after playing, or even go and look up the OST on Youtube, but with this game, you might as well put different music on over top of it. So dull when compared to the music in games like Mechanicus and Dawn of War. Put those soundtracks on. So many games seem to fail at sound design, and I don't know why when it is so important. The voice acting that is in this game is pretty bad, and the ""Space Marine voice guy"" in a lot of it needs to be dubbed over with someone else.

It would have been great if you could customize your units with the items that you could research or could find and buy, creating an old fashioned Alpha Centauri feel, but you can't do that. Only heroes can buy and use items, and even then you never see them. Customizing your units with gear/upgrades/weapons from the tabletop game would have made cool combinations and changing how they look as a result would have really spiced things up. It would have made this game really stand out from the rest, as it is all it has going for it is that it is Warhammer 40k.

That last fact, that it is Warhammer 40k, keeps me coming back to this game to try and get into it and play it. I really love the universe that much, but every time I play I just end up getting bored and wanting to stop. I can see though, how people love this game, and I know people who would love this game. If Steam would allow me, I would have given this game a Mixed review, but because I can only pick between Positive and Negative, I have to go with Negative.

1)  Well optimized.  I'm also a fan of battletech but despite my PC being decent that game can be choppy / slow at times.  It seems it has memory leaks due to the Unity engine.

This game runs smooth as warm butter.  It's clean, fast.  Games load quickly.

Also, the simultaneous turn feature is awesome.  4x does not have to mean slow.  Basically the engine figures out which moves can be parallelized and does it.

2)  Warhammer 40k

A real pleasure to play around with all the units

3)  Do one thing and do it well

I read a review saying they wanted diplomacy.  Hogwash!  Diplomacy would have messed this game up.  When you read a 40k novel, do they try to do 5 things at once?  No!  They focus on space drama and epic battles, just like this game.

The city building elements are just enough.  It's closer to starcraft 2 then civilization.  Like a turn based starcraft.  There is depth on when to expand, when to build units, just like SC2.  

Being turn based is nice when you are not 16 and you don't want to click 400 times a second to try to play.  

3)  It's fun

Holding a choke point against the Tau and the tyrannids?  Doesn't get better than that my friends.

Yes, there are like 40,000 40k games on steam.  It's hard to know.  Got this on sale but would have paid full price if I knew how much fun it is.

TL;DR: New units are neat but not game changing, worth a buy.
If you like hex strategy games and 40k, game is worth a buy.
Game still doesn't have Eldar, Drukhari or AdMech as playable factions.
No titans either.
Still no loadout options.

!important! - It also looks like the developers are trying to make modding this game more popular, so that's really cool. You can just subscribe to mods in the Steam Workshop now. There aren't that many right now but in the future.. who knows?

It looks like there's been a lot of rebalancing and bug fixes since my original review and I wanted to check out the new units so here goes: The game is even better than before, if you like hex based strategy games then this is definitely worth a buy. The new units are.. okay? They add some tactical flexibility but they don't fill that niche each army really needs. The Tau gunrig for example is basically a mobile fortress with great anti-armor and it IS amazing and useful but the Tau are still the slowest faction in the game. One of the most mobile factions on the tabletop is somehow the slowest faction in this game. What they actually needed was the Manta to be either a flying long range troop transport or a deep strike option. (Seriously, imagine crisis suits without the ability to deep strike and a commander without the coldstar upgrade, it just ain't right.) 
-----------------------------------------------
I didn't like this game when I first played it. I thought it was slow.. kind of.. bland? ..but after some time, and after they released my favorite faction (Tau) as a DLC, It's quickly become one of my favorite games. Each faction plays differently and each match can be customized to suit your ""mood"". You can have everything from a small skirmish to a massive war between every faction at once.

Of special note are the opening cutscenes.. they seemed lazy to me but the voice acting is extraordinary. They sound exactly like I imagined they would.

That said.. there are a few crashing issues. A few balance problems. The Tau's Utopia system needs a rework. I wish they'd add Eldar and AdMech as factions too.",1587721497,1591074754,True,3,0,0.545293033123016357,0,True,False,False

AI seems way better than civ (since they are both 4x ill use it as comparison).They build nice enough cities and mass a good army also they use terrain very well.Even in my limited play time AI always tried to lure me into choke-points or fortified positions of its own.They also line up units pretty well with fragile ones on the back and shock troops at the front.They flank,use artillery and faction exclusive abilities and all that good s..t .Also wildlife (barbarians) in this game is awesome, and add much enjoyment to the overall gameplay.

Visuals are good enough.Nothing too special but they are way above average imo and they are true to 40K lore.Terrain looks good and have a fair bit of variety.Cities could have been made more distinct and detailed but still they are also good.

It looks like sci-fi Civ but the combat is deeper than that.  Varied factions and interesting units combine to make some fun turn based battles.  

Really the only complaint I have 14 hours in is the drab color pallet of terrain.  The maps don't look bad, they are just drab.  Units are rendered better and are animated well.  So it's a minor gripe.  

For a non-Warhammer person I'm not certain if this game would be worth full price given the typical Slitherine doctrine that they released a game with four factions and then others as DLC.

Consequently you spend near all your time in the main view rather than auxiliary windows. Add to this that developers have been very good at avoiding all classical mistakes/problems of the 4X TBS genre (e.g. exponential economic growth) and a well done implementation of the W40k theme and you have a winner.

1 - ""It's not really 4X"" - This is, perhaps, the most absurd argument I've seen.  The 'X's in ""4X"" stand for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate.  These four words describe this game exactly, even more so than every other wishy-washing ""4X"" game out there.  Oh, sure, it doesn't have diplomacy, and the tech tree is pared down--but those aren't fundamental to the 4X concept.  

This game gets rid of all of the non-combat ""frippery"" and bloated pseudo-systems (many of which don't really work in other 4X games, despite what people think) and distills everything down to these four concepts.  ""It's not really 4X"" is just a dumb statement; this game is purely 4X ... with none of the illusions of ""additional layers"" of game play that other games want you to believe exist.  No, the diplomacy systems and tech trees in Civilization are not what makes a game 4X--how many times do Civ games devolve into nothing but combat anyway, only with nowhere near as many options and tactical combat choices.

2 -"" I don't like this game because of DLC ... whaagh"" - This is the standard cry-baby response to game development companies that are trying to remain competitive in a ridiculously competitive market.  I could almost understand this argument if the DLC were overpriced--but it's not.  People see the $15 price tag for a faction DLC and they whine and cry ... ""whaaaghh, I should get Tyranids for free ... whaahhgg"", not realizing the work that goes into each of these DLC's:  devs have to create new models, rigging, animations, ambient sound effects, new music, UI, static art, etc., not to mention design a faction from the ground up with new and unique game play that doesn't imbalance the rest of the game's systems.  Considering you will get an absurd amount of additional time with the game with each new DLC, the cost-to-gameplay ratio is definitely in the buyer's favor.  People want everything for free these days.  Here's a suggestion:  grow up, get a job, and support the company that has produced a game you like, and stop whining, or giving negative reviews, for something that isnt' the game's fault--it's yours ... for being a free-loading cry-baby.

3 - ""But Civ is a better game ...""  - Is it, though?  Civ V was a great game, for it's time, but still flawed in how it handled happiness and end-game challenge.  Civ VI is an utter joke of a game, with it's dopey graphics, small utterly ruined maps (thanks to ""unpacking"" cities), and hopelessly bad AI.  Not to mention the DLC isn't any more ""worth it"" than the DLC for this game; that argument is also fairly infantile, considering most of the new Civs, or game systems, change only one or two things; new Civs don't bring new, sweeping mechanics or an entire new roster of units; and the AI gets ""dumber"" with every expansion.  Earlier versions of Civ are still better in every way.

Compared to Gladius, Civ VI is a bloated, boring-AF game with overblown game play (""Ooooo, unpacked cities, bro!!"" .. ""Volcanoes!!"" ...) that gives the player no real agency, just the illusion of more ""interesting choices"".  Gladius, by contrast, is a multi-headed beast, with each faction providing a metric shit ton of replayability through providing unique and interesting game play that doesn't ""get old"" or played out.  Also, the AI is actually insanely devious, and will work to give you a challenging experience right up until the end of the game ... unlike Civ VI, where the AI is about as challenging as an ice-cream headache.

Decent models and animations
Well fleshed out and enjoyable gameplay
Its Warhammer 40k (so cool flavor text and the likes)
Good replayability and faction diversity (7 in total all with unique gameplay)
Offline play with Ai

The Bad;
High price including DLC

The Ugly;
A strict focus on killing things=very enjoyable combat and little depth in resource management. (Coming off of CIV6 I like that but you might not.)
limited gameplay without dlc though what is there is still pretty good. (I think the dlc is quite good and would recommend buying them despite the cost.)

All the different elements: tactical combat, basebuilding, research, map exploration, Warhammer 40k theme and UI mesh together in a seamless way I've not seen before, leading to the perfect 'just-one-more-turn' experience. 

I particularly like the way the simple UI allows you to press 'space' bar to quickly cycle through all the actions you need to take each turn, including ending the turn, which contributes to  a really immersive core game loop.

Having read some of the more negative reviews, it seems one thing people dislike is the slow pace of battles. And it's true that the pace is somewhat slow, but for me that is not a negative, but precisely what you would hope for from the ultimate in turn-based combat games: a slow pace that builds towards climactic conflicts but that stays interesting because of the immense variety of tactical situation that comes from varied terrain types and each unit having unique characteristics that go beyond simple differences in key stats.

Nostalgia Factor: None.
Bug Factor: Very Low.
Crash Factor: Low in SP, high in MP.
Replay Value: For non-40k fans, it's Low.

It's another strategy game set in the W40k universe, but this time around, it's 4X.

And how does that compare against other 4X games, when the overall expectations, and quality of W40k computer games in general is very mixed?

Well, imagine your typical 4X game. Take away the special resources, replace them with percentage boosts to your normal resources for every tile. Take away any form of diplomacy, always war mode is always on and can never be switched off. Take away any meaningful endgame objectives like victory conditions, make total annihilation the only option for winning the game.

Gladius is at it's best when played 1v1 on a smaller map size, or multiplayer, if you can get that working. When played like the usual 4X game, it's just so shallow...

[b] THE GOOD: [/b]
FACTION DIVERSITY
- 4 Different races/factions to play as in the base game, with a few others sold as DLC.
- As you might expect from a 40k strategy game, all factions have very different flavours, playstyles and share almost no units or techs with other factions. Even the Astra Militarum and Adeptus Astartes, both of which are supplied by the Imperium, share only a few weapons.
- There are 5 resources in the game; Food, Ore, Power, Research and Influence. Not all factions make use of every resource. For instance, the Tyranids only use 3.
- Context sensitive ""bark"" text depending on morale and what is happening around your unit. Also, every faction has a unique introduction and defeat text for every other faction.
EARLY-GAME EXPLORATION
- The map is dotted by outposts and relics. Outposts can be captured by units to provide cover, a place to heal faster and some small resource bonus. Cities built near outposts, such as a Grox herd, for example, can produce more food from it's farm buildings. Relics come in 3 forms, but they all give some sort of global bonus to your units or cities.
- The Jokaero trader outpost allows hero units to buy and sell artefacts, which can also be found by being the first to discover ruins.
- Independent mobs roam the map, guarding relics and providing some early game challenges.
ACTIVE & PASSIVE ABILITIES
- Most units will have access to one or more active and passive abilites, like throwing grenades, erecting psychic barriers, deploy mines etc. Many of these abilities are locked behind technologies, or require you to level up a hero unit. Most active abilities have no resource cost, but go on cooldown.
TERRAIN
- Certain terrain can make units placed in them more resistant to ranged attacks, like forest tiles and especially city tiles.
IN-GAME OPTIONS & SETTINGS
- Fleshed out settings menu. Change keybindings as you please.
- Plenty of options and parameters to adjust in the new game lobby, like adjusting the general game difficulty, and the individual faction strength of yourself and others, or adjusting the presence of every terrain type in the game.

[b] THE MEH: [/b]
NO DIPLOMACY
- Although you can assign team numbers while setting up a new game, there is no diplomacy to speak of.
NO VOICE ACTING
- No voice acting apart from the opening cutscenes.
NO ARMY PAINTER
- Though you can choose from 16 or so different colours.

[b] THE BAD: [/b]
BORING ENDGAME
- There are no real endgame objectives or victory conditions to speak of. Destroying all your enemies' cities is your only objective.
- Although the quests can be a great addition to an introductory game when you're playing as a new faction for the first time, or when hunting cheevos, they are not proper victory conditions. Firstly, only human players can complete quests. Secondly, the way you play with quests enabled is to stay in your own corner of the map, while the rest of the game plays itself on the rest of it. The quests have other problems, as well, but unless you're doing one of the two aforementioned things, quests should be disabled.
CRASHES
- The game will crash from time to time, but in multiplayer, it gets really bad. It seems that the longer the game goes on, with greater amounts of units in the game, the more unstable the game becomes. I found that by turning down the graphics settings and turning off multicore rendering in the late game, it runs without any crashes.

If you're a big fan of 40k, you might get a fair few hours of enjoyment out of Gladius. If not, I imagine you will burn out after a couple or three games.",1588335504,1588335504,False,3,0,0.528985500335693359,2,True,False,False

That content being voices, better UI design, and more factions in the base game. I also have an additional problem with how the DLC is handled, and some design decisions. I'll first go over my issues, then I'll comment on what I really liked.

To understand why this game needed voices, just imagine playing dawn of war without the unit dialogue. The unit dialogue really sold the feeling that the game was going for and this game only goes half way. The dialogue is there but only as text that pops up above the unit that you can miss. The main sounds that you will hear for the entire game are units attacking or moving. The UI is functional and easy to understand, but it lacks personality. The screenshots don't show it but it is all black and white square boxes with color being reserved for resource icons and unit icons. Again, look to dawn of war for what they should have done with each faction having a custom UI. They already gave every faction unique mechanics, city and unit design, custom quests, custom techs, etc, but for some reason stopped at the UI. This just adds to the bland feeling that the lack of unit dialogue already gave. Lastly, and this is the main reason I stopped, there are only four factions in the base game. Those factions are Space Marines, Necrons, Orks, and Imperial Guard. Given, they all have unique mechanics and looks, but this limited selection almost guarantees that matches will start feeling similar after the first couple. I can't stress enough the lack of replayability this limitation causes. However, what irritated me the most about this issue was the fact that the developers are charging $14.99 (US) PER FACTION. As of writing this review, there are three: Tyranids, Chaos Space Marines, and T'au. The base game needed about 8-10 base game factions in order to not feel repetitive after only a few games but instead of adding these to the base game, they are sold as overpriced DLC. 

This goes into my issue with the DLC in general, they are all either overpriced, or have not enough content to justify as being DLC in my opinion. As mentioned earlier, one new faction is $14.99 (US) and this is too much. The price should be closer to about $5 - $7 each, and maybe bundle them into a single package of $15. But, I personally think they should haven been in the base game. Fortification Pack (6 units), Reinforcement Pack (5 units) and Lord of the Skulls (1 unit) should have been content updates. None of these have enough content to justify being a DLC in my opinion, especially the Lord of the Skulls which charges $2.99 (US) for ONE UNIT that is neutral. Some people may be fine with these prices, but I'm not. This seems like the devs are trying to cash grab with these DLC that should with be cheeper or a part of the base game.

There are also some other issue with the game that should be noted. The balance is bad at times, some factions feel stronger than others and some neutral units, mainly Enslavers, are too strong for how plentiful on the map they are. The quest system is a bit broken and also unbalanced. An example being that new powerful neutral units may suddenly spawn near you city or units when going to the next quest without warning and make you lose the game. The city building is a bit boring and confusing with some of the design choices. It is interesting that you can build multiple units at the same time if you build multiple unit factories, but there are some tiles in which you just can't build anything on making them terrible since they still cost resources to gain and maintain. The game map is also dark,which fits a little, but combined with the white and black UI makes the screen always look bland.

With all of that out of the way, I want to comment on part of the game that I thought were really good. My highest praise goes to how each faction has their own unique mechanics that really affect their playstyle. This isn't Civilization style difference where one civilization has a buff and another has a different buff, these differences are real and aren't easily ignored. Some examples being how Necrons can teleport units between cities, or now Space Marines can only settle one city. Aside from the Warhammer 40K theme, this is what really drew me in. I think more games of this genre should embrace this design. I also enjoyed the descriptions written in various places since they help make me feel like I'm playing a Warhammer game. Personally, I also liked how early game units are given upgrades throughout each match to help make them still useful in the endgame. Lastly, I'm not sure if I should call this a positive or negative, but you are able to kill all of the neutral units on the map and never have to deal with them again. On one hand, this eliminates another factor to consider when moving units through an area that has been cleared out, but on the other hand, this start to make the world feel empty since there will now be open areas with on one in them.

I wish I could have given this a positive rating, but it had just too many bad or lazy design decisions for this to be pushed into a positive rating. There are aspects of this game that are really good, but it's bogged down by the seeming lack of personality, and DLC that I felt were over prices or should just be content updates.",1587099953,1587102705,False,129,1,0.853832900524139404,8,True,False,False

This is the closest I have seen a video game get to the actual board game to date. Sure Dawn of War is a bit closer with the unit selection. But this game comes even closer in the overall rule set.

I played 3 full games with the Space Marines, the Imperial Guard (Astra Militarum for the nit-picky), and the Necrons (my favorite). The Orks I played only half a game got frustrated with the 'fodder units' they have and gave up on that game. But to be fair, I never was all that great with the Orks any way.

If you wanted to get into 40k, know a little about it, or even just love (Emperor I hate that word) 40k you will like Gladius,

The only ""bug"" I saw was a type-o with one of the Orks techs. 
The VI for the enemy and random wildlife units is very good.
City building is somewhat basic, but 40k never was about the cities. So most the time you'll only have/need maybe 1-3.
Unit selection is also a bit basic, but most of the major players are there.

My only real 'nit-picks' are that there is no army painter, and 7 factions to play* 4 with only the base game.  

Overall it's a great game though. And it does represent 40k well.

Edit: *The Tyrnids, Chaos, and T'au have been added but as DLC!? 

And yet there's still; 
No Sisters of Battle (Adepta Sororitas)? With Chaos you would expect them to show.

No Eldar,? With the Necrons in the base game you would expect them to show.

No Dark Eldar? Their raiders, they are everywhere there is slaves to be had. You would expect them to show.

If you like 40K and strategy it's a fun (if overly simplisitic) hybrid of 40K and 4X lite gameplay.  If your not a big 40K fan, skip it until the game is expanded significantly.

Pros:
- Good graphics
- Performance seems fine
- It's 40K and 4X strategy
- Has a nice but limited tech tree
- City building mechanic is interesting (wish it had a bit more depth in terms of structures)
- Units have special abilities and enough stat depth to make the unit mixes interesting
- Quests in game are interesting and do a good job of painting the overall back story of the game.
- Limited but interesting exploration elements added to the world

Cons:
- Tech tree is shallower than I would like to see.  Given the depth of lore and wargear in the 40k universe there was alot of opportunity here to have a really robust tech / wargear tree that was IMO way under delivered.
- Unit listing feels incomplete.  No whirlwinds, land raiders, assault terminators, specific veteran units, no mixed squads (include devastators in a tactical squad, etc).  It's a passable list but this is a 4X game and not a RTS - it's a ripe enviornment for providing a really rich and robust unit list.
- Wargear mechanism just feels bizarre.  I mean, some from a handful of quests and some tombs but mostly you buy from ""Joe Bobs emporium of uber artifacts"" which is absurd.  Have wargear drop from combat, be results of tech research or just influence cost based vs a random store.  List of possible wargear is also very limited IMO.
- Some really basic irritiations in the game are present such as no remappable controls (come on guys - it's 2018, get your head in the game) allowing things like wasd scrolling, being able to exit out of a control mode by htting esc, etc.  
- The graphical presentation sometimes feels I guess messy for lack of a better word.  The graphics are not bad by any means, it's more than sometimes its harder than it should be to find / identify units vs the terrain.
- Not aware of any means to get a listing of your own units deployed (how to find a specific Captina for example on the map).  Not a huge deal but it's irritating.
- Information and mechanisms are just not presented / explained very well.  I have some units that get renamed to something special (no idea why).  Combat mechanisms and how some of the stats work isn't clear and the expected pop up of that information when mousing over a stat value doesn't happen.
- Not many races which makes game feel ""smaller"" than ideally you would have in a 40K game.  I mean, you have the empire of man, orks and necrons.  Where are the Eldar, Chaos, Tau, Tyranids to add some flavor to the larger maps?

At the end of the day, it's medicore 40K and mediocre 4X strategy but what makes it interesting is that it's a mix of the two and alot of folks (myself included) have been waiting for that.  I hope that the developers will release patches and DLC that add to the depth of the game since it is well setup for expansion.

Despite the flaws I lay out, I don't regret getting it but I might have waited to get it on sale or until additional depth was added.  I like it because I love 40K but if I wasn't a 40K fan im not sure there would be much here to draw me in as a gamer.  I think with some additional time this will be a no brainer for 40K fans and have wider 4X appeal for even non 40K fans.

UPDATE 3/20:
Given the embarrassing DLC model and small amount of content provided by said DLC, I would steer clear of the game.  If the devs had actually tried to finish their game it would be one thing but to release a shallow DLC at very high prices is akin or even worse than Paradox games.

If you wanna rip yourself off via DLC then go pick up a Paradox game - least after you empty your wallet you will have a game with much more gameplay than this.",1531692969,1584803677,False,0,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False

Now there's a bit of a dichotomy when it comes to the reviews, but i took the risk anyways.
What I can tell you is that if you like W40K lore/universe, you're most likely going to sink a lot of hours into this game.  If you're a Civ fan, this is domination on space steroids. 

Each map is procedurally generated, there are advanced options also available and depending on where the RNG goes, you can end up on a Clover, Island, Continental, Horseshoe or any of the typical RTS formats style maps. all as planned..

Now this is important because terrain matters and sometimes you might be ahead in the game due to terrain or behind and that's one of the variables that really increases the lifespan of the game. NPC/neutral factions also patrol the map and will smack you down (or just mind control you) if you push out too far too early. Don’t get cocky kid.

There's a really good spread of units across the factions, whilst you can't merge squads together like for say TotalWar or Civ, each squad or unit does feel a little more unique, a little more valuable. 
Unlockable upgrades, abilities and promotions help cement this.

All units available across the factions suit the tactics the factions would be expected to deploy, as per norm there are 2-3 units per faction that are soso, but given how many there are to pick from, you most likely won't even notice. 

Mechanics or ”Admechanics'' shall we say are pretty easy to pick up, each faction operates in a different way or requires different resources. It'll take some time and finesse to refine all the factions successfully, especially with variable terrain and different factions as enemies.

Games can vary in length depending on what you want from them. 4 players on a small map are going to be into the action quicker than 2 on a large and again this is a variable that increases the lifespan of the game.
I'm quite happy with single player vs AI, but there's matchmaking if you're into it.

DLC is pretty cool tbh and i don't think i would have played this for as long as i have without it.
Again each faction plays differently and that expanded scope of extra play styles just helps keep things fresh.

I would definitely recommend buying this game if anything in the review intrigued you

It's more like a turn-based version of Age of Empires or Starcraft in that regard, and if you're looking for interlocking systems and multiple paths to victory, you should look elsewhere. It is NOT comparable to Civilization, despite also being a turn-based 4x game. 

However, this focus on warfare allows it to really shine in comparison to the uneven combat on offer in other 4x titles. Each unit has a distinct function on the battlefield, and when you're doing well it's because every unit is working in sync, executing your tactical vision as neatly as a chess piece. It's immensely satisfying to play, and each faction brings not only a unique assortment of units, but special mechanics that make them feel very different from one another. Even Chaos, who so easily could have just been reskinned Space Marines, bring a unique style of play with random mutations and hybrid offensive/defensive structures that can be deployed along their front line.

As far as negatives go, I would say that it feels like the DLC feels a touch too essential. The additional factions bring much needed variety to the base game in terms of enemy threats, along with some indispensable units; the fortification pack is particularly important for giving you more strategic and tactical options. Beyond that, the game was clearly made on a budget, with noticeable shortcomings in terms of tutorials (though copious tool-tips keep it from being a major obstacle), sound design, game modes, and visuals. The graphics in particular are rather mediocre, and it's a genuine shame that the quality of the mechanics are not matched by more visual flourish. I will note that the writing is fairly decent; though the writers are clearly not native English speakers, the game is freer of typos and grammatical mistakes than some AAA titles I've played, and they manage to squeeze a lot of character into the (non-voiced) unit quips. 

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes tactical warfare, particularly those with a fondness for Warhammer 40k.

Like CIV, but with no culture or diplomacy, just war. Though I do prefer overall a more complex implementation of the 4X game style, Gladius is simple and fun all out war. Kind of brutal at the harder difficulty settings though, so best to start at an Easy setting, learn the intricacies of the factions, their heroes and their unique units, and then move to harder difficulty settings from there. The only thing I don't like about Gladius is that the map is too dark and muddy and the ""battle outcome prediction box"" does not really provide the info I need. It is hard to figure out the Rock, Paper, Scissor implementation in Gladius. You get a feel of it as you play. I never rely on the battle outcome info.

I don't recommend the game because the devs switched from OpenGL to Vulkan, and their implementation leaves something to be desired. Game crashes all the time (like every second turn), though this only happens, at least for me, around mid game. By that time, you won't be able to get a Steam reimbursement. Issue with Vulkan is mostly with mobile Nvidia cards. I have the 860M in SLI on my laptop. Does not appear that the devs are going to fix this issue as it is restricted mostly older gaming laptops. So basically, they switched their rendering API after I bought the game and now they are saying: ""Though luck, get a new gaming laptop or stop playing Gladius"". So I will be staying clear of Proxy games in the future. 

Note: I have almost 100 games on Steam and none of them crash constantly like Gladius. Heavy 3D games run fine on my system. Even games running Vulkan like Talos runs without a glitch.",1584294514,1584294514,False,9,0,0.48096930980682373,1,True,False,False

Note:  with no option to speed up the AI you can fall asleep at times...zzzzzzz.  Maybe a mod can fix it like they did in Totalwar Warhammer. ;)

The Square based system with a little more 40K Unit Depth and Tile Depth (larger environment pieces with smaller & more properly scaled units.) would work much better imo. 

I think the Devs took the right approach in developing a 4X game that focuses more on combat in conjunction with the 40K universe, I just don't think the Hexagon System works, is very messy, and takes away from the overall fun.

I still highly recommend this game because: 
1) It’s a small development company with lots of potential. 
2) They appear to have good taste & a passion for the 40K Universe.
3) There is still some stuff to like in this game and if well supported hopefully the developers will create Gladius 2 that will play a lot more like March of war.

Thus, if the developers ever create a Gladius 2 that plays like March of War then I would highly recommenced a little more Unit Variety e.g. Imperial Guard Heavy Weapon Teams with several variants like the Heavy bolter, Lascannon, Autocannon, and Mortor.  In essence design this turn based game with more of an RTS feel on top of a Square based turn system with a Larger Tile Environment and all Units Scaled Properly (like MoW) and you will have a bigger winner…..imo.

DoW 3 failed to be a success for obvious reasons and I am more than positive if you add more of an RTS feel to this turn based game it will be a bigger hit with a much large player base.

I think it's best to start with the fact that I'm not a big W40k fan, and even though I have been conscious about the universe, rule sets, merchandise etc. since the late 80's it hasn't really made a big impact on me.

I had previously purchased W40k - Sanctus Reach, which is a purely tactical take on the franchise, and found it very much to my liking. Gladius on the other hand I was eyeing for a long time, and had it briefly on my wishlist, until after reading some of the negative reviews I decided it wasn't for me and removed it. Then I saw it one Slitherine sale a couple of weeks ago and decided to get the base game after all, which I am now quite happy about. I have also since got all but one expansion DLCs.

When you look at the pictures about the game, it looks quite Civilization-esque and sure there are a few things in common. Similarities like the strategic map (that also kinda serves as a tactical map in combat) that has different biomes and resources on it and you can found cities on, construct buildings and units and do research. This is however where it ends; in my opinion this game is very different from Civ-series. In addition to being placed in W40k- universe, there are so many differences that I feet all my hours spent in Civilization games didn't take absolutely anything away from enjoying this game.

The factions play extremely different from each other, and I really do mean that. The unique units, tech trees, buildings, resource needs, strengths and weaknesses - the whole package is just so as different from faction to faction as you might guess if you know about the W40k lore. 

Now if you are a true W40k fan who doesn't particularly hate the 4X game setting, I can see no reason why you wouldn't grab this in a heartbeat. And vice versa, if you are a 4X game fan who knows very little about W40k but doesn't hate it, this has potential to be a real treat for you.

I think I have babbled on long enough, Time to go and play the the Orks now. Which remainds me of just one post scriptum especially for anyone very familiar with the franchise.

Honestly it's just a lesser version of CIV. . sure you can put multiple upgrades in a single ""District"" and it doesn't even have to be the same thing, like.. a generator district, a manufacotrium, and . . I dunno.. dormitory area.. can all be in one tile, and that's neat and all.. b u t. . . this just feels limited. 
.
.
Wouldn't this have been so much better if say, we could outfit our units a bit better? Like how we can in the table top game? Or maybe if. . .we could control the colors more like in Soulstorm? This just feels really limited for a Warhammer 40k game when we have already had so many examples of ""Ok, here is what is good, here is what is bad."" 
.
.
Honestly this game also suffers from just feeling bland by a certain point, the new races are at like.. 15 dollars per race? When they aren't even worth that much, maybe 5 or 8 bucks? But not 15.. 
.
.
Also, random crashes.. n e a t. No reason to crash, everything was fine.. and then poof, crash. So, that's neat. 
.
.
Positives would be... ah.. The quest system is kinda neat?

So, another crash... was playing as Space marines this time, first time was as Imperial Guard, cause, Imperial Guard.. obviously.. 


Space Marines are extremely powerful, to an absurd point, you can mash out those cannons all over the planet and just take over the world like that, it is ABSURD. 


Game crashed again.. had a literal wall of Cannons.. nothing was getting through as I also had the ah.. fortifications, fully upgraded btw.. so they had missile pads and heavy bolters... 


Started another new game cause the Space Marines got boring.. Necrons are just.. b a d.. you are stuck making your cities in VERY specific areas, which is just bad... like.. REALLY REALLY BAD. . . The design is bad too, it just feels like not as much time, effort or love was placed on the Necrons as compared to the space marines.. the walls look very boring, and the mid point towers on each wall just.. phases through.. the city buildings are boring, clip through each other, and leave areas all patchy and bare, I was expecting each tile to look like a clean Egyptian setting, however I had random Warhammer 40k: Soulstorm Necron Gauss Turrets just kind of.. clipping into each other.. more of those ""Mid point towers"" clipping into the same building over and over again.. a bunch of obelisks just kinda chilling.. it's so dull and boring looking. I expected a well designed network of tombs, instead of haphazardly placed buildings clipping into each other.




The space marines have MASSIVE CITIES in every hex, and it looks clean, and nice. While every other group is messy so far ""Except the Tau, who have little villages in each hex basically, looks nice, but still boring."" 

I was just expecting a lot more honestly.. Also the Baneblade feels.. underwhelming.

Tyranids, as a mostly close ranged swarm of biological weapons consuming the planet itself controlled by the hive mind, do need synapse creatures to keep the others in line. 
Orks have to keep fighting to keep their combat buffs active (havent played them that much tbh...). 
The necrons hav strong weapons but can only rise their cities on special tiles, however they are able to speed up that process if their immortal overlord so desires.
Superhuman Space Marines reclaim the planet from their single city while taking control of its resources by spreading fortresses all over its surface.
Their nemesis, the Chaos Marines, branded with the different gifts of the dark gods at your choosing, can sacrifice their followers to speed up different aspects of their economy to unleash hellish beasts upon their foes.
Caught inbetween, the astra militarum stands strong, fighting the horrors with a vast number of armoured tanks, long ranged artillery and a neverending stream of guardsmen ready to die for the emperor.
With the newest DLC the T'au stranded on the planet. Claiming both planet and wildlife for the Greater Good squads of Fire Warriors and Pathfinders, followed by hovertanks and mighty battlesuits swipe the surface clean of anyone too ignorant to accept the salvation offered by the T'au.

Cons:
The economy is sometimes a little bit too much micromanagement imo. 
Cliffs, I hate them... - Update: cliffs are now very good visible, I'm happy^^
As someone who loves to not only play games but also watching someone else interact with them... there isnt that much (up to date) content (streams, videos). Neither entertaning nor educational.

Naming our units, fighting off the tough Ambulls and a but too OP (But manageable later-game) Rogue Kastillen Robots. Mechanics are pretty good, at least for the factions I played. Never got around to playing others before I didn't want to play anymore. 
Orks are a bit over done. They are cheap. Plentiful. But too spongy and teal far too much ranged damage. These are Orks we are talking about. Shootas aren't accurate for shite, but for some reason the devs thought it a good idea to make Ork AI far too powerful. 
Another issue I have with the game is the ""Shoot, or move and shoot. Nothing else."" It's doable but damn is it restrictive..Guess that's me being a bit picky. 
A bigger and more real issue is how powerful Enslavers are early game. You don't have the firepower to take them on early game, and they can enslave anything. Units. Vehicles. Fucking...Fortresses and Cities? Are you kidding me? I lose on turn 15 because Both my starting Marine units were enslaved, my Fortress, and then my City. That's just...No. Sorry. 
I understand this game has a random factor to it. A huge random factor. Which is why I'm not complaining on terrain when starting out..Though I'd only request to add some building slots to wire weed patches. Considering you can clear them away anyways, I don't see why you can't build there. Give me a -40% with food/req buildings or something. Seems a tad too restrictive is all. 
Overall it's fun when you first start playing, but the most annoying parts come soon after and won't go away..It saps the fun out of the game.

I can't forget about the multiplayer and how poorly implimented it is. it's an absolute pain to invite friends/have friends join pre-existing worlds. My friend and I have to start new games over each time we play, and not being able to finish any fight is starting to get old. This game isn't Dawn of War. It's not a 45 minute session. This is closer to BFG:A, Total War, etc. A bigger, longer, tactically thinking game. Come on guys..If you set the sattings to ""Friends Only"" the lobby should appear to people on your friends list. I'd ask the devs to fix the game, but since they had to prioritize a faction DLC over mechanics, these problems are the least of their concerns. ANd the comminuty, from the looks of it. Ah well.

random powerful units that can either wipe out or mind control your units and use them against you in the super early game, of which you have no warning because they can emerge out of the fog of war (at which point you may as well just restart because you're going to be behind where you would be)

I can understand this though, as it is focused on ""only war."" I can imagine it being really fun as a multiplayer game, where the lack of different ways to win could be counter-balanced with (hopefully) smart opponents pressuring you.

What I do find egregious is the dlc. Faction packs are alright, though I would've put them at 10€. But I started questioning the developer's/publisher's motives when it would seem that there is cut content as part of the base game. I'm talking about the fact that you have a technology tree, with locked technologies that require the Reinforcement Pack dlc to be able to research them, one for each faction and one neutral. For 4€, you can get a whole 5 units!

I was rather disappointed when I found out that I could not field Necron Immortals without spending another few bucks. Or get a Land Raider as Space Marines. Land Raiders are the eponymous battle tank for the SM's, while Immortals are one of the only two basic infantry units available for the Necrons. If you want to make a 4x focused heavily on eXtermination, why would you limit the options for that in such a clear, greedy way?

Pros:
-Decently balanced game play.
-Attractive graphics
-Continued support from devs

Cons:
-Many iconic units are missing from their factions. For example the Imperial Guard lack standard infantry officers as well as their ubiquitous chimera APCs.

-Limited ability to interact with game map. I understand that the devs didn't want to focus too much on the economic side of game play, but there are some obvious features that were left out. Building roads, mine fields, trench networks and observation posts would have added a lot of depth to the game. Having tiles that see heavy combat transform into crater scared hellscapes would have been a nice touch. Also it is possible for significant portions of the map to be covered in water. As there are no naval units in the game this limits the playability  of such areas.

Playing as Marines at the moment - the voice on activation is just what this game needed.  Adds so much life to the conflict!

-----------------------------------------------
*Update*

Game keeps getting better.  I'm playing on all of the default settings.  Have half a Marine force bloodied, the other just stomped on some Chaos and are pushing back Tyranids.  Units leveling up are getting custom unit names.  Enemy is a bit cautious at this point.  Hoping to see some aggression.

I'm still really enjoying the game, but can't stress enough how much ""action"" voices would enhance it.  You know, select a unit, assault/attack with a unit, move a unit, and they ""say"" something.  That kind of audio would really enhance the ""intensity"" of the conflict in the game. 
 If that feature isn't coming some day, I wonder if the old Relic audio could be modded in.

Aside from that, no complaints.  Fast, fun W40k TBS.

----------------------------------------
Well, I held off for a long time - I was put off by the lack of factions on release.  I just picked up the bundle on sale, about $50 with everything but the Eldar (I would really like to see these guys added to the game), and so far I am really impressed.  Game seems really polished and I'm having fun.

With games like this, Slitherine have finally gotten out of the ""icons on a map"" type of games - the graphics are beautiful.  Don't get me wrong, I grew up with cardboard counters on a hex grid, but we've gone far beyond that technology-wise, and games should have some graphical meat nowadays to make them interesting.  And for a 3/4 TBS game, it's absolutely stunning, but lightweight as well, with the download clocking in at something like 1.7GB

On thing I *would* like are squad voices on selection.  But that, so far, is my only criticism.

I always did enjoy the original 40k Relic games, but have to admit that I prefer TBS to RTS.

Talk about synchronicity: this game  was released that day. I knew nothing aboout the WH universe but it was a Matrix game  and they usually do wargames with reasonable AI. Boy, this didn't disappoint. So what's it like then?

It's not like Civ at all for starters. Further, it has no diplomacy. It's just war, war, war and that's kind of refreshing for a change. You can set a game up so that you have allied teams but if they're not in your team, they're your enemy.

It's more like Endless Legend  with respect to each faction is unique and has its own distinct style of gameplay which really affects how you play the game, unlike Civ factions which usually get a unique bonus, unit and skill but otherwise play the same.

Also, like Endless Legend, the tech 'trees' are simple: you pick from a number of techs in a tier and once you have researched two, you can choose techs from the next tier. It is a good system and requires you to think about what you want/need.

A word about the wildlife (barbarians) in this game. It is LETHAL and there are some truly nasty horrors lurking in the FoW which can really ruin you day. 

Graphically, it is very good. the unit models are nicely detailed.

The sound is fantastic. The music is suitably and muscularly macho. I particularly like the musiic for the Necron faction. The new T'au faction has similarly macho music. The sound effects are satisfying as well.

So, should you get it? If you don't mind the lack of diplomacy and just want to fight, yes, it's fantastic. You can play a single map in about 6-20 hours depending on size, the number of factions and, most importantly, the amount of wildlife you have.

Gladius? Rather nice in terms of gameplay, rather bad on a technical side and fucking terrible for it's devs attitude.

Let me go point-wise:

The game is a fine mix of your typical wargames like Fantasy Wars with Master of Magic-likes akin to Age of Wonders. There is no advanced economy\techs, so if you read ""4x"" as ""civ-like"" you've read it wrong. Still, it has everything that a proper wargame should have + something extra from MoM. To get it right, just imagine Wargroove that has every thing better, safe for technical issues and how developers address them.

That's right, the game stability seemingly detoriated from 2018 and it keeps getting worse. Despite the number of fixable bugs you get with pretty much every update, there is tangible number of accumulated ones.

The most notorious cases: 

1) Dancing sound (when music tracks are getting switched from a minute to a second delay span)  https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/5/2534848209923680598/
2) Netcode [a shitload of threads and messages left in discord, let me relay just a part of it] 
https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/1736633878446023678/  https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/1736633446491600596/ https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/5/1638675549017029676/ 
3) Infamous Vulkan and the crankiest transition to it. (a single thread would be enough) https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/1607148447816732665/

The devs respond.. well they prefer not to respond, untill you corner them in Discord like in this case. https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/775115920186391003/07A5A4AF109F3A0A7BCC375F372DD35736CD9DD2/
You can search forums with 'Vulkan"" and find that they've ceased to respond completely on that topic since September, except for the only case, which turn out into major fuck up, because they have promised (ok, almost promised) to fix things up for Nvidia 700m and 800m owners, buuuut something went wrong on their side (5 months after they have started to blame Nvidia on discord but someone brought it up on Steam which didn't end too well for their holiday sales, apparently.)

That's how it started (for in-between threads look into Void's [developer] post history): https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/1642043732655508982/
And that's how it ended: https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/0/1607148447816732665/?ctp=3#c1736633665864982791

For somewhat complete list of major issues you can reffer to https://web.archive.org/web/20200213221149/https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/2823131222987913835/ (yup, that thread deleted, ""naming and shaming"" warning issued. It's Steam)

Wait, but the game is at ""mostly positive"" now, right? Indeed, with 3 buts:

1) It already had over 1000 reviews after Tyranids release, before things worsen up with netcode and new issues popped after their manipulations with sound engine and renderer.
2) Some people value the game for it's gameplay over the crashes and glitches https://steamcommunity.com/id/ElijahRio/recommended/489630/ https://steamcommunity.com/id/nukercity/recommended/489630/ https://steamcommunity.com/id/RUTHBATERGINSBERG/recommended/489630/
3) While others don't play it regularly or play singleplayer only, which is less affected (the more people you have in a multiplayer session, the more crashing you get)

If you still don't believe me that the game performance has detoriated rather badly, let me show you screenshots of people returning to the game upon the Tau's release (also, Valve, I don't use your media and those ID's are of Discord, so, please, save me from that convient ""naming\shaming"" rule this time)

Void's response is a funny remark to the old habbit of his, because since January 2020 Proxy has all the logs autosent to them by default, unless you've figured it out and got disabled or it's not freaking working like the whole game, or, maybe, they have too many of them, so he couldn't get the right one by the time-stamp? [Screenshots compiled from 2 weekends - Feb 15-16 and Feb 22-23, so it's 9 crashes in 4 days]

They need a coder. They needed one long ago. There was a guy joining Proxy to work on AI - and if you ask me, Gladius had it on pair with AoW3 by that time - but he left them in 3 months and there we got ""refactoring"".. To be honest, current AI is on the level of CoE4 or Planar Conquest and it works much better in that sense than other game systems.
You can see a point that they are constantly updating and improving the game and that holds true. For gameplay purposes. They were fixing the crashing behavior on city kill for at least 4 times, and at least twice it had reappered later (other two? they've just failed to fix it despite stating they did https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/discussions/5/1740008576842201211/ )
Gladius is literally the only non-EA game that I had been playing while constantly being opted to OpenBeta. Just in 1.4.6 they had managed to fuck up the launcher for win7 users https://steamcommunity.com/app/489630/eventcomments/1736634311728335292/ . Ways to fix it? Wait for 1,5 months or opt to the said beta. Because they don't deploy any hotfixes (the only exceptions I can recollect were on CSM and Nids release).

All of that were bearable, untill they had decided to step things up with ""major improvements"", among which Vulkan transition stands in the worst possible way. That was plainly idiotic on Proxy's behalf to even try this transition with how ""stable"" the game already was and even more so to leave it in it's place after so many people got screwed up and they've proven themselves incappable of taming that beast. They got two builds for CSM initially: OGL and Vulkan and the best advice they could have provided on DLC release was to switch on OGL branch. If Vulkan wrapper turned to be so fucked up, why, for the Lord's sake, why did you keep up with it? No, they did try to explain it on Discord with 3 points: 50% better performance on AMD cards, saving 1gb of VRAM and making the game future-proof in result. Since it's impossible to argue with them in Discord, let me have some counter-claims here: according to Steam hardware survey for last 3 years, 70-80% of all participants ussed Nvidia, ~15% is for AMD. Was that performance gain even needed for newer AMD boards to justify all those people left abroad due to rapidly increased minimal requirements (including old AMD's), let alone all those suffering from the aftermath of this transition? 1gb less of VRAM, but minimals rose from 1gb videocards to 2gb's MINIMUM. I can give you my version: they'd been working on that transition for ~9 months and decided to make it work no matter what. That's freaking childish, I know, but that's the best word I can describe Rok's attitude on Steam forums. Playing an ostrich after you've promised to help people out (I'm speaking of 700M and 800M case), wasn't been able to, but decided to interrupt the radio-silence only to call those affected vocal minority? There is a plethora of methods yeidling much better results for a crisis like this, even if you aim to screw some people up, but, apparently, Rok doesn't know of them yet. When I had an audacity to call them amateurs on this ground, Rok issued a community warning (my very first for this account) and started to snipe my other posts out. That's what freaking amateurs do, Rok, because that was totally uncalled for.

Civi has so many Victory options, causing the comparison to be wrong.
For Gladius the victory options are this:
Military- I kill every living thing
Religion- I kill everything because GOD EMPEROR 
Culture- I kill Xenos scum because Human
Tech- I use bigger guns to kill everything
or Quest- which usually involve more killing
( its been awhile since I've played civ so i don't remember the options )


For this game everything is to feed the machines of war- because there is only war.

Then there are people saying its dull; a problem that can be fixed changing one setting- and not the difficulty. Want more action? Turn up the wildlife density- make it so the planet actually wants to kill you. I've had the setting so high it takes squads of TANKS to deal with random wildlife, and the tanks come out FAR from unscathed.

Changing the Difficulty only applies to the NPC factions- it's an overall boost to their resources making them expand far quicker than you- more ore,energy,food, and research; they will out produce and out build you at an insane pace- Like they will have bombers before you can even build something besides scouts and second tier INF.  Unless, you get some research centers up to keep up but on the flip those are resources you can't use to build factories, barracks, or forts.

The AI is agro AF, if they see you, they will fight you, and you could lose.

This game takes time to learn, like all games of its genre, and you have to stick with it.

Long review: I don’t like civilization games like everyone compares this game to. I grew up on fallout 2, and a couple other turn-based games, but this is what a multiplayer strategy game should be. 

RTSes have devolved into hotkeys, micro, twitching and a whole mess of rather unfun things which make playing them horrible for me. I had totally given up on strategy games in general after Starcraft became as ridiculously competitive as it is, and I have to admit I’m slower than I used to be at playIng games. Warhammer: Gladius fixes all of that.

Gladius streamlines resource gathering while still maintaining necessary strategery. Simply stand on the resource tiles around the map to claim them—or build a city next to them and acquire them for added bonuses. This absolutely beats having to watch units mine them for you and watching them get chased down and mauled. 

The manual for this game is super comprehensive and is necessary to understanding all of the mechanics, but you can tell it was well put-together 

The models look great, and whether you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k or not (though it helps), there is serious attention to detail anyone can appreciate.

The only two issues I have are fairly consistent crashing (some kind of write error?), and I wish more warhammer races were in it. I hope they come out with another expansion soon, because you’d better believe I’ll buy it. The crashing sounds like a big deal, but the game auto saves even in multiplayer, so it’s easy to boot back up and get every player in the game.

Also for a civ-like game, it’s much faster with concurrent turns, and it has added levels of strategy since you can buff your teammates’ units. Also I can run to the bathroom or get the door and not cause too many issues—huge bonus.

Oh also, the AI is stellar. In many games playing against computers is worthless—not so here. There are many difficulty levels, and impossible really feels that way, as it should. I‘ve learned a ton playing against the AI.

I can go on and on, but I can’t stress enough: buy this game. My friends and I have been playing non-stop for weeks and I think I’ll be at it quite a while longer. Worth every penny.

Edit: while I’m at it, here are some tips I wish I’d known early on: 

1.  Read the manual. For real, cover to cover.

2. You don’t have to fight the creatures on the map, even if you engage with them, you can run (except for enslavers, which can enslave your infantry units unless you’re Necrons or Tyranids in synapse and probably other exceptions. Killing them gets your units back but mine always come kill themselves on my nearest city so I’ve never reclaimed one).
2a. Avoid robots til you have anti-armor.

3. Don’t let your starting units die, use them to capture resources cautiously, losing even one unit in the beginning is a huge deal

4. Each race has resources which are more important than others for it. I exclusively play Tyranids, which have only 3 and influence is the only one you can’t let get too low. If it does, you won’t be able to correct it and that’s catastrophic. Pumping research is important for all races if you don’t want to be out-tiered, but figure out your balance or you’ll pay for it against other people or difficult computers.

5. While you can go mass-infantry if you want: don’t. It’s fun just to try, but it’s difficult to take enemy cities with infantry. Try well-rounded forces and figure out what your good anti-armor unit is; that’s probably your best unit. 

6. You can’t delete buildings but you can turn them off. Most buildings are better left on, but turning them off (minus sign next to name) cuts their cost and population usage allowing you to build more. Doing this allows you to balance resources better late-game if you need.

7. Destruction hurts your resource production but this heals as your cities heal. 

8. The settler units are super useful and can clear that pesky wire-weed for you. I bring them with my army to make moving around the map easier. Ymmv

9. That’s it. Again-again, and I can’t stress this enough, buy this game.",1579351964,1579592252,True,20,1,0.646935582160949707,0,True,False,False

Feels very much like a heavily dumbed down version of Civ V.

Quests are boring, mostly consisting of kill X Units or go to Y location, and the story that comes with them is not very engaging.

the Deep Strategic Combat is basically just mass lots of units and shoot, most of the ""strategy"" consists of extremely basic things like put melee units in front,

City management/buildings require almost no planning whatsoever, just look at the resource tab, oh need more of resource x, build building A, need more of y, then build B, etc...

Research trees appear deep at first but eventually you will realize you can just get everything anyway at minimal cost.

I would give the game 10/10 considering its price.

Clearly, is not an AAA project, but the game itself does not give you any false promeses.Its an tactical turn by turn game, Civilization like , but with focus on combat mechanics.And I shall tell - combat side is better done here,than in many other similar projects. 
Diplomacy , economy , science , religion etc....well they are not in the game , from this point of view game is simplyfied.But wait , are we talking about WH 40000? Yes? Well then who the fuck even need these concepts?

WH 40000 is a world of never ending war, with only 1 religion for each side.Economy is only existant to provide fuel for the war,science is only here to provide deadlier weapons.Dimplomacy?!...have you fucking ever seen a Space Mar to do any other kind of diplomacy , than bolter in da head of Xenos?

So game is not really simplified , but well adapted to dark world of WH 40000.

Lets talk war then/
ALLLLLLL facktions are unique in a kind , with different mechanics. combat tactics you use.No more Civ bullshit with generic untis,no.

1)Every faction has its unique type of units which respects well the Lore.
*You wanna play Astra Militarum? Well get ready to send billions of Guardsmen to the death on the front line , until your havy mech will transform every enemy in a pile of meat.
*Orcs? RUSH!BEAT!KILL!
*Tyranides? Unleash an endless wave of deadly creatures and just overrun them all.

2)Every faction has its own way to play 
*)Orcs live for war and so you are forced to fight non stop if you want to maintent your orc ordes
*)Tyrandies are zerg-hive like , who shall remain in shadows for a while to prepare an invasion - for like 30-40 turns you mind your own staff until you are ready to pop by 5-7 strong unites every turn and then unleash a deadly swarm
*)Being a space marine is being a hammer - you bring your whole army and one shot your enemy with supperior pressure and firepower or you die trying.
*)Astra militarium - entranchment war.Wait , build,fortify your positions and earn tile by tile , at the cost of billions of men your victory.

3)Balance?
I have learned every of 6 factions and I shall tell, that for 5 of them balance is good.
Only Orcs for 31/12/2019 are weak.If you fail to rush down all over the map , you lose.That means on big maps you will lose   almost always.

Other factions are pretty well balanced with strong and weak timings in the game.Great job done here , since balanace 3 non generic factions is a hard task...but 5 of them with very unique mechanics? Well , bravo.

I do recommande this game,defenitivly a low cost but great game to get for every WH or turn by turn strategy fans.",1577796779,1578237498,True,8,4,0.596883952617645264,0,True,False,False

This is a turn-based strategy game in the Warhammer universe. As you would expect there is some base building, but nowhere near Civilization or Endless Legend since there is only war.

Is the war good as a commander? Yes. There is diversity in units and there are things like advantages and disadvantages based on terrain (shooting from a cliff is better than shooting from the low ground) for instance.
What I am missing in this is expected bonusses or penalties. When moving a unit I am not always sure whether a certain tile is better than another. For cities and forests this is self explanatory since there is cover. When moving units to sand dunes and shooting from there, I am not sure how it will impact my troops accuracy or damage.

If you are looking for a turn based game with some strategy, but mostly aimed at warfare than this might be the game for you.

Now for my caveat. I alt + tab a lot in games and this is no different.
Initially I let the options be, but this caused the game to hard crash when switching too much.
After this I changed the game to borderless full screen and I experienced about four crashes ranging from a memory violation to a tile somewhere on the map getting corrupted (this tile might be hidden in the fog of war).
Once I stopped using alt + tab these crashes no longer occurred, so I am guessing I just can't switch applications while playing. This is a rather large minus for me since there is down time in between turns, but I still like the game slightly more than I dislike it.
Despite having no crashes in about 23 hours after I stopped using alt + tab, I am still wary that a crash might happen randomly at some point...",1575050210,1577638968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a mixed bag. Despite similar core mechanics the game is definitely a deviation from the Civ formula towards a combat oriented game mode. This is fine and suits the 40k franchise perfectly.

My main gripes stem from the ""sameyness"" of every play through. For example a Necron playthrough is going to feel incredibly similar every time you do it. Unlike Civ there is no real alternate victory modes, the tech tree is very linear and the option of what to prioritize is generally pretty obvious. For a genre that has its lifeblood in replayability this is the main mark I can strike against the game.

The two main ways to play are with quests enabled and disabled. Enabled, quests are a series of events that happen - unique per each faction - that trigger some new condition required to beat the quest. If you beat the final quest you win the game. Turning quests off makes the game a straight annihilation victory.

However they expound the samyness of each playthrough since the quests are identical each time you play. Ie, Space Marines have the same quest chain every single game. This isn't very interesting since you know what is coming. 

Further a lot of the quests are something like ""A faction of whatever has turned traitorous"" and just spawns a ton of units right outside your base. If you aren't ready for it you can get wiped. But also you have no way of knowing the game is going to just decide to plop a death army literally out of nowhere at your front door. There is no countdown or anything it's just like ""Hey this happened hope you weren't too far from your base or you lose""

IMO it's best to play with them off. I really didn't like them. I find they conflict with the core of the game personally.

What combat there is is relatively simple but has just enough depth that it remains engaging. You have one unit per hex tile and units have varying abilities and certain attack properties (ie, anti-armor, anti-air, anti-infantry, support, etc). However for a tactical wargaming franchise the actual positioning of units and thinking about the broader tactical implications of them doesn't really come in to play. Yes there's cover mechanics and such but they aren't much more than a small defensive bonus under certain conditions. I would have liked to see this be much deeper. Things like flanking bonuses, unit adjacency bonuses (which do exist but are limited), things like attacking across a river, etc. Things like this are either non existent or pretty light and I would have enjoyed unit positioning not just being something that gives you an edge in battle but being a critical and required part of combat in the game.

In terms of faction differences they exist and are meaningful, but they all center more around the city management portion of the game rather than the combat portion. Ie space marines can only have one city, Necrons can only build on tombs, etc. While that is interesting I found it really didn't do much to change my overarching combat strategy. Every faction has troops that fill whatever role (infantry, anti-vehicle, anti-air, anti-infantry, etc) and the overarching strategy of just amass a load of units and start trying to steamroll things seems to just work no matter who you're playing as. There ARE combat differences between each race but I just didn't find they mattered all that much to feel like I was doing anything fundamentally different.

All in all I say the problems with the game outweigh the good. There IS fun to be had. The game also runs very well and AI turns times go very quickly which is nice and something competitors could learn from.

My only complaint about this game was that there are no factions within factions. The Space Marines seem to represent all chapters, saying things like ""We are the hammer of Guilliman"" even though the Fortress Monastery is named after Vulkan. Having specific chapters with different bonuses and weaknesses (Like Age of Empires 2) would add a lot to this game. Same goes for the Imperial Guard - I want to play as the Death Korps of Krieg, but there is no such option. The only customization is naming your units and choosing your color.

That said, I know this game was made by a very small team so I am perfectly willing to overlook that. I have very, VERY high hopes for a sequel to this game, and I recommend it to anyone that loves 40k and/or strategy.

Art is taken directly from the GW Codex, with little effort to innovate or create their own. However everything is pretty fluid, and for all the faults each of the 4 races play almost exactly as they should based on lore. In some cases to an extreme detriment. Other than Imperial guard, everything feels pretty fair and lends to making this a genuinely good addition to the Warhammer franchise. There is a pretty game breaking bug with graphics though, where after a certain game time or trigger it will corrupt everything on the screen like an original NES dipped in water.

Imperial Guard Cons:
IG flat out need a rework as they're the only race that really has no benefit that can't be easily undone by other races, and generally just don't feel good in any way.
I would heavily suggest not playing as Imperial Guard since they have pretty much nothing but cons, and have an extremely unfair disadvantage. Not only do they take 3x more resources to maintain than any other race, the units are also extremely useless. This is fair due to cannon reasons, however gameplay wise it's extremely unfair. This is brutally noted when it takes the same time to produce basic units as Space Marines do, and the Space Marine units are easily 4x better than the IG. It can take up to 7 IG units to kill a single unit of any other race.
In order to make even the most minor success as IG in this game, you MUST min/max to the most micro level and every single decision has to be perfect. You're basically limited to the RNG gods on where you start, and what you face. If you're against Orks or Necrons, and they're close to your starting zone, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose.",1576102857,1576102857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I  has an incompatible graphics card for this game. Did you know that this game doesn't work on certain graphics cards? I didn't buying it. Now, a tip of the hat for the devs, they're not hiding this problem and they were super responsive on discord about it...

But a wag of the finger for their approach. This problem has been around since October, and as of this review's date the plan is to pester Nvidia and hope that they fix it. Nvidia has no concrete plans to fix it but I guess ""they're looking into it"" which means it might be in some dev's bug queue that they'll get to it eventually maybe. And to be fair, my graphics card runs civ, it runs anno 1800, the witcher, remnant from the ashes, and loads of other beefy titles, so I'm not willing to just accept that my PC is too old for this game.

So the downvote is not because I don't like the game, I hope it's good and that I get to play it someday. The downvote is because I think this is poor software engineering, not the best customer support policy, and sitting around and waiting for the other party to negotiate a solution didn't work for Napoleon in the winter of 1812, and I'm not so sure it's a good plan here.

The first is that this game is basically just a Civ knock off with 40k paint. It's not anything special or new or interesting, meaning you're probably better off playing Civ (unless you actively hate diplomacy, trade etc because that's not there). It has some minor elements, like units with abilities (none of which are hugely thematic or flavourful) and a ""story"" when playing single player, which is actually just a few random objectives but they don't make this a really good 4x. It's a bare bones 4x with a very small tech tree.

It's a game that's all fighting, all the time - the in grim darkness of the far future, there is only war and all that - so there's no diplomacy or religion or any other path to victory other than mini story-quests during skirmish battles. None of that is a bad thing, if you enjoy turn-based tactical combat games; Gladius isn't trying to deliver a Civ-like empire-scale 4X game. Instead, it focuses on warfare and does that pretty damn well. 

The mechanics can be seriously obscure at first - full disclosure, I actually failed the *tutorial* somehow - but after a few matches, it opens up significantly and feels like there's some nice depth, with a clear tabletop or board-gaming influence on the gameplay design. The drawbacks in my experience are the default factions, since I'm not wild about Orks and the Imperial Guard just feel flimsy and sad. I could see the game wearing thin after a while, too; I've played maybe a half-dozen matches as Spehss Mehreenz and I feel like they're pretty similar each time. The DLC factions (Chaos Marines and Tyranids) seem almost required just for the sake of replayability. 

There's not much in the way or lore or story here, but really, dropping squads of Terminators from orbit never gets old.

While having do do a fair bit of reading to figure out what building is needed for various reasons, that i will happily hold as a virtue especially given the flavor text and peices of lore scattered in everything the game has to offer.

From a Mechanics stand point the game is rock solid and for anyone who plays Civilization and other hex based games, getting to grips with this one will be smooth as silk. The various Unit animations are Soilid more often than not, though some animations do leave a touch to be desired such as grenade explosions and Other effects. The sound has pretty prety soilid alround and flows seemlesly with whats going screen.

If something was left wanting how ever, its Regiemints, chapters and that sort. I have no idea what regemnt of the Guard is suppose to be represented. ascompaired to being to choose from certain ones like the Macabiean Jannisaries, Armaggedon Steel Legion, Elrisian Jump Troops, the Solar Hopalite Even! Or my Personal Favorit Death Korps of Kreig. and good lore the sheere number of War Bands and Chapters to choose from both the Astartes and their Fallen Brothers.

Rant aside some extra flavor would serve this game well, perhaps introduce this as a subb faction type element that can be added to in futer along with various campaines.

This is what you get when you want to play Civilization but only win by killing everyone on the map. So everything is built around that. You research new units, or unit improvements, you build economy to produce and support more units and you build units to fight. Fighting has some depth with different terrain types, and (kind of confusing) damage calculations from damage, attacks, armor and armor penetration, accuracy, attack distance and morale. And on top of that you also have squad size for units. I still don't know how to calculate damage properly and why giant mechanical dog does 10 damage to a city, but only 3 damage to a tier 1 unit. 

There's 4 basic factions, and 2 dlc ones. I still haven't played tyranids and guards, but i can confidently say that all of the factions are pretty unique. And besides that each faction has some build variety due to research. It's pretty much infantry vs vehicles but all of them have some unique stuff, like necron being able to teleport between cities or to a special unit or orcs using influence for unit upkeep, but units themselves generating that influence by dealing damage. 

Game has nice audio-visual presentation, with lots of good warhammer models and decent animations. Nice ambient and pretty solid gun sounds. There's also a lot of flavor text for all units, buildings and basically everything in the game, if you're into that kind of stuff. 

I still find some mechanics and overall balance a bit questionable, but overall the game is very enjoyable for me. And one aspect i don't see a lot of people talking about in their reviews is how easy it is to mod the game. Most of the info about units, buildings, traits and abilities is contained inside XML files and you can easily edit them with Notepad++. So if you feel like some unit is underpowered or need more health or whatever, you can just edit it to however you want it to be. And that, for me, what makes this game a solid Yes recommendation.

There is a quest victory condition which adds a nice bit of context and lore the game.  Secondly the cities, cities act somewhat like they do in Endless legend.  Instead of building improvement you expand the city, unlike endless legend instead of collecting the surrounding tiles' resources the city expansions are where you place your buildings; Resource harvesting buildings like ore mines, farms, power plants and influence generating buildings, and Unit production building.  Every unity type, Infantry, Armor, Air, requires its own building to be made, you could make one Infantry building, which for standard units will take 6 turns to produce basic level units. Or you can build more if you want to, with 4 infantry buildings the turns to produce 1 unit is 1 or 2 turns.  Because of this you can specialize cities to be military powerhouses that just produce constant streams of various types of units.  Gladius is all about war, there are many more systems at play with unit design that makes it much more complex strategic gameplay with regards to what unit is good at killing another unit.  Units all have different weapons some deal greater damage when used 1 tile from and enemy as opposed to 2 tiles.  Infantry ordinace units deal half damage if they have moved that turn(Vehicles ordinace negates that penalty).  Some weapons are better at higher armor, or low armor, Large groups of enemys or a single unit.  There is a large amount of variety.

This game isn't without bugs as many other reviews have pointed out, but the great gameplay out-weights the bugs in my opinion.

If you liked war in Civ but want more depth, this game might be for you.

This is not a single player game. It has no campaigns, no scenarios, no branching victory options, no diplomacy.  It's like a Civilizations game, but all factions are permanently hostile. 

You establish your base, you fight hostile monsters, then you find the enemy, you fight them, win or lose. That is pretty much it. Infinite resources can make it a huge grind.

There is a sort of a quest based victory for each faction, go there, explore this, kill that, win, even if the enemy has 75% of the map by now, since you weren't keeping him in check.

Besides doing a couple of playtroughs with each faction, there is nothing else to do.

Multiplayer part is fairly well done. Factions seems reasonably well balanced, there are a couple of ways to build your army, and if you got friends to play it with, you can have fun.

tl;dr;
Its a pretty decent turn based strat game. Nothing really new here.

Pros:
Basics are pretty solid
Mechanics are fairly well documented
UI is for the most part fairly intuative

Cons:
Very basic unit system 
Strange mechanics in places - AP in particular
Balance is a bit wonky, units becoming more obsolete than they should is a major issue imho
DLC makes total game pricier than it should be
Very basic tech tree

Really, I like this game, I just wish the devs had spent an extra 6 months on it adding what I would have expected to see from a game like this. Its not really that much that is missing, there is the core of a really solid game here but I'd really love to see the devs actually do a full balance pass as well as adding in lots of extra features that you expect to see from the various armies in 40k.

SM, Imperials and Orcs at the very least should have units with different weapon options and upgrades, these could also be level locked to getting the more powerful unit upgrades so say as you get terminators, you also get the option to equip assault marines with power weapons or convert them to assault terminators when they hit level 5. 
Even better they could switch weapon types at a city or a transport carrying wargear, so a devastor squad might use missile launchers, heavy plasma, las-cannons or heavy bolters. This would at least allow them to stay useful late game.
None of that seems difficult to add to the game.

Overall I think my main problem with this game is that its too simple in the long run to keep me occupied. 
I've won a couple of games now and already feel there isn't much more to experience. I might try the races
i'm not so keen on again or play about with the settings to see if I can make it more of a challenge but once
you've played each race once, I don't feel any surprises playing them the second time around and nothing
new to discover.

There's no diplomacy, no real tech ""tree"" (players do research technology, but there are no real dependencies between techs), and city management is more akin to base management in an RTS than a Civ game.  

But what Gladius does, it does well.  Graphics are pretty, the soundtrack is fantastic, resource harvesting adds a nice area-control aspect to the game, and the overall Warhammer ""feel"" is spot-on.  There are a few rough corners: the compendium of info could be easier to use (a search tool would be nice), combat resolution during the AI turn is wonky and often doesn't show you what's happening because the camera pans somewhere else, etc., and given its relatively simple mechanics the game can arguably get a little shallow after a few playthroughs.

I decided to play a little Gladius and the game crashed on launch because it didn't detect speakers. In my 30 years of computer gaming, I never had a game crash because there were no speakers.  You just didn't have sound.

I bought 2 copies, one for myself and one for my wife to multiplay.  Soon after, they patched up the game so it only supports video cards with Vulkan technology.  Her game crashes on launch because of this.  We are not buying a new video card to play one game.  Thank you for the ripoff.

I went to play my single player game and found that my saved game and all autosaves will not load because they are an incompatible version.  What is the point of playing a game like this if you do not know when you are going to lose your saved games because of a patch.  Again, a huge ripoff of time and money.

Update 8/31/19:  I have submitted a customer support ticket and described the issue concerning the saved games to them.  Upon discovering the nature of the problem, customer support has ignored the ticket and all further inquiries about the ticket.  This is an excellent way to lose customers.

Now basic economy and logistics become more important.
You need to manage the tactical situation on the battlefield, while considering the wider strategic implications.
The last battle I fought was a war of attrition against the orks. This battle went back and forth many times and I was about to be overrun when I finally deployed a tank battalion to the front lines (just rushed off the production lines).
With the brutal wildlife roaming the world, peril always lies just over the fog of war. Giving a sense of dread when exploring.
Each faction plays totally different, but seem pretty well balanced.

I do wonder why people complain about the lack of diplomacy. I find that peace agreements work best when delivered via the medium of a clenched fist... Or earthshaker heavy artillery round...

I played it for a few hours before getting frustrated at how slow and dull the game-play was and requested a refund; unfortunately I'd played past the two hour limit by that point (seems a bit unfair to me considering my issue with the game was how long it takes to do anything, but oh well). I gave it another hour or so on a faster game setting which worked for a little while, but I eventually hit an impasse again. 

The basic problem with the game is that everything requires so many prerequisites before expanding.  Your city needs to acquire new tiles (which costs time and resources) to build buildings (which cost time, resources and research) to produce units (which cost..you get the idea). Your buildings need population to operate which grows over time, but is capped at six (for chaos anyway) until you construct a mid-tier building to increase that. If you want to build another city, you need to send over a builder unit and then spend more resources to start the whole excruciating process again. In the meantime, your production tanks in both cities because you need another building to alleviate the unrest that having more than one city causes. Basically, you can't build your cities tall or wide and you'll be constantly constructing buildings to deal with the negative effects of doing anything in this game. 

Exploring is very unrewarding; because there is Only War with the other factions, there's no particular incentive to meet your neighbours to trade, and they don't even seem to communicate with you. There are a few goody hut type things scattered about the map that give tiny bonuses that are nowhere near the effort. There is a pretty good mechanic where you can automatically create outposts on far-off resources to siphon off some of the rewards before building next to them.
Unfortunately, the map is crawling with monsters, most of which have deeply irritating abilities, which will grab your outposts unless you keep them defended. As well as active threats, the map is completely covered with a range of irritating terrain features (woods, rocks, weeds etc.) which slow movement to a crawl, block ranged weapons and take up building slots. You can clear these with your construction units but it costs resources.

Considering it's a 40k game, you might expect the combat to be good, but it's passable at best. Units feel way too tanky and advanced units have a hard time damaging weaker ones making it a slog. For some reason, it takes about 8 turns for a unit to heal back to full, effectively slowing an assault down as you shuffle wounded units to the back line. Assaulting units don't move into the attacked hex after killing an enemy, so there's no way to push the front line back - the enemy can just move new units into the vacant space. There don't seem to be a whole lot of units (despite the DLC I purchased), and while there are a few technologies to customise them for an edge, they all require taking research time away from the tediously necessary economic buildings.

The sad thing, is none of these problems seem particularly insurmountable. If this game just dropped the build times, made your city automatically acquire new tiles and gave you some of the core technologies to begin with, it'd be pretty decent. From what I've heard, there's decent mod support for this game so I can maybe find or create something to make the early game less excruciatingly slow. It's just a pity I have to do this for a game that probably costs half as much again as it should.",1568831348,1568831348,False,7,5,0.460072696208953857,0,True,False,False

Based on the above description, I didn't have very high expectations when I purchased the game, but after spending a fair bit of time with it, I must say that I've thoroughly enjoyed it. The aspects that have been cut from the traditional 4x formula seem to be the ones that usually turn out to be clunky and more of an annoyance than the core of the gameplay, instead focusing on getting the combat, tech-tree choices and faction diversity right.

The sounds are fantastic, the pacing is downright perfect, the AI is a liiitle dumb at some parts but very very rarely and it's probably because I am playing better than the AI I have gone up against, the models are gorgeous, the music is fitting, the overrall art syle is nice and grimdark like 40k should always be, things that should be strong do feel strong, nothing feels completely broken (really, it's the fun sort of balance where the op stuff is fighting op stuff so its balanced anyway).

It requires SO LITTLE hard drive space (currently under 2gb), it runs fine on old machines and like I said it still looks great, I've come across no bugs (will update accordingly), it has customizable matches which is new for something published by slitherine as far as 40k goes, the games mechanics are very natural and displayed very obviously, absolutely nothing finnicky at all with the UI or camera controls, doesn't cost much at all considering what you get, and it has some user friendly things like handicaps (both positive and negative) for all players as well as lots of colors to choose from (personally, I hate it when colors are locked to player numbers and when there are so few) and plenty more.

One gripe I do have is the Lord of Skulls being a deluxe edition only neutral unit. Hopefully that means if they release chaos, the Lord of Skulls will still be a player unit, but I still don't like seeing ingame content being locked behind a pack that is supposed to be inconsequential outside of game stuff.

I plan on playing loads of this, and I can't wait to see more armies come out. If you like either 4x or 40k, I highly suggest buying this.

PROs
- The factions play completely differently. I'm really impressed by the level of thoughtfulness and creativity that went into the faction design. Somehow they are well balanced will playing like they're not even from the same game. On your first playthrough, each time you play a new faction is a delight as you learn what works and how to get the most from the faction.
- Incredibly deep tactics. There's so much to learn about how to maneuver individual units, groups of units, how to control space, project power, draw the enemy to you, bring the fight to them, etc... I've never played a game that was as deep tactically as this one.
- Also deep strategy. When to attack versus when to play defense, when to stay committed to a tough attack vs cut your losses, which enemy to attack and where along their line to push are all critical decisions that can make or break your campaign.
- Best AI I've seen in this type of game. It's obviously not as smart as you the player, but it still does a lot of really cool things and doesn't feel as moronic as AI in these games usually feels. (Obviously you learn to exploit the mistakes it does make more as time goes on.)
- Great implementation of hero units. Super strong, can turn the tide of a battle, but still can't do it all on their own. Vary by role and how they interact with units/fortifications from heroes that are great on their own to heroes that make their armies stronger. All unique, all play differently.
- Great base-building mechanics. As mentioned above, base-building is different for all the factions, but for each one, it's incredibly satisfying to place and build up your bases.
- Incredible unit design. Each unit is unique, fun, and aesthetically pleasing.
- Polish. Although they could have built some more into the UI (unit lists, city lists spring to mind), what they did build works elegantly and intuitively. 
- Soundtrack. Although there's only one soundtrack, each faction introduces its own motif and they get you super pumped up.
- Replayability. As mentioned, each faction is completely different so you'll need to play each one multiple times to master it. Depending on map position, games play out totally differently. You can take different tech paths, so even playing the same faction can feel different from game to game. And of course you can vary map size, # of opponents, game pace, etc, for an incredibly varied experience. I've played 70 hours since I started about 2 weeks ago and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface.

CONs
- Would have liked to see a few more management features (city list, unit list)
- The quest system is a bit... weird. I see what they were going for, and it kinda works, but, especially your first time through, it can be really frustrating if you complete a quest step and the next quest spawns a massive group of enemies while you're engaged in a tough fight against an AI faction. Once you know the quest lines, you can manage it how you please, but it's still quite clunky. 
- A campaign would have been awesome.
- Some of the mechanics aren't explained very well or at all and will take a lot of playing to figure out. E.g. - resource outposts only get you the + resource, not the % resource, unless you acquire it with your city or drop a Space Marine fortress on it. I just figured out how forest affect line of sight, I'm still not sure how Imperial Ruins affect line of sight, and I'm still not sure how height differences affect attack/defense, LOS, or movement.

As I am getting older but still like games, While this game for some reasons still does not feel ""finished"" it offers very good & quite addictive gameplay. While having lots of game time hours a stable fun game turned into 1 of the most buggy/crashy game duu to crappy programming.

Pros:
- WH universe, what is not to like? Ah well, at least if you don't like any war setting, you will not be buying this game.
- Game very easy to figure out.
- Automated save game (up to 5 of your last games are auto saved).
- Good & highly addictive gameplay!
- Gameplay can be adjusted to cater every difficulty!
- Can easily be switched to another program during turn time (during loading times is a complete different story, see cons!)

Cons:
- Screw VULKAN!
- WH universe is all about units & unit variety. Unfortunately this game heavily LACKS in every aspect of offering any decent variety, options & deep customization of anything related to units. While heavily lacking in any form of unit delivery also NO mods are available, only very high priced DLC's that offer ""some relief"" of additional units & new factions.
- The AI.......... is too easy to figure out, well at least for me (don't worry I won't mention any spoilers)
- The maps are TOO SMALL!
- Practices when loading the game. This is not the 80s or 90s anymore, so instead of watching some loading bar or circle do its loading I choose to read or watch some news or youtube when having to wait & wait for a game to begin loading...... with 98% of every game I bought these last 2 DECADES this is no issue. Well this game is made so you basically can't! The game even sometimes crashes when you are forcing to switch programs by hitting ctrl-alt-delete during loading of the game or reloading saves. i7, 2GB Nvidia, 16GB RAM, Win10, so no hardware limitations on my end. Also when switching programs, the music still plays on while having switched towards another program. 
- ..... this game software updates are absolutely horrendous & ultimately badly executed. Completely made this game unplayable, well at least for me during the last game update, needed several days and patches to finally restore this & basically made the entire game unplayable! I do respect the rather fast delivery of new fix-patches + I don't mind losing all my previous save games due to an update but please stop with this amateurism of releasing your updates without PROPER testing (don't these people realize that a vast number of their customers have older non VULKAN hardware systems?). Also the huge lack in communication is very worrying during 1 of these abysmal patch launches, this is very worrysome especially for coming future patches...... Just relying on unpaid forum members with a passion for your game IS NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE DECIDED TO SUPPORT YOU BY BUYING A LEGAL COPY! Luckily for me I am soft- + hardware & tech proficient. Lots of YOUR customers are NOT & RELY ON GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND GOOD BLOODY INSTRUCTIONS! Being good developers does not mean you know how to run a company.

Would very much like to recommend this game, but ever since the last update debacle & severe lack of communication & severe lack of overall customer information AND overall customer support I am rather very neutral about this. Unfortunately I cannot choose neutral, so therefore I have to choose NO instead.

PS: apparently this game is made + managed by a 3 person team.

Furthermore I love turn based strategy and 4x games so technically this should be right up my alley, or atleast so I thought. 
Ive been lured into many games merely by the Warhammer tag plenty of times before and been burned in the process. Safe to say good Warhammer games are few and far between - and sadly this is not one of the good ones. Enough backstory let me tell you why Gladius fails to deliver in my oppinion:

The game feels largely unfinished, there is no sound queues what so ever, no responses from your troops when you order them around, no voiced notifications - nothing. It feels so weird playing Imperial Guard and not hearing your guardsmen shout ""SIR YES SIR"". The audio problems are not limited to the absense of voice queues though, as weapon fire sounds absolutely bonkers. Bolters, grenades, plasma you name it, have no meat behind the fire whatsoever which is a huge letdown when you compare both of those aspects to games such as Dawn of War which had amazing audio on both voices and effects. 

Now if only the audio was an issue I could maybe live with it, wait for someone to make a port of DOW 1 or 2 sound assets or some other community fix. It doesnt end here though. The visuals themselves have no weight behind them either, this is especially clear when using explosives such as artillery or grenades, you dont ""Feel"" the impact. Sometimes you dont even get to see the impact, as in the case with the Basilisk (one of my favorite units of all times in WH40k) it just shoots past the target visually and small pops on the unit it attacks represents the hit, there is no gory impact.

My biggest problem outside of audio or visuals is probably the fact that you pretty much only play on 1 ""Map"" yes you can tweak landmass / features but it feels samey no matter. There is not really a huge variance in what youre looking at and ultimately it feels like you have seen all there is to the landscape by 10 hours in the game.

It bothers me, because you can feel that beneath the extremely lackluster(sometimes not even present) audio and visual side the Devs actually genuinely like the Warhammer universe and they do have some good takes on the different factions. This is clear when you look into the detail they write about and descripe the factions both through upgrades and splash screens. 

All in all it could have been a decent Warhammer game if only they have had the resources to actually add visual and audio assets, but with audio completely missing for the most part, and visuals(Combat effects or Map generation) being generally quite bad it feels like an early access alpha game but its supposedly released. 

The download size (Just short of 4gb) was a red flag for me but I went in anyway, I suggest you dont.",1565268562,1565268824,False,7,0,0.498789727687835693,0,True,False,False

Race unit availability is all pretty generic with enough racial differences between to keep life interesting. 
I have played the game for around 80 hours, mostly offline single player and it is very much to my liking.

Don't think civilization but think panzer corps or fantasy general. Armageddon sandbox style without its huge unit offering.
I'm not sure where the civilization comparrison stems from but most of the time a sortoff 4x game is revealed many people tend to use civ as a comparrison. While fair since civ's standard in the 4x scene it does show a lack of understanding for both civ and wargame a like ;) 

The a.i. has a nice twitch to it and will certainly on the harder level pose a more then decent treat.
With enough variables accompanied such as 2 different difficulty scalers world builders and a multitude of other options such as terrain and wildlife even the base game offers a good amount of game fun

I would recommend you start with the base game and choose from there if you want to see the other faction dlc or not
I currently have all the dlc in possesion and i can't say without much of a regret.

Other negatives that point out the sometimes very small update choice of the developer seems to hold true for a bit. This behaviour is most expected around the release of new DLC packages or balancing changes to the game.

Diplomacy? That's for heretics. What Gladius loses in terms of strategic and economic depth, it replaces with deceptively deep and nuanced tactical combat. A combination of overwatch, strategic abilities, different unit types, melee combat and powerful abilities with cooldown timers mean that there is far more to combat than just spamming your favourite unit. The combat elevates this from being a lacklustre Civ clone to being a solid game in its own right.

There are only 4 races in the base game, but they all play very differently to one another (not just having slightly different bonuses and a unique unit). Further, the tech-tree is set up so that two people playing the same faction could still find themselves fielding different units and using wildly different strategies. 

The game also demonstrates a lot of love for its source material. Start looking through tool-tips or reading the tech-tree descriptions and you'll find a wealth of interesting and amusing titbits. (My favourite is the description of the tyranid construction 'building', which is both fascinating and horrifying.)

Complaints? Well, as good as the combat is, it can be relentless and get a bit tiresome after a while. And, whilst forgivable for a tiny studio with a tight budget, the game suffers from both bland background music and a total lack of voice acting. I miss the bombastic, hammy lines from the Dawn of War games. :(

Dawn of War, the glorious Dawn of War that indoctrinated us into this cruel Dune-inspired universe, was a long time ago. Everything that came after was excruciatingly underwhelming by comparison. It felt like the Emperor had abandoned us.

And to that Gladius blasts the door open, decrales you heretic and then purifies thou.

In true Warhammer fashion, Gladius grabs all the 4X genre conventions by their sullied beards, condemns them, tosses them out of the window on top the hive city and shoots them to death while they're still airborne. And I don't just mean no diplomacy - that's something to be taken for granted. What I mean is two things:

1. Gladius has ACTUALLY different faction mechanics. Each faction functions differently - not only on the one city - multiple cities, one resource - multiple resources level like in the second-boldest 4X out there that is Endless Legend. Here, each faction is just DIFFERENT: different units (and so many you probably won't use all the faction units in one play session), different tactics, different philosophies regarding territorial expansion, different research trees. Just different.

2. Gladius is as much a wargame as it is a 4X game. Battles happen right on the map, units have special active abilities, terrain matters, line of sight matters, firing distance matters. It's as if we're back to ye goode olde General series heyday if the General series was ten times better than it really was. It forces you to think both strategically and tactically, making you look for advantageous positions for your last stands or your pre-offensive footholds, and, when the fray breaks out, to think logistics in order to feed the front with the constant supply of fresh troops. War is the focus, and the focus is on the war.

Also, Gladius has respect for the source material. Texts are well-written and feel appropriately Warhammerly. The keyword here is ""appropriately"": the writers know the difference between ""Ima fantazi ork, Im stoopid"" and ""Letsahoot us sum gretchin outadiz here fingy we inginirious basterds just made outadiz here siminly uzles junk""

They also made veriaty a death sentence as the a.i. just spams whatever new unit it gets so by late game all the enemies you encounter are high tier with high armor making say necron worriers/orc boys ect useless and not even worth building which to me ruins any fun i would have fighting the a.i.

The game also have only one mode: random map, with two distinctive kind of play: to destroy all opposition or to complete all the quests. Both will earn player victory.

It's a very good table top but with no extras around to support it. -> 8/10

Gladius takes its inspiration specifically from Alpha Centauri. The maps are rich with hundreds if not a thousand of tiles of differents types including ressources, landscapes with attibutes and a very hostile fauna that does a really good job in putting you in alerte mode right from the start. The gameplay is what you can expect from a table top, it beats any Civilization game any day and warhammer 40K has nothing to envy when it comes to immersion and lore telling. Now that's where the game stop being great. ALL YOU HAVE IS A MAP GENERATOR, once you created your map you'll play against the AI (or your friends) and you'll get quests and texts to support the story but that's it. There is no specific campain mode, the campaign has been included in the sandbox. I didn't know what to think at first but once I got through my trial and errors I could start to expand on the map then the real ""gameplay storytelling "" began. You can do sieges, you can hit and run, you can play the war of attrition, you'll play on many front at the same time, exploring there, doing a siege here, call space drop or bombardement for urgent matters, buff you units, lvl you your heroes etc. The AI is also correct, it does smart stuff to annoy you and does very rarely let you kill its units for free. The music is a good match I love it and I say it sincerely with consideration it's great soundtrack.

If you love Warhammer 40k tabletop, you should love this.
If you love turn based hex wargames, you should love this.
This is NOT Warhammer Civ at all - do not think it is - but you may still love it.

The squads and unit selections are great. The range of units, and shown as individual troops / vehicles, are animated brilliantly. The shots of different weapon types look and impact the enemy EXACTLY as I expected them too from imagining the tabletop games. My only wish is they had rocket launchers with choice of missiles. The differences in play style between tactical, assault and devastator units are great. You really need a combined unit approach to balance out different units strength and weaknesses; a tactical unit will hardly scratch armour, but the devastator unit will be overwhelmed by an enemy assault unit. 

My favourites are the bigger units like terminator squads and vehicles. They crunch and zoom over the landscape.

The AI is good - at first kind of overwhelming until you work it out. Slowly building up units to support each other is really important, as is creeping forward with units supporting. Scout units are great and useful. They also pack a punch which is satisfying when your scout bikes slaughter a pack of AI neutral faction wild dogs. After a while you work out the AI, it could be more aggressive from what I've seen but I haven't played on the toughest settings yet. 

The research and resource elements are why I think some people, incorrectly, compare this to Civ. This is a wargame not city management. The research and production is an interesting element, and you are prioritising, but these are quite short tactical affairs rather than the nation building. You research to get improved weaponary, hero types and vehicles. You need to support your growth. That's it, but it's fun and feels like this is a battle. I often think the RTS games ""research"" is just silly since the battles appear in real time. Here I feel days are passing between turns as you are re-establishing the worldthat's fallen into disrepair.

Chaos Marines are coming! Awesome. 

Where are the Eldar?! 

Overall this is one of the best Warhammer 40k games you can buy if you like wargames and/or Warhammer 40k. It's a rich, immersing and challenging game that I can't stop. Get the Eldar released and add rocket launchers please!

No Diplomacy like many other 4X games, but with the bipolar implementation of AI diplomacy in other games like Civ, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  No flipping of close allies just because you defend yourself in a war, you always know where you stand.

Excellent game if you like the eXterminate side of 4X games.  Factions are varied and require different tactics to succeed.  Even the ""barbarians"" are challenging compared to other games, no running around with single scouts.  You can see that the time that would have been spent on Diplomacy went instead to focusing on combat and unit design, and for a warmonger like myself it really shows and is successful.

Tech tree at first seems quite basic, but actually allows for multiple paths to succeed depending on what you want to focus on.  Frontload for an early rush or economic advantage, or race for higher tiers for advanced units.

The combat is fluent and works well, it doesn't take long for action to ensue, you don't have to spend all game turtling until you get certain units, gameplay is fast paced (for a turn based game, at least), everything just works well. 

However, like all games, it has a few flaws/irks. 
The neutral units/bandits are plentiful and not at all balanced. Every one of them will cause you endless frustration throughout the entire length of the match. Even the weakest ones will murder your early game units with ease, and the toughest ones are next to impossible to deal with even mid game. All it takes is one wrong step around some trees you can't see past for half your army to be wiped out in a turn. The worst of it, is that there's no setting to get rid of them. Even while making a game if you choose 'Very Low' neutral units, they still take up quite literally half of the map. Most of my game time is fighting them instead of the other players. It is a serious pet peeve that I can't simply turn them off.

Secondly, the AI is arguably too easy. Even playing against them on hard, I only see them running around with 3 units and a single city before steamroll them in one turn. Then I'm back to fighting the neutral units again. Fml.

As other reviewers have stated, it's pretty much Civ with mostly military and aggressive expand approach. It's fun enough to play through, they have good lore and the units look like they belong in 40K.

The thing that kills it for me in this is they have quests for each race to complete as an 'endgame alternative' to wiping everyone else off the map. The final step of these is pretty damn hard, in every case I've hit. We're talking like all of a sudden there's like 40 floating death pyramids outside your main city while you're engaged across the map on 4 fronts. The different stages of these quests are locked behind invisible turn numbers so if you're trying to see all of a particular quest in a casual manner, you have to just advance turns to past 100-something, playing on standard speed.

They recently updated the game, awesome. Good to see that they're balancing some stuff out and getting ready for new expansion. Problem is that it killed every single last save that I have on record. Crashes to desktop with a window saying to email them the game logs and save games. So I do that, ask in the initial email if they have any way to just revert to the past version for a quick fix.

As others have said the UI is clean and without clutter, the graphics are quite good with a lot of detail to the models.  This is the first 40k game that I've played that seems to keep to the lore, and, it also has units I've not seen before outside the tabletop.  There is no useless army units - everything has its role, so the player is rewarded for using combined arms and not spamming units.  

There were quite a few complaints about the lack of army unit responses - well to be fair, I did not feel this was so much of an issue after a while of playing, when you have so many units it could become a bit annoying, but each to their own.

Gladius also has a surprisingly good AI that can retreat, regroup and rally to defeat you.  At the time of writing there were five factions to play (each playing very differently) which are Space Marines, Orks, Astra Millitarium, Necrons and Tyranids with Chaos on the way, though its worth noting that the last two are paid DLC and Chaos is not released till July 2019.

This is not a 4X game in the truest sense. If you are looking to an alternative to classics like Civ, there are plenty of other 4X games that stick closer to the tried and true formula. Gladius plays more like a more resource-intensive Advanced Wars. I recognize that my opinion is slightly bias, as I am heavily invested in the 40k universe, and Ive been playing the tabletop game for a number of years; however that experience lets me verify the authenticity of this game. It stays very true to the universe and its factions. Each race feels correct, and even the lore tibbits you can read in the compendium are detailed. The balance of the game isnt perfect, but the devs have been releasing patches constantly to fix bugs and balance issues. The cost of DLC for new factions is one thing that concerns me. The adjustments to unit stats fits a combat based strategy game, Each unit has several stats that influence how well it fairs against other types of units. The research trees are kinda straight forward, with key upgrades and obviously subpar ones. Each faction has gimmicks and mechanics that are very on theme, and allows for unique strategies as and against each faction. 

TLDR; would not recommend to pure 4X/Civ fans. Would recommend to fans of turn based strategy and the 40K universe. There are very few turn based strategy games that offer you this authentic variety of factions in the 40k universe.

I like the 40k setting, but the games can be hit or miss.  I wanted to like Sanctus Reach, but the production values were too weak.  I've played ALOT of Xcom and the Civ games and other 4x over the years, maybe my favorite genre.

So the graphics are decent.  The production values are decent, not top shelf with voice for troops --but nice touches like different text lines they say.  The game seems really well balanced, I'm in my third campaign with the third different army just to better understand the nuances.  Maybe the most important part, the AI seems decent so far.  Maybe even actually competent, which is a rarity and would make or break this game.  But I've had to abandon games at ""normal"" settings and I took to playing with an AI ally to watch them expand, more efficiently than me.

Bottom line, it so far has the ""just one more turn"" fever that keeps you playing for hours.  I now want to understand the nuances of the game better, I can see me playing this alot more in the future.   It's a 4x with no diplomacy, which I dont mind so much -- so maybe more like a Might and Magic: Heroes feel than Civ.   There is a campaign of sorts, every map is a random map but you can complete faction quests in addition to just eliminating the competition.  And it lets you keep playing after you ""win,"" which I found useful to finish the faction story and get the achievements.

But, turns out it's a good something alien! Maybe it's because I'm typically a Chaos player that I'm comfortable with this process.

This game lacks the typical battlefield chaos. No Orcish roars, no bodies or vehicle hulks littering the fields. It feels slow, with victory or defeat coming turn by turn, rather than hordes vanquished in a few seconds of explosions, or descending in screaming hordes on your final base.

What it lacks in adrenaline fueled excitement though, it makes up for in depth. It's nice to have every hex having more than just cover. There's resource and other attribute values. You get to play with lots of units, including many I've never seen outside the table top. The other Warhammer 40K games often have just a few rather predictable units from each race. 

Having to do logistics and long range movement and deal with morale shows aspects of Warhammer 40K that would realistically have to exist, but are just never really a part of most games that focus only on battle. This game reminds me a little bit of a meld between Warhammer 40K and Sid Meier's Civilization. The focus is combat, but there's an alternate path to victory with quests and a lot of Civilization type world development, city management and ""Wonders of the World"" type achievements.

My only minor issue with the game so far is that I feel like the Necrons dimensional doorway system isn't quite right. Back in Soul Storm, for instance, Necrons could move to a lot of sites that they'd built upon, so the system was useful. In Gladius, you can only move back to cities or, I believe, between cities and a Monolith, once you finally build one. This means very few places you can go as Necrons using this system.

It is as many other players described it as a much more battle focused civilization type game. Every faction has a noticeably different playstyle and method of combat.  The AI on regular is okay. As you can easilly annihilate them one on one without any real danger when you attack them early game. However if you are doing a free for all with more than 4 factions on then it can lead to some pretty challenging scenarios. You may defeat your neighbor rather quickly but it take up your early game time. Mid and late game makes the other computer players much harder to kill as they will have properly developed and have fully fledged armies.

Note that the reviews complaining about difficulty are either wrong or outdated. I easily won my first game vs 4 AIs (all different factions) on normal difficulty. It was not hard, although it wasn't a walk in the park either. The AI is very good at shooting and running (aka kiting), which is good when there's only few units around. But it means you can take resource spots easily and they can't sustain a big battle despite having enough units, as they will keep retreating shifting the numbers in your favour. Quite silly AI design, a bit more berserker behaviour in numbers would help.

The complaint about neutral enemies being too strong is valid; you have no way of dealing with them for a while and if you run aimlessly across the map without scouting then Enslavers will steal your units. Given that they can only do this if they don't move it is quite easy to avoid unless you run into a forest and by accident end up next to them.

WARHAMMER 40,000: GLADIUS - RELICS OF WAR, a strategy game with a Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION and Slitherine PANDORA visual style but totally focused on the brutal warfare and bloodshed of WARHAMMER 40,000.  It has it's own unique blood soaked thriving on nihilistic warfare character and playstyle.

The way combat is done is incredible as it feels more meaty and like a fast paced turn based game where units can last longer and have a chance to retreat even after devastating casualties to rebuild. There is a sense of a unit being one cohesive force or character acting in unison.

Hero units make a major difference being able to heavily damage if not outright annihilate tougher units. My Ultramarine chaplain was able to take on a Necron unit dealing lethal casualties to it when before my Ultramarines on their own got wiped out.

Mass combat is the way to go and pulling back damaged troops so they can heal, come back in the fight to gather more experience to level up becoming better after each battle.

The immense variety of encounters from enemy faction skirmishes, discovering relics and enhanced technology to the planet itself which thrives with native life forms out to kill consume everything in their path is amazing. Each faction feels very different with their own individual playstyles. I have definitely felt the differences from the Ultramarine faction in comparison to the Necrons. The world of WARHAMMER 40,000 GLADIUS - RELICS OF WAR feels very alive.

Resource gathering and city building are very important as it is what will keep your armies coming in and growing. There are buildings such as the armory which will allow you to build vehicles while other buildings deal with city population growth and loyalty among many other factors. You can also build outpost like defenses around cities and throughout the map. Orbital satellites allow one to scan hidden areas of the map to reveal important information on less hostile areas and possible threats etc. 

A very indepth skill tree gives the player the ability to craft their faction to their liking with many indepth choices filled to the brim like a cup of morning coffee with WARHAMMER 40,000 tech. 

Graphics are nightmarish works of art capturing perfectly the grim death entrenched character etched into every face and physical fiber of the WARHAMMER 40,000 universe. Zooming in on a Necron's forboding image is eerie as if it too is looking back at me. Imperial Guardsmen look very detailed and gorgeously modeled full of military pomp and circumstance.

The writing is pure magnificent deliciousness like the finest drink known to man become The Emperor's word. It has the inspiring imagination triggering detailed imagery of a Dan Abnett novel which leaves the reader wanting more.

Audio.. a funeral march across a universal holocaust where all is slaughter as battlefields are nourished with gushing blood upon the screaming symphony where death is incarnate. From the steed like bikes of the Ultramarines to the flesh crushing Necron vehicles the shrill soul electrifying horror echoing in the air will grip your mind with the intense desire to fight or flee.  The unearthly futuristic sounds of weapon fire like some damned chorus from the darkest corner of the warp emanates life snatching intensity. What a glorious melodic song sings from the Psychic Primiris weapon!

Music, INTENSE! DYNAMIC! MENACING! EXPLOSIVE! TRIBAL! FUTURISTIC SCIENCE FICTION EXCELLENCE!

Headphones guide thee in the purity of the moment.  
 
WARHAMMER 40,000: GLADIUS - RELICS OF WAR, BUY IT! PLAY IT! Be consumed in a world where survival is the only treasure.

Cons- The spamming of units is a bit overdone me thinks. I don't mind it with regular factions but when suddenly finding myself facing off against five Castellan Robots at once with more wandering around nearby it makes the game world feel off and more like a arcade game of huge numbers coming at one. Castellan Robots are supposed to be some sort of ancient rare technological weapon so to see huge numbers piled up all over the place does not give a sense of game balance in comparison of the factions which are supposed to be huge armies of Orcs, Space Marines, Tyranids etc.",1531489606,1550270637,True,15,0,0.627582013607025146,2,True,False,False

It was almost completely ignored until a professional trainer was made by a third party.

It is no secret among game devs that they leave these things easy to access, often going so far as to create their own, built in version of such cheats.  Their job is NOT to compete with players.  Their job is to please customers.

Well, I am not pleased and avoid Warhammer games and this is one reason.  The other is the reason to use the cheats in the first place.  There is too much of a time sink in the game.

For a Warhammer game?  Fantastic.  While focusing on the armies and combat, it does not neglect economy, research, or city building.  Each aspect of the game is fun, and allows you to strategize without being overwhelming.  The first thing I noticed was that before you enter a game, there are a plethora of options to customize your game beforehand.  From individual AI difficulty to how large you want certain regions.  In-game there is a storyline that you may follow, aside from the ongoing objective to eliminate everyone.  Every faction has different objectives and stories, but it will be the same thing every time you play a faction.  In game, the combat system is turn-based, your damage is done on your turn, and vice versa.  Overall, the gameplay makes sense, it's simple without being too simple that strategy doesn't matter, and each faction feels unique.  Very enjoyable, especially with friends.


Positives:
- A combat focused 4X strategy that covers all aspects of 4X well.
- Each faction feels like that faction.
- Each unit can level up, gain experience, and literally earn a name for themselves.
- The customization for each game is awesome and in-depth.
- Good, long research tree.
- Inclusion of many Warhammer 40K mechanics such as overwatch
- Attention to detail with lore

Negatives:
- The DLC policy is... iffy.  Perhaps a bit much for what the game is, however if they put these resources to improving the game and adding more factions of features, then I will have no qualms and even turn this into a positive.
- The color palette is limited, nothing compared to that of Dawn of War.  You only get one, base color for everyone.  This is actually important for factions in the Warhammer universe because of things like Space Marine chapters or Necron dynasties.  It would make a very nice aesthetic and immersive difference.
- Even the ""huge"" map feels relatively small.  Which is a shame, because you can add many more players than the game recommends, so the potential is there.

It has a light economy layer, and a very light technology unlock system. But that is fine, because it does exploration and combat really well. It's a bit like the civ-series, but with a much more heavy focus on combat and pushing frontlines, holding choke points, countering enemy units, flanking around to get at backline ranged nukers, healing damaged units in time, etc.

While the game does a fantastic job at most things combat, it is still light on content - even after a few DLCs. The game desperately need MANY more playable races, an option for bigger maps, and more randomized world content - to up the fun and novelty of exploration. It wouldn't take long to add small resources piles to pick up for example, or just an item here and there to encourage uncovering more map. This should be just a few hours of development time guys, cmon ;)

Unfortunately the lack of content and the need for DLCs makes the game a bit expensive. I think some free content is due, to balance things out a bit and increase the value of the purchase for new and existing customers.

INTRO

I rarely write game reviews, but I believe this one deserves my time and effort. As I'm writing this review I have 27 hours in the game and I can see myself playing many more hours in the future. Let me begin by saying this game isn't perfect by any means, but still manages to successfully inherits some of the strongest features from other strategy and 4X games. For instance the careful city deployiment and management, the detailed and strategic turn-based combat, the skill/leveling system, the items mechanics, and many more.

A NICE ADDITION TO THE GENRE

Although I have sunk hundreds of hours into Civ 5 and the Total War series, things such as diplomacy, culture, religion, trading, etc got me tired after a while. Heck, sometimes I just want to get straight into the combat. Gladius Relics of War puts the player right into the grim, visceral universe of the 41th millennium. It's a welcome addition to have such a well designed W40k experience brought to the genre, which some modders already tried to achieve before around the Civ series as well as other turn-based games.

GAMEPLAY

Players can choose from four different factions: Astra Militarum, Necrons, Orks and Space Marines. They recently added a fifth faction, Tyranids, which is only available through a paid DLC. Each faction plays different, which adds to replayability. In addition, because players can choose from different 'builds' (biological, mechanical, melee, ranged, etc) they need to carefully plan ahead which route to go. One thing worth mentioning is that each city is able produce more than one thing at the same time, since buildings within the city have their own production queues.

ARTISTIC/TECHNICAL ASPECTS

The graphics do the job pretty well (I'm glad it's NOT cartoony/stylized). Sound effects are pretty good, each faction sounds very unique. Soundtrack is also good, although nothing to be compared to the fantastic DoW2 soundtrack. On the technical side, the game stability is fine. I had a crash during my first few hours into the game, which got me worried at first. Then I found out that the single player matches are automatically saved every turn, so no big deal.

THE DEVELOPERS

The developers are listening to the community and they're implementing what players are asking for, which is VERY good for the future of the game. How awesome would it be to have Tau, Eldar and Chaos Demons as playable factions, even in the form of paid DLCs? As a W40k fan and former wargame player, I would buy them at will. I will gladly keep supporting the developers in the hopes of seeing some other quality DLCs and even other 4X games from them.",1549302549,1549302549,True,6,0,0.510516107082366943,0,True,False,False

Let me start off by saying this has been the closest Dawn of War experience I've felt since Relic went under. Is it the 100% most AAA title out there under the 40k liscence? No, but unlike other games which feel like a cheap cashgrab. This game has shown promise. It plays like Civ5, minus needless diplomacy in the 41st Millinium where there is only war. It's fun, it has a very fresh Dawn of War feel to it, but also tries to wrangle two differnt types of games and succeeds. Bottom line, I'd give it a checkout if you're looking for a 40k with some conquest potential.

The good:
.Being turned based, you can make your own campaigns and take over the map. It's like Civ5, which is fine with how they got it.

.Tyranids,Necrons, and both factions of the Imperium. 

.The aliens put up a very good fight, you have to fight off a lot of lifeforms that haven't been seen much in the lore. Making it a challange. 

.There's hints of what's yet to come.

.Heroes are fun

.Each faction plays how you would expect them to.

The bad:
.No Chaos, (but I have a feeling they're going to add them.)

.There are some animation kinks, but nothing too game breaking.

.The AI is rather dumb, even when it is on your side it doesn't try to help you. (I had one squad of guardsmen I tried to reclaim get shot by allied Space Marines.)

.Some units are missing, but I deduce that there will be more unit packs in the future.

.It is indie, and needs support.

.It would be cool to add some named hero units, but this is not a issue. It's not trying to be Total Warhammer.


.I've not played MP yet, but balance maybe needed in the forseeable future. However, I cannot confirm or deny balance issues as of this moment.

I gave it a try after seeing something on reddit. What I found is something that just scratches the right itch for me.

One thing that I have disliked about the more recent 4x games using hexes (civ, endless legends, etc) is that combat strategy was slow and clunky. It dragged into mid game and always made me angry how cumbersome war was. Felt like 40 turns to get to the enemy and when you got there your army was obsolete. 

Not so with Gladius-Relics of War. Combat from start to finish is a joy for me. Light unit armies dance around the battle while your heavy tanks and mechs bear down for some robo-stomping. It feels good. 
Additionally factions all play asymmetrically. It’s quite a different game each time you try a new faction. While I’m not great at the game yet, but even losing has been a blast. Unit statistics and abilities are detailed and the hex map works flawlessly. 

One final thing. The way the game does unit building and construction in cities is great. Units are produced in separate buildings and you can build more to increase speed of that type of unit. It’s more like a traditional rts style in a way that really adds to the game.  I would like to see other 4x strategies games do a similar thing.

When you are in the zoomed out overhead view it looks like many 4x games but when you zoom in you can see all the 40k goodness. Superbly detailed 40k figures with excellent animations. The day after I came back to this game they released a new faction, the Tyranids. I had played about 24 hours, was loving it, then, BAM, new faction.

This game is wide open and it wouldnt surprise me to see all of the factions eventually, since the game is well recieved and positively reviewed. The game doesnt just look and sound great but it plays well. The AI is the best I have encountered on this type of game. The opponents are so crafty they will drive you crazy at times,  even on normal setting. Enslavers stealing your units and running into the shadows making it as hard as possible to free your guys. The neutrals setting up ambushes in the tree lines making matters worse, but it works both ways. I had a space marine AI partner that was legit the Emperor's finest. He set up defensive lines that withstood attacks from multiple fronts, and mobilized every time i pushed on one of the enemies. I improved my game a lot by implementing tactics I learned from that AI partner.. For me, Gladius has endless replayability. Yet they are still adding factions and content. The game doesnt just say ""Victory"" at the end, it gives you a nice bar graph analysis of the players performence in various categories after the match.

 The depth of the tech tree is compelling, with many techs per teir, and 10 teirs deep. The skills of the units  can affect the outcome of a battle. You level up units and choose new skills for them via tech, or directly in the character card for heros, and while we are at it lets just have war gears to throw on our guys. heck even some of the war gear adds abilities on top of stats..lol. i just never expected this level of micro detail at the unit level of a 4x game that does the macro civ management / tech so well. it reminds me of starcraft, it reminds me of dawn of war, it reminds me of total war, it reminds me of company of heroes,  yet its turn based.

First the positive:
The game looks great and is technically well-done. I found no bugs so far, and probably won't find them in the future.

Because I won't play this crap game any more.

Take Civilization, remove diplomacy and add several accumulatable ressources. Then remove builders, spys, settlers and every other civillian unit and convert the entire tech tree to military, but keep the slow-a** combat.

This game takes a framework that is made for slow buildup and tries to run a game of turn-based strategy battles on it which it is not suited for. Don't take me wrong, it works, but it is so damn slow and uninteresting. You take turn after turn moving units over a huge empty map. You battle NEUTRAL enemies most of the time and try to get past them while not losing all your early units to Enslavers (who STEAL them and use them against you). The neutral enemies are more dangerous than the actual enemy units.
The tech tree is probably pretty easy but it takes so long to understand the whole mechanics of the game. ""Building gives +10% (SYMBOL)"". Of how much? Of what is produced in this town, or in all towns? What is this symbol? It's in a tooltip so I can't mouseover it. ""Allows to harvest adjacent ressources"" - Wait, I thought I just have to capture the outpost to get them? Razorweed or what it is called - supposedly dangerous, but it does NOT tell me exactly what it does until I walk in and try to find out.
After three(!) hours I finally found the first enemy base and ran over it. Two more enemies to go, both of which I hadn't even encountered yet. I had enough and quit the match.
Of course, since the match had taken so damn long, my requests for a refund was refused because I had played the game for more than 2 hours. This is a joke. You have no chance to get an impression of the game in under 2 hours.

Gladius is polished and turns resolve extremely fast. There is a heavy focus on combat with a large unit roster. No diplomacy, so this is more like a 3x, but I prefer the combat to heckling an ai on a diplomacy screen. 

There is no campaign in this game, but why would a 4x lite require one? A campaign would literally boil down to a glorified tutorial. 

The ai holds its own on higher difficulty, and the neutral creeps create a hazardous environment at every turn. Recommend if you are interested in a combat focused 4x lite.",1547766957,1547766957,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
489630,48388252,76561198030217555,0,165,948,0,919,1547950409,"Gladius is a gem that got lost in the sea of shoddy 40k remakes of various games. It's a turn based 4x strategy game that at first glance appears to be a shallow civ-clone ala Warlock: Masters of the Arcane; when it is in fact a tightly designed combat centric 4x game. The core game loop is ""found a city, turn it into a economic powerhouse, churn out units, kill"", as you are trying to build a web of efficient cities capable of sustaining your war effort. In this way, Gladius feels more remenicant of 90's era grand strategy titles where you go in with huge groups of units. 

It's dripping in lore, which of course isisn't applied 100% correctly but they made sure to sue as many names and monsters as they could. Planet Gladius has EVERYTHING from Ambulls to Catachan Devils to gigantic columns of Kastellan robots, making the ""barbarian"" enemies extremely diverse and interesting. Every faction has their iconic units and heroes with a little fat trimmed off. The orks for example don't have Kommandos but they are referenced. For not having a real story mode, the game has a LOT of writing and voicework; most of which looks extremely well researched to the point where you can forgive any mistakes they made. 

I was legitimately shocked by how well applied the games mechanics are. You have combat units. That is it, and that is how it should be. Every faction's ""engineery"" style unit has the abilitiy to build a city, with every other unit in the game serving as combat fodder. This is what I expected coming in, and that's what I got. The result is the game never hands you junk units, they are all useful for various reasons. Picking where to build cities is disgustingly easy, you just look for as many special resource tiles withing 3 spaces of your city location as possible; and customize the city to take advantage of them.

There is no diplomacy, for in the grim dark future there is only war. This was very jarring to me, the game litterally tells you almost nothing about your opponents. There's no intrigue, no spying, no truce, no nuetrality. If you exist on this planet and aren't on the same team as them, you will need to shoot them. In this way the game gives you a total blank check for your military budget, expecting you to fight out your problems with the game world. 

Even after Angry Joe favored it on his show I was extremely skeptical of this game when it came out because there were so many 40k skinned games coming out at the time, including the left 4 dead clones Vermintide and that Space Hulk shooter.  And from what I heard, Gladius had a rough release. Thankfully recent patches and new content have begun to make Gladius a very tight product, the units now have barks they make that help immerse you into the game world. 

In short, every part of this game feels fun to both 4X and Warhammer players. Cities have minimal busywork attached, combat is meaty and appealing, and the tech tree is laid out in a way that quickly gives you access to fun units.

An excellent example of this is that Gladius does not feature diplomacy, which kind of makes it a 3X game. What it lacks in diplomacy, is well compensated for by an excellent combat system. Personally, I am very happy to accept the concept of ""there is only war in the grim dark future"" and as such no diplomacy; purely because the combat systems are pretty damn fun.

What I believe Gladius really excels at, is variety. The game has a fantastic way of making each faction and its units feel unique. While playing a campaign as the Necrons, I definitely felt the difference compared to the Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard!!!).

I would definitely recommend this game to any strategy fan while it is on sale, it is an excellent purchase while discounted. I would not recommend it to a standard strategy fan while at full price though. However; if you are a 40K fan, I would recommend it all year round. The simple fact that this is a 40K game explains its lack of diplomacy and increased focus on all out war well to a 40K fan, but translates poorly to others in my opinion.

As other reviews have said, it has some superficial similarities to Civ but the focus really is on war. Resource gathering and research is there just to produce troops/vehicles and upgrade them. These are used to take over key points on the map and eventually eliminate all other teams. In that respect it is similar to an RTS such as DOW and that's how it feels to play, albeit in a turn based manner. Another way to look at it is it similar to Armageddon in terms of turn based hex based combat but with the additional strategic elements of production and resource gathering.  
It all comes together pretty well. I have no problem with it being a 4X focused purely on war. There are a lot of tactical elements to the combat, such as range, cover, accuracy, armour, etc. AI seems fairly robust so far and as soon as I upped the difficulty to hard I got my butt kicked so there is enough challenge to keep coming back. I like the huge amount of options for setting up a game, you can adjust just about everything to do with the map, number of factions and teams, individual skill levels of teams, map size, etc. The interface is clear and I really like the way it focuses on everything you need to do each turn.
Game runs fine on my low-mid spec laptop. Stable, no crashes or problems. Graphics are on par for this type of game, I quite like the map terrain, unit animations and sound are a bit basic, but they do the job. Haven't played online so can't comment there.  
A few minor niggles, it would be good to have unit voices, and a unit painter would be nice, but neither is a dealbreaker for me. Acheivements and extra factions are already on the way. Dev support seems good. I had no problem supporting the dev buying the extra content, especially since I got it on sale and I'm sure I will get the 'Nids when they come out.

It's very fun & tactical with each race behaving quite differently. It's true that it's like a faster-paced Civ but with a greater focus on combat and capturing resources. 

Because it's mostly just building and pumping units, you might compare it more to an RTS in slow-motion (turns). Building/managing your city is still very important though, and can make or break you. Unlike Civ, its combat is far more tactical offering more abilities per unit and equipment/items for ""hero"" units. Whether to move in close-range to do more damage or fire guns only from a couple tiles back is another consideration. Also, unlike Civ, you can construct buildings and pump units at the same time in separate queues (which was a welcome change for me). The slowness of sharing a build queue in Civ games was really torturous to me.

On a side note, the AI is very good and fun to ally with or fight against. Unit management (microing) and keeping your units alive is key to winning.

To put it succintly: this is a brilliantly designed strategy game undermined by its unavoidable lack of larger-than-life moments. 


Complaint #1
Outside of Gladius the 40K setting is delightfully over the top. Orks don't incrementally fight or move. They bellow war cries and blow themselves up with oversized guns. Space Marines don't gradually defeat enemies, they shout ""He who stands with me shall be my brother!"" As they die gloriously in the service of the their beloved Emperor.

Yet in Gladius, the very nature of the well designed strategic gameplay inadvertently works against conveying that larger-than-life flavor. The absence of the audio barks and viseral interactive animations found in Dawn of War is keenly felt. And the action that is conveyed is both gradual and viewed from afar.

The gradualism and incremental nature of combat and movement create a clever and challenging strategy game, but by their very nature mute the bombastic decisiveness of the 40K setting.

The result is an experience that feels muted and stifled when compared to many other 40K titles. Yet in fairness keep in mind, this game was made by a small studio that simply can't match the production budget of many other 40K based games.


Complaint #2
Some claim the game is out of balance, but this simply isn't true. It is just cleverly designed to actually challenge players, forcing them to adapt their strategy and tactics. Each faction and unit type presents a unique threat. 

Necrons aren't overpowered. They just counter high HP units better than any other faction and demand you develop efficient focus fire, line of battle and pursuit tactics. Otherwise, that isolated, lascannon armed Predator tank that served you well battling Ork Killer Kans, is going to struggle when it is ambushed in a forest by Necron Warriors.


YMMV Complaint #3
Some complain about bugs, but the game has been rock solid for me and I've encountered zero issues. Perhaps those complaints are the exception or legacy issues from eariler builds?


Praise #1
Once you get past the stifled 40K presentation shock, you'll realize this is a finely tuned and brilliantly designed strategy game for those with the patience to enjoy it. All your choices matter and there is a lot to master and explore. 

This game has been crafted to truly reward retreat and regroup versus unit spam. Combined arms, hit and run, pursuit, evasion, delaying actions, and more all elegantly and natural emerge during play. 

The elegant combat system and special abilities achieves a surprising amount of unit variety. And the addition of resources and buildings gives context to every decision; amping up the angst and intensity of every battle and deployment.


Praise #2
The AI is truly impressive compared to its genre peers. It understands how to expand, retreat, regroup, focus fire, and secure objectives. It isn't perfect, or equal to an expert player, but it is good enough to challenge such a player. Provided that player is willing to accept the asymetrical challenge of fighting a multi-front war with wandering monsters stomping about.


40K Fans' Praise #3
Once you get past the stifled setting presentation shock, you'll find there is an epic amount of 40K goodness to enjoy. The audio and graphics successfully invoke much of the glory and grandeur of the setting. The UI is clean, accessible and feels polished.

It's very similar to Endless Legend, but it doesn't seem to have the bugs E.L. did, and it's just straight up war - you build your cities, you build your production bulldozers, and you wipe the map.  I was VERY much on the fence about the price, and turns out for good reason - I don't feel it was worth $40 of my money.  It is a fantastic game (in my opinion much better than Endless Legend), but I wish I would've waited to purchase it until it was on sale for no more than $30.  I'll likely get hundreds of hours out of it, so I'm not refunding it, but I would've been happier if I got it a little cheaper than full price.  If you love WH40K, this is a MUST HAVE.  If you liked Endless Legend and you like WH40K even a little bit, this is a MUST HAVE.  If not, wait until it's on sale, but keep your eye on it and definitely purchase it.  Here are some games I like so you get some context: X-com (the most recent ones), Total War (most of them, but in particular Warhammer 1&2), Endless Legend, Star Wars Empire at War & FOC, Civ V, and I'm ok with Endless Space but I didn't jump around about it.  And this game is a must have to me.  If you have similar tastes, you won't be wasting your money with this one - it'll keep you entertained for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.  I'm sure the developers intend to add Chaos, Eldar, and Tyranids with some paid DLCs, and if the reviews look good and they're out long enough for me to get them on sale, i'll likely purchase them too.  I didn't get any of the current DLC and don't intend to.  Again, fantastic game, very very very well put together.  :-)

I sent the email about 3am - got a response at about 8am the same day and there was active effort to actually work the problem, not just a blanket ""oh sorry sucks to be you have a nice day we already have your money"" email like we've all received over the years from the big 3AAA's out there.

[list]
[*]The weapons sound very good, makes attacking a joy
[*]The 4 factions are very unique. Not just their units, but also how they use resources and how they build things.
[*]Plenty of tactical variety, where even your lowly guardsman can learn how to use grenades and med kits to make him last... well a bit longer.
[*]AI can hold his own and receives regular patches
[*]Plenty of options to tailor the difficulty using teams and various income bonuses or penalties
[*]A nice selection of WH40K units, from the iconic Space Marines to Necron Doomsday Arks and even Enslavers
[*]Lots of lore bits. Even the buildings have a paragraph of lore attached to them and I enjoy reading it all.

[h1]Not so good bits[/h1]

[*]Only 4 factions
[*]Resource usage can be a bit weird, with Space Marines I regularly run out of Influence, while as [strike]Imperial Guard[/strike] Astra Militarum I'm drowning in the stuff and barely get to spend it due to other resources being a bigger issue
[*]No epic voice lines. I know this is a small team behind the game, but I am missing me some ""HE WHO STANDS WITH ME SHALL BE MY BROTHER""

The overall feel of the game is atmospheric in that you are constantly fearing what may lie behind a city or mountain range, I have lost so many units to scouting like an idiot in this game. In most 4X games, you tend to have quite a great deal of movement freedom in the early game as you can scount a bit of the map fairly easily, but in this, I literally have never seen the entire map in any of my playthroughs. I tend to scout maybe 10 or 15 hexes away and that is it, then I sit in my base and fear what comes next :)

Overall, I would say that this game while brutally difficult even on the easy setting, will appeal to many (not just to those who like 40K) as it is again a tactical 4X game, we have gotten used to the soft style of most games now, the type that hold your hand and gradually walk you into the deeper water. Not so with this. You are plunged into a hellscape that will try its best to rip you to shreads the moment you start. Move your soldiers one space too far to the left and you die, move into open ground and enemies right there and you die. Stay in your base and wait, you die. I have only won 2 games that I have played, the tutorial mission and once against the easiest setting and even then it was a battle to get it right.

I like that the developers have been updating to the game and adding content as they go, I hope they also stick to their dev logs and add in additional races as I think having a massive battle with 12 or so different races would be so amazingly brilliant and it would also add in different play styles, like hit and run tactics for Dark Eldar and long range destruction with the Tau.

This is 40K, this is WAR.

No diplomacy.

4 distinct factions with their strengths and weaknesses, well balancced and AI is getting continuous upgrades which is very welcome.

You can play multiplayer (co-op or VS) and of course single player.

There's no campaign, which, while a pity, is alleviated by the fact that each faction has an optional set of story/campaign quests that are quite hard to complete and that are an alternate form of victory condition (you can toggle it on/off at map start).

The random map generator is well done and there are numerous options.

You can put players in preset teams as well as tinker with all kinds of settings for specific buildings, wildlife, terrain etc.

You found cities, manage your ecconomy and build units with which you defend against the wildlife, conquer outposts for economic boosts and artifacts for all kinds of boosts and ultimately lay waste to enemy player capitals.

Plays like any other 4x where deciding research and capturing resources is key... minus having to worry about the politics. (You can, however, make a team and play coop with a friend.) 

Orks are cheeky buggers, Spess Mehreens all have sticks in their collective asses, Imperial Guard (because I refuse to acknowledge the whole astra militarum BS) are all regular dudes with brass balls and laser pointers... and the necrons are green and glowy. They paid true to most of the models and units as well, EXCEPT in the case of Devistator and Heavy weapons teams- both are geared for vehicles mainly and the AI loves to spam these late game. 

Each faction are fairly well balanced with unit research spread evenly across the tech tree and all are pretty handy. Mostly. (No whirlwind or Rhino troop transports.) 

Personal opinions/gripes-

Get it on sale. Current content is cool but not worth 40 bucks. it's still pretty fun!

Graphics are really pretty and do the combat justice... The Ork commentary is pretty funny too!

I'd love to see another faction than the Space Smurfs. Why does every game dev think we want to play as the Adeptus Dildodies of Rowboat Girlyman? Maybe we want to be the Rainbow Warriors or the ANGRY MARINES. I'm personally fond of Lord Adorable's Imperial Fists myself.

No chaos- Which is really weird considering most 40k lore.  No 'Nids, Tau, or Eldar either. Will probably be added as DLC later if at all.

This was one of the reasons I even considered this game, modding support would have been crucial to fixing some of the issues it has. Very recently in another thread devs have now said workshop support will never happen because their contract with Games Workshop wont allow it. So they intentionally misled people around release into thinking the game was going to get something they knew they could never add, presumably to get a few extra sales. This kind of scummery shouldn't be acceptable. If I was inside the refund window at this point I would refund and walk away from this company for good.

In addition to that today the game released the first DLC, it's $5 for 4 units. They say 5 units but one of them isn't playable. That's it, that's all the DLC has, 4 playable units, for $1.25 each. Seriously?

-------------

Original review: Have to down vote this for now out of principal. It's not a 4x game even though it's plastered all over the store page. There's no diplomacy, no non-combat gameplay, and it has more or less basic RTS style units and progession, except in a very slow turn based environment.

As a strategy game it's mediocre and I probably would have upvoted it as like a 65-70%. It's pretty light, combat is simplistic 1UPT civ5 style, but the one thing it has going for it are that the 4 factions play very differently. It also borrows heavily from the Endless games with the story based missions mixed into the normal gameplay, but from what I've seen so far the missions aren't very interesting or rewarding, they do add some story and help diversify the factions even more though. I expect late game on large maps will be a huge slog as there isn't any sort of unit cap and upkeep is pretty cheap, even just moving a dozen or so units around every turn is pretty slow and I don't think I'd be able to handle 50-60+.

It plays a whole lot like the well known civilization series but much more simpler in terms of diplomacy and economy because war is eternal.

You don't need much of a reason or even any story at all. You just start, and the eternal war begins anew. 

A simple tech system and easy to remember counter units make the learning curve quite nice, even for the ""hard"" factions. 

I kind of missed the atmosphere. While the soundtrack is really great, it quickly begins to repeat and the all time epic battle music even gets boring. The units are all voiceless and even the heroes do not have something like a sentence once they spawn. This lack of personality is the main reason I got bored after just a couple of hours and had to do many single sessions instead of one big one.

Unfortunately, I can't really recommend it because I really think this game did a disservice to Warhammer 40k and was only ""ok"" for the 4x.

Game play comes down to a so-so outing along the Alpha Centari line. That is: a Civilization style game where there is plenty of alien wildlife, etc. 

Fundamentally, nothing about the game feels like 40k. You've got a 40k skin, but 40k is all about combined arms. This game uses the 1 unit per tile style of play, meaning it's difficult to get a real combined arms type of fight. 

Game pace is just slow(too much of a trend in 4x and similar games lately!). 

Quests are just a distraction and if you're not familiar with them, will become too hard as you will inevitably advance too quickly through them and some of them drop a large number of enemy units on the board, causing you a lot of grief. Once you know what the quests are, you manage the triggers and then they become no challenge.

I can't get past the feeling that this started as a total conversion mod for Civ 5/BE, but at some point decided it could be its own game without really justifying it. Do I like the game? Do i fine it entertaining? Yes, I do. But the problems of replayablity begin almost immediately after you finish your first game. Given that the only action to victory, is either quests or murder, the game tends to play rather simplistically. I do like the additional mechanics that this TC/full game brings to established mechanics of Civ 5/BE. Most notably the hero mechanics and shop mechanics. The system has massive potential for future development. Id like to see the mechanic expanded where the factions have access to different items, where necrons outright get their own list, which is procured via a building in their city. 

I’m somewhat disappointed that I can’t edit the guns used within my squad. A WH40k game just doesn’t feel right without the ability to edit your squads down to the guns. Also, there are some noteworthy bugs, crash issues, and other nitpicks that just annoy you more than anything else. My personal favorite is that items for heroes can be equipped more than once, but don’t stack, nor inform you of their uniqueness. I’m also somewhat disappointed in some of the visuals. While the unit models are on point, some of the ability and firing effects are just awful. The orbital strikes look pathetic as well as the necron monolith particle whip. 

Given that I keep comparing this to its almost identical cousin, CIV 5/BE, BE had a tech web which was far more engaging for player choice. With 10 tiers of research, you could really play with that. I wish this game had workshop, with an SDK, I would be playing with this concept immediately. Player choice, and any attempts to improve that, be it more options during your turns, possible diplomacy, a more complicated resource system, new factions, new units, new items and call ons, would be the correct way forward with this game. 

Final verdict. Good for about 5h oh gameplay. Recent AI improvements have pushed this to around 8h. The game does have a noticeable lack of player choice. Which is a problem. But as a TC mod for Civ 5/BE, this is a great title that has potential to expand.

In all honesty, it is an entertaining game. However, it's just a giant skirmish. The ""story"" is really just some objectives tossed up sequentially while in ""skirmish"" mode. I'm not a real multiplayer guy either.

There also feels a lot of Fanboy stuff thrown in at random. Yes, it's cool that there is a Catachan Devil, but alongside, Enslavers and Psychneuein, but each of those individual creatures could conquer a planet on their own.

Toss in some random annoying Kroot Hounds, and you have a mix of someone who really thinks the 40K world is cool, but not an understanding of how it all works together.

Of course the unit's reflect this as well. Sure, there are a lot of iconic WH40K units, but once more, haphazardly thrown together without a real sense of 40K. It basically feels like each faction is a cookie cutter, but with slight tweeks to make each one ""unique"".

I also believe that stripping the game down (as many here criticize) is NOT a bad thing. It helps simplify and allows focusing on the thing that is most important: Tactical (almost table-toppy) combat on a hex-field turn based map, which even includes tricky terrain such as heights and cliffs. Do I need to discuss peace with the Necron-filth and Ork-scum?  Not on my watch, Sir! 

Anyone complaining this game not being 4x – please think again. Explore, Expand, Extract, Exterminate: ALL of these are abundant and form the core loop of the game. Yes, indeed more from a military aspect, but then again – it’s WARHAMMER 40.000. Duh. Whaaargh-aya expekkt?

Really very good presentation and intuitive user guidance. 

Lastly my only gripe: I would LOVE to have the units voiced, providing some randomized vocal responses. DLC? I would pay for it. The unit text-lines displayed in-game work surprisingly well, but come on, it’s 2018 – quality recording ain’t as expensive as it used to be….

Choice of four iconic Warhammer 40,000 races to lead to victory or defeat with the developers working on a new race.  The world builder has had some upgrades which you can access via open beta and these upgrades give much more granularity over the battlefield you will be striving to dominate.

Graphically the game is pretty decent and everything is represented as it should be and follows the Warhammer 40k mythos nicely with some abstractions to help the game flow along without bogging in detail.  The dev team have been very keen to patch and fix most bugs and obviously have a passion for the product which bodes well for future additions in the form of two DLC which are planned with maybe more to come.

Gameplay is your typical 4X genre with a good solid feel of 40k.  One of my first thoughts after building some units, getting some upgrades to my city and then finding some foes was ""this feels like 40k"".  I put my Marines in a solid gun-line backed up with devastators and when the enemy Orks came to the assault I counter-attacked with some Assault Marines and a Dreadnought.  After a brutal and bloody melee the Orks staggered back and I had to pull back my wounded units and plug the gaps with Tactical Marines who advanced with Boltguns spitting hot death into the fleeing Orks.  ""I quite like this"" I thought as I pushed the greenskins back who promptly counter attacked with a flanking move with warbuggies and the Warboss himself.  ""Ahhh"" says I.  My turn to retreat and re-align the frontage.  All the while research was ticking away nicely and my city and units were building leaving me to concentrate on the good stuff, mainly reducing Orks to piles of goo and lumps of icky stuff.

I find I can quite happily sit and play this game for a good few hours on end until real life intervenes and grumpily I have to go deal with that which dares intrude upon my tactical pontifications.

The overwatch mechanic combined with how line of sight works (units in forests or ruins for example can only be seen if they fire or if you have a unit on an adjacent tile to them) makes for incredibly engaging battles and the factions play different enough that Im always excited what Ill get if I lock in random. Yes, Space Marines are a lot more beginner friendly, but I wouldnt call the game imbalanced because of that. In Starcraft 2 Bronze League Protoss are said to be cleary overpowered and in Silver League its suddenly Terran, etc. 

Even within the faction there are several interesting openings, given that you do not have enough production in the beginning to go for heroes, infantry and vehicles at the same time - so every game can go different, maybe your hero + infantry opening meets with a vehicle infantry opening of the opponent.

Gladius is extremely focussed on war and not much more. You move around with a bunch of basic troops and kill everything, thats it. 
 The tech-tree is more or less useless and there is a discussion in the forums if someone ever builds a laboratory. Most of the players build just 1 or 2. You can ignore science (which is a shame in my eyes).

Did you like Civ but wish it had more panzer general?
Did you like Panzer General but thought it needed more 40k?
Do you like 40k but wish it had more Civ?
AARGH I did this joke last time D:

Bored of 4x games with erratic diplomacy options? Good news for you, there is only war.
Do you have your life altogether with a reasonable sleep pattern and able to channel your energy into productive upstanding activities? Well, say good bye to that, y'all, there is no sleep here, there is only WAAAAARRR!!! 

Warhammer 40,000 Gladius- Relics Of War is a pretty neato game, it does the whole ‘one more turn thing’ pretty gud and whatnot. 
When I first saw this game I assumed cash grab, I thought it was going to be a budget Civ game with too many game mechanics borrowed from other games on a ‘just because’ basis- diplomacy being somewhat redundant in a 40k game on account of the whole ‘there is only war’ thing, research redundant in a universe where nearly all the races have stagnated technologically with varying degrees of violent dogma reinforcing these rules. 
Gladius neatly skips around these issues by either throwing out redundant mechanics, or else sidestepping the issue with the research tree in this game, unlocking a relatively small range of units for each faction but then enabling buffs to those factions that will feel familiar to tabletop players.  These buffs are often physically modelled onto the units which is a nice touch. 
The game’s city mechanic at first struck me as a bit of an annoyance, but has over time fully engaged some sort of mentat like appreciation for balancing my various cities population, power levels and food production. This is done to ensure an available and willing workforce for your forges, factories and unit upkeep costs. 
Each faction plays slightly differently with nearly all of my time spent playing as the Astra Militarum.
The  main attraction here though is the combat with no need to thin your paints or shred your fingers cutting up plastic sprue; your units look great and totally at home on the well detailed maps which is almost a shame, as you will rarely be zoomed in enough to appreciate the work the devs have put into the visuals, as you will ideally be busily engaged on multiple fronts by some of the better hex based combat I have had the pleasure of messing around with for perhaps decades. 

Keep your expectations in check, play it for what it is and not what it might appear to be and you will have a great 40k themed Panzer General time with Civ elements. 
If you thirst for expansive faction customization options, non canonical - heretical tech trees and diplomacy with the  Xenos, you should instead of buying this game, report to your nearest Commissar for immediate re-education.

A little weak on the faction side, but it's always been a dream of mine to see a great 4X Warhammer game and this certainly fits that description.

PROS:
-It's 4X
-Understandable and sensible resource system
-Reasonable Combat System
-Initial factions are created well
-Neutral/Gaia faction is built well and a fantastic intial challenge to keep players at a limited startup (assuming there is no loyalty bonuses for the player)
-Requires a lot of strategy, but not a steep learning curve

CONS:
-Weak on the playable factions
-Overpriced first DLC (Lord of Skulls, which I do not reccommend)
-Lack of story (not a big deal)
-Fuck the necrons

OVERALL:

I give it an 8.5/10 and would buy it at its standard retail price on Steam. Definitely something I could sink plenty of hours into if I had infinite free time. I will patiently wait for DLC, but aside from that a really fun 4X in a universe that I truly enjoy.

At times it feels akin to Civilization VI, while at other moments it favors Nintendo's Advance Wars or Endless Legend. It is this ability to mimic aspects of these well known games that give Gladius its appeal. However, it is also uncovers some of what may disinterest hard core fans of 4X.

The Endless series of games excel at dropping quests at regular intervals to drive unique storylines for each of its races. Gladius mimics this in similar fashion. The downside with Gladius is that the maps are smaller, more confined. The AI, as well as the races themselves, feel unbalanced. Space Marines for instance, are the overwhelming superior faction and winning the game with them is a breeze. For added challenge you could play the Orks, or the Nekros, and see if you can topple the SM war machine.

To those who love excercises in brutality I say, good luck! For it will be tedious. That says something good about the game's AI. It is formiddable. It will target your support and healing units first, then swarm your monstrous more powerful units to take them down like an elephant in the wild. It will also cause you endless frustrations as certain units just feel irrationally resilient to damage. Space Marine infantry can withstand multiple hits from the superunit the Gorkanaut while Ork infantry are wiped out in one attack from just about any other medium class unit and above.

The other glaring issue is that there are only 4 races (no sub-factions of those races to differentiate) to play. There is a wide range of techs to research through. This tech tree allows players to focus their offensive rush towards key strengths. Again, the problem with Gladius appears to hit a plateau of being able to outpace the SM (if you are against them) or to hold off defensively until your units are the most powerful (if you are the SMs). 

Regardless, this is a well done 4X game that should attract 4X fans and W40K alike. The title brings with it a memorable soundtrack and modernized graphics lacking in many older W40K games. Despite the difficulties and perceived race bias in the game, I am enjoying this title and actively try to dominate maps knowing full well each races glaring limitations.

The graphics look good and you would expect that in a game that is solely based on combat with a small amount of base building. Unfortunately there is only 1 cinematic action for each units different attacks so once you have seen each attack it never changes after that. More variety would have been nice but at the end of the day it's not deep enough to warrant other effects and I can see why the dev was happy to leave it at that.

The problem is that combat is almost the same as you would get with a game like civilization. Fairly basic stuff. But unlike civilization there is no grand empire building and no spies, diplomacy or anything else. Except tech research but again if you compare it to the tech trees of civ the one in this game is quite small.

The AI is nothing exceptional and seems to be quite easy on the hardest difficulty. I never played MP so cant comment on that.

Overall I like the graphics of the game despite the tiny amount of mapped actions. But the rest of it feels like a mobile game dressed up as PC. It only takes about 5 hours or so for the shine to wear off and once it does if you still like it you could play the other races and probably get about 20 hours out of it. 

I have 51 hours but to be honest most of that time was waiting for for my PC to process turns cause it's about 5 years old .
Hope this helps ladz

Well we will have to disagree then. In civ it is only 1 unit per square as is this, Terrain modifiers affect unit performance (in this though you can't build forts etc to enhance the defensive capabilities and fortify a pass or road etc like you can in civ). Theres no supplies for units or ammunition per se like civ generally speaking. 

There seems no reason to manouver as, if you create a wide front you just engage more enemy factions as the maps are quite small. 

I disagree about the AI, I have yet to see it do anything well planned such as flanking etc. The AI turn consisted of damaged units pulling back and fresh ones moving in for the most part. The only difficulty was surviving the first wave if your outnumbered but if you death ball your troops and attack each enemy faction one at a time there was no challenge imo

Maybe moral would have played a part if I had it on a lower difficulty but I had it on max so maybe they all had bonuses to morale. I don't remember it having any significant impact except for orcs where killing a few big ones would start hurting others but wasn't impressed with that mechanic.

Some buyers are complaining that it´s not a CIV, but guess what : IT IS NOT A CIV, and it shouldnt be one in the first place. 
In the Warhammer 40,000 universe diplomacy may have been an option in ancient times. Your goal is to conquer the planet, no matter the costs.

Presentation:
The developers made great effort to bring the vibe of the franchise alive. Little intros for every race, an in-depth compendium including quotes from the lore, the soundtrack etc. I really dig in the weapon sounds and hit-animations (still 4x), it gives a feeling like ""this hit made some damage hrhr"". It is never ugly, but if you are looking for stunning, detailed graphics, maybe 4x is not your genre.

Gameplay:
There is a lot more under the hood than meets the eye in the first place. Some Units have mounted 3 different weapons, each with it´s own range. So if you fire at the same enemy from 1 , 2 or 3 tiles away makes a big difference. Get close to use that flamethrower :-P. Each of the 4 races has its very own playstyle, resource management and of course tech tree. At the moment there are 50 Techs per race. Once the first battles are going, the good old ""just..this..round..."" is circling in your head. You know that feeling :-)

Overall:
I see this as a great base to grow. Hope there are many races and mechanics to come, the universe gives sooo much potential. 

Wishes:
How about picking a special clan together with the race, like blood ravens or orc clans with own heros and some techs. So it would make sense for the same races to fight each other.

You increase the Size and Scope of your City (Cities) and Technologies corresponding to the Faction 
you choose, all the while Hunting for Enemy factions, scouting for Relics and Defending everything you have from the Local Wildlife Xenos to Lost Human Machines Of DEATH (TM). While Humanity has 2 Factions they play in VERY different fashions.
One is the Space Marines, that focus on One Fortress City and Fast Deployment with Orbital Drops of Space Marines and what i call ODDT's (Orbital Drop Defence Towers), something that greatly incourages denial of resources and buildable area for other factions. The othe faction is The Guardsmen, in other words the Military force that makes up for 99% of humanitys Army in the 40K universe. 

They play in the following manner: 

1. Multiple Cities (Means alot more managing of your resorces, something that i enjoy.)
2. Mass Infantry (And i mean alot, cheap and quick to train}
3. Plenty of Hero Units to choose from. (Commisar Captains, Psykers, Tank Commanders and more...)
4. Heavy Tank/Artillery Units with a plethora of Upgrades to choose from. (some that you can see in the Screenshots above.)

As you can see, i dont have to really tell wich one i prefer, as for the other races..Can't really say if there good or not, never really played them even once so far as i just completly dove into the Guardsmen once i started to play the game. So you should go check out another review concerning them if thats the info your looking for.

Word of caution though:

1. While it plays like a Civ game, this is all out war, you can set teams up AI and multiplayer alike, but there is no diplomacy to make nice with your neighbors if there AI controled, and multiplayer consists of either wiping out the oposing players and finishing through the quest system they have in place, but that can be ajusted i believe withing the settins before a match.

2. Those that play this game expecting an easy time against the Local Non-Faction AI (Xenos and such...), your gonna get a nasty suprise if you don't ajust your match settings for what population density you want to face of against. The 'Barbarians' of this game do not play around, come in multitude of shapes, abilities, and numbers, sometimes becoming a real threat for the player(s).

One last thing to say, if this review or others here on Steam still don't reallly give you enough info wether to say Yay/Nay to this title, i suggest you go see {Angry Joe's} YT review of the game, as he explains the races in a better way than i can, and doesn'tpull any punches on what flaws the game does have.",1533540730,1533540730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No diplomacy or espionage. It is what it is, only war.  It may seem odd as presumably the human factions would talk before deciding the other is corrupt and going to war but the idea these factions wouldn’t go to war is not accurate.  I’m no 40k lore fanatic but I’m pretty sure Heresy can be found anywhere and that is a nice trick to justify everything if a little simple and lazy from a writing point of view.  
Tech tree isn’t a tree, but I don’t find that as bad as I expected.  I frequently found myself choosing to research a lower cost item because I need it (population cap) even there was some next level tank I wanted.  In short, I still had to make choices that mattered.
Some flexibility on world creation was nice.
I dislike the ½ finished nature of these Warhammer games that seem pre-built to DLC you later; if that bothers you wait a year and get the complete package on sale for the same price as it was new without the DLC.
It reminds me a bit of the Warlock variant of the Biggest 4x game.  Lots of atmosphere, definitely not as good as the best in the genre, but still enjoyed it immensely.

I am an avid 4X and Warhammer 40k fan. I also liked the previous title from this developer, Pandora: First Contact.

This game is pretty much excellent in what it does - 4X in the Warhammer 40k setting. There is no diplomacy - in the grim darkness of the future, there is only war. And you will like how it's done.

There are 4 very distinct factions, each with its own set of unique units, technologies, abilities and heroes. All of these factions are familiar to a veteran of the 40th millenium: Astra Militarum (the old Imperial Guard), Adeptus Astartes (old Space Marines), the Orkz and the Necrons. The units are golden. If you've played Dawn of War extensively, as I did, you'll immediately recognize most units and their roles: Guardsmen for a cheap infantry shield, Leman Russ Tanks for armored punch, Basilisks to rain steel and shatter their sky, Marauder Bombers to decimate opponents and the beloved Baneblade to unleash the eleven barrels of hell. And Sentinels to quickly capture points of interest on the map. All of these units feel and play exactly the way they're supposed to. A job well done here.

The game plays like Civilization V-VI *should* have in terms of combat. Overwatch (the ability for certain units to fire on approaching enemy) allows for coordinated retreat and ambushes. Multiple unit abilities can turn the tide of the battle (hint: research those grenades, your Guardsmen will thank you for it later). You get a lot out of building a balanced force of units, and the queue system of building them rewards this even further - you can build a tank, an infantry unit, a special unit, an aircraft and a building at the same time. By far, the combat system is pretty much the best for a turn based 4X. Oh, and you can also have heroes, who can learn abilities (3 levelled ones and 1 elite) and equip artifacts. Heroes may have a very small pool of hitpoints, but are surprisingly durable, because of their special (*cough* plot armor?) damage reductions.

Building and researching is decent. Overexpansion is heavily penalized, since you get loyalty hits in all your cities. I've found through the number of playthroughs however, that 2 cities will absolutely suffice, especially that end-game cities cover a ten fields each. You build district-style, baby! And again, there's no pointless and confusing special special bonuses like in Civ VI - your tile bonuses are visible from the start and simple to reason about, not obscure and hidden somewhere in the tech tree 100 turns into the future. DId I mention already I disliked Civ VI? Good. You can also utilize special points of interest on the map, either as standalone outposts or incorporate them into your cities for a sizable percentage bonus.

Technology tree is good enough. I admit, when I looked at it, I thought it was pretty much lean, but it proved to be a deceptive feeling. There are 10 tiers of techs, for 5-6 techs each tier, and you can jump tiers when you have researched at least 2 techs of an underlying tile. Yes, that shiny Baneblade is on tier 10 and it *will* take a lot of time to reach, as it should be. But when you *get* it, the enemy will feel it. You can also research abilities (like grenades), passive upgrades (give your Baneblade and Leman Russes additional bolters, they want it, they *need* it) and edicts. Edicts are temporary boosts that cost Influence and last for some turns, each specialized (build that tank faster, research more, dig more ore). They affect one city, and you can have multiple edicts in place.

I've enjoyed building, I've enjoyed fighting, and I must say I look forward to any foreseable DLCs with warmth and curious anticipation. Like a Sisters of Battle faction. Or Dark Eldar. Or Chaos, by Khorne.

Also this looks pretty much moddable, with XML files similar to Pandora. Sweet.

So, one thing to bear in mind that while this is nominally a 4X game, it is -not- Civ. There are a variety of reasons I'll cover that make this the case, but I'll first address the elephant in the room - neither the budget nor the size of the development team of this game make a direct comparison to Civ particularly fair, however given the asking price for the game it's one that is reasonable to ask. Look at the developers mentioned in the credits (ignoring the publisher credits) and you'll see a handful of names. That is a handful of individuals who clearly have a great love of the setting and who know what specific elements of a 4X they aim to focus upon, and to do well. Whether or not this game is worth it's asking price is a matter of how much you enjoy the combat and how much you enjoy the 40K theme. Research and city building is very much simplified. Research is a linear progression with no branches, and city building is a matter of taking it in turns building whatever resource production facility you'll need next. These are very much de-emphasised relative to Civ with the core engagement being the combat, which will make or break the game for you. And the combat IS fun, with varied unit types, weapon types, armour values, abilities, hard counters and some of the more exciting units of the factions coming out to play in the later game. Terrain types factor in, with city ruins and forests providing marked ranged damage reduction and rivers etc. hampering movement, increasing the variety of combat encounters and tactical approaches.

Expectedly for a 40K game, diplomacy is not an option (but you CAN assign teams, it's only a free-for-all if you want to set up a game that way) and so the focus is on combat. Cities can have multiple production/barracks structures which have independent build orders, allowing for much faster unit turnover than in Civ. A good game in Gladius involves fighting many battles on multiple fronts, and given the tenacity of the environmental wildlife this may sometimes even begin from turn 2. Resource points throughout the map encourage expansion and provide natural points of conflict between factions. 

Factions are highly varied and definitely all fit the theming of their respective races in the lore. Units largely behave in combat how they should, and the flavour text is all rich and lore accurate. Orks gain power simply by consistently getting into fights, Imperial guard/Astra Militarum are squishy but with outstanding armour support, space marines are hardier and have orbital support, necrons are powerful and constantly regenerate health but are constrained in their expansion potential (they unearth cities from tomb tiles rather than 'build' cities). A vocally expressed issue is that the orks were said to have caused the warp storm and that this makes no sense in the lore, but as you go through the factions you'll see that they all have their own ideas how the warp storm commenced and probably only the necrons are correct.

While there is a 'quest' for each faction, it is a thin veneer of a tasklist placed over a skirmish match. These give rewards and for some factions provide almost vital resource kick-starts at the beginning of the game. I would not consider this a campaign, this is just the Gladius format of skirmish, and it is not a point in it's favour.

The quality of the visuals is best described as inconsistent - city design is wonderful, with suitably gothic Imperial spires and hab blocks for the imperial guard, and fortresses for the space marines, derelict shanty towns for the orks and otherworldly obsidian edifices for the necrons (a LOT of which look suspiciously similar to the building designs for the necrons in Dawn of War: Dark Crusade). However some of the units are very simplistic, and low textures abound. I imagine this is to support the potential scale of battles and I don't tend to fixate on them much myself but it is a definite factor.

And lastly, the future: the devs have expressed that they wish to build upon the game with more content which is pleasing (chaos pls), and almost more importantly the game is fully moddable. As of this review there is unfortunately no major mod available, but the potential is certainly there. I can certainly see myself happily availing of higher texture mods or new unit mods should some industrious player produce any.",1533299405,1533299405,True,11,0,0.598750054836273193,0,True,False,False

The game as it is currently from when this review has been posted is as fun as civ 5 to be honest but there are still issues with it of course better news is that it is constantly being updated and fixed.

Problem is though (other than the current issues of minor bugs and balancing of the necrons hence why I called them ""assholes"") the game in its current state feels like that more of an indie game than a full fledged strategy game so its best for you to go and wait for it to go on sale or comes with more factions as there are only 4.

Other than that the game is suprisingly fun considering (from what I have been told) that it was made by 3 people!

On playing through the tutorial, I was a tad disappointed. The game seemed a bit lacking...shallow; however, I plowed on and started up a real game and...my, my, my...(said in my best Lt. Joe Kenda voice). It readily became apparent that Gladius allows each player to build their faction their way (based upon research, building selections, and unit production--all influenced greatly by the resources available in your starting base). What's more, as expected, all four factions appear to begin with the same generic units, but from that point forward, the differences become stark. All four starter factions play differently. What was unexpected was how differently you can build the same faction. In a multiplayer game, my orks were zooming about in warwagons while my teammate kept pumping out a veritable horde of ork boyz.

I should hasten to note that I have enjoyed the single player games, but the multiplayer has been where Gladius shined. It really does feature simultaneous turns, so you only rarely have that moment of wishing your buddy would get his turn done already...chuckles again. We've already put in three different multiplayer games and everyone involved enjoyed them enough to be anxious to try another (just to try out a different faction or copy someone else's play-style and see if you could make it work for you). All of our games have been coop, but I am looking forward to when we are all even more comfortable with the game and willing to do some pvp.

Famous saying, from a famous universe; and it holds up to it. There has always been skepticism from the game (even from me) as to whether it would be fun, hold to the Warhammer name, and be accomplished well by a solid team.

Being a 4X game, it holds true to the genre. However, it is nothing like Civilization. Because of Civilization’s popularity and huge spread across the web, we tend to think that 4X=Civilization. Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate. Gladius approaches the genre differently, focusing hugely on warfare. That being said, you must manage your empire (be it one (1) or sixteen (16) cities), manage your technological advances and explore the map for varied advantages based on race. Unlike popular belief, 4X’s don’t necessarily have diplomacy, spies or trade. Instead, they’re replaced with War, Exterminatus and [b]WAAAAAAGH!![/b] which makes a very engaging game that keeps you on your toes at all times.

Gladius also brings extremely good sounds effects and music to the game, bringing every unit alive in ways Dawn of War could not. It also offers new 7th Edition units that older games never had while still following most tabletop rules in terms of special rules, equipment, etc. The gameplay does not stick to ground units only either. It presents infantry, armor, air, hovercrafts, and much more complex gameplay that unravels itself the more you research. It ultimately is a solid game with varied gameplay decisions and strategies for every race offered so far.

I highly recommend Gladius for every strategy player out there for it is a very interesting piece that can be enjoyed by gamers who aren’t fans of 4X’s, RTS’s or the Warhammer genre. While I may not agree with some of the surrounding lore about the planet and reasons of war or the units chosen to implement into the game, it still has a solid foot base in regards to every faction fighting each other and the many uses for every troop available.

10/10 would have 5 Monoliths and 3 Obelisks spawn around my base again with 2.5 Terminator Squads to defend it

Looking for a 4X game? Then I can't recommend Gladius to you, it strips out an overwhelming majority of 4X mechanics such as trade, diplomacy, empire building,  management of your populace, espionage and basically anything that isn't somehow related to combat or building more units for combat.

Ah, but what if you're looking for a more strategic game that focuses on combat and tactics? I still can't recommend Gladius to you in that case as there are numerous other titles that do this better, namely, things like Total War: Warhammer as well as Slitherine's own Sanctus Reach, both of which allow for greater control and flexability during skirmishes as well as greater unit variety (the main thing I have heard held up to justify this game's emphasis on the combat).

What if you want a game that gets you really immersed into the 40k setting? A game that treats you to a thick serving of the rich lore and storytelling that the universe is known for? The main contributions the game makes in this regard would be the inclusion of a codex (which is nice) as well as each faction having a single questline to pursue in every game which never changes or varies (making it become repetitive very quickly), as such I can't even recommend it on these grounds either since I would have to say that things such as the Dawn of War series vastly surpass this as far as delivering the '40k feel' goes.

Sadly, no matter what approach I try to come at this game from in terms of thinking of a way in which I could recommend it I keep coming up empty and with other games that simply do what this game is attempting to do better (and in many cases with a lower price tag), in it's current state I can only say that at best you should wait for a sale (and even then that is only if you're a diehard fan of 40k).

TL;DR: Game feels very underwhelming and unpolished with a lack of content or replayability, a good concept is in there and could potentially be worth a look in the future but for now, only get if on sale or if you're a 40k fanatic who must own everything 40k related.",1532635766,1532635766,False,26,0,0.641699850559234619,10,True,False,False

You start the game at war, there is no diplomacy, there is only war. The game gets you into the action immediately against some incredibly potent wild life. You're definitely never bored in this game, the early game especially is fantastic. XP is given to all your surrounding units after a kill so there is a real bonus to keeping an army together and leveling them up quickly which gives huge bonuses mid-late game. The AI is quite good and you never seem to get into a situation where you vastly out class your opponents (Rfilemen vs Crossbows Civ style). Not only that they are good at identifying unit weaknesses and will flank given the opportunity to eliminate their biggest threats.

The thing I like best about this game is that all the different factions play differently, they are not simply reskins with a unique unit (Civ style). Space Marines for example can only make 1 base so you need to get it strong ASAP and level your troops and keep them alive to survive late game. Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard for 40k fans) however rely on numbers so the early game is all about survival and creating new cities so that you produce mass hordes of troops.

The game certainly isn't polished though. Sounds could definitely be improved but this is an indie title produced by I believe only 3 developers so hopefully these get added soon.

Have been PC gaming since 83. 
Have most of the Matrix/Slitherine catalogue (a few are on steam account most are not). Sorry, I should have added more depth to my review. You are correct it was a quick review.

The game is entertaining, but not enthralling. There are a lot of aspects of a 4X game that go undeveloped here, though that's partly due to the 40k setting being rather limited on negotiations and more about that Dakka life.

The combat is fluid and feels like you'd want. The technology tree really just serves as a dam to slow down the flow of the game; which technologies you pick is really inconsequential, unlike Civ where techs can make a big difference in the gameplay. 

There really isn't much in the way of economic development to be had. There are several different resources that can be constraints towards your progress, but if you keep half a mind towards them, you'll do just fine. 

Only having four factions limits the gameplay a good bit. Once you've played through as each faction once or twice, you've played just about all there is to be played. Looking at it, I'm worried at how many faction DLCs they're going to be dropping for $10 a pop. Pulling a stunt like that just makes it feel like a late night TV ad; buy in for $40 for part of the game, buy the rest for 6 easy payments of $9.99.

On a lore standpoint, the xenobiology on the planet is strange to say the least. The ""native"" species of the planet include Kroot hounds running wild alongside of Catachan Devils (giant scorpions, not guardsmen), with random Mechanicus Kastellans stomping about, and a number of other strange things, including mythical Enslavers (which I didn't even realize those were around and kicking much anymore in the lore). It sorta feels like the game devs just picked and grabbed at whatever they could find off of Lexicanum that sounded cool, rather than doing any appropriate homework or any creative designs of their own. 

All in all, I'd wait for a sale and grab the game at $20 or $25. It's fun, but not all there.",1532476980,1532476980,True,44,3,0.797930240631103516,0,True,False,False

There's an interesting and complex mix of unit types all with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Battle is similar to something like Panzer General or Panzer Corps, although I would say Gladius combat is a bit more interesting because of the unit mix.

Many of the units have special abilities (some inherent and some unlocked via the tech tree).  Units level up and get much stronger (although they only increase in stats, no new abilities from leveling for regular units).  There are three special hero units for each faction which level up and allow you to pick skills from a very small 4 ability skill tree.

In addition to unlocking new unit types and new unit abilities via the tech tree, factions can unlock special faction wide abilities, such as Space Marines ability to deploy from their capital to anywhere on the map via drop pod (but once dropped, they have to march back) or Necrons ability to zap units instantly to any of their cities.

The factions all play very differently, and the tech tree is complex enough that you probably won't unlock all techs in a playthrough unless you're playing on a Huge map (there just won't be enough time before you win or lose the game).  So there's a fair bit of replayability.

The AI is quite good.  It retreats units that are badly damaged allowing them to heal.  It focus fires on units rather than spreading fire around less effectively.  It does a good job picking high priority targets.  It pulls back its entire force when it realizes it has no chance of holding a line.  It's really one of the best tactical AIs I've seen in a turn-based strategy game.

There is only individual skirmish games rather than a linked set of campaign scenarios, which isn't really a minus for me, as I always ignore linked scenarios in games like GalCiv in favor of playing random maps, but I'm sure some will miss it.  However, there is a quest chain you can follow during each skirmish match which fills in the fiction of what's going on on the world of Gladius.

If you're a Warhammer 40K fan, they did a great job matching the fiction with the game, and the units all play out as you would expect.  It's definitely a lot of fun ordering around Space Marine Dreadnoughts, leveling up your Imperial Guard Commissar, crushing humies with your Ork Gorkanaut, or watching as your relentless line of Necron Monoliths crushes inferior races

Short version wait for it to go on sale, because it will have (hopefully)been balanced by then. and don't buy the deluxe edition.

Long version; One of the biggest selling points of this game besides being set in the 40k universe was the aggressive fauna on planet, no more civ style wandering barbarians to hoover up for money and XP, these are supposed to provide a genuine threat, sadly this needs some work before it's worth spending money on.

The fauna can honestly be described as follows 

Kroot Hounds - Little more than the wandering barbarians from Civ.

Ambulls and Catachan Devils - An actual threat to units early in the game.

Kastelan Battle Robots - Urgh welcome to the grind, tough high dmg and constantly run away to heal. Also not sure why but FAR more numerous than any other creature besides Kroot Hounds, makes me think that the people who designed the game had very little idea of how Kastelans work.

A couple of others equal parts non threatening and uninteresting 
and then the steaming shit on the hot fudge sundae that is the Lord of SKulls

The Lord of Skulls..... This kinda ruins the game.
In before people expessing suprise that I'm complaining it's a tough unit, yes obviously, and I wouldn't mind dealing with a boss unit if it wasn't a boss unit that can and does;
- Get teleported to somewhere near your base on the map.
- Completely focus you
- Kills 1-2 units a turn, literally I'm not sure there is a unit in the game that isn't 1 shot by his melee attack, and even tough units are seriously damaged by his 2 shooting attacks, I have seen it kill 3 fortresses of redemption in couple of turns, 1 a turn in melee and 1 in 2 rounds of shooting.
- Regenerates
- Gains levels and therefore HP from killing things
- Appears randomly late game, and is almost immune to multiple units.
- Despite being the larger than a building and barely fitting in the hex it occupies it can not only hide in ruins but disappears from line of sight with such ease that I suspect it has been signing up for Ninjitsu school. 
To put it's toughness in perspective, a high level unit of guardsmen rapid firing it do about 1.6 dmg, or 3 dmg with krak grenades, a leman russ with battle cannon and lascannon do about 4 dmg, it has over 100 hp, regnerates 2 a turn and can and will kill both those units in 1 turn.

And all that would only be really annoying if it wasn't that IF you finally kill it, there is a reasonable chance for the bug that doesn't give you credit for killing it to happen so it doesn't even count.

Some other fun bugs include when your space marine chaplain hero does his ultimate ability to heal surrounding troops he crashes the game, and reloading doesn't fix it once this has occured it stays that way for the rest of the game.

Or when you get a quest to save your scattered Guard units but your space marine allies instantly focus and kill them because they are neutral..

Summary.
Needs balancing and a lot of bug fixing, nice ideas though.
Fuck the Lord of Skulls, if you're going to make a boss don't make one that always spawns near your base with a raging hate boner for your stuff while your in the middle of a pitched battle with multiple other factions, you actually made me regret buying the deluxe edition as now I have the edition which makes me want to show the developers and their families exactly what ""blood for the blood god"" means.",1532263725,1532264040,True,2,0,0.480309605598449707,0,True,False,False

After one hour i would refund it, but I continued and the game became more interesting after developing a sound city base, two forts and some troops, incl. 2 heroes (turn 79). Now i cannot refund it, because this is fun. It is indeed a CIV build mixed with the warfare of WH Sanctus Reach on a most detailed and graphical enhanced map. Exciting gameplay without stress.

(after 60+ hours) WARNING: do not play this game (I mean do play this game!) Like in the days of C&C Red Alert and before that old skool CIV games of the nineties, I've never spend so much time in playing a game. You just want to finish it, even if a scenario takes 8 hours. Good to have holidays.

My impressions: Because the settings of gamespeed can be altered, technologies can emerge quicker, you choose your game. Another pro, the AI is wounderful and can has many levels from weak to emperor strength. I played a game with a AI on my side against two other AI and we really were helping each other out. The settings ""weak to very strong"" mean something in this game. One tip: to get the nice stuff (like tanks) on time, play with tech on fastest.
And when the game is over (Victory over the enemy AI), it is not. You can continue and play through some quests if not finished them before. After my victory  we (me and AI in one team) got attacked by a 20 turn killer robot army so they kept ""us"" busy. And there's always this pesky wildlife, a nice implementation to spend the time and resources during the Xploring maneuvers. 
This game has been made by a 3 person team, as I've heard. Amazing concept to make a game that can continue after the victory (in one case for 4 hours more) thanks to the quests. So ... More additional quests would be a nice addon (maybe steam workshop?) or free or payed dl for this game. The quests make this a RPG, continuously fighting and expanding your race.

Lets start with the mechanics of the gameplay. It simply combines both Endless Legend and Civilization mechanics and improve it to a whole new stage. Its not a straightforward game and force you to think a lot before making every turn valuable. Adding a wildlife threats (npc such as kroots and kastelan robots) and nature (wild root that damages your unit) simply ask you to make a plan before making a move. 

Yes I know that the number of faction is very few, but hey we got Imperial Guard (YEAY!), Necrons (Okay, shit is going real), Orks (Shit, diz boyz again?) and Space Marine (shit just gone from bad to worse). I personally enjoy these 4 factions a lot and each faction offers a unique gameplay. I enjoy Imperial Guard at most though HAHA. But I'm sure the developer could add more factions. I am hoping for Chaos & Tau Empire due to their nature and faction capabilities :D

Furthermore, YES NO DIPLOMACY, ALL OUT WAR! This should give us real challenge even at early stage of the game. This is also something that matches with the warhammer sensational quote --> ""IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE, THERE IS ONLY WAR."" So yeah you get what this means afterward? right? ;)

The only negative I would like to point out in this game is that, the map should be bigger (i know this will affect the gameplay framerate since it is a 4x gameplay). It feels so close and too short to play even when playing at huge map alongside 3+ players. But I'm certain that the developers will surely improve this in the future. 

This game is good for all turn-based strategy lovers and wh40k fans. For non wh40k fans is also not a big deal but it is better to become a wh40k fans. Because it gives you the feeling not just about the game, but what are you playing inside the game. I'm dead serious about this, its completely fun and exhilirating when you know how to play this game and also know what is being played inside. Geddit? hahaha

However with that being said I have not played the tabletop game in over a decade, so I'd hardly identify myself as a hardcore fan. I think if you have an interest in 40K that will probably be enough to make the setting interesting: an in-game encyclopedia provides all the lore and unit details you need if you're not completely familiar.

At the time of writing, I have 5 hours in game. This is from my first sitting, all in one go - I'm certain I will be adding more, but that gives you an indication of the ""just one more turn"" mentality this game inspires.

I've seen a lot of reviews comparing this to the Endless games and Civ6. While there a clear similarities in the UI, I'd have to say that's where the comparisons must end. As you'll see in many other reviews, there is no diplomacy (cue ""In the grim dark future...."" quotes here). In this particular setting I'd have to agree that diplomacy would be out of place - can you really see Space Marines and Orks setting up a trade agreement?

With that said, rather than a fully fledged ""4X game"" I'd describe this as a war game a la the tabletop WH:40K, with added 4X elements. In my opinion this actually works well: Take the tabletop game you likely know and love, and remove the point based army selection. Instead, add in some basic resources, research, and easy-to-understand base building and then use these to build, support, and improve your army. Outposts scattered across the map give small but important resource bonuses which will allow you to afford and pay upkeep for larger armies, and also give you a reason to fight for sectors of the map other than simply to purge the Xenos. 

All in all, the visuals are good. Not outstanding, but definitely not bad. I do however find a lot of units (Necrons in particular, but also the other races) are mostly grey, which does seem to blend in a little with the scenery and make units stand out a lot less than I'd like. In large battles I tend to get a little cross-eyed trying to keep focus on all the units (although they do have indicators above their heads to identify their team).

Sound design is good, if a little sparse. There is no voice acting aside from the introduction cutscenes for each race. Personally, that isn't a huge issue for me: the weapon and combat sounds are impactful and accurate. 

I do think Gladius has excellent replayability as it stands, however I feel it would benefit tremendously from the inclusion of more races. At the time of writing, only Space Marines, Necrons, Orks, and Astra Militarum/Imperial Guard are available to play as/against. I'd love to see the addition of more of the armies available in the tabletop game (in particular Eldar/Dark Eldar, Tau). I'm hoping that if well received the devs will add these options in as DLC - if sensibly priced I would certainly buy!

All in all, despite some improvements on my wishlist, I do recommend Gladius even as it stands now. It is a solid Warhammer wargame, with some welcome 4X elements.",1532169247,1532169247,True,5,0,0.538956999778747559,0,True,False,False

The graphics and sound are spot on and totally contribute to the feel and atmosphere of the setting. The game has plenty of customization options as well, along with modding support which can really help replayability.

Speaking of replayability, every time you play, the map will be different. It's randomly generated every time so no 2 matches will ever be the same. You can set the amount land mass, specific terrain features, ""wildlife"" density, and the list goes on. It actually borders on overwhelming with how much you can dictate what will be in your map. Each game can also have up to *16* human players or AI, which, for somebody who came from games like Command & Conquer and Battle for Middle-Earth, is absolutely incredible and really contributes to the epic scale of the conflicts.

It's not all shiny and rainbows, though. For one thing, the game lacks any dedicated campaigns or serious story telling. There aren't any characters to get connected to or root for, and it feels like you're just reading a history book that is the memoirs of some historian around during the time. Additional game modes is something I think the game could greatly benefit from, as right now there is only one. The other major drawback for me right now is the lack of factions, but that is going to be fixed in time so I don't feel comfortable counting that as a negative.

Overall, if you're a fan of 40k or a more casual, well-paced 4X game, give Gladius a run! I've had plenty of fun with it, and I've only played one faction :)",1532147427,1532147427,True,7,0,0.522675216197967529,0,True,False,False

The game uses a lot of Civ 5/6 mechanics, but in a good way. This game, however, is completly combat focused and has a much faster pace.

It has a great balance of depth and simplicity, and leaves a lot of room for potential to improve. I look forward to more updates in the future.

So right now I can say a good few things about it. the factions are varied, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. If you've played Civ you will understand the basics and adapt quite easily. If not, you can easily learn them. If you've played 40k you will understand the strengths of each faction and be able to employ them to their fullest. Each faction has their own tech tree (though when it comes to units it's mostly their own flavour of x unit. for instance, everyone's base infantry unit is good against infantry, but the Guard are more numerous where Space Marines are tougher, everyone has a heavy weapons infantry, everyone has an AA unit, the list goes on)

The Quest system the game has is a bit of a strange thing. I give them credit for giving you missions, it's a nice idea, gives you an idea of where you should be working to, but I feel as though it needs a lot more padding. You can clear the Space Marine mission list with tier 3 research (out of 10 mind). SHOULD YOU is an entirely different answer. I personally feel as though it could benefit from spacing out, more missions to do or simply asking you to have higher tier research already done.

Each Faction has their own special things you can activate. for instance Space Marines can improve their units for some turns, and Guard can improve production for the same time. Resources also vary by faction, with Guard being the closest you will get to a traditional game of Civ.

Right now the game only has 4 factions, Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Necrons and Orks. This is very limited and I do hope they expand this to other factions and indeed subfactions. Chaos probably should have been in at launch given how important it is to the setting. You are also limited to the main factions. For instance, Guard are only Cadians. If you know the Guard, you know Cadians are but one part of them.

Your forces are also stuck at what they are. Devestator marines are only armed with lascannons for instance. I believe this should be amended but then it may knock the balance of the game off. Though I still think you should have some customisation of forces.

Your forces don't come with an army painter either, so I hope you like being stuck to your basic paint jobs. though there is a wide range of them

Bottom Line: it needs more work, but right now it is varied enough to be a lot of fun. when more factions come along, this will be great.

-SOUND DESIGN;  like jesus christ i honestly have never heard sounds design so bad outside of awful greenlight games. none of the units have voices, which makes games a strange silent affair with nothing but the music track. Half the weapon and movement sounds  are way too quiet or plain wrong,i swear a tank cannon is quieter than a las gun 

-unit variatoin; this isn't a huge budget game which is fine, but the lack of unit variation is a time when it actively affects gameplay. Having 10 or so units per faction is fine in fast moving games like DOW2, but in games like this designed to last over multiple hours you'll quickly find you'll just be losing the same units over and over for hours on end.

For experienced 4x gamers, it's best described as Endless Legends Meets Warlock.
- Single player, the quest (like endless legend) provides a great experience.
- Research is similar to endless legend.  You need to research 2 techs at each tier level to unlock the next tier of research.  There are 10 tiers in total.
- Be aware that at its heart, Gladius is a WAR GAME (just like warlock).  The economy system is there allow you to produce more units, and research better units!
It is not a traditional 4x with ""depth"" - Religion system, espionage system, diplomacy system, wonders - all that stuff is not here (and honestly, other than diplomacy, I always felt those other systems were annoying to deal with).

Despite the lack of those, I found myself enjoying this game much more than any 4x I've played recently (Endless Legends and Civ 6 come to mind).  Right from the start, I find myself fighting the neutral monsters. After that, I'm fighting other players (or AI, or doing my faction quest).  Played as a TBS war game, Gladius is BRILLIANT.

Mulitplayers has a bunch of issues, but the developers are very active on the steam forums and discord, and have been addressing the issues or giving ETAs for fixes.
- There is no chat box at this time (July 20th).  The devs have said that they will add chat by next week.
- If the host leaves, the game ends.  The game doesn't assign a new host.  So if you're playing FFA and the host dies... Game over man, Game over!  Unfortunately, no ETA for a fix on this issue, but the devs are aware of it!",1531751992,1532086211,True,4,0,0.557799875736236572,0,True,False,False

If your a WH40k fan you won’t regret buying this. If your a civ fan you may want to take a close look at gameplay before purchasing. 

Four unique factions each with many different types of units makes combat very fun and engaging. 
The UI is pretty intuitive, clean and easy to understand. 
I’m pretty impressed with the ai as it will play carefully and seems to recognize threats. 
The game has been designed to be mod friendly so expect a lot more customization to be available in the future. 

If more factions are added as inexpensive dlcs this game could be a really big hit. 

My only biggest gripe with the game is a lack of voice acting. Civ has it, as does AoW and it never annoyed me. WH40k is synonymous with unique voices and quotes and it’s a shame it’s missing from this game.

Been a 40k fan since Rogue Trader saw daylight in 1987.
Been a Civ fan since I was in High School.

Verdict:  I LOVE this game.

It's Civ with the fat trimmed off.  A lot less micro-management so you can get to blowing stuff up faster.

40k - These guys stuck to the lore religiously.  To the point of:  In the original 40k Rogue Trader book, there is a section of pencil sketched alien lifeorms one could encounter in the 40k universe.  Little has been seen of them, until now.  Catachan Devils, Enslavers, Ambulls....  Not only are they in this game, but they are depicted exactly as the 1987 Rogue Trader book had them drawn.

Just an example of the detail.  The rest: ""Nailed it.""

If you're a 4x game fan: It's worth checking out.

If you're a 40k fan: It's definately worth checking out.

If you're both a 40k and 4x game fan:  Stop reading this and just buy it.  Also, from what I understand, the devs are already working on additional races/factions.

I love this game, I have been following this game for quite a while now and I pre-ordered it because I was excited to see a Warhammer 40k style 4x game. This game is a 4x at it's basics where your focus is just to get resources, research tech and fight until you win, the game has missions and tasks that it allocates you which are fun and sometimes add another level of challenge when they show up at a bad time. The factions you get to choose from (Space Marines, Necrons, Orkz, and Astra Militarum) all feel fairly different and have unique play styles/abilities. The customization options for the map are simple and easy to use which in my opinion is a good thing and playing the game with friends can be funny since the game can very easily go both greatly for your or poorly depending on your choices and strategies.

If you are expecting to play a Warhammer 40k version of Civilization then I'm sorry but this is not that, this is it's own thing, that is a stripped 4x game based in the 40k universe, the good things about it are that even though it is a stripped down 4x, the stuff that is in the game is done very well and for me, make up for any of it's flaws.

But I think a better comparison in many ways is the Age of Wonders series, especially 3 -- this game is much more war- and combat-focused, for pretty salient reasons. It's not quite as large or shiny of a production as a game from a bigger studio, but for what it is, it's a pretty respectable effort if you're the type who's willing to buy in to more indie-ish games.

As long as you understand what this is -- a combat-focused 4X using the Warhammer 40,000 license in a smaller, more indie-style production, it's pretty damn good. The only serious complaints I can make are mostly balance-related, which are things that can be fixed with time and updates.

The game gets a lot of things right:
a) Unique play and feel of factions (stays true to the lore of each faction)
b) Good graphics and sound quality
c) Extremely challenging game (Very Hard/Impossible difficulties)

There are some areas to improve:
a) Would like additional factions (aka Tau please)
b) Some graphics/sound bug out at various points

If you are expecting an experience as deep as Civ or Endless legend then it doesn't really scratch that itch. What it is is a fantastic 40k wargame with 4x elements. It is most definately my favorite 40k game since Dawn of War and i imagine it will only get better and better as more updates are released.

It's fun, you don't realise how many turns pass and the number of times you'll get used to smashing that ""End Turn"" button before realising that you left a pizza in the oven for the last three hours.

The problem with it, the game feels very basic regardless. The technology tree is a simple ten-layer side-scroller, where you research two things on one layer then you move up, but you'll always end up racing the AI to get higher tier units while missing out on important buildings or upgrades for other things. The number of units feels a bit weak too, with lots of different faction-related units being missed out which is understandable otherwise we'd have an almost unlimited list of units.

The music is nice, I haven't gotten bored of that. The map is lovely to look at if somewhat annoying when it comes to different levels of terrain, so if you're moving through an area with a few units half the army won't be able to attack a foe in the open because they're blocked by a hill you didn't know was there.

The neutral wildlife is fun to play against as well as the normal AI opponents. They have a set path and have a chance of randomly attacking you or leaving you alone, unless you attack first. I wish the AI wouldn't get all the research upgrades every factions get, which I don't know if that is a bug or intentional; so a Catachan devil I saw had 3 melee upgrades, one from Orks, Space Marines and Necrons.

Combat is basic. Units have range between 1-3 hexes, slightly more like 2-6 if it's a basilisk. Damage is usually done by how many are in the squad, how many attacks per model they have, damage and then armour penetration. Accuracy is also a thing for units. Different factors are taken in to account like upgrades, cover, etc.

City building is done similar to civ, you have one constructor unit (unless Space Marines, which drop pod down) and you place them where you want. You spend resources to acquire more tiles and upgrade your base further, making sure to keep an eye on population and loyalty when you create more buildings. As each tile has a slot amount ranging from 1-3 which multiple modifiers inside that could boost or hamper a building. For example, a research building with a base amount of 5 research a turn is placed on a 10% research boost tile now has 5.5  research a turn. Simple, right?

Manafacturing: I was slightly taken unawares by this when I first started, figuring that ""production"" which is used for the time it takes to build something, would carry on to the next building over. So if it takes 24 manafacturing to build one guardsman squad, it'll only take the 6 from your barracks and won't add the +6 from completely different building. So it helps to stack the same building each time in the same city.",1531830408,1531830458,True,3,0,0.506604492664337158,0,True,False,False

So it is a 4x strategy game set in 40k universe. Something I personally hoped for, for a long long time. Forget diplomacy or subtlety. Prepare for warfare, tactics and death.

Pros - 
+4 quite distinct factions. Not a paint job, really different playstyle
+ Challenging AI - if you are used to strategy games, it might not look like that at your first gameplay. Try raising the difficulty though and you might experience some really epic battles. Protip - lower wildlife. Even thought it is really challenging, downside is that AI faction struggles with it more than you do.
+The graphics style suits 40K nicely. 
+ Has quite a lot of ""just one more turn"" factor
+ Very fitting soundtrack

Cons
-animations do need more polish (e.g. Assault marines' attack animation did raise the eyebrow with WTF on my lips)
-missing voiceover. I would love to hear that WAAAAGH! as 6 groups of ork boyz charge out of forrest.
-might get repetitive though customization options for each game do nice job delaying it. More game mods/different enviroments would make a difference here.


Is it worth the money? Considering quality and funfactor of other 40k games, yes. Compared to other 4x games? I would give a carefull ""maybe yes"". As a final note, please add more factions. Eldar, Chaos and perhaps Tau, DLC or not :)

if you expect anything close to Civ or an Endless Space game in a 40K setting you will be very disapointed. 
instead of a civ-building mechanics the game offers more a classical rts approach to base-building and upgrades (research) and is solely focused on combat, not economics and especialy not dimplomacy. 
which makes the game more play like a Panzer General with some mixed in 4x elements (very minor).
exploration elements are as many other aspects of the game very minimalistic: you find special ressource-nodes, some tiles which will grant you gear for heroes or shops...then there's a whole lot of neutral critters. 
expand is so basic that it bears a striking resemblance to the Dawn of War -Series; but certainly not  to any other 4x game (Age of Wonders, Endless, Civ and co.)
exploit goes hand in hand with all the other elements of the game: basic.

the only aspect which realy shines is the exterminate:
combat is done very competent, elements like ""overwatch"", different weapon-types and unit skills work very well together and fit the 40K-universe perfectly.

what realy shows is the budget...about every other element than combat is so minimalistic and basic that it makes Sanctus Reach look like a million-dollar budget game. there's a a handfull of different art-works per faction (probably around 5 artworks...) for each tech, quest..etc. the rest are universal artworks..and even there it's probably around 4-5 (probably less).
the ui is per definition basic: low-detail icons, mixed with 2 colors and some black..again unlike other games nothing in the game got it's own unique artwork apart from the faction specific game-endings....and ofcourse all faction got the exact same UI. 

the grafics are passable, but again very minimalistic. the game looks more like something released 2012. 
the music is also basic, i heared about 2? tracks...perhaps 3. there are 0 voice lines apart from faction intors (which are the same with just minor details changing). once you are in a game you will never hear any sort of dialogue. 

at the date of writing this review there isn't even a key-binding option which goes to show how low of a standart is set here.
also there are still quite alot of bugs, reproducable game crashing bugs like certain skills, multiplayer lacks chat-options and is riddled with even more bugs and there is no ""hotseat""-mode.  

i can not recommend the game at this price...it would be alright with price tag around 10-20 bucks. 
if i ever wanted to show what a minimal-effort, low budget, basic game should look like it would be Gladius. 
yes, as a 40K fan you can get some enjoyment out of it (as did i), but without the license no one would even touch this game in 2018...not because it's ""bad"", but because it is about as generic and bare-bones as it can get...when we got game-series like Age of Wonder, Civ and the fantastic Endless games.

Before I go into this, a few things about me should be stated. I'm a decent fan of Warhammer, but prefer fantasy and don't love the universe all that much. I like indepth tactical games, simulators, and empire-builders, and I generally love Slitherine games. 

This game is probably one of the best Slitherine games on the market, and one of the best Warhammer games on the market, to put it simply. Here, I'll delve into all the core points of the game, and give a rating out of 5, 3 being average.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game is passable in the visual department. The city-scapes and units look nice, as does the terrain and atmosphere, but the weapon affects are mediocre at best and laughable at worst. This game is not a looker, and is seriously lacking in the special effects department. Graphics are a 3/5. They're passable, but barely.

[h1]Sound and Voice Acting[/h1]
Mediocre at best, embarassing at worst. The weapons sound very tinny, and not like the incredibly large and dangerous weapons of the 40k universe. This is especially notable for the Space Marines bolters and vehicles. There is no voice acting, instead you get some text lines over units' heads. Music is decent, I guess. It's nothing crazy, but, it's not bad to listen to either.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Combat is where this game shines. ""Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods."" There is no diplomacy in this 4x, which was something that turned me off originally, but now I think it was the best choice this game made. Combat is fun, tense, and strategic, with all the factions fighting differently. It's simple enough that you can boot up a save, look at the field, and understand what units to target, but there's enough numbers and stats going on for more focused players to have fun crunching numbers to maximise damge potential. Terrain, armor, armor penetration, morale, unit size, and weapon type all are important in combat, which leads to simply fun combat with enough depth to satisfy more involved wargamers. It's easily a 4/5.

[h1]Gameworld[/h1]
The procedurally generated map, has, in my 5 playthroughs on Huge settings, not failed to make a diverse and logical map, with plenty of biomes, outposts, tombs, and natural positions like chokepoints. It also goes great with the large, tile spanning cities, which are visually and gameplay wise quite interesting. That moves on to my next point.

[h1]Empire Building[/h1]
City building is very straight forward, but, they're critical to sustaining a war economy, and, play fundamentally differently for every faction. It's incredibly satisfying to see your cities expand and cover more of the map.

[h1]Factions[/h1]
Incredible. All the factions are extremely different, and not just visually. Necrons play extremely different from Space Marines, who play different from Orks, and so on. If you hate one faction, you'll probably love another. I've enjoyed my playtime with all of them. The only issue is the lack of any more factions.

Overall, I'd give the game a 4/5. It's incredibly well made, but lacking in visuals and sadly, faction diversity. Overall, the game is really fun, but, there's little visual flavor, and the audio is lacking. Once more factions are added, I can seriously see this game being my new favorite strategy game.",1531791558,1531791558,True,3,0,0.518289148807525635,0,True,False,False

The player builds units and deploys them across the map to fight enemy units and alien life forms. Resource areas can be captured to increase income. The space marines and 2 other factions really do not build cities. They build up their main fort instead. They can also deploy sentry towers on the map, usually near resource areas, that can fire on nearby enemies. The Nekrons do need to build cities, but only on special Tomb hexes.

The player also performs research to unlock new units and upgrade existing units.

It is a fun game. One aspect are the unit designs. Seriously, these units look so junky. The 1980's are long gone and these units are just Blah. The space marine tanks, for example, do not look very high tech. Iunderstand this game is based on a lot of old lore but sheehs, can't GW update things a little? Otherwise the graphics are fine. (The troop units are still cool.)

Some players have complained there is no voice for the units. Frankly I am happy there are none because in a turn based game voice overs just get redundant and old.

I neither recommend it or not....

I am not sure its worth its Price Tag 

However, its the first actually playable game in the Warhammer Universe!  So thats something!!!

What is the game:
To put it simply its Civilization 5 with everything Non Combat related extremely streamlined and simplified...
This game is like playing Civilization 5 non stop in a state of war with your total focus on moving and using the units in battle....  

If you were wanting a deep emersive economy or city builder this is not it....
This is the game you would get if Panzer General and Civilization had a baby.

And for many this is a great game!
For me I prefer Panzer General for Hex based combat...
Or I prefer Civilization 5 for its in depth economy city builder etc etc....

I don't find the streamlined Hex Based combat focused game that Gladius is to be that fun....
Its not terrible, its mildly amusing;  like a 6.5 out of 10.  Not high enough you would recommend it to anyone!
But not bad enough you would feel obligated to tell the world about how bad it is either....

It does have some buggy issues as of the time of writing this review and they are all Multiplayer related.
This game seems very stable and bug free in a single player environment but the multiplayer environment is a different story.

Please note I am a gamer, I am not a person who has great ties to the world of War Hammer, as an IP.  If you are a huge Warhammer fan then this game is likely for you.....As it is the best Warhammer game I have played to date, but thats also not really saying much....",1531774203,1531774203,True,21,0,0.60062021017074585,0,True,False,False

The biggest praise I have is that this is the only Warhammer 40K game which I played to date which I consider lore friendly. For example Space Marines are simply superior when compared to humans and this game makes no apology for that fact by watering them down like the Dawn of War series does. The mechanics and troop balancing feel like they make sense and that they were designed by people who know and love Warhammer. Space Marines (with PROPER bolter sounds) can only build a single city in the form of their Fortress Monestary. The Necrons, not known to be the greatest bringers of civilization can only build cities on top of a dormant necron tomb. This ensures that these two superior races have limited expansion options and will eventually run into a resource limit. So while the early game isn't very challenging as a Space Marine or Necron player you will eventually be overpowered in a war of attrition by the weaker but more numerous Orks and the Astra Militarum which will expand all over the map if you don't purge them.

The 'Relics of War' themselves are pretty uninteresting. They are basically terrain features which provide bonuses and I presume that they are mainly there to force players to hold territory and to spread their forces. They also make it very hard to roleplay fighting on any planet other than Gladius Prime. I was a bit surprised that Chaos has so little presence in this game. Not even so much as a cultist coven in the wilderness. But I think they will almost certainly be added as a DLC or expansion in the future, which me and my wallet will wholeheartedly support!

I highly recommend this game for those warhammer fans who always wanted to know what it is like to be an Imperial governor during a full-scale Xenos invasion, only to be purged by Space Marines for your trouble. This game is a grimdark dream come true. No mercy. No diplomacy.

Summarised review:
""Gladius: relics of war is in my opinion Dawn of War, translated to the 4x genre. If you were a big fan of the original dawn of war and like 4X games too, definately have a look at this one. Varied races, lore flavour galore and eternal war are what you'll find here.""

The good:

-Starts out with 4 varied races: i've seen people say that 4 races isn't that much, but i'd say it's enough, considering both DOW 1 and DOW 2 originally started out with 4 races each (We won't mention DOW 3). There's room for expansion on which Slitherine is planning to capitalise, so I'm expecting Chaos/tyranids/Tau to be added. The Four races that are in the game though (Astra Militarum, Space Marines, Orks and Necrons) are each varied and unique in their own ways. They even have different resources and resource gathering methods based on their lore: Influence, for instance, which is used to use your racial special abilities/heroes is gathered rather traditionally by all factions by building shrine-like buildings, but the Space Marines have an early hero who has a skill that nets you influence everytime he gains experience from battle. The Orks net extra influence per time they hit something, giving them massive potential to gain the resource, but unlike other races, their units also costs influence, to represent the WAAGH! drive of the race. All the Race rosters are expansive and covers most of their units from the lore, with only a few exceptions (Slitherine confirmed they might add in those missing units yet).

-Base-building: Copied, or at least very similar to endless Legend, base-building requires your city to expand physically tile per tile and has you build appropirate buildings to maximise the bonuses per individual tile. It all feels very smooth and organic and you can have each city produce multiple things: your Labour corps buildings can construct other buildings, whilst your barracks/factories simultaneously produce units. These buildings can be produced multiple times, speeding up your recruitment times and giving you the chance to specialise your cities. You'll soon feel like's youre creating massive Manufactorums churning out massive engines of war, or Infantry academies in a jungle.

-Lore and quests: definately a plus with a deep codex to look up everything you encounter via pop-ups or by clicking on it manually. The flavour text is very abundant and very well-written and really evokes the unique feel per race really well in my opinion. There's also a questline per faction, whose completion is a potential road to victory next to wiping out all your competitors. Like the flavour text, it is well-written, and explains the backstory per faction (and also why both human factions would kill each other).

-Combat: Combat is easy to learn, and harder to master. You'll need to pore over each unit's outfit and weaponry in order to maximise its potential, aswell as learn to work with terrain (forests, slopes) and unit firing range in order to master the field of battle. There's also a lot of wildlife (from Kroot Hounds to Haywire Kastellan Robots) to contend with on Gladius Prime, and it will not give you your precious resource tiles without a good fight.


The Neutral:

- Lack of Diplomacy: often cited as a negative point: in my opinion the diplomacy isn't crucial during the game itself. The only diplomacy to be done is acutally done before launching your game session, where you can set teams. Those whom don't like the space marines and imperial guard killing each other can set them on the same team, much like in Dawn of War or other RTS skirmish games.

- Animations: rather basic but not annoyingly so

The Negative:

-Customisation: I'll start with what they did get right: you can rename your units and these names will float above them, setting them apart from the rest of the army. They can also randomly acquire regimental names like ""eyes of the deciever"" for necrons, or ""Men of Tourmarinth"" for the Astra Miliatarum which adds flavour nicely. That said, there's no army painter/customiser or Changing of your hero characters, despite the light RPG aspects being present. Slitherine's announced they're considering adding the Army painter, but for now one has to content themselves with simply changing the overall color of your faction, and imagining playing Dark Green space marines is the same as playing the Dark Angels chapter. That said, the community's brought this up a few times and I'd be surprised if an army painter wouldn't be introduced.

Is it fun? If you are into that.

But it lacks a few elements I expect of especially the Warhammer (40K) franchise.

Scenario/Campaign: Right now the maps are random. And by random I mean totally chaotic random. There is no rhyme or reason to landscapes, rivers, mountains, biomes, placement of special resources, artifacts etc. No scenario & campaign.

Grandeur/Heroism: A squad of tactical marines should take out four times it's lesser adversaries (i.e. Imperial Guards) in numbers - or at least should have a chance to do so. It's just wave by wave plus maneuvering taking potshots.

Lore/Atmosphere: There is too little of it (and only in written form in the Compendium), to small & to few animations.

Ideas: Why no fortifications and trenches? That's how the Imperial Guards survive an hour longer. Up to three buildings in one spot - but only one unit? Different unit sizes, squad or platoon. Why does a Fortress feel like a glorified Landraider without tracks? Roads?

The faction missions in each skirmish are enjoyable, and really add depth to the lore for each faction, but I want more. More cutscenes for single play, more tooltips for the tactician, and more detail to the faction playstyle are the ONLY problems I have with this game. The tech tree is overly enjoyable. I always felt that civilization had too many ways to research where as Endless games had too little structure to the techtree. Gladius changes that by streamlining the tech tree into about 80ish techs that could potentially change the game for you.

Other reviews led me to believe the AI was clever or at least capable, but in my game I expanded out to two cities (which was surprisingly difficult because I was playing Necron and the only expansion opportunity was literally surrrounded by advanced creeps because a relic was next to it) and then attacked the first neighbor I could find.  It went alright up until they pulled a unit two tech tiers ahead of me out.  

I refocused on my other neighbors and completely overran one.  Interestingly enough as I slaughtered that neighbor they built a city next to my invading army, and that was the one time I saw the AI build a city in the entire game.  After overrunning one neighbor the rest of the game was a steamroll because I was now controlling three relics with a handful of cities compared to my opponents who controlled 1 city each and were, I'm guessing, trading a relic back and forth.

At the very end of the game I finally spawned the unit the AI used to fend me off in the beginning (doomsday ark) but was unable to get it to the front lines in time to participate.

Rather than trying, and inevitably failing, to recreate Civilization or Endless Legend in the WH40k setting, this game actually sets out to do something new with the genre. Technically speaking it is a 4x game, but in practice it occupies a weird borderland between a 4x and an RTS. The decision making and overall strategies have much more in familiar with RTS games, while the game mechanics (and the whole turn based thing of course) treads very familiar 4x territory.

If what you want is a completely traditional 4x game, with absolutely nothing changed and no envelopes pushed, then this is probably not a game for you. But if you're willing to meet the game where it is, this is an extremely well-executed and very compelling experience.

And it's fucking HARD if you let it! You can tone down the difficulty either through traditional sliders, or by increasing neutral unit amount to act as a sort of buffer, but with standard settings across the board even experienced strategy gamers will be challenged. The absence of diplomacy, and only two win conditions, mean that the AI is fully focused on the single task of building a strong infrastructure so it can kick your ass. And it doesn't pull any punches either. It doesn't pointlessly sacrifice units, or go into battles it doesn't have a decent shot at winning. A very refreshing experience when used to games like Civilization where the AI flips between psychotically randon and completely moronic every other turn, and the whole experience feels like playing a board game with your ""special"" friend, that you need to afford all kinds of handicaps to not roll over completely.

This is a tactical combat game, there is no diplomacy, spies or trading. You exterminate everything in true Warhammer fashion.

If you had played Civ you'd remember terrible AI, walking over your enimies with tanks while they had bow and arrows, while being harrased by mindless barbarians.

No this game is fantastic! I don't expect much from Warhammer games as I've been disapointed too many times but this is going to be a great one. I only say going to be because it is missing many races but all that can be fixed with DLC I'd happily buy.

The AI is challenging, grouping up, focusing fire, retreating to defensive positions and countering your units. 10/10

The depth of units is good and feel important, even your first units are useful end game. You feel badass with some tanks rolling up to some enemy troops only to have the smile ripped from your face when they hit you with melta bombs...

I'll list my Pro's:

1. AI (Amazing)
2. Combat is rewarding and fun
3. Races feel different, not just copies with 2 unique units 
4. Sounds and graphics are spot on
5. Good challenge level
6. Tactics is required (Unit spam is punished through counter units)
7. No bugs! None that I noticed or bothered me (almost unheard of these days)
8. Quests, though some variation between new games would be good
9. I completed a game!!!!! I've played EVERY Civ game ever released and I've not once finished a game...
10. The relics are a nice touch and give a reason to control positions
11. Fog of war, all I'll say is don't scout with units you don't want to lose...

Cons:
1. No mod support (please add it, all the cons below would vanish over night with the amazing people that create community content)
2. Big lacking in tooltips, seriously just how much of a defence bonus do ruins give?
3. City customizations like names, special buildings and such would help feel more connected to your bases/cities
4. Should have more map view options, like to see terrain bonuses and territory based on controlled positions. Otherwise you feel like you're running around a map aimlessly instead of protecting your land.
5. Need more random events or global events
6. No titans, they will be stupid I know but come on, give us some Titans :)

All in all this is a really fun game and has me choosing one more turn instead of sleep :)

Just don't play this expecting a game like Civ, because it is not Civ.. 

Instead it is a Warhammer turn based tactical strategy game that has fantastic AI and keeps you wanting to exterminate 
your foes over and over gain.

[list]

[*][b]Base building[/b] allows each structure you place to build separately from your main city unlike Civilization games that you might recognize this game's graphics from. This allows the game to escalate to bigger combats much faster but not so much so that losing units is not an issue.

[*][b]Units[/b] have a simple one movement, one action/attack per turn. This action can be saved to shoot enemies who move into range. This makes planning your movement and attack choices important. Some units have free actions that allow you to break these rules. Some scouts have the ability to move into a dangerous area with a damage reduction buff and then move back out again, thus allowing your army to move in or retreat to better terrain.

[*][b]Research[/b] allows you to unlock additional upgrades for existing units, making even beginning units relevant throughout the game. Nothing becomes obsolete and that is a game design rarity. 

[*][b]Cover/Armor system[/b] is what really makes this game's combat not seem dull. Each faction has different amounts of armor but all of them still benefit greatly from cover. This allows you to take different kinds of risks with each unit. Some units can afford to stand out in the open and soak up fire while your more vulnerable units use forests and Imperial ruins to reduce incoming ranged damage. However, all units lose most of their cover protection against melee attackers or flame-throwers. Deciding how to move your units so they can both attack and be safe from retaliation is perhaps the most critical part of this game. Making these decisions is easy due to the tooltips displaying what damage reduction percentage you will gain from the terrain. 

Overall, Warhammer Gladius hits the ground running each game. You build up a big sprawling base that you can use as a fortress if you get attacked and try to turn the game around. The units all have unique rolls that stay relevant throughout the game. Research progresses these units to be more adaptable to different situations and unlocks new toys of course. There is two victory conditions - conquest and lore - allow you to play offensively or defensively to win. Also, the games four factions will keep you playing with a lot of variety for many hours.

[list]
[*]No, there is no diplomacy. Kill everything, assuming everything will try and kill you. Quite a few people are upset by this--it's become a staple in 4x games by tradition (but not by definition). I do not feel like the game suffers because of it. The game is about combat strategy and resource management, and it does those two things well.
[*]The resource management system is balanced well. You should always have enough to make more units and keep the pace of the game moving, but little enough that you can't be wasteful without consequence.
[*]Huge games! I'm not sure the exact number, but this bad boy can fit a whole ton of players in it.
[*]The game is all about map control. The more objectives you control, the more map you see and more resource bonuses you receive.
[*]Both tall (one big super city) and wide (lots of smaller cities) gameplay styles are viable, but this varies mostly with the race you're playing as.
[*]Lots of future dlc: new races and additional units for current races are confirmed and under development. You can bet your bananas I'll be happy to pay for whatever dlc/expansion it is, too. This game is great as it is, and any new content will only be cherries on top.

The wildlife gives you something to fight and level up while exploring (Although it ""can"" be annoying and even horrifying)

There are multiple world settings to customize. You can turn the planet into a toxic sprawling waste of wireweed or a massive destroyed city with vegatation, cover the planet in hostile wildlife at every turn, or just set up a basic planet. All the options are there for you to play around with.

The music choice is good.

Turn timers do exist which makes everything so much nicer for larger games.

You can end your turn instantly if you feel like it.

The combat is fairly good as certain terrain types over their own advantages.

I was optimistic after watching the game from Arch Warhemmer's video but still wanted to be cautious, but now I feel secure in the time and money I invested.

The war focus of this 4x game gives it a very unique position compared to others in the genre, and fits the 40k theme. Playing with maxed out wildlife makes the planet feel hostile and gives you more to think about in terms of defense and offensive strategies against encroaching AI and the neutral monsters. They were fun to play around like a next would impeded me expanding there just as much as the AI, so it becomes far more tactical in choosing the priority target.

I was a little sad that the unit customization from Pandora was missing tho, i thought it world work great in 40k with all the different weapon and unit types, and give the diversity of Armageddon's massive unit roster, but remove the redundancy of having them all be separate pre-established builds. (Here's hoping for some kind of customization update)

I don't know what some people are talking about when they say the game is low on features, it has everything your standard 4x has besides diplomancy since it's Warhammer, and they make up for that with all the neat gimmicks of the game. Each faction is very unique and they all add a lot of replayability.

Also for some reason AI turns in this game (even at the max of 8 AI) go by extremely fast. I don't know why other games can't manage system resource processing for AI turns. Some take FOREVER. (looking at you Age of Wonders and Endless Space 2)

If you're a Warhammer fan it's a fat ""yes"" from me to buy this now, $40 is pretty generous for a new game from an established company, I'm sure you know the price is normally $60.

No diplomacy but there are quests. Note that the Deluxe edition neutral unit is tied to a quest.

The price is far far too high. The game feels like playing a mobile game and as such should be priced that way. £15 at the most should be the very top end for a game such as this. Its been jacked up as its a GW related product. 

More depth in choice of faction would have been easy to add and added much more spice to the game. For example being able to pick a chapter of space marines or ork clan, each with slightly different play styles and units would have been an easy add. 

The biggest failing in this game is the lack of Chaos as a playable faction. The 40k universe without Chaos just feels wrong, all GW games should come with Chaos as a playable race.

It's relatively expensive full price and has a low amount of content.  Visuals are very poor.  Gameplay rewards an excruciatingly slow pace as bold exploration often gets your stuff murdered.

So let's get the obvious out the way.  This is a 4x strategy game using the 40k universe.  The question anyone who'd be interested in this title immediately asks themselves is how does it compare to other 4x's they've played in the past?

- The first obvious difference is zero diplomacy.  It makes sense for the context of the game but also means there's a very large aspect of most 4x's missing.  It also changes how the game plays dramatically from any other game in the genre.  It's a lot closer to old SSI titles from the general series, (Panzer general, fantasy general etc..)  This is not a bad thing, just something to be aware of when looking to purchase this.

- The factions are ""sort of"" asymmetrical.  Which it to say they all have their own unit rosters, buildings, and bonuses.  However they are not that radically different from one another.  Each faction has roughly the same unit type at the same tech tier.  The scout sentinel for the imperial guard serves the same purpose as the skimmer for the space marines for instance.  They are different units with different stats/model but the role is the same.  Likewise with city buildings and play in general.  They each have a flavor without being really unique.  End game they differentiate themselves somewhat with units like the Baneblade and Gargant playing obviously different.  It's a middle ground between Civ's near identical factions and Endless Legends true asymmetry.

- Barbarians in this game are the local wildlife.  I would strongly suggest turning it up to max as well.  It does a lot to keep the game exciting through early and mid-game while the players are still expanding and growing.  They insure you very rarely are spamming the ""end turn"" button waiting for things to happen, A La Civ.  It's also fodder to level your troops on as well a s a real threat to expansion and small groups of units.  Proxy really improved this aspect over their previous title Pandorum, in which the local fauna was mostly just annoying without being fun.

- Graphically it's attractive.  Nothing mind blowing in the looks department but it's more than functional for what it is and some the the unit designs and animations are really nice.  I find this less important than some when playing a strategy a game so keep that in mind.  My criteria is generally, ""If it's not eye searingly ugly, it's fine.""  Gladius more than passes.

- The sound is a mix between average and good.  The bolters sound great while lasguns have an odd thump that I'm not a huge fan of.  Again, functional without being outstanding.  I found myself surprised by how much i liked the music though.  It's somewhat generic but fits the the theme of what you're doing and has the occasional epic swell that is just a joy to listen to.

With those points out of the way, I have to say that I am having fun.  At the higher difficulty levels the AI puts up a good fight, and you can designate teams to make it even more challenging.  My current game is a huge map, playing as necron vs three other teams of 2 AI.  The game plays pretty chill and well paced with occasional moments of panic as something goes badly wrong.  One of my favorite moments thus far is playing as the imperial guard and running into a massive Ork army with several scouting infantry and a psyker hero.  Trying to withdraw them while pounding the enemy advance with basilisk fire felt great, gave a plethora of meaningful tactical choices and really highlighted the games strengths.

It's a 4x for the combat oriented.  It's more limited in its scope than civ but a lot tighter in its focus.  If you're a fan of both the 40k mythos and enjoy TBS games, this is a good buy.

As a 4x game has its flaws, for example no diplomacy system (they said is for lore reasons, but there is in fact diplomacy at Warhammer 40k). And may be a bit simple, but its adictive.

As a warhammer 40k game, also has some flaws, as only 4 playable factions. But the good point is that they bringed up necrons and imperial guard. Some people hate this game because no chaos, but we have plenty of games with Chaos/Eldar/Space marines and no Necrons. Also the roster is ok, but it's not completed. I think they made it for balance reasons (in tabletop necrons have few units, meanwhile imperial guard, space marines and orks have tons of types of unit)

If they add more playable races at a fair price (i don't think they go mad at dlc price) it will be a nice addition, as every race is pretty well done, and unique style of playing.

I'll start with what's good about this game, move to the weird, touch on disappointing, and end with what pushed me to write this review. Bear in mind that this is coming from one playthrough, as the space marines, on the difficulty one below normal (can't remember the name right this second).

Good:
Combat is satisfying and tactical, and the AI is not incompetent at it at all. I started out close to a space marines AI, and had a really interesting duel over the course of 50-ish turns, when multiple times the AI would send out a unit that I didn't have before (first predators, then thunderfire cannons) and use it inteligently, forcing me back for a while. I actually had to work to counter what it was doing and figure out where I could put devestators in order to kill the vehicles, rather than just rolling over the AI easily, as would have occured in most other 4x games. Unit balance on the whole feels fairly good, I never had any units that felt useless or overpowered (well, except the stormraven gunship, but given that it's the very last unit unlocked it can get a pass). Eventually I got to a critical mass of land speeders and devestators where I didn't really have to think as much about what I was doing, but it wasn't easy to get to that point, and I lost up to half my army getting there. 

Weird (not negative for everyone, but sort of annoyed me at times):
Tabletop-ish mechanics: The game mechanics for combat are clearly based off of warhammer 40k 7th edition, rather than 8th edition. This means a couple of things: firstly, no primaris marines, which might be a positive for some people, but I missed the variety somewhat. Secondly, any keywords a weapon has gets brought into the game, even if said keywords only exist for the sake of abstraction on the tabletop. For example, a bolter is still a ""rapid fire"" weapon, which does exactly the same thing as on the tabletop, lets you fire faster at close range. But, they could have just given it a rate of fire between its rapid fire and long range values, and got a weapon with less gamey abstractions that would be closer to how a boltgun actually shoots, rather than this binary difference. They keep following this same trend with storm bolters (2 bolters strapped together), which fire 2 shots with no rapid fire. Why? Because there was no way to have a 2 shot at long range rapid fire weapon in 7th edition, so the storm bolter fires 2 shots at all ranges in that game. There's no reason to have it still work this way in this game, and I feel like the developers should have taken more initiative in thinking about the reasons why the tabletop game works the way it does, rather than just copying everything blindly. The only mechanic they don't seem to have replicated from it is how characters work, where they instead... made them work in exactly the same fashion as they do in Warcraft 3, essentially. They have 3 regular skills and an ultimate, maximum level 10, 6 item slots, all they are missing is the same stats system. 

Lack of customisation: Every unit in the game has a fixed loadout, with every individual in the unit having the same weapon as well. This means, for example, that instead of a devestator squad working how it does in tabletop, with a squad sergant who can use a variety of weapons, and 4 tactical marines with any heavy weapon, it's always 4 tacticals with lascannons. The predator description mentions the Annihilator and Destructor varients, but you can only ever field an annihilator, without sponsons (until a tech lets you have them! buuuut you can only have heavy bolters, no options there either) The dreadnought is probably one of the best examples of this, because the loadout it's locked into (close combat weapon with storm bolter and multi-melta) is exactly the same as the one from the Assault on Black Reach starter set, for 5th edition, which ties back to my point above about this game keeping closer to the tabletop than it really needs to. Not a major issue, but somewhat disappointing, particularly because a side effect of this is that I was unable to find a single plasma weapon on anything but the plasma cutter that the techmarine with the thunderfire cannon has. 

Lore: On the surface, the lore looks quite good, but there were some weird moments of dissonance while playing. The random lines that my marines would say during combat were generally fine, but occasionally they would say something that doesn't really fit with the mindset of a space marine at all. It never broke immersion that much, but it felt like whoever was in charge of that part of the game didn't really know the universe that well. What's more, the intro for the game starts out saying that your chapter is claiming this world as its recruiting world, putting its fortress monastary down and all that. But, the armour of your marines is blue, and they occasionally make reference to Guilliman, the ultramarines primarch. It feels like you're playing as ultramarines and they just haven't stated it, but the situation of your chapter bears no resemblance to them at all. I don't get why the developers didn't just make a new chapter with clearly different livery, rather than ending up in this weird state where it's not clear if you are an established chapter or not, and the lore breaks if it's the former. 

Disappointing:

Faction variety: Yes, I know each faction is designed to play quite differently and that takes a lot of work, but launching with only 4 factions is disappointing to me. Especially given that fully half of them are imperials and there's no sign of chaos anywhere, it could lead to the game wearing thin fast. As already mentioned, in my first game with only 3 other opponents, I ran into a duplicate of my faction, and it wasn't even that unlikely. 

Unit variety: While the units we have are generally well made/balanced, there's still some holes in the roster that would have been nice to be filled. As I said earlier, no primaris, but beyond that, the marines have no vanguard or sternguard veterans, no assault terminators or centurions, no whirlwinds, rhinos, non-scout bikers, or razorbacks, and especially absent is the land raider. If you're going to have only 4 factions, you might as well fill them out. As is, I was really feeling the absence of any kind of anti-armour melee unit for most of the game, until terminators came (and even then, they are more melee-shooting hybrid units). Being able to put some lightning claws or thunder hammers directly into the enemy would have been very nice at times (I couldn't find either of those weapons in the game anywhere, tying back to the lack of customisation mentioned earlier). 

Reason for writing the review:
The missions: This will go into spoiler territory eventually, but essentially, after killing 2 of the AIs and reducing the last one to its last city, I decided to win via the missions system rather than just finishing off the last AI, since that seemed more interesting to me than taking just another city. 

[spoiler]Going through the first 4 missions, things went fairly smoothly. The game spawned a bunch of units without warning a couple of times, but generally it wasn't anything too unmanagable. I eventually acquired this doomsday device, which the game told me could perform exterminatus, and activated it as told. Rather than instantly ending the game, it instead set off a 20 turn countdown to victory, and spawned a massive army of necrons, which was reinforced every turn faster than I could ever produce units. And it wasn't chaff either, 3 monoliths on the first turn. I went from being completely dominant with most of the tech tree researched, to dead in 12 turns, with next to no warming. I saw one of my predators go from full health to none just from overwatch. I probably would have had to max out my city to stand any chance of winning, and overall it was really unfun and hopeless[/spoiler]

Take Civ5, cut away all the fun things, like normal growing cities, diplomacy (wth can't two Marine factions work together?!), different biomes, complex research-trees.

- find a place for your first city
- get attacked by kroot hounds
- all of a sudden: castellan robots und enslavers (which are, btw, warp-dwelling creatures)
- loose your units
- try to farm ressources
- steamroll your opponents

And I never thought that I will say this, but in this game it really doesnt matter. So lets see: graphic is eons ahead of last 40k game of this sort that slitherine published - sanctus reach. Now I'll say that its on par with games like civ6, which is huge improvement. Gameplay is solid, sure there is some (lot) balancing issues (like dreadnought being hit for 1/3 of his health from freakin' kroot hounds), but the core mechanics are there and they are very good fundation for plethora of $20 DLC's that will surely follow. Speaking of civ6, don't expect that kind of game here, it's much more like warlock (much more about combat that on building), 'cause ""in the grimm darkness of far future there is only war"". And that's really great for this game. The building menu is minimalistic, but with very intuitive icons, and I like them very much. It's really whether you like chrome or firefox as your explorer kind of debate here, someone will love it, others will hate it. For now there are only 4 factions (which play very differently), and there are some options missing (like devastator marines having only lascannons as weapon of choice), and some wrong animations (like dreadnought multi-melta sounding and looking like lascannon), and oh yeah, it looks to me like vehicles cannot shoot on different targets with different weapons (which really sucks if you have bolters and lascannons), but all of this can (and probably will) be easily corrected in moaaar DLC's. So, overall, to me this is the best game from slitherine ever. If you're a 40k freak this game is a must buy, if you like 4x genre this game is pretty solid considering it costs 30 euros or so.

So as a huge W40K fan a Civ fan and an Endless legend/space fan i feel pretty comfy sharing my humbel opinion ^^

I started up the game, lowered the sound and put on some archwarhammer on my second screen, i noticed how i could toggle on dlc(wich made me very happy since it indicates a good possibility of new races comming later!)
the settings are fairly wide so i messed around a bit before starting a game.

For my first game i picked the orks, orks have always been rather straight forward so i expectedt hem to be a good start!
this game reminded me a lot more of endless legends then it did of civ wich i found rather suprising, but let me just sume up a couple notabel things i noticed on my first playthrough:
-You can build multiple buildings on one tile!
Wich is really nice since it allows you to exploit bonusses from certain tiles a lot better.
-Citys can build multiple things at once!
As in: i can build a farm at my city, a unit from my barrack and a tank from my workshop all at the same time.
-Dear wildlife, could you not?!
i love it! i love seeing great groups of hounds agressivly roaming around my city tearing up poor orks and guard man.
-there are multple special building across the map, simply capping them will grand you a bonus.
this promotes a way more active gameplay wich i deff like, it also increases the odds of running into something very very nasty ;) 
-its so damn smooth! units move very fluid and the mechanics are very solid, its truly remarkable how they managed to build a game wich promotes both: carefull planning, agressive scouting and in depth managing of cities.
-Lore approved! no jumping terminators!!!! all jokes asidfe, i do really love how units will have little comments about situations wich really fit their theme( for ex. guardsman that are standing around will say things like ""the quite before the battle is the worse"".
the quests and intro videos are also really spot on.

Now, enough sucking, lets get into some negatives.
-No frikking roads!
like, could you please?
-no stationary deff structures?
let me build artillery stations in my city, gun enplacements and walls, let me truly make a W40K like city!
-no wonders ;(
i like making beautifull buildings, why not allow me to make only 1 of a kind buildings?
-Tech options and balance
It still needs some balancing, especially necrons seem a bit to OP.
Futher more i would love some special load outs mfor my troops, plasma guns, flamers or meltas will make early tier troops somewhat relevant late game.

all in all i really love the game! i get that classic ""one more turn"" feeling and they really managed to make it feel 40k like building a far more dangerous and aggresive planet then you usually play in.
i really hope they will look into things like: trade or allies (i do see how this could be a race trait say the tau being really trade like and the eldar making allies for a while)
if i did have to give it a score i would rate it a solid 7/10 in its current form(with a good change for a 8 mb 9 later on)
as refference i gave civ a 7 and endless legends an 8.5(with the exp).

So is it worth your 30 bucks?
yes! go frikking buy this game and go play it! it's awesome and gives a highly entertaining and unique W40K feel one that is more than a endless bloodbath(DoW >.>) but actually feels grimdark.

Ill admit it felt stale for the first hour (maybe i was expecting a new twist to the 4x scene or something else idk), but after playing it some more i really started getting into the game. 

I really like how the factions feel very different from eachother. Playing as the spacemarines really had me going with a sense of zeal and praising the EMPEROR with every action I do, but then switching to the Orks i really felt like i everything i was doing was just for the sport of fighting and smashing things. Im really interested to see if they will add more factions but im happy with the differences in the factions and how they really make the play style feel different.

Overall Gladius is a fun solid game. There are small little things i can nicpick about like the UI but it doesnt really destroy the games fun for me. If your a Warhammer 40k fan i would recommend giving this game a chance.

Some call the game a civ clone with 40k skin.
That would accauly been an improvement on what we got.

So why you shoudnt buy it?
Because the game ask more then 10 bucks for something a kid in his spare time makes for free.

The biggest map is tiny.
The combat takes forever kill anything.
The factions arent lore friendly.

You can see that they tryed.

The game offers nothing other games havent done better.
Go play dawn of war, eternal crusade, battlefleet gothic, deathwatch, spacehulk, etc.
Most 40k games are better then this.
Strip away the 40k skin and there is nothing left.

Boring combat, horrible slow gameplay, a tiny map on the biggest map setting's, a lack of options.
The game just isnt worth the money.
If it becomes less then 10 bucks then sure buy it.

It features asymetric factions who each have their own twist on how they should conduct war.  If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40K lore, you will also enjoy how the design of each faction is thematically appropriate.

Based on the few maps I have generated so far, each game you play will turn out very differently than the last.  This speaks well to the game's replay value.  The number of opponents you include as well as the map size will certainly have an impact on the pacing of your game.  If you enjoy early game skirmishing, you can add more opponents and use a smaller map.  If you'd rather duke it out later, you can use a larger map and less opponents.  The game allows you to play it how you want to play it.

Ideally, I'd like to see another 4-6 races added to the base game's 4 races.  This would allow you to have a huge variety of opponents to plan for and deal with.

Having a flashback to Battletech though, with the my only major downside being something ""not quite"" AAA being priced ""almost"" AAA.

If this was in the 20-25$ range I think it would be basking in the Overwhelmingly Positive.

This game is not a clone, for better or for worse, of another game. It isn't Civ, or Endless Legend, or Age of Wonders, it is it's own thing.

That thing is a completely war-focused and stripped down 4X. This gives the games a fairly straightforward feel, and the mechanics, while good, are not particularly in-depth. This is not necessarily a bad thing. All the micro in this game is really pushing you to army management (with one caveat I'll mention below). Everything outside of war is straightforward - build, research a decent tech tree, and use your stuff to kill more xenos.

The focus on army management and the way in which battles play out actually gives this game a TBT feel that I appreciate. I think they have found a nice little niche here.

Resource management is fairly well done, as you won't find yourself in the weeds to much on this, beyond the caveat I mentioned above. This interesting mechanic which I have yet to decide if I love or hate is population caps on your city. 

It basically works like this: your city might have a max population of say, 6, due to food limitations. At this point, it just won't grow. Pops don't go work tiles, they just ""man"" your buildings. So you can have a city with 6 pops and 12 buildings, and the micro is all about turning buildings ""off and on"" as needed. The buildings pump out (or eat) the resources, not workers on tiles. This actually sort of flips the 4X genre on it's head and I respect the bold move. In essence, you might be in the negative per turn on a resource for a long time, because you have built that one up for 10 turns. Now you've turned that building ""off"" and started pumping out marines from the academy which is now ""on.""

Note that even buildings like factories and academies often *provide* some resources, so this isn't a simple zero sum calculation.

All that being said, great game. Price point a bit high. As it falls and people start getting it on specials, I think it will become more and more well received. By the time any person can pick it up for 20 bucks in a couple years I think this will be remembered, in the storied legacy of hit and miss WH40K games, as a very solid hit.",1531452003,1531452003,True,74,0,0.81950145959854126,2,True,False,False

If your favorite part of 4X games is engaging in diplomacy and politics, this game isn't for you. At its core, Gladius is a war game; as it is set in the 40k universe, this style makes a lot of sense. The four factions feel quite diverse, with each one having its own units, buildings, and technologies. 

Setting and Environment: Set on the world of Gladius Prime, the game nails the feeling of an utterly hostile planet. In the early game and, to an extent in the later game, one of your greatest adversaries will be the environment. Facing hostile contsructs and monsters adds a nice sense of variety to otherwise stale conflicts. Since the wildlife doesn't care what colors you sport, battles often can become 3-4-5 way brawls between you, enemy factions, and the wildlife. This adds an element of unpredictabilty that is quite welcome in breaking up a stalemate or a standoff. The environment is rendered with drab colors, fitting for the 40k setting. There are different types of tiles (desert, savanna, etc.) but you won't notice this too much from a gameplay perspective. Some tiles are high ground, giving you vision or combat advantages over enemies below. Others hinder your vision and movement. In all, the environment and set pieces do their job well.

Gameplay: As a 4X game, this game has the required features. City management isn't too complex to distract you from your wars, but isn't so simple that you can ignore it completely. Fans of other 4X games should have no trouble jumping into their first game of Gladius and learning the ropes. For a game that focuses so completely on warfare, Gladius rightfully directs most of its (and your) attention to just that. Most technologies pave the way for unlocking new units and abilities, and your economy's singular purpose is to support your war machine. Expansion is driven by a need for more soldiers and vehicles, and it all feels natural. The technology tree is fairly simple, with each faction having 10 tiers of technologies that are researched progressively. Don't expect your tech choices to vary wildly from playthrough to playthrough. Each faction has a wide variety of units that are all useful throughout the game. Warfare is a mixed between ranged and melee combat, and giving your units orders becomes quite natural after an hour or two. There is no diplomacy at all in the game; from the time you start to the time you end, you'll be fighting. 

Graphics: Gladius' graphics are adequate. The set pieces look nice enough, and the unit models have nice animations and textures. It's not breaking any records in the beauty department, but it plays out the 40k fantasy more than adequately. 

Replayability: Sporting random maps and generation, this game is quite replayable. With the addition of more factions over time, the replayability will only increase. 

Who should buy it now?: People that love the war aspect of 4X games, people that love 40k, people that love wargames. people that have friends to play it with.

Who should wait for a sale?: Anyone who likes 4X games but is more on the fence about the lack of diplomacy and politics. 

Who is it not for?: Anyone wanting a complex empire managment simulator. Anyone who doesn't like strategy games. 

Gladius is well worth its 40 dollar price tag at launch, and deserves long term DLC and patch support from its devs.

That's that playthrough attempt down the drain. I'm tired of technically flawed and unpolished releases. I'd give it another go, but that will most likely kill my chances of getting a refund, if the problem persists. Hence, the refund is requested right now (don't know if I'll get it with 3 hours of playtime...). I might give it another try at some point in the future, IF the devs get their game in working order.

For those of you who'd still like to give it a chance, here's my first impressions:
I had fun while it worked. Gameplay is solid, albeit a little shallow. It feels less like a ""proper"" 4X, but rather like a simple turn based, hex based wargame. The focus (as most of you will know) lies entirely on combat. There is no diplomacy, no advanced empire management, only a very linear research ""tree"" (it's more a road than a tree, really, since nothing branches out) and basic city expansion. The only victory condition apart from extermination is the completion of a quest line (if enabled). The game doesn't have the depth of Civ or Endless Legend, but it seems pretty good at what it does (from my experience so far and from what I gather by watching others play).

The game handles well. The UI is visually bland but very well organized and easy to understand. Tutorial popus help with basic controls and game mechanics. Tooltips in game are detailled and easy to understand, but they are missing during map creation.

Visually the game is overall not very appealing, but it's not horrible either. The units look fine, though not super detailed. The same is true for effects and most of the animations (some of them are really cool, others rather basic). The map itself looks very bland and I don't really like the colour pallet, but it captures the gloom of 40K.

Sounds and music are good, but the game lacks voice acting.

Content-wise, the game offers the typical playthrough on randomly generated maps with a large number of customization options for map generation. Nothing else. There's no narrative campaign or specific scenarios. I haven't tried multiplayer, so I can't comment on that.

Bottom Line:
_____________________

The game might be a fun little strategy game. If you love 40K, that's a bonus. The price tag seems a little steep for what you get. If you want to give it a go, I recommend waiting a little while for the devs to fix the technical issues and a sale on top of that. In it's current state I can't recommend it because of the lack of stability.",1531423496,1531423606,False,6,0,0.526842296123504639,0,True,False,False

The clean UI kind of reminds me of Endless Legend/Endless Space style, the game stands on a solid base mechanically as well. The ambient of the game, the fine details are just above anything I ever dreamt of. Performance is solid, Easy to get into, the tutorial and the tips do help out quite a bit.
There are really no place for unforseen shenanigans, as the game's pace is not too fast, but not too slow either.

You build units, position, use abilities, and slowly war your way through the enemy forces while taking on some quest chains. Doesn't seem to be overly complex, but also isn't a AAA priced game. Each faction playing differently makes me look forward to the other campaigns I'll play after the space marines, even though I've barely started this one. Resources like food and ore which I can only assume orks/imperial guard use the space marines do not, so having a variety of game mechanics will keep it interesting rotating between the factions so they don't play the same or prioritize the same development. Initial impressions are definitely positive though, as a more advanced battle for wesnoth/advanced wars/similar battle centric turn based strategy games I'm having fun with it.",1531420143,1531420143,True,4,2,0.508873105049133301,0,True,False,False

I like that the fact that I don't have to worry about the other Factions in the game finding me and realizing I have technology they want and if I don't give it to them then we go to war. We are already at war with eachother so that is nice. I also really like the research trees. I think they did a good enough job spacing everything out to where you have a hard time deciding what to choose in the tier you are in and if, once you unlock a another tier, to continue researching in the same tier or move on to the newly acquired tier.  

All in all. If you are a fan of CIv and you basically only choose a military win in Civ or if you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k Universe then this game is definitely worth it. If you are a fan of Civ and you choose a diplomatic victory I would recommend staying away from this game.

The biggest killer for me with this game was it just didn't have any satasfaction while playing it, it just wasn't fun to play, and i expect to get hate on this because i'm giving it a bad review but the game just isn't worth what they are asking for it with such small ammount of content. I'm personaly tired of Companies thinking that they can just throw a title out with a couple of units and call it a $40 title like it has hundreds of hours of content possiable i just can't see it being that way.
