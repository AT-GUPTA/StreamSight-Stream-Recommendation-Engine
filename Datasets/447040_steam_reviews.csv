[quote]Context: I’ve completed Watch Dogs 2 about a week ago, but last played Watch Dogs 1 ~22 months ago, so my memories of it might be fuzzy[/quote]

Watch Dogs 2 is an “ok” game, ok enough that I completed it (~35-38 hours), but it lacks heavily in three critical areas in which Watch Dogs 1 didn’t (at least not that much): story, game design and balance.

[h2]Story[/h2]

Story in Watch Dogs 1 is memorable, makes logical sense and makes you want to play more to uncover it. Story of Watch Dogs 2 is bullshit:

[list]
    [*]You complete the entrance test to DedSec (hacker organization, member of which you become), so they kidnap you just to let you know that you are in. What?
    [*]DedSec is not trying to be secretive. They shoot video addresses with their real faces and basically everyone knows who you are. You can here something along the lines: “What is DedSec doing here?”, “DedSec shouldn’t be here” when doing missions from people in buildings, yet none of them are doing anything about you.
    [*]The premise “we need more followers to take down Blume” is not bad by itself, but it is entirely empty words. You “take down Blume” linearly, as you complete main missions, independent of how many followers you get in side missions.
    [*]They try to get followers by doing good stuff, yet some of the stuff they do is completely random and doesn’t portray them as “good guys”. Like: let’s steal the car used for movie shooting. Or: let’s hijack popular singer, to prevent his deal with a billionaire.
    [*]Some enemy says something and DedSec reputation plummets … Wait, what happened? So they go to hacking event, win and now everyone believes in DedSec again … Wait what?
    [*]So many seemingly random characters. Who are they? Who is Miranda? At some point [spoiler]Horatio[/spoiler] dies and the entire DedSec team is sad about it. Meanwhile I was like: who even is that dude? Watching a speed-run, he indeed was featured in one of the missions, but nearly not enough to remember and care about him as a player.
    [*]DedSec met some of its arch-rivals a few times. Why didn’t they try to kill each other all those times? (And they killed a ton of people throughout the game) Why did they need to wait until the final mission?
[/list]

Almost none of it makes sense.

[h2]Game Design[/h2]

There are just so many missions (especially side missions, optional items) which are of type: “climb to the roof” (to pick up or do something) and most of the times it is incredibly annoying to do it, especially annoying after you do it a couple of times. One of such mission’s walkthrough video’s top comment says exactly the same, so I’m not the only one who thinks so.

Watch Dogs 1 had cool police chase sequences, where there used to be a lot of things you could hack on the road: you could enter a road and then immediately close a passage behind you. This barely exists in Watch Dogs 2.

[h2]Balance[/h2]

is almost non-existent. I remember when playing Watch Dogs 1, I had to use all available play techniques: stealth, melee, shooting, remote detonation, etc. With Watch Dogs 2, the only viable technique left to complete most missions (as a non-pro player) is stealth+melee, because
[b]Reinforcements[/b]
the very moment you get noticed by anyone, [b]everyone[/b] in the restricted area gets immediately alerted. It doesn’t matter if you kill the person who noticed you half a second later and he’d realistically try to defend first and not have the time to alert others. Once you are seen, everyone is on alert. Even worse: it then only takes about 2-3 seconds for someone (most likely someone far away you can’t reach) to call reinforcements, which a bit later call their own reinforcements and so on, thus continuing an endless cycle. Reinforcements arrive almost immediately, even you are on a ship. What?! Then everyone surrounds you as if they could see your exact location (maybe they don’t and it’s just good AI). Once you get spotted, the endless cycle of reinforcements begins and it’s almost impossible to restore the game.
You can take down enemies with melee one-by-one, but in some missions, 2-3 of them are always close to each other - that’s when it gets really tricky.

Watch Dogs 1 as far as I can remember was also tricky with reinforcements, but nearly not as much: you had the opportunity to deactivate (with hacking) enemies’ ability to call reinforcements. You could explode enemies with area props, most of which in Watch Dogs 2 became “non-lethal shock” (read: almost useless, as the affected enemies don’t die, but everyone gets alerted anyway and as I told before, we want to avoid anyone getting alerted at all costs).

[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]

One very cool feature of Watch Dogs 2 is “automatic multiplayer”. I have never seen anything like this in any other game. You can play single player missions, but the game automatically detects when there are other players in the nearby area and suggests you to do some (online) missions together or against each other. For example, you can join the police chasing some other player. This all (mostly) happens without any loading screen, the game switches between single- and multi-player mode behind the scene. You can determine which mode you are in by opening the map and seeing if the car continues to move or pauses.

[h2]World[/h2]

is cool and beautiful. I like the graphics.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I recommend to get Watch Dogs 1 and skip this one.",1708764108,1708764108,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It is decent. Limited mechanics are very obvious and you will be using and doing same mechanic through the game.

Very limited choice of cars/bikes. Overall expectation as a lot worse then it actually is. Considering the price on discount it is well worth it

As for the game itself, as someone who is tired of samey open-world games (thanks Ubisoft) I enjoy the Watch Dogs series, and 2 is my favorite of them. It's not like GTA at all and does it's own thing; I appreciate the focus on stealth even if it's not super deep. San Francisco is beautifully recreated in this game and I would recommend getting it when it's on sale.

Hacks, Combat, Driving, and vibes. Really fun game to play, and runs extremely well for the open world expansion it is. Been really enjoying the campaign, and a few of the online missions. Expecting the campaign to take 10-15 hours, given the breadth of options in side missions that seem too fun to not do. Want to steal an AI based self driving car and then blow it up? YES! 

Pretty good game, got on sale. Would recommend. Honestly really is no where near as good as the original, and I cannot see myself completing it- personally I just found it dull after half way through.

As far as open world games go, this is probably the one I've enjoyed the most. More than just a pretty vista to look at, so much of the environment is interactable in ways few other games compare to. Buildings serve as 3D puzzles for you to climb, explore, and manipulate. Enemy strongholds give you a hundred different options on how you approach your attacks, and no two encounters are the same. The sheer amount of variety tucked into such a vast space will keep you entertained the whole campaign through. Oh, and the fast travel system - it’s golden. For players bored with traversing the vast distances, you can shortcut from one destination to the next with absolute ease. 

In terms of a [i]Watch_Dogs[/i] game, the mechanics familiar to the franchise got streamlined and fine tuned in all the right ways. It is definitely the superior of the two, feeling like the next evolutionary step for returning players, while being accessible to brand new players. You can skip the first one and miss nothing both in terms of play and story. Speaking of which…

Ubisoft took notes: audiences were bored with broody, bland Aidan and his vigilante quest for revenge. So they gave us an animated, quirky group of folk heroes sticking their middle finger to the man by causing ALL of the collateral damage. These are protagonists from tragic backgrounds, with chips on their shoulders and the tools needed for chaotic good to burn down a broken system. Go crazy, be a domestic terrorist, and then get back to your righteous crusade fighting corporate “monsters.” The game doesn’t just let you be a maniac, it [i]encourages[/i] you to be a maniac. If you ever needed a lesson in ludonarrative dissonance, this may be the game for you. 

Overall, it's pretty fun, if a bit pricey. Grabbed it on a Steam sale and got my money's worth out of it.",1689053556,1705720144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Watch_Dogs 2 as a sequel met my expectations in a weird way though. I lean towards dark & gritty atmosphere and serious tone but Ubisoft did complete opposite which isn't a bad thing, actually it's a good thing given Ubisoft record of using same formula since FC3 & ACB this was unexpected and bold move by Ubisoft.

Gameplay where WD2 shines most. Hacking skills improved a lot you can do so many crazy and creative stuff using your abilities. For example you can call cop on a target and witness him/her getting arrested or call hit on a target observe gangs doing driveby you can even do gang shootout just call a hit on rival gangs and watch them doing gangbanging in middle of street call cops too for extra chaos and watch it like a movie. You think that's enough? hell no! summon your explosive equipped drone and rain bombs on them and watch vehicles getting explode and bodies flying away... Hacking is focus here there are so many creative ways to utilise and take out your enemies I didn't use guns much only for last resort I mostly went with stealth and hacking. Game incentives for that style too because you can die easily and lethal gun takedowns & slow mo focus absent here. They still using same takedown system from first game so that was let down for me. You can punch pedestrian but there's no proper melee system and your melee weapon called ""Thunder Ball"" looks & behaves very silly I didn't like it but fits the setting of the game I guess. Driving mechanics not improved much still feels same as WD1 but vehicle variety increased. Game have a radio now you can listen different radio stations with it's DJ which is a great improvement but don't expect GTA's Lazlow quality. Song selection on the other hand uninspiring this might be subjective but I didn't like most of the songs in this game it just didn't put me into game's mood. This time game based on San Francisco a colorful and cheerful atmosphere complete opposite of Chicago's dark and moody atmosphere. Map size is big so many great locations to explore and rural areas also expanded greatly. What really impressed me most how versatile map design is you can climb so many rooftops using your parkour ability. There's even a crane; you can hack it, hump on it, lift it, rotate it then reach very tall buildings or better squish any poor enemies with it...

But if we look at story well it's kinda falls apart. This time we are part of DedSec hacker collective, throughout the game we're doing operations to expose big corporations's shady practices and take down main villain's goals. Mission structure not linear we can do main missions in different order and replay it these are great improvements but why story is weak then? well because of characters. Main villain for example I barely even remember his name he is very uninteresting and forgettable. Other big companies you expose through operations also not integrated well into main plot. Final mission also huge let down seems very rushed. WD1's final mission was very memorable and chaotic this ending isn't like that. Your companions not great either what's the point of ""Horatio"" he just appears at beginning of the game and few missions then gone, he felt last minute addition. Game also tries to create some tension between the crew but goes nowhere. Since I'm not really into hippie culture, silly jokes and constant pop culture references I just couldn't be attach to story nor it's characters. That doesn't mean they are terrible in fact ""Wrench"" by far the best one, out of all characters he stole the show I liked him a lot. T-Bone also returns as well he's still great just as WD1. What I really liked most on main missions though are level designs you can complete your objectives in multiple ways for instance you can use your RC Jumper without even stepping a foot or you can enter from various types of entry points. Side missions are good improvement over first game. Crew gives nice context for each side missions and some of them really good and hilarious like ATM mission. There are tons of activities you can do as well such as racing, taking pictures etc. 

Gameplay wise WD2 great improvement over WD1 but from story wise it's not, WD1 did it much better. I recommend it to any fan of this open world genre. As for WD1 fans be ready for drastic setting change. I also have to point out modding. This game uses Easy anti-cheat and it's not allowing to change game files you need to turn it off but turning off means you cannot play online. It's bummer but I didn't care because I really dislike camera in this game it's far from protagonist so I downloaded WD1 style over shoulder close camera mod to make my game enjoyable at the expense of online. After finishing 100% I tried online and it's fun they kept seamless solo/online experience intact they even added bounty hunter mode.

Really, after the first game we know DedSec as a group of genius hackers working underground and able to collapse whole ctOS system of Chicago. And in second game we see all of them: 

-	Hipster version of CJ from San Andreas
-	Girl doing painting and chilling
-	Guy with communication problems solving via tattoos, violence and BDSM-mask
-	Guy with even more communication problems solving via hard coding
-	Guy with funny name who motivates everyone[spoiler], mainly by dying in the mid of the game[/spoiler]

I understand that the game was launched at the prime of hipster culture and represents vibes of San Francisco, but seriously…  these guys are DedSec? If yes, omg we doomed. 

And the plot based on fighting corporate evil and solving personal problems of kids-like level is sometimes very hard to digest. 

This is my only concern about the game. Rest is a direct and quality evolution from the first game: visual (pixel arts), new mechanics just-in-time added (drones and weapons crafting), old mechanics evolving (privacy intrusions), and even multiplayer nicely incorporated into main game.

{ Graphics } 

+ San Francisco appears as a beautiful city, everything from the buildings, the lighting, the environment , the npc is just so spectacular, hard to believe this game came out in 2016 
+ The characters model is good and detail, but normal NPC model is not up to par

{ Gameplay }

+ Now this is where Watch Dog 2 really shines. The gameplay expanded a lot compared to the first game, It nails the hacking system very well with a variety of options like: phone distraction, vehicle control, traffic control, security system shutdown, robot hacking and of course, one of the best things they ever add and ever exist in a video game is planting fault evident which make the police or the gang to attack someone . You too lazy to learn the enemeis location to sneak in their base ? just call an entire SWAT team on them and they gonna create enough distraction for you to go in 
+ I have to give the parkour system big credit for making the game movement so smooth and enjoyable . There are also variety of parkour animation , my favourite is back flip and front flip 
+ Gun play is so so , i don't have much to say about it 

{ Story } 

+ The story is decent , not great but decent . The thing that stands out for me the most is not the actual story itself, but the interesting characters that we meet , i mean by that is my gang : Wrench, Josh , Horatio , Sitara and the main character himself Marcus  . Their personality is quite unique and the way Ubisoft show them is Amazing 
+ Wrench with his iconic mask. He is so fun to talk to , he is hilarious always make jokes throughout the adventure, he like destroying stuff . My man having a serious problem with animal though XD
+ Josh is like a depressed kid . He is quiet ,doesn't talk much kinda socially awkward but very smart. That doesn't mean he is boring , he brings a different sort of humor to the game like when he try to find out what ""cornhole"" mean XD
+ Sitara is the only woman in the team , my girl is a real artist and DJ , very talented . She is the face of dedsec cause without her drawing skills dedsec have no appearance
+ Horatio is kinda bland because Ubisoft some how doesn't  give him much screen time. He is nice and vibe dude 

{ Audio } 

+ Voice actiong is great
+ Music is...... so so , i don't find myself listen much to the music in game. But it is cool that you allow to pick a song to listen to all the time even in combat 

{ Difficulty } 

+ Gun play is balance , our health is not superior than our enemies like other game . We die like after 4 to 5 shoot and believe me ,you gonna die a lot if not careful
+ Enemies AI is Smart . They don't just take cover and shoot back, they actually have strategy like some guys in the front keep you busy while the others rotate and try to flank you, and since you die after 4 to 5 shoot like i said, direct combat is not recommend
+ Well.....Here is reason why the game is not 10/10 . It the stealth system , WHAT KIND OF GAME where one enemies spot you even just for 0.1s after you take him down, the entire army knew exactly where you are and jump on you. 

{ PC requirement } 

+ You need a decent laptop/pc to run this game 

{ Game time } 

+ pretty long ( 17h-30h )

{ Bugs } 

+ i don't see any bug 

{ Final thought } 

+ There are still a ton of thing i haven't talk about like normal NPC AI , dialogue , Car physics, hacking puzzle, side quest and stuff.....
But This game is good and for me it is the best game Ubisoft ever create",1702368324,1704644943,True,45,2,0.805272042751312256,2,True,False,False

Watch_Dogs 2 as a sequel met my expectations in a weird way though. I lean towards dark & gritty atmosphere and serious tone but Ubisoft did complete opposite which isn't a bad thing, actually it's a good thing given Ubisoft record of using same formula since FC3 & ACB this was unexpected and bold move by Ubisoft.

Gameplay where WD2 shines most. Hacking skills improved a lot you can do so many crazy and creative stuff using your abilities. For example you can call cop on a target and witness him/her getting arrested or call hit on a target observe gangs doing driveby you can even do gang shootout just call a hit on rival gangs and watch them doing gangbanging in middle of street call cops too for extra chaos and watch it like a movie. You think that's enough? hell no! summon your explosive equipped drone and rain bombs on them and watch vehicles getting explode and bodies flying away... Hacking is focus here there are so many creative ways to utilise and take out your enemies I didn't use guns much only for last resort I mostly went with stealth and hacking. Game incentives for that style too because you can die easily and lethal gun takedowns & slow mo focus absent here. They still using same takedown system from first game so that was let down for me. You can punch pedestrian but there's no proper melee system and your melee weapon called ""Thunder Ball"" looks & behaves very silly I didn't like it but fits the setting of the game I guess. Driving mechanics not improved much still feels same as WD1 but vehicle variety increased. Game have a radio now you can listen different radio stations with it's DJ which is a great improvement but don't expect GTA's Lazlow quality. Song selection on the other hand uninspiring this might be subjective but I didn't like most of the songs in this game it just didn't put me into game's mood. This time game based on San Francisco a colorful and cheerful atmosphere complete opposite of Chicago's dark and moody atmosphere. Map size is big so many great locations to explore and rural areas also expanded greatly. What really impressed me most how versatile map design is you can climb so many rooftops using your parkour ability. There's even a crane; you can hack it, hump on it, lift it, rotate it then reach very tall buildings or better squish any poor enemies with it...

But if we look at story well it's kinda falls apart. This time we are part of DedSec hacker collective, throughout the game we're doing operations to expose big corporations's shady practices and take down main villain's goals. Mission structure not linear we can do main missions in different order and replay it these are great improvements but why story is weak then? well because of characters. For example main villain I barely even remember his name he is very uninteresting and forgettable. Other big companies you expose through operations also not integrated well into main plot. Final mission also huge let down seems very rushed. WD1's final mission was very memorable and chaotic this ending isn't like that. You're companions not great either what's the point of ""Horatio"" he just appears at beginning of the game and few missions then gone, he felt last minute addition. Game also tries to create some tension between the crew but goes nowhere. Since I'm not really into hippie culture, silly jokes and constant pop culture references I just couldn't be attach to story nor it's characters. That doesn't mean they are terrible in fact ""Wrench"" by far the best one, out of all characters he stole the show I liked him a lot. T-Bone also returns as well he's still great just as WD1. What I really liked most on main missions though is level designs you can complete you're objectives in multiple ways for example you can complete your objective using your RC Jumper without even stepping a foot or you can enter from various types of entry points. Side missions are good improvement over first game. Crew gives nice context for each side missions and some of them really good and hilarious like ATM mission. There are tons of activities you can do as well such as racing, taking pictures etc.

From gameplay wise WD2 great improvement over WD1 but from story wise it's not. WD1 did it much better. I recommend it to any fan of this open world genre. As for WD1 fans be ready for drastic setting change. I also have to point out modding. This game uses Easy anti-cheat and it's not allowing to change game files you need to turn it off but turning off means you cannot play online. It's bummer but I didn't care because I really dislike camera in this game it's far from protagonist style over shoulder close camera mod to make my game enjoyable at the expense of online. After finishing 100% I tried online and it's fun they kept seamless solo/online experience intact they even added bounty hunter mode. If you planning modding this game keep that in mind.",1704642459,1704642459,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Parkour was also great, you get this sense of speed. I never found myself complaining about running to my car that spawned a 100 meters away.

Story was decent, not as gritty as the first game, but decent.

8/10.

note: please do not buy any story dlc here in steam for this game unless you want to turn out like me. It seems the dlc only works if you play on Uplay, and that is going to lead into starting another save file.",1704478157,1704478186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Innovative Idea and interesting gameplay. Looking back the story is uninspiring. However, def worth a try if you like a hacking-themed game





This is my old review back in 2018:

(Please forgive my bad English as English is my second language)

WD1 is rather a disaster, from the huge downgrade in graphic to disappointed main story plot, there's many cons in the game. And because of that, I didn't plan to play WD2. However, in last year's winter sale, the price went down drastically, so I said to myself, why not? And I bought the game with the least expectation.
Turns out this game is MUCH MUCH BETTER than WD1, not only the graphics gets much better(2 Years gap, duh!), the main character, marcus and his buddies are much better in the main character role than grumpy old man Aiden. Here's the Pros and cons I've come up with, hope it can help you determine to buy this game or not!

Pros:
+Graphics
+MC are much better
+Many more guns and cars
+Phone looks much more like a phone than WD1
+Melee Animation
+Marcus actually uses a computer to hack stuff
+The Co-Op mission is really fun(For me)
+Like the Jumper and Quadcooper

Cons:
-Harder to earn money(Maybe should be a pro? idk)
-The showdown is crap
-One of the motocross races and all of the sailboats races are hard as hell
-[spoiler]Horatio died [/spoiler]
-There's other cons but I can't think of any right now

It's like finding out your gran has taken up skateboarding. Unbelievable, right? But, surprise, surprise, this one's actually good! I mean, they made it with love and dedication, which is rarer than a cat that fetches.

Let's break it down. Graphics? San Francisco looks bloody amazing, like they hired a bunch of artistic magicians. Characters are detailed, but the average NPC looks like they stumbled out of a budget costume party.

Now, the gameplay – that's where Watch Dogs 2 shines. Hacking galore! Phone distraction, vehicle control, traffic chaos – it's like a digital playground. And planting false evidence to watch the cops or gangs go nuts? Genius. Too lazy to sneak into enemy territory? Call in a SWAT team. It's like Uber for troublemakers.

Parkour system deserves a round of applause, making the movement smooth as silk. Backflips, front flips – it's a virtual Cirque du Soleil. Gunplay? Eh, it's there. Not much to say.

Story's decent, but the real stars are the characters. Wrench, with his crazy mask, destroying stuff for kicks. Josh, the depressed genius with a weird sense of humor – ""cornhole,"" really? Sitara, the artsy DJ saving DedSec's aesthetic bacon. Horatio? Nice dude, but a bit of a wallflower.

Audio's good – voices are on point, and music's alright. You can pick your own tunes, even in combat. Difficulty? Balanced gunplay, smart enemy AI – they actually strategize! But the stealth system, mate, one guy spots you and it's like the whole army has your GPS.

Final thought? Ubisoft, against all odds, made a game that's actually worth playing. It's like seeing a dog play the violin – surprising, but hey, it works!",1703724725,1703724725,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As far as I'm aware, there's no sure way to fix it but people claim limiting your FPS fixes it, turning off HFTS shadows, or using DXVK. None of these fixed my issues except the 0.72 version of DXVK but it caused insane performance dips and stutters for me and I'm just not playing the game like that. Honestly, the flickering makes the game unplayable since not only is it immensely distracting, but destroys any semblance of immersion and is just downright painful to witness because of how bad it can be at times.

NVIDIA even released an official statement saying they're at an impasse with this bug because Ubisoft won't help them fix it (Proof - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/520845/geforce-grd-53623-feedback-thread-released-61423/3361173/). I've also seen multiple instances of Ubisoft support just telling players to use DXVK to fix it, which is insulting I'd need a third-party application just to fix a game-breaking bug. Of course it's not their support department's fault, but that alone just says a lot about Ubisoft as a company, especially morally, and how much they truly don't care about their players or the future accessibility of their games, yet still charge nearly full price knowing this hardware issue.

[h2]The Open World of San Francisco[/h2]

A major highlight of ""Watch_Dogs 2"" is its characters. They're thoughtfully developed, adding depth and relatability to the gaming experience.

The gameplay here is absolutely stellar. It's quite unique and a substantial improvement from the first game, with even more interactables and dynamism. While the gunplay is subpar, it is absolutely possible to complete the game without using anything more than melee takedowns, the taser, and environmental objects that you can hack. The most fun I've had playing this game was when I held myself to not using any lethal guns for an entire playthrough.

I also really like the game's depiction of the Bay area and its general worldbuilding, showcasing a dystopian but all-too-real future where health insurance companies can raise someone's rates for ordering ""unhealthy"" food and every aspect of life is datamined for the benefit of large corporations. The bay area here also provides a fun sandbox experience outside of missions, with many ways to mess around with pedestrians and even start conflicts between rival factions.

While I do love the general worldbuilding, I'm not as huge on the overall story nor the primary characters. Say what you will about the story of the original watch dogs, but the ludonarrative dissonance here is truly on overdrive at times. It does help to go for a non-lethal playthrough, but there are unavoidable moments that feel incongruent from the personalties of the involved characters. 

Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a very fun experience that shows the promise of the IP and the unique gameplay elements center to it. It's a shame that this game ended up receiving far less attention than otherwise due to how much of a disappointment on multiple levels the first title was, and it's also a shame that Watch Dogs: Legion took a massive step back in a number of respects despite the interesting gimmick at it's core & the interesting environment London promised to be for the series. At the very least we did get one good watch dogs title, and that's about as much as I can ask for when it comes to this publisher.",1703333088,1703333088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The overall joy you get from driving a vehicle in this game corresponds to the amount of nutrients you get from eating half a cucumber (the small ones). The story is incredibly unsatisfying to follow. The radio stations play music that would fit really well into the main menu of a skateboarding game from 2008. On average, this game is somewhere below average.

Here's my updated review after coming back to the game a few years later and giving it another try:

Not as bad as the first few hours made it out to be (not counting the intro - that was pretty solid), but it does take some getting used to. Expecting the charm of GTA isn't a good idea, although it does have its own cool moments. I found myself enjoying driving around the city and completing the small objectives and puzzles. It is not a challenging game, but the sort of overpoweredness that it gives you allows you to play around and have fun. The story isn't super interesting but it does feature internet memes and other types of internet fandango shenanigan thingymajingies that I haven't seen in many AAA games. 

The grid-hacking puzzles are fun. The spider-robot was very fixe pá.

A little later on into my playthrough..

I used to hate the characters in this game, and to some extend I still find them a little cringe, but they do have their charm. The story is not super serious, and I kinda wish killing people wasn't a thing you did, cause it creates this weird quirky-but-serious scharingadingdong that doesn't work. Game is not as bad as I previously thought, but a big part of that is me deciding not to take it too seriously. It's not a hard recommend but it is a ""maybe haha"".

The parkour is fun and well made. Reminds me of Assassin's Creed a little bit, although not as integrated and important as in those games. I wish they made it a bit more prominent and important to the overall gameplay experience, because throwing your drones above rooftops to figure out which path to parkour up is quite a satisfactory experience. Quaint, if I must say so, even.

Invading a building by sending in your drone first to retrieve the door key and then sneaking in to stun-gun everyone is satisfying. The whole sense of overpowered control that you have is fun, even though it makes most tasks in the game feel trivial. But it doesn't have to be hard, because the narrative of the whole story is that you are this overpowered group of hackers that are trying to turn the world around. 

The ""we are anonymous"" type of cinematics that play throughout the game are a scandal and I wish they stuck to the silly and goofy stuff. The ending was quite cool though, it's an ALRIGHT game, I will state again. Now I shall leave this keyboard and go do some parkour-lite (walking to the fridge).

There's a pretty good collection of indie-pop music present in the game which I didn't discover until after I had beaten it. The in-game radio has infected my own Spotify playlist a little. 

The graphics are pretty good but the characters are big bottlenecks. The facial animations aren't great and the way the lightning hits characters makes it look like they're made of plastic.

The parkour animations are pretty cool though, I like those.",1605897980,1702947530,True,0,0,0.449826985597610474,0,True,False,False

The DLC contents should be added in the game, but that's just Ubisoft being Ubisoft I guess. Even if you are a fan of Ubisoft like me, do not buy this unless ALL THE DLCs are added in the game and the price is way cheap.

Nothing like the first one, this is more of a stealth game and has a pretty goofy story and characters that doesn't take itself seriously at all. i don't like how much of its identity is borrowed from GTA V it feels kind of cowardly like a complete over-correction from the first games moody atmosphere and action packed gameplay
its a horrible sequel but it is a pretty good game on its own terms.
there is a pretty sizeable sandbox in here with the hacking systems having higher depth.
unfortunately alot of it feels inappropriate, why would you use lethal firearms and steal cars in this game?
it has the worst ""ludo-narrative dissonance"" in a game i have played, but you can choose not to interact with those elements

the skill tree in the game made the end of the game more fun since all the hacking abilities are unlocked and you have the freedom of doing the missions however you like, even driving feels more fluid than the first game.

The villain who appears often enough during the story is also a very plausible character with a very well chosen voice actor.
I enjoyed playing this game far too much (especially with the little Nudle-car which is awesome), although I suck at driving. But the missions are manageable, the site activities self-explanatory and this game has enough content for many hours of gameplay. Did not spend money on the cosmetic DLCs but on the content DLCs, and since i bought the package on sale, it was definitely worth the money. Not only for fans, but for everyone enjoying a story-driven game, which you can play as you wish, either stealthily or doing an ""overkill"", taking out anything that moves.

I play on Steam Deck LCD and turning the settings down to about Medium mixed with low and limiting my fps through steam deck settings I can get about 2 hours of play. On Steam Deck OLED with the same settings you could probably get 4 hours of play or more if you turn the settings lower. Multiplayer and general online functions don't work due to anticheat not working on Steam Deck/Linux. In my experience I can't play the game if I'm off wifi because whenever I try to login to Uplay/Ubisoft Connect it says my login information is incorrect when it isn't. The simple way around this is to just get into the game when you're on wifi and put the Steam Deck on sleep mode. Once you're off wifi and turn the Steam Deck back on you can play exactly as if you were playing on wifi.

Overall in my experience this is a pretty good game for the Steam Deck having been on consoles and works with the steam deck controller scheme just as it is played on Playstation or Xbox. You can even get a steal on the game if you wait for it to be on sale for about 8 dollars and something cents if the 49.99 is too much.

The game does require a bit of tinkering such as needing to run the game on Proton Experimental which you can do by going into the steam game's settings (the cog wheel), go to properties, Compatibility, force game to use of a specific steam play compatibility tool, change the proton version to Proton Experimental which should be at the top, then save it.

Next, because the game uses ubisoft's launcher it has ubisoft messages like ""your graphics card is lower than recommended"" which that message doesn't go away so it's annoying, it's also meaningless because the game runs fine on steam deck. 

Anyway to make the messages not show up add the back buttons and make one of them shift, and another F2, than while in-game (not in the main menu) hit them at the time time and it should bring up the ubisoft quick menu. Go to settings and turn off ""Enable In-game Notifications"". Now if you restart the game the messages may show up for a second but they'll go away. You can also now reset the back buttons in case you don't want to use them or if you want to assign them to different controls.

Finally, I've heard the game crashes sometimes and it's because of the multiplayer aspects that you can't use on steam deck. The best way to stop these crashes is to simply go into the in-game settings, multiplayer, and turn off all the multiplayer settings.",1701552577,1702237863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

San Francisco is beautifully designed and is fun to go around. There are a lot of fun activities to do. Graphically it looks amazing, even playing this in 2023.

The gameplay is vastly improved. Movement doesn't feel sluggish. A lot more hacks are available and the equipment available is far more interesting. The RC car and drone are amazing and it really opens up the way you can approach the game. Driving is also vastly improved compared to WD1.

Story-wise, it's very good. Some cringiness here and there but I could get past it. Most of the characters are well rounded and the villain as well. I love Marcus as well especially compared to Aiden from the first game.

So, I just finished my epic hacking adventure in Watch Dogs 2, and let me tell you, it's like jumping headfirst into a tech-filled roller-coaster of emotions. Strap in, for what I am about to say!

First off, San Francisco has never looked this cool. It's a digital playground where every street corner hides a hacking opportunity. The graphics? They're so sharp you might accidentally cut yourself. Seriously, the attention to detail is on point.

The story follows Marcus Holloway, a badass mofo. He's like the love child of Anonymous and a parkour master. The dude can climb anything, and his hacking skills? Pure genius. You get to wreak havoc in the tech world, and it feels oh so satisfying.

Now, let's talk hacking. It's not just pressing a button; it's an art form. You can manipulate the city's infrastructure, turning it into your personal chessboard. Traffic lights, security cameras, even a random dude's smartphone – it's all fair game. And trust me, causing chaos with a few taps never gets old.

The characters? are quite good almost like Ubi nailed it. They're diverse, hilarious, and just the right amount of crazy. I found myself caring about this virtual gang more than some people in real life. Oh, and did I mention the soundtrack? It's a head-bobbing, mood-setting masterpiece. Get ready to hack to the rhythm.

Multiplayer? Heck yeah. Co-op missions, hacking invasions – it's a wild ride. Me and my friends causing chaos together? What more could you ask for?

Sure, every game has its quirks. The driving physics might make you question the laws of physics, but who cares when you're hacking a self-driving car, right?

In a nutshell, Watch Dogs 2 is a hacker's dream come true. It's bold, it's beautiful, and it's so damn fun. If you haven't jumped into the world of DedSec yet, what are you waiting for? This game is like a high-tech adrenaline shot straight to the my soul.

- I can't access the dlcs ( I have search everywhere and send a ticket and got zero feedback )
- The achievements don't always pop ( You need to restart the game )

General opinion: It's fun to roam around and find new things to do, there's a good amount of missions both relating to the main story line, and also side quests. Some missions, like the ones where you have to paint murals around the city, really annoyed me, because it's all just grinding.  I added a spoiler on the bottom of the review in-case someone wants to read it. 

AI:
The AI in this game sucks, not that it was any better in the first one either in my opinion. Sure, it's not as bad as in ,,Rust"" where the AI shoots you straight in the fucking head in a nanosecond, but it could of been better.

Optimisation:

The game mostly ran well, medium to high settings and it performed well. I haven't tried to change that many settings, but sometimes while loading in certain areas and mid-fights or chases the game stuttered a bit, nothing major to worry about. 

Multiplayer:

Oh man.. Some people really deserve to get hit through the monitor. 
If you're new to the game and need help with a difficult online missions and try multiplayer, be ready for fuckers who take on the role of trolls in-game and ruin it. Fuck being stealthy or helping you out, multiple times I've been sabotaged and failed missions which were hard to complete, all because the player helping you decides to fuck around. Certainly not recommending to play with anyone else, unless they're your friend.

Characters: 
 
Well...they're fine. Some of the characters I really like, some of them i REALLY don't like. Marcus is a good introduction to the series, but i feel like him getting into Deadsec felt a bit rushed. Josh was okay, Sitara was pretty cool with all the art she did and the dialogue with Wrench was the most fun you will have. Wrench and Marcus shared a lot of bro-mance through the game, and Wrench carried the whole dialogue mid-missions. Sure some stuff was annoying, but very rarely did I feel annoyed at characters in the game. Spoilers ahead: 	[spoiler]Aside from..Kenny. Kenny was really cool to talk to in the first game, but here I was always suspicious if he wasn't going to fuck me up or not, which ruined me to expect for him not to. I had to finish the whole game to find out he wasn't gonna do something, and it just feels like it flopped, because he never really proved himself to me that he can be trusted.


Spoiler alert ! : [spoiler] At some point the game is gonna make you paint on a fucking bridge, climbing all the way to the top, which takes about 15 - 20 minutes to complete. That, is a incredibly boring mission. [/spoiler]

Buy it for a console, or at a service that will let you refund it if it doesn't work at all.

Update 4 months later: spent another evening trying ideas from the dozens of google results around this error - compatibility mode, forcing it offline, priority changing, xml editing, running as administrator, fiddling with graphics card settings (AMD has even more issues, though i'm on nvidia) and it still crashes within a minute of playing the real game after the intro.

Gameplay has varieties to them. They're not just a shooting fest or go point-to-point. Hell, killing enemies is difficult because they are actually intelligent and troublesome. The stealth part is actually the best part of the game. It has a lot of depth, and you need to strategize and not just blindly kill. You can even NOT kill anyone (which perhaps is unique from other """"""GTA clones"""""") if you are smart enough. Of course, I like it classic and headshotting everyone.

I enjoyed the story. I do not think it is cringe and the characters have their own charms. I hope what's in this game stays in the game because everything from ctOS, Blume, and that giant fucking Spider are goddamn terrifying and those who wish to reproduce them should not reproduce.

The puzzle (hacking networks) have been improved. Despite having the same puzzle pieces, instead of solving sets of networks in a fixed wall, you have to move around or use your gadgets to reach them. Much more fluid than the last game.

Definitely an improvement from its predecessor and calling this a GTA clone feels...condescending. I do not care about how good the graphics are or how large the world is, give me exciting and diverse gameplay and new concept that differentiate you from the competition, and I'll give you 27 hours of my life to play this heck-a-ton of gigabytes.

That being said, it's pretty okay. I do not own any DLC, just the base game. I beat it in around 35 hours, at a leisurely pace while doing some side missions here and there. It'd probably take you 25-30 hours if you focus only on main objectives. I had a pretty decent time with it, I'd say, but there are plenty of problems.

 I wish that the open combat was given a bit more of a focus, but considering that this is a stealth-heavy game, I get why it doesn't. I also with there was weapon customization. When it comes to stealth weaponry, there's a stun gun, a silenced pistol, and a silenced assault rifle. That's it. You don't have any other options for stealth. No adding silencers or scopes or anything. It doesn't make sense to me to emphasize stealth and punish open combat, then limit your stealth options in such a way.

 The puzzles are alright. They're not too hard, and the last few missions do make you think. Shame that all the challenge is in those last two missions rather than the whole game. Also, it's all plumbing puzzles (Rotating pieces to make one continuous connection) and finding out what vent your jumper needs to go through. Those are the only kinds of puzzle there are. If you're looking for challenging, engaging and varied puzzles that really make you think, look elsewhere. You won't find them here. If you just want to have fun without hard puzzles getting in your way, then this probably won't bother you.

 I hate the integrated multiplayer. I keep trying to turn it off, but every time I start a new session it's turned back on again. It's really annoying when I'm in the middle of a police chase and some guy with a grenade launcher and sniper rifle comes and wrecks my shit, or when I'm just minding my own business and someone comes along and blows up everything around me and enters a ""hacking invasion"". It's extremely annoying. You might like this random PvP, but I don't. I hate it. When I buy a singleplayer game with multiplayer features, I want to play a singleplayer game with *SEPERATE* multiplayer features. Not a singleplayer game that randomly decides ""You're playing multiplayer now, deal with it"".

 Most things about this game that I don't mention in this review can be described in one word: *Fine.* Nothing amazing, nothing horrible. It's average. Nothing special. Graphics, driving, gunplay, all that can be described as just fine. Not much else to be said. It's just GTA but with hacking. The hacking, by the way, is also just fine. It's exactly what you'd expect. Aim at something electronic, press a button, and something happens. Make the traffic lights blink. Make a transformer malfunction. Hack into a camera. Make a car move remotely. It's all kinda whatever. Decent, but not great. It is *fine*.

 Speaking of cameras, they don't do anything except act as viewing places. You'd think that maybe you'd have to avoid them during stealth, wouldn't you? Make them look somewhere else, disable the camera guy, temporarily turn them off? Nope. They're just viewpoints for you. That's all they are. And related to that, security systems, namely the motion detectors. When you first encounter them, they're an actual problem you need to work around. But then you can just get a skill to turn them off, completely removing the challenge! What was an actual problem you needed to work around creatively using your drone or jumper, becomes a minor inconvenience to aim your mouse at them and press ""C"". Sure, you can just not take the skill, but why would you include the skill in the first place? It ruins the balance of mid to late game missions.

Oh, and now the story- it sucks. I mean, the plot itself is just a generic ""Big bad company is bad and good underground rebel group fight bad company"" story. Full of clichés, the characters are about as deep as a baby pool, and the game tries to portray the player as good when we steal money from the poor and homeless. And while that last one is optional, the other two are very real problems. The writing sucks. If you want to play for the story, don't.

TLDR, the game sucks in a lot of places and is just fine where it doesn't. Now, I had a decent time with it, but I'd still say it wasn't worth fifty dollars. If this game goes on sale for $35 or less, I'd say it's a good play. But it's not worth $50, much less $90 for a bunch of cosmetics and a few extra missions.

By the way, the description has a grammatical error. It says ""execute the biggest hack *of* history"", when it should be ""in history"".",1700488915,1700488982,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In an attempt to be a mix of assassin's creed and dues ex, it would end up being a somewhat mediocre combination of the two if not for one major issue.

The stealth mechanic is one of the most poorly done I've seen in any game. You can be fully concealed and have suppressed weapons, but if you take more than 1 shot to kill your enemy - even if it's 2 hits with a super fast automatic weapon - suddenly all the enemies in the area know exactly where you are. The only way to break the heat is to shoot your out (impossible if you're against the cops) or hightail it out of there (which is impossible when you're doing a mission). Because of this, the game ends up being a cover-shooter more often than a stealth game.

If it doesn't work, refund immediately, because there's no way you can get it to work if it doesn't work on your system.

After the first mission, you unlock the final mission which is ""locked"" behind the requirement of: getting more followers, destroying everything about the story, since, the story doesn't matter anymore, the only important thing is: get followers, which is not a fun game mechanic..

The side quests have trickled down a lot, there are some races, and then... there are some races that you need to repeat for the main quest anyway, soo, why bother..

The worst part is though: your headquarters has this guy saying: hey, we need a fourth for this cool new DnD ish game we want to play, you up, and even after finishing the entire story, when you finally don't immediately auto respond, naw, I'm busy, since you're not busy anymore... you still auto respond with, naw, I'm busy...

If you can get it for under 10 bucks or so, you know, it is kind of relative fun, and the story, even though it doesn't matter at all to the entire game has some fun small things embedded into it, that's just cool to do, soo, while it's on sale, like right now, probably worth it",1699815544,1699815544,False,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

I asked for a refund (first time ever on Steam) which I did not get because I bought the game too long ago. Does it matter if the game just doesn't work? It shouldn't have been sold in the first place! 

The sarcastic thing is that you get a crash screen when you start the game. It really fits the unstable and constantly crashing game. If you search for ""crash"" on the Steam discussion page for this game, you will find 831 articles spread over 84 pages. Instead of the developers wasting their time making 100 types of clothes/appearances, they should spend that time making the game more stable.  

So now you already know that you should avoid this game, I will still say something about the game as I still managed to complete this game for 100%. 

The game offers many missions and variety and you can spend many hours in this game to complete the story and all the sub stories. Make sure you buy your drone early in the game as it will help you a lot to sneak through missions. The character in part 1 was much more interesting than the character in part 2. Part 2 is probably more appealing to 16-20 year old players because of the immature jokes in the game. 

On the positive side is the ability to complete the entire game non-lethally. Hacking gives you a lot more options compared to part 1. You can call SWAT on an NPC or put them on a gang hit list.

The DLC's Human Conditions and No Compromise are worth buying/adding to this game (if you ignored my advice not to buy this game in the first place).",1699807544,1699807544,False,2,1,0.53071671724319458,0,True,False,False

 - Steal random people's money on the street, including but not limited to: homeless, poor, rich, men, women, etc. There's no discrimination.
 - Graffiti a religious building (No, not New Dawn, an actual Church).
 - Hack the lights and electronics of a female streamer and scare her because she does 24 hour live streams because her nosy aunt makes assumptions with no proof there are simps in the stream.
 - Erase job applications from people because we don't like where they are applying to.
 - Supporters of Dedsec in New York start setting fires to corporate buildings. When asked if Dedsec should make a statement about it, Marcus says that the statement should be one of support for the arson.
 - Swat a kid playing Rainbow Six Siege. (Granted, he SWATS people too, so it's eye for an eye mentality. You decide.)
 - Stealing civilians cars on the street by hacking the alarm system.
 - Blow up vital infrastructure in San Francisco.
 - Mess with people's bank account for shits and giggles and recording reactions.
 - Cause numerous traffic accidents.
 - Leak company secrets for game journalists (yuk) (but an admittedly funny thing to do).
 - Vandalize the Golden Gate Bridge for advertising

Heck it's literally a plot point that because of Dedsec, people are afraid of hackers and are buying CToS 2.0 to fight it. Blume aren't the good guys, but it sure takes a villain to beat a villain I suppose. It's hard to tell if it's intentional, so you decide if this is genius, or stupidity from Ubisoft's writing department.

its really really sad that they KNOW these problems exist but continue to host sales for it in its broken, unplayable state.
and its tricky cause youll get halfway through the story before you just cant progress any farther.

ubisoft seems to do this for many of their legacy titles. 

due to these issues this is a no go for me until they patch the game.

Lots of fun running around San Francisco and fun being able to do missions cleanly with just stealth and your drones. You have access to all sorts of military hardware but it's nice not having to kill hundreds of NPCs if you don't want your non-violent activist hacker guy to be Rambo.

The story is very simplistic, get the evidence against the bad guys and put it out there. The public will listen and believe and react accordingly. Politicians and CEOs are easy to get rid of with a few hacks and some evidence gathering.

Whatever, it's fun and if you want a big running gunfight on the way to the next mission, just pop a few shots and let the madness ensue. When the cops kill you, you respawn quickly and near the place you died so it's not annoying getting in accidental fights either.

I didn’t play the original game, so I approached this with fresh eyes. And boy, am I glad I did. The San Francisco setting works well, even including some of the surrounding areas, like Oakland and Silicon Valley. It’s a GTA-style open-world game that doesn’t follow the typical Ubisoft formula, although it still has some elements.
I didn’t find the story particularly interesting; it’s a lot of exposing the evil plans of big corporations—a trope that's been overused. The characters are a mixed bag as well, and I didn't particularly like any of them. Most missions are also repetitive with similar objectives: hacking things inside a restricted area, although a few of them are fun.
There’re a lot of different collectibles to find, from money to skill points and cosmetic items. Some are locked behind puzzles, but they aren't that interesting. Some are annoying to get, and most are inside restricted areas as well, which isn't a lot of fun.
However, what I really enjoyed in Watch Dogs 2 was just messing around on the streets with your hacking abilities. That's where I had a lot of fun with the game. Even with your basic skills, you can already do things like hacking bank accounts and watching people's reactions to that. And that’s just the beginning. As you progress and gain more abilities, you can remote control cars, call the police and gang members on civilians, and even cause small blackouts.
The hacking skills are fun to use, and combining them leads to some of the best moments I had in the game, all unscripted. Only a few privacy invasion missions made me laugh as hard as hacking ATMs and seeing the reactions. This was much better than what I found in the main story.
Besides these, there’re a few optional activities, mostly time trials. I need to mention the sailboat races—they are very annoying because the controls are different, and you need to constantly watch the wind. But in contrast, these races have an unnecessary epic soundtrack that made the races hilarious at times, since you’re just sailing while listening to Two Steps From Hell. Maybe it’s just me, but I really enjoyed this detail.
Speaking of music, the overall soundtrack is okay. Not great, but memorable enough. It has radio stations that you can listen to at any time, not just inside vehicles like GTA. The graphics are also good for the time. What I didn’t enjoyed were the shooting mechanics.
The game also has online co-op, but I haven’t played that. But from what I saw, it still works, and you can even find people to play with. Besides co-op, there are some seamless multiplayer elements in single-player, but I disabled them since I don’t like to be interrupted and want to play at my pace.
Besides the average story, I had a lot of fun just free-roaming and messing around, and in normal circumstances, that would’ve been enough for me to recommend this. However, being Ubisoft, I have two MAJOR complaints, not with the game itself, that I can recommend, but with Ubisoft itself.
First, there’s a known issue affecting at least most of Nvidia 30 and 40 series graphics cards. There’s a lot of shadow flickering, no matter what settings you use, which is very annoying. It’s also very specific to this game, so probably not the cards' faults. Still, Nvidia tried to fix the issue in a driver update, but since the issue was very specific to Watch Dogs 2, it contacted Ubisoft for help troubleshooting the issue. And guess what happened? Ubisoft just ignored that request, leaving the bug unfixed on a lot of modern hardware.
I suppose they didn’t want to bother with an older game that doesn’t make a lot of money anymore, but still, what a joke. There’re some unofficial fixes available, but they also have annoying side effects. And the cherry on top, the game has the “Nvidia – the way it’s meant to be played” splash screen, which is ironic as heck.
Despite this, I managed to play through the entire game, so it wasn’t a huge deal to me. Some times, especially at night, it’s barely noticeable. It’s very inconsistent, but most of the time, I managed to ignore it. Still, unacceptable for a AAA release.
The second complaint, however, affected me the most. I bought the Gold Edition here on Steam, which includes the Season Pass with extra missions and cosmetics. However, most of the DLC simply didn’t appear to me. I tried everything: reinstalling the game, Ubisoft Connect, disabling and enabling the DLCs, even installing older versions of Ubisoft Connect, and nothing worked.
After some browsing, I found out more people were having the same issue, but no fix. Well, I tried Ubisoft Support, but conveniently they recently shut down live support, redirecting to a Discord channel. At the same time, I submitted a normal ticket.
On Discord, I saw more people with the same issue, and all Ubisoft had to say were generic fixes, which I tried again to no avail. After some back and forth, I finally got a response from the ticket, where they basically said it was an incompatibility issue between versions and there was nothing they could do about it. Like, WTF??? What incompatibility issue? You are still selling the game and its DLC on Steam.
Are you implying you know about this, and everyone buying the DLC on Steam is basically getting scammed? Or it’s another issue, but like the shadow flickering issue, you don’t care because it’s an older game? Maybe it’s not affecting everyone in that case, but me and some other people PAID for this content and can’t access it, and Ubisoft refuses to help.
Ironically, in the end, I managed to access that content after downloading a pirated version of the game with all DLCs. It generated a save file where all the content was correctly registered, and by transferring that save file to my legitimate copy, all the content worked, without losing any progress. So yes, the only way I found to play the content I PAID for was by pirating the game. That speaks for itself.
While I had fun with the game, these issues, especially the second one, really left a bad taste in my mouth. I spent hours trying to get the DLCs to work (I bet I put more time investigating this than Ubisoft did), without success legitimately. And in the end, that’s why I’m giving this a negative review. I can still recommend the game, just not this version.",1698514926,1698514926,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

The first 10 hours are some of the best Ubisoft can offer, with varied mission design, well made cutscenes, a beautiful and in depth city, and interesting hacking mechanics. However, the game suffers from a lot of repeat, recycle filth that Ubisoft is best known for nowadays. The open world is legitimately one of the best that Ubisoft has ever made, and is a great representation of San Francisco. The graphics are great for a game that came out some time ago. The story is laughably dumb, but the characters are interesting and there are some good side missions. The story is far worse than WatchDogs 1 but the characters are a bit easier to connect with, despite there being far more of them. Coop is also decently fun, and since you can turn off annoying random invasions, it become less annoying and more of an interesting mechanic, although to my knowledge you cannot play through special or story missions in coop, just the open world and specific side missions.

The biggest problem with this game is just how far downhill it goes after the 10-13 hour mark, as the missions get ridiculously repetitive and tedious. Guards now take 50 shots to the head (yes, even guards without helmets on), and the stun gun becomes more effective than an assault rifle. The game balance is hilariously broken, stealth sometimes doesn't work, as you'll be chilling around a corner and they will see you through the wall, or see you 150 meters away while you're hiding in a parked car with the engine and lights off. The game also has a gamebreaking glitch where, if you headshot a guard with a silenced weapon, the game will immediately freeze and bug out. This is fixed in a mod that removes decals, but that also means you can't play coop with the mod downloaded. Thanks Ubisoft. 

The game is unique, and you're bound to find something you love about it, but after the 10-12 hour mark, you'll notice a severe drop in quality in the mission design, uniqueness of levels, storytelling, difficulty, and basically everything about the game. The first 10-12 hours are worth a buy if you get the game for $7.5 like I did.",1697871405,1697935657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Ubisoft, this open-world action-adventure game offers a captivating and vibrant world where hacking is your greatest weapon, and the city of San Francisco is your sprawling playground.

One of the first things that will strike you about Watch Dogs 2 is its stunning rendition of the San Francisco Bay Area. The game's attention to detail is astonishing, from the iconic landmarks to the diverse neighborhoods, which breathe life into the virtual city. The dynamic day-night cycle and weather effects add depth to the immersive environment.

The star of the show is undoubtedly the game's protagonist, Marcus Holloway, a brilliant and charismatic young hacker who's out to expose corporate corruption and government surveillance. His likable personality and compelling backstory make him a protagonist you'll genuinely care about. The supporting cast is equally well-developed, each character adding a layer of depth and diversity to the story.

The narrative in Watch Dogs 2 is a thrilling rollercoaster ride, exploring themes of hacktivism, privacy, and corporate greed. The game strikes a perfect balance between a gripping storyline and the freedom to explore the vast open world. You have the agency to choose your approach to missions, whether you prefer stealthy hacking, tactical combat, or creative solutions, and the choices you make have real consequences.

The hacking mechanics are the game's core feature and are executed brilliantly. You can manipulate the world around you by hacking into cameras, traffic lights, and various devices. This leads to an array of inventive and often humorous solutions to objectives and challenges. The possibilities are seemingly endless, providing players with a true sense of empowerment.

Watch Dogs 2 excels in its open-ended approach to gameplay. Whether you're exploring the world, infiltrating heavily guarded facilities, or participating in online multiplayer activities, the game offers a seamless blend of solo and cooperative experiences. The online integration allows for thrilling, impromptu encounters with other players, adding an extra layer of excitement.

The attention to post-launch support by Ubisoft ensures that players have a wealth of content to explore, from additional missions to fun and quirky customization options. This ongoing support keeps the game fresh and engaging.

In conclusion, Watch Dogs 2 is a remarkable and immensely satisfying experience that improves upon its predecessor in every aspect. Its striking visuals, engaging characters, thought-provoking narrative, and innovative hacking mechanics combine to create a gaming masterpiece. Whether you're a fan of open-world adventures, technology, or simply a gripping story, Watch Dogs 2 deserves a spot in your gaming library. It's a thrilling ride through the world of hacktivism that will leave you craving more long after the credits roll.",1697392046,1697392046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Watch Dogs 2 is overall one of the best games ive played, from the humor to the characters to the amazing gameplay i think this game is really good. Now here is where my problems arise: bugs. I have ran into multiple bugs in my playtime of wd2, but the main ones i would like to currently point out are as follows:
1. Screen Flickering: This seems to be an issue for just me as I havent seen anybody else really talking about this, but it is really really annoying to have constant flickering on my screen while playing this game. I've looked for a fix but haven't found one, if you have one please let me know in the comments.
2. Body ragdolls flying everywhere: Whenever i kill literally any enemy, for some reason they just go insane and start flying everywhere. This is really annoying and, like the other one, i have looked for a fix but not found one. Let me know if you have experienced this and have found a fix in the comments please. Other than that this game is awesome and i would 100 percent recommend it.

Overall: 7.5/10

The story feels weaker than the 1st Watch Dogs, but perhaps it will get better the more I play it. The characters are nauseating. You can barrel down a crowd of pedestrians and massacre the police force down to a woman (cause half the officers seem to be women for some reason) and then return to your loser club in the basement to hear more lame jokes and annoying comments from the average mentally deranged degenerate San Franciscan. The characters and story in the first game felt a lot more real (except T-bone) and impactful. These characters that I'm forced to tolerate seem like hipster children playing vigilante.

There's also clear leftist brainwashing in this game. Homosexual flags, a transgender character, black racialism comments, anti-free-market pro-socialism comments, just utter nonsense. Besides that, the hardware optimization is beyond dreadful, as usual.

Don't listen to the positive reviews. The only thing this game has going for it is a big map filled with boring repetitive tasks to try to get people to waste more of their lives on garbage. I would return this slop if I could, but for now I will give it another chance to see if I change my mind.

Edit: The gameplay is better than I originally thought once you unlock the hacking tools, but not too much more. Still mediocre. Ending is mediocre. Okay game, I suppose. Characters are a bit less annoying later on, but nothing is really developed between Sitara and Ray for some reason. No real development of characters in general, though there is potential.

2 hours in and I almost refunded. The characters are annoying. The story wasn't nearly as good as the first one and I agree with Aiden Pearce, that DedSec is childish (reference from WD1). The foul language is excessive and absolutely I would not let my children play this. I was able to skip the cutscenes at least.

So why the positive review?
In the end, I grew to really enjoy the game mechanics especially after investing in some of the research (i.e. skills). The RC element was really fun and I appreciate the massive amount of time that went into the myriad of puzzles throughout the game. The online aspect was a pleasant surprise and seamless to the single player experience. Despite the mixed reviews, this game makes me want to play WD:L. I enjoyed that so many things were destructible and I felt I had a lot of control over what I was able to do. The world was stunning to drive around in and it ran perfectly on my 1070 Super.

You are theoretically doing stuff in order to gain followers (which seemed like arbitrary numbers that were thrown just for the dopamine hits) but a mission will reward you just the same if you complete it without killing or killing 20 innocent bystanders in your way.

Early on there's a mission involving a car you have to steal.
I completely trashed it on my way to the garage, when I arrived it magically restored itself to prime condition, that sort of thing, which is minor by itself but when everything is that way completely feels like what I do in game doesnt really matter.

In Watch Dogs 2, is the first time since... ...a LONG time I actually found glimpses of something special in a Ubisoft game.

Although I still consider Watch Dogs 1 my favorite (Due to the overall mood, slightly better characters and better story), W_D2 is absolutely a great game, with refined gameplay formula, more freedom and also interesting characters and story.
My personal fun story with W_D2, was that I bought it full price on the PS4 and dropped the game in less then 3 hours due to it's annoying teenager characters and definitely millenials-trying-to-please-zoomers writing, that is not true tho, the game develops into something far more interesting later on.

I love the San Francisco they built with this one, even more than my beloved Driver: San Francisco (Bring that to sale again ffs).

The game has a lot of shortcomings (physics still sucks, some keybinds are questionable (esc cuts dialogue and also is the button to leave a hacking interface), flickering shadows bug in RTX40 series, soundtrack could have more metal (one single metal song, come on).

But I do recommend it, for sure. The game does not feel bloated to the brim with useless content as latest Ubi games and is actually a neat package.
Ah, the DLCs are pretty good too. 

Now, I will leave the comments open, as a fan of W_D1 and W_D2, should I play W_D Legion?",1695704950,1695704950,True,2,0,0.467496544122695923,0,True,False,False

I decided that I'd get the game on steam and 100% it here now that I have fully migrated to PC only, but Ubisoft has decided to remove achievements from their games: meaning I can play the game and get achievements through Ubisoft connect, but there is no longer steam achievement support for this game, or 99% of other ubisoft titles on steam.

Hugely disappointing and an odd decision. Just another poor decision from Ubisoft.

Granted, I can still enjoy the game in its full capacity, but realistically I only completed the story recently. Achievement hunting is where it's at and we've lost that with all Ubi titles on Steam.

Furthermore the level of detail in the world itself is something to marvel at for sure.

The game play is great due to being able to control cars remotely, have the ability to use a drone, and a remote RC car. Using the drone and RC car are a great way to scan an area and be able to go in and out of an area with stealth. You don't have to play stealth either because the chaos is great. You can hack people's phones to initiate a gang attack or a police cruiser to make a scene. Doing so distracts the people in a restricted area and makes it easier not to be caught while stealthy. Lastly, the graphics are phenomenal for a game from 2016. It's so beautiful and after all these years I'm just now finding little details that make the world of San Francisco more immersible.

It wasn't until I started playing it that I realised how old it is. Initially I did not like the style and it took me a while to get into it, but once I did I found that I enjoyed it every bit as much as the original. I guess the open world and variety of gameplay makes it special for me. I even kept playing the endless side-missions even though they just repeated similar scenarios in a handful of locations. I like that the progression with research points is balanced and it did not feel like I was doing much grinding, apart from money. And that was the only real flaw for me. Once I bought the drones and a weapon I had no further need for money. I really don't care about skins and clothes and once I got the money-profiling I soon amassed so much money that I lost interest in finding money bags. I ended the game with about $2M and had no use for it. But other than that I thoroughly recommend the game for anyone who missed it.

I bought the game and season pass for about £12 in the sale and played 86 hours, making it one of the best value for money games I played.

Visuals are nice, great sound, great music and great voice acting. The story is also interesting enough and steers away from the bleak serious tone of the first one. The game-play however, feels pretty much the same as the first. Nothing new or innovative, just some new gadgets and features to mask the same open world tropes that have been done to death.

I did pick this game up well after release. But I think it's safe to say that open world fatigue had set in around the time it came out. This doesn't add anything new really, but if you're in the mood for another open world game, it'll do the job nicely. But, for the price of $89.95 AUD in 2023!? No way.

Yes, you can try to find the english localization in the game files and poke **** around and find out to turn it onn, but that's not how it's supposed to be.

And when I say serious, oh I mean SERIOUS. It's really bad, you can't even change your birth date on your account information without having to talk to the CEO of Ubisoft which will then contact the President of the US to get permission to change your info. This is why I steer far far away from any games or any products that have the ""Ubisoft"" stamp.

One of the many reasons why I hate Ubisoft is their ways of being, especially when it comes to support; I opened a support ticket, August 11th and today is the 21st, still no reply...

-------------------------------------------

Ticket Opened August 11th 2023:

I have several accounts with Ubisoft (unfortunately), I am able to access all of them but I closed an account (ray@nerdtech.biz) because I no longer have access to the email on that account, I did that because Ubisoft makes it ridiculously hard to change anything (even your birth date) without a massive headache (part of why I steer away from any game or anything to do with Ubisoft). I thought that doing so would unlink my games (like it said it would) but nope, it's Ubisoft, nothing is easy with Ubisoft. I'm trying to launch my steam purchased Watch_Dogs 2 but it won't let me play it since it's linked to ray@nerdtech.biz. How can I play my game now?

Thank you for any help, I know this is probably going to take years, since every little thing to do with Ubisoft is extremely difficult, so I'll be patient.

Ticket Updated August 19th 2023 (by me):

Let's see how long it takes for this aweful company to even say ""hi"" on this issue; it's August 21st now... I should take bets on how long it'll take for them to actually do anything. I'm guessing maybe 2 or 3 months, perhaps longer.",1691766403,1692599133,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just like Back 4 Blood, I bought this game simply because It was released later than 2013. Just like Borderlands 2, there's a constant freezing problem. But, this one has to do with the props loading In and pausing the game to load props.
Supposedly It has something to do with online features, which I disabled using -eac launcher In the launch options for the game. I'm pretty sure It's A online feature related to occlusion culling, which Is loading props behind objects.
PART 2 You should buy it
So, I was compelled to buy and play this game because I tried the Demo out on Xbox One. And, watched the entirety of Whitelights review on this game. And It being similar to GTA. Which, I have 672 hours on, on the Xbox One. 
I have 73 hours on Watch Dogs 2.  I didn't complete the game. Spent most of that time doing shoot outs with the police, looking for cash dufflebags and driving around. And just from that little tidbit of doing nothing worth any value,
I love this game. You should buy it. 
PART 3 Headshots
My gripe with this game Is the braindead AI which don't challenge the player intellectually. They do the third person cover lock thing, and pop In and out of cover to shoot you, and occasionally
push up to get new cover. But, the one thing that frustrates me the most Is the fact that you cannot one shot headshot some enemies, which completely takes me out of the game and makes me wanna do other games.
You need 11 headshots to kill A heavy with A pistol. The headshots not instantly killing makes this game more of an RPG than A Third Person Shooter. I mean It totally takes you out of the game. 
I think they did that way to attract a certain kind of audience, to avoid criticism from GTA 5 players and to attract less the Third Person Shooter kind of crowd, and more the RPG Stealth kind. Because, the stealth In this game Is 
amazing. 
PART 4 Playstyles
Now, from when I played the demo or maybe It was A youtube video. But, they said there's 3 kinds of Playstyles in this game; The Ghost, The Guns Blazing, The Trickster. The Ghost does exactly what you think it does, they 
use nonlethal means and avoid arousing suspicion to complete missions. The Guns Blazing goes Into combat shooting every one and going on mass murder sprees to complete missions. The Trickster Is somewhere in between but not really,
The Trickster relies on tricks to pacify and to mess with the AI's behavior to compelete missions.
PART 5 Budget
So, now for most people they don't take this Into account.  But, some of the best games cost millions of dollars to make. And just mark off all the features and production parts of the game as trivial. 
But, there was A lot of thought put Into games like this and the cost was high to even make this game. Anyway, this game was released In 2016 with A budget of 11,000,000 Dollars and made 600,000,000 Dollars, claimed as A commercial and critical success.",1691800975,1691815436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Watch Dogs 2 offers a refreshing take on the open-world genre, providing an engaging mix of hacking, action, and exploration. The game's portrayal of a near-future San Francisco is both vibrant and dynamic, inviting players to interact with the city and its inhabitants in unique ways.

The hacking mechanics are a standout feature, allowing players to manipulate technology to achieve their objectives. It's incredibly satisfying to infiltrate security systems, control vehicles remotely, and disrupt enemy plans with a few strokes on the in-game smartphone.

The characters are well-written and likable, contributing to a more lighthearted and humorous tone compared to its predecessor. The diverse cast adds depth to the narrative and makes the story missions genuinely enjoyable.

The freedom to approach missions with stealth or all-out action adds replayability, and the ability to tackle objectives in various creative ways is a testament to the game's design. The cooperative multiplayer mode further enhances the experience, offering collaborative hacking challenges that can lead to some truly memorable moments.

While the game excels in many areas, some occasional technical glitches and AI inconsistencies can disrupt the immersion. Additionally, the story's plot twists might not resonate with everyone, and the humor may occasionally fall flat.

Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a fantastic sequel that successfully builds upon its predecessor's foundation. With its engaging hacking mechanics, memorable characters, and lively world, it's a title that offers hours of entertaining gameplay for those who enjoy action-packed adventures in a tech-savvy world.""",1691456352,1691456352,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Opening this game, I am immediately bombarded with the most on-the-nose, predictable introduction to a story I could possibly imagine. They didn't even [i]try[/i] to make it subtle. From the very beginning it forces you to sit through minutes long cutscenes where a narrator explains to you ""GOVERNMENT BAD. GOVERNMENT SPY ON YOU. CORPORATION BAD. CORPORATION SELL DATA. ANARCHY GOOD. HACKER GOOD."" The narration genuinely feels like I'm being lectured like a six year old.
The game also of course opens in the laziest way possible, following our protagonist breaking into a highly secure building to do something no one has ever done before. Who is he? How does he have the talents to delete his ctOS profile, something nobody has ever done before, and yet he somehow doesn't have the capacity to hack a forklift until you research it?
The dedsec characters themselves are also walking stereotypes of the modern internet. Every character is identified primarily by some surface-level detail about themselves. The protagonist and the other black character have almost nothing in common besides the fact that they're black, and that makes itself perfectly clear in the way that from the VERY moment these two characters speak for the first time the only thing they have to talk to eachother about is the fact that they're black.

The visuals even today look absolutely stunning and the sheer detail of the city is incredible at times. Missions are varied and thoroughly enjoyable plus they can be completed in several ways thanks to your gadgets.

I did find the cast surprisingly likeable and the story is pretty entertaining even if a bit cheesy. NPC's feel pretty dynamic at times and the world always feels vibrant.

I've seen reviews and gameplay videos of other Watch Dogs games, but I decided to try this one first. Let's dive into it.

[h2] Graphics [/h2] 
Perfect. Maybe in 10 years, people will still be playing this game. The visual quality is on another level. I was impressed with the LOD and the overall aesthetics. It's freaking beautiful, especially when it comes to the city landmarks on the San Francissco map (Golden Gate Bridge is the best). U have a camera, use it.

[h2] Performance [/h2]
Some Ubisoft games I've played on platforms other than Steam, have poor performance and shiddy framerate. However, this time I'm satisfied with the frame rate. I got around 50-60 fps while playing on high settings at 1080p. The graphics are not too demanding, yet they still look stunning even on low settings.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2] 
I always imagined a game like this similar to GTA. Although not everything you can do in GTA is possible in this game, it still offers a unique experience. Playing as Marcus, a fast-paced character also good at sneaking combat, making the gameplay enjoyable and dynamic. Sometimes, the enemy NPCs can be a bit dumb and too easy to take down, but at other times, it can be challenging to remove the bounty stars.

[h2] Online activity [/h2] 
I've had numerous encounters with people in online sessions. I particularly enjoy PvP hacking invasions and other online co-op missions in this game (PvP bounty hunter is also the best one).

[h2] Story [/h2] 
The storyline can be described as impressive. The characters are well-rounded and likable, with unique personalities and individual story arcs. There are also plenty of funny and [i]cringey[/i] moments in this game too. Never forget to mention that WKZ news report on the phone and radio always keeps me entertained.

[h2] NPC behavior [/h2]
Every NPC in this game of course has a different name and even some of them look like the same model, but their recent activities and current jobs impressed me. I love how they interact with each other. Their conversations, and activities together are also good to praise. Look as realistic.

[h2] Things I don't like in this game[/h2] 
- Driving mechanics is not what I expected it would be. I can barely drive normally.
- Bullshhh enemy NPCs know exactly where I'm hiding, even in the bushes. Sometimes, hiding in a car proves to be useless.
- No Steam achievements bruhh.
- [spoiler] Controversial flags and pride-related things in the game. I'm not triggered by a flag but it's all over the place. [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] The Cyber Driver mission. [/spoiler]

Despite these drawbacks, I still highly recommend this game. I would give it an overall rating [b]8.5/10[/b]. Haven't played it yet? Do yourself a favor and have a go.",1689622884,1690421005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in the vibrant and tech-savvy San Francisco Bay Area, this sequel introduces a host of improvements and additions that make for an exhilarating and immersive gaming experience.

Graphics:
The graphics are visually stunning, depicting a beautifully recreated San Francisco and its surrounding areas. The attention to detail is impressive, from the iconic landmarks to the bustling streets filled with dynamic NPCs. The lighting effects and weather changes contribute to the game's realism, creating an atmospheric and engaging environment.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is the heart of ""Watch Dogs 2,"" and it shines through its innovative hacking mechanics. Players step into the shoes of Marcus Holloway, a talented hacker who joins the hacker group DedSec to combat corporate corruption and oppression. The ability to hack into various devices, manipulate city infrastructure, and use stealth tactics offer a refreshing take on traditional action-adventure gameplay.  Moreover, the game gives players the freedom to approach missions in different ways, allowing for a mix of stealth, combat, and hacking tactics. The hacking options are diverse and creative, enabling players to feel like true digital vigilantes in the expansive sandbox of San Francisco.  While the game's AI is generally competent, there might be instances where enemy AI behavior appears inconsistent or lacks depth. This can occasionally lead to moments where the challenge feels artificial or less immersive.

Story and Characters:
The story is mildly compelling and but not poorly paced, revolving around themes of surveillance, privacy, and the power of information. The diverse characters of DedSec contribute to the game's charm, with each member bringing unique skills and personalities to the table.  While the antagonist Dusan Nemec has a significant presence in the game, his character development could have been further explored. Additional backstory or moments that delve into his motivations and background could have made him a more well-rounded and compelling character.  Nevertheless Marcus Holloway is a relatable and charismatic protagonist, making players invested in his journey to take down corrupt corporations and expose the truth. The narrative is also laced with humor and wit, making it an enjoyable experience from start to finish. Players will find themselves emotionally invested in the characters' motivations and connected to the larger fight against oppressive forces.

Sound:
The game's sound design enhances the overall experience, immersing players in the bustling urban atmosphere of San Francisco. The dynamic soundtrack complements the action and perfectly captures the vibrant and rebellious spirit of DedSec. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life with authenticity and emotional depth.

Setting and Presentation:
San Francisco serves as a stunning and diverse playground for players to explore. The city's landmarks, neighborhoods, and iconic areas are recreated with meticulous attention to detail, making the open-world setting a joy to explore. Whether it's the bustling streets of downtown or the serene beauty of Marin County, the game offers an authentic depiction of the Bay Area. The presentation is sleek and stylish, with a user-friendly interface and smooth navigation. The attention to detail in the environment and character animations further elevates the overall presentation, creating an engaging and immersive experience.

Rating:
This is a remarkable open-world adventure that successfully builds upon its predecessor. With impressive graphics, innovative hacking gameplay, a captivating story, memorable characters, and excellent sound design, it offers an unforgettable experience. This thrilling digital playground of San Francisco will leave players entertained and immersed in its world long after the credits roll. I would rate this 9/10.

I played the game on the hardest difficulty (I really enjoy stealth) and honestly, outside of a few moments I had an amazing time. I didn't really engage with the multiplayer content, but the main game, the side quests, and in world activities are great. The Driver San-Francisco quests for one were great! 

Gameplay: Solid. Marcus controls well, flows well, and the driving is a huge step from the first game. Combat is FAST with high risk high reward. I would say this game plays better as a ""fast"" stealth game. While it does have its problems, specifically certain weapons ruining the balance, if you're capable of limiting yourself there is a TON of fun to be had. 

NPCs are actually quite realistic, compared to most other games I've seen, they do feel like they have lives, they interact with your character, especially when he's doing things that are not ""appropriate"" for the environment. Gangs fight each-other on the streets making a constant stream of chaos something that's possible to achieve. Paired with your hacking tools which allows you to distract enemies, explode grenades, move cars, and call in the police or other gangs there are tons of ways you can manipulate the world to do what you want it to. I also think it's fair to note that while police are insanely easy to avoid even at the level 5 wanted level, the chases are insanely fun even with a fully leveled character. I got the little electric Go-Kart and had probably the most fun police chase around the city, and that's largely due to the map, driving down narrow alleys, up and down stairs, through parks, off of ledges while the police were just doing their best to keep up is the best. 

The map is really amazing, this is something Ubisoft has always done well in my opinion, and this game lets it shine. Landmarks even have their own ""app"" that lets you find these unique places and it is honestly quite fun being able to just walk the city, steal money, botnet, read other people's texts and explore the landmarks. The game really is quite picturesque. There's even a free hi-res DLC that I would recommend. 

Plot wise this game is...okay. It loses itself in a few places, and of course the memes and humor have not really dated that well. Everyone beside Marcus is quite shallow and goofy, I'd even go as far to say that certain parts are quite cringy. But overall, the actual story is good enough for what it is. Gameplay actions vs the story's tone often don't match up (violent murder sprees vs the ""killing people bad"" moments). 

In conclusion? Great game. Solid entry into the series, and imo the most solid. Pick it up on sale and burn through it in 1-2 weeks easily.",1690233828,1690233828,True,21,0,0.690962493419647217,0,True,False,False

Hack your way into the world's now largest security organisation ""Blume"" and expose how they take advantage of their users to gain leverage over them. Watchdogs series is a criticism of the current time of our world. How the invasion of privacy can lead to disaster in the hands of the wrong individuals. 

Once again, apart from being made by the 2nd worst game developer, it is actually quite fun to play.

Multiplayer is a thing in this game, whether its co-op or PvP showdowns.

Open world is a very close replica of the real life San Francisco. Many of the locations are present and interact-able.

-

A big negative is that instead of a dramatic story with solid reasons for our main character; we have lousy, irresponsible and awkward teenagers who occasionally get detained for ""loitering"". Therefore it is hard to feel connected to the characters, except for Wrench, who happens to have the only decent story.

There are references to the first game. Dlc is kind of a joke, steer clear of that.

Im playing on normal mode and it's been pretty easy. I really like the story and there's always objectives all over to keep me busy. It's most comparable to the GTA games: you run around in third person, hijack cars, have all kinds of unlawful missions etc. This game adds a hacking feature though, which initially reminded me of Cyberpunk (which I like a lot). The hacking is pretty simple though, its actually a pretty small part of the game. I think the music in this game is a lot of fun, the NPC's have a lot of detail and personality and the game looks really look on my PC. I run a 3080 and Ryzen 5900. There's a feature in the game where you have little PvP bouts for experience and those are a lot of fun. You don't NEED to participate but theyre kool.

Now i wanted to play this again after some time with my brand new Hardware and 40 Series card. But after you've completed the tutorial mission and then wake up at the beach location at daytime IT WILL FLICKER YOUR EYEBALLS OUT YOUR SOCKET.

I find Watch Dogs 2 to be a pretty phenomenal experience, it has a fun movement system, a pretty expansive (although lacking in comparison to the first's) gun library, and a lot of extra content, while the story in this game I will say is rather uninteresting and more dubbed down than the first's, the extra content, skills and online functionality are much better. I believe the final mission is 10X better than the first games finale and would have gone the mile to 100% the game, if it had steam achievements.

Besides those points I personally believe Watch Dogs 2 is the best Watch Dogs game and would recommend it to anyone for the fun factor alone.",1689110056,1689110056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just be warned, the game quickly gets frustrating and punishing if you go off the stealth rails, and the side activities are mostly a repetitive waste of time.

If you do end up playing this, I would suggest minimize time on side quests and side activities as they get really repetitive. You get enough XP from the main and DLC quests to get the upgrades that actually matter, and those quests are more fun to play.

Good
+ The main quest has a good pacing to it and ends strong. Doesn't suffer from the problem of some AAA games where the good stuff is front-loaded.
+ Fun and thematic stealth action. When it all comes together and you're using a combination of the RC vehicles, taking control of things, and using hacking abilities and moving around as Marcus, it makes for quite a fun challenge
+ Enjoyed the story, characters, environments,
+ The original music tracks are pretty good too, especially during the missions. Nothing super memorable, but fitting and unique.

Bad
- The pursuits (by police, gangs, etc...) are frustrating and tedious, especially because the upgrades you get to make them easier actually seem to make them HARDER. Basically, using them to take out the enemies pursuing you can make it harder to escape. More enemies spawn out of nowhere to replace the ones you took out, almost immediately, and they spawn outside of your map view, surprising you. This even applies to the helicopters and also when on foot.

- The game discourages gunplay in a number of ways, despite giving you a lot of guns and related upgrades. You die quickly and you never get any sort of armor, and some of the enemies have a lot of HP and have some powerful guns. Especially towards the later game. Furthermore, your RC vehicles respawn but you don't. Often, if you die you restart the whole mission. So the more you can rely on your hacking abilities and RC car, the better. You will be punished if you, like I did, see guns as a valid playstyle rather than a situational option.

- The stealth can be janky and unpredictable until you learn its quirks. Sometimes when you are completely in stealth and you pop up to shoot someone, they will magically report your location to everyone for the microsecond between when you were visible and you shot and now you're in combat. Sometimes they don't. There are some silenced weapons, and some stun weapons, and the game doesn't really explain what effect those have on detection. 

- The non-combat/non-stealth gameplay gets really repetitive and tedious. I'm talking about roofs. Man, the game designers were OBSESSED with roofs and ways of getting up to them. You might as well call this ""roof based gameplay"" because it basically ends up always being ""find a way to climb onto this rooftop"" and it gets old fast. Find a crane, lift, vent for the rc car, or vehicle than can help you get higher to get to the objective. And that's basically it barring a few exceptions to make ""clever"" puzzles that end up being more annoying than everything. A lot of those things are really agonizingly slow as well, like moving lifts and cranes, driving around scissor lifts, etc...making these things even more annoying. This is especially the case for research points.

- For how much time you spend getting up to and down from roofs, they sure don't give you many tools to make this fun, interesting, or to speed it up in any way. For example even just getting down from rooftops to be on your way is a huge pain because you take falling damage and you have ZERO tools for climbing down. Like 99% of open world games of this sort have already figured this out.There are research points that you can't get without certain upgrades and the game doesn't warn you about this, causing you to waste quite a bit of time not knowing if something is currently possible to get.",1689043464,1689043497,True,4,1,0.566465556621551514,0,True,False,False

- Buy this game if on sale or get a cheap CD Key.
- Has more fun and better mechanics, bigger map(?), and more sophisticated skill tree than WD2.
- Online currently works for WD2 as I review.
- Gameplay wise the game feels more fleshed out than WD2. Online with randoms doesn't engage with me too much, as people without mics can't coordinate movements when attacking enemies. Don't expect Rainbow Six communication. PVP is technically better as it's usually 1v1 battles. 

Story feels lackluster imo, which is the main reason why I played. I can say I liked WD1's story more even though technically WD1 is the shitter game. I think the up-beat vibe of the story is way to much for me to consider playing.

The story revolves around Marcus, a hacker from San Francisco, joining forces with the hacker group DedSec, all with the shared goal of shutting down the city's intrusive surveillance system, ctOS 2.0. The formidable opponent they're up against is none other than Blume, a powerful entity controlling governmental resources.

Stacking it up against its predecessor, it's impossible not to notice the significant graphical upgrade and the contrasting narrative in Watch Dogs 2. Where the first game presented a somber, introspective journey following Aiden's solitary quest for vengeance in the desolate cityscape of Chicago, the sequel paints a vivid picture of hip-hop culture and the dynamic, warm hues of San Francisco. Though the sequel's narrative features a sunnier disposition, it still struggles to elicit strong emotions or create unforgettable moments, a common pitfall for many sequels. That being said, it's undeniably a noteworthy title worth adding to any gamer's collection.

Now, let's turn to Watch Dogs 3: Legion, which, I should mention, is indeed available on Steam. As a die-hard fan of the series, I was among the first to pre-order the Ultimate Edition in 2019. Unfortunately, Legion fell short of my expectations. I find myself straining to recall the main plot. Its futuristic London setting felt too familiar and lacked novelty, as if Ubisoft had taken the easy way out. However, the redeeming factor was the DLC content, bringing back our original protagonist, Aiden, back into the narrative fold.

Throughout the trilogy, the narrative evolves around the totalitarian central control system, CTOS, presenting unique tales of resistance - from an individual (Aiden), to an organization (DedSec), and eventually to society at large (Legion). It's an engaging narrative, particularly when the underdog is pitted against a power behemoth. However, Ubisoft's core message may be missed by many players.

The question we should be asking is: are we already living in a dystopia dominated by totalitarian technology? If we are, are there hackers like Anonymous out there, fighting back? Most people may not recognize this potential danger, and such obliviousness is itself a significant threat. Could 'Legion' be a prophecy of our future, leading to more and more people joining hacker collectives in the name of justice and human rights?

As Edmund Burke famously said, ""The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for decent people to do nothing."" In a world where injustice is rampant, we might choose to live with silent anger and follow the so-called ""rules"" of survival, but who will stand up for us when our freedoms are compromised? Who will seek justice on our behalf?

In the words of Aiden and Reggie (Wrench) -

Aiden: ""I once spent my life fighting people like Lambert because I simply thought it was worth it... and it didn't work.""
Reggie: ""So what? Should we give up?""
Aiden: ""No, you shouldn't give up. Some resistance is worth losing everything you have.""

Through the series, Ubisoft has gifted us with a lone wolf hacker with unwavering moral integrity, and an organization unwavering in its pursuit of justice. These narratives encourage us to confront the totalitarian implications of technology.

Although Aiden may be gone, his legacy lingers on. He's a symbol of street justice that transcended his own solitude and grief. My hope is that, in the face of encroaching totalitarianism, we can find our own inner Aiden.

However, after Legion, I've found it hard to ignore a nagging sense of disillusionment. It feels as if the spirit of resistance that once permeated the series has been lost. Much like how there were no Assassins after the Great Revolution, it seems there are no hackers after Watch Dogs 1. A poignant reminder that even in gaming, all good things must come to an end.",1481635741,1688913407,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

tl;dr: a game that shows promise and has its fun moments, but is sunk by extremely lazy and careless design and direction.

The good:
Graphics: 
The bay area setting is beautiful and quite nicely rendered. The game is PS4-era so don't expect to be wowed too much, and it has some optimization issues when you run it at 4k with framerate stutters in situations you wouldn't expect, but generally it looks great for its age and the city is vibrant and beautiful.

Banter: The game's new characters, which sometimes join you on missions but almost always take a ""the guy /gal in the chair"" position, are fun and have some level of fleshing out. Not all of them and not too deeply (bear in mind I put a bit under 20h into the game but never reached the end so I may be underinformed). The group is generally fun to talk to, although they are a bit naive if not oblivious (going after government agencies, other hacker groups and literal narco-gangs like they're not afraid of what it could do to them, so on).

Hacking improvements: 
Some quality of life improvements over Watchdogs 1 hacking, like better versatility in hack options, remote triggers, scouting devices like the ""quadcopter"" (a quad-motor aerial drone) and the... idr what they called it but it's an RC car; and inally a way to hack helicopters to get them off you (need to work to upgrade for it, but it's there).


The very, very bad:
Shallow GTA clone:
Coming out 3 years after GTA, I guess Ubisoft was in a panick and said ""COPY EVERYTHING!.... but don't bother about doing it well"".
You have it all. Random events happening around you - including police violence (I saw police randomly attack civilians - with lethal force even - for no reason), drive-by's (saw a guy drive up to a random dude, unload a full smg mag onto him [from inside the car, which you cannot even do as a player] and drive off while the other npcs went about their business), and random gang-fights (which the police generally ignores, or sometimes joins in - on the side of one gang, never seemingly wanting to do anything except shoot the last person to shoot near them).
Radio: but only 5 stations, with dubious genre relevance (""rock"" meaning ""anything not pop"", pop meaning ""whatever the sound guy liked"", ""electronica"" meaning...)
Super-illegal-weapons: The game is set in the Bay Area, but doesn't try to go ""this is alternate universe, where there are zero gun laws"" like GTA. You can build (3d-print, yeah) multiple grenade launchers and other weaponry that would get you super-max'd... all from the comfort of your basement.
Mass-murder-immunity: Wanna kill a dozen civilians? a hundred cops? literal FBI agents? All fair game as long as you drive away and hide for a half minute.
Cars, boats, bikes, drive whatever: The driving physics aren't too bad - below GTA V's but not terrible; however most cars feel and drive alike and if you don't buy the vehicle (using, of course, in-game-apps) it will disappear as soon as any cutscene or loading takes place.

The enemy AI is not just extremely bad, it is ""I thought I would never see AI like this after we left the PS3/Xbox-360/etc console generation"". If an enemy sees you, even for a milisecond, even if you shoot them in the head at the precise point they noticed you, EVERYONE knows where you are. And I mean everyone, enemies off-map will come for you, enemies that were on the opposite side of the building and could never have known, will come for you. But! If they don't know where you are, you can kill them all off, one by one - shooting them, dropping bombs on them, detonating hazards near them, and they will go ""wow, that's really weird, we should investigate but I can't call for reinforcements until any one of us sees the guy themselves [then we all can and will as we are telepathically bonded like a hive-mind and will instantly know everything about him --- even when we are a lowly gang-member minding their business guarding a drug stash, we will instantly know that the guy shooting us with a literal grenade launcher is ""one of those hacker guys""].

Back on the ""shoot people with impunity side""... Watchdogs 1 had its dark edge - you were a guy on a revenge rampage, a morally-grey if not fully dark-side guy looking to get vengeance for a dead family member. And even then, it was hard for me to get half of the kill-count I got in on this game halfway through. In this game, you are a happy-go-lucky hacker that joins a group of wannabe-techno-anarchists looking to ""do good"" and ""fight the evil guys taking our liberties and information"" and whatnot.
And yet the game is so happy to let you become a psychotic mass-murdering terrorist without consequence.
You can kill cops, gang members, FBI agents and civilians without anyone in your little hacktivist group batting an eye or even making mention of it. You can literally construct IEDs and weapons the NRA would be unable to justify any civilian posession or use of in any state - and you do it in a state with some of the more restrictive gun laws in the US.

Sure, you could go harmless/less-than-lethal stealth, but the game does not want that. At all. Between the hive-mind AI, most missions being of the ""infiltrate this location that has ~10-25 armed guards who can also call more as reinforcements"" and the ""there is absolutely no penalty for killing everyone here, even civilians"" mechanics, you need to be roleplaying for your own pleasure (and using your imagination to pretend it even mattered) not to.

------------

The game shows promise and could've been great, but it's design and delivery are so thoughtless it is just way too jarring and incongruent of a final product to deliver much more than occasional ""ah that's cute/funny/lolzy"" moments in a sea of ""everything about this is terrible and I don't care anymore"".

Will you have fun playing this?
At times, probably. In general, it depends how forgiving you are of how hard it will try to persuade you to go play something else. And there are so many better games out there, there is no reason to waste your time on this one.

Definately has some problems and some kinda lame ubisoft mission design but the core gameplay story, setting have all been vastly improved from the original. When it comes to gameplay its alot of fun with the heavier usage of drones in this game that make u feel more stealthy and hacker-esque lol. Also the inlcusion of a simple parkour system makes the combat encounters and traversal of the world more enjoyable. There would be missions where I would have to infiltrate a gang hideout, And instead of breaking in directly id find a parkour route to the top of the building and take out people from there, or in a cop chase climbing a tower and then lobbing grenades at their cars while the circle around the building. It just adds alot more variety and experimentation to the combat. Graphics are honestly kinda eh sadly there are alot better looking games that came out even in 2016 alone. Also the stories alot more fun than the last one. While the overly jokey writing misses alot and can sometimes feel like late 30 year olds trying to write dialogue that appeals to young people, it has a certain fuck the man attitude to it that feels genuine. Also alot more punk influence than I remember hearing one of my favourite dead kennedy's songs on the radio was a fun suprise 7.5/10",1604266994,1688755727,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first one was great! Everything from the characters to the story, why couldn't they just expand on that original concept rather that making everyone an edgy hacker that has to get ""follows for processing power"" whatever the shit that even means. I'm actually mad at what they've done here.

There's immediately far too much going on from the get go, nothing is broken in properly, the controls are retarded, enemies just keep spawning in infinitely and theres way too much sidetracking that ends up in doing the same thing over and over and over again in this repetitive loop where you're forced to find ways to climb buildings by running around them for 10 minutes. I preferred walking around like an incognito ghost, profiling people with my phone out instead of giving me this dumb robocop vision. Everything Aiden Pearce did and the way he did it was so much more acceptable and realistic. There's just no consequence to randomly blasting up civilians or cops anymore either, they stripped the morality system away and just gave it this dull social media makeover, so go mental and just run everyone over! The only real choice is deciding if you want to rob their money before or after you put them in a hospital.

Missions are mainly theme'd around stealth, but you can essentially run and gun your way through all of them as well.
Gameplay isn't anything groundbreakingly new but it get's the point across.

Story is a lot more light hearted than the first and has less of a darker undertone.
The protagonists works with are a bunch of dorky SWJs (DeadSec) that want to get back at corporate america.
They're corny as hell and cringe inducing a lot of the time. A bunch of ""cool kids"" who aren't really cool.

This game is really in the middle for me. I would put it in the casual.
If open world games and casual gameplay is your thing, it's pretty good for that.
It has a good amount of content as well. On discount for less than 10 def worth it.

Pros:
- game looks great
- gameplay is fun for a while, but not solid enough to warrant a second playthrough
- using the drones is fun

Neutral:
- forced PvP/PvE events that you either have to opt out of in the options or disable anti-cheat (I enjoyed these at first but they happen so often that eventually I had to disable them to just get on with the story)
- missions are very samey and I got bored of them
- lots of collectables which at first are fun but eventually became a boring slog

Cons:
- extremely cringey ""celebration of nerd culture"" dialog. Did they hire the writers from Big Bang Theory? I couldn't skip the dialog fast enough
- sky rapidly flickers and the devs blame nvidia
- physics absolutely borked when running on a powerful PC with high FPS
- messed up ragdoll physics cause killed enemies to fly around in the sky and bounce off walls, alerting other enemies and making stealth impossible
- cranes do not work properly at higher frame rates and whip around at mach 10, instantly killing you. Several missions require the use cranes so you will have to limit your frame rate to 60 then hope and pray that the cranes work when you restart the game
- higher difficulties often require abusing mechanics or playing in lame ways, like repeatedly using drones to drop explosives on enemies while hiding around a corner
- lots of time consuming use of cranes and lift trucks, I got very impatient with them

Skip this game unless you really want to be hacker mans and like cringey dialog. Maybe worth a try if you can pick it up for $5.",1688343487,1688343487,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

Characters are pure cringe at times. Some abilities and weapons are taken away and put behind skill tree. Gunplay is worse. Story, villain and the motivation behind the plot are much weaker. Finally you're able to shoot while driving. Way less traffic lights and other things to use during chase sequences. Controlling cars is cool. 99.9% of puzzles in this game consist of getting to rooftops using a crane or a scissor lift and/or using your drone/rc car. No improvements made to combat. Side missions are BORING and very samey. ""Focus"" system completely removed.

Very large map, with lots to do, lots of both offline and online content, lots of stuff to collect and stories to live out. Loading times are also very short, so fast traveling is not a waiting game.

Gunplay improved massively from the first game, and `arcade` driving feel has also improved (but still feels a little over the top). 

New gadgets felt amazing, (you get the RC car and the quad drone to help you out in hacking), and now you can hack many more things (like cranes, lifts, forklifts etc.). However, hacking is the same like in the first game, with the hardest hacks being `connect the pipes` mini-game. 

Outside some aspects that annoy me on a personal level (pushing `woke` stuff, like pride, trans and other similar themes for unnecessary reasons), this game is pretty much a great addon to a more grounded GTA format of games. It improved everything that the first game had problems with and added a ton more things to do, and ways to do it.

The only thing I didn`t like is how the story panned out. It is very...cringy on so many levels and it felt like the `memes` were forced into the game on many occasions. Also, the videos that were created after every main mission (like a collage of what you did, but in a 8-bit/hacking way, made for your followers to see) were very...hard to watch to say the least. 

However, the core graphics and open world interactions felt so good, it is fine to let it slide.

Would not recommend, basically unplayable. Go play Watch_Dogs 1 which is the best game in the series, no bullsh*t follower collecting, just simply a hacking game (which is why you bought this in the first place presumably). I don't remember that game crashing at all plus it was very enjoyable.
As for when the game actually runs, I'd say the only enjoyable thing is the city. Overall it's clear that much more quality work went into the art, textures, and the world as a whole vs, the programming (hacking game with 'script kiddies' developing it huh xD). The only consistent thing about the game is how trash the driving is compared to every other ubi game.

This is not to say that the foundation on which the game is built isn't good, just please do justice to the core gameplay mechanics by maintaining the pretty visuals and sounds, and taking a long hard look at the code.

EDIT: While the next 15 hours of BSODs and crashes weren't so nice, some of the later missions were enjoyable and there are some neat music choices in them as well. To top it all off, the ending is satisfying.",1686405966,1687087455,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.[6] While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers ""crackers"" (analogous to a safecracker).

The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.[7]

As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In popular usage and in the media, ""computer intruders"" or ""computer criminals"" is the exclusive meaning of the word today. (For example, ""An Internet 'hacker' broke through state government security systems in March."") In the computer enthusiast (Hacker Culture) community, the primary meaning is a complimentary description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. (For example, ""Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, is considered by some to be a hacker."") A large segment of the technical community insist the latter is the ""correct"" usage of the word (see the Jargon File definition below).

Representation in mainstream media
The mainstream media's current usage of the term may be traced back to the early 1980s. When the term, previously used only among computer enthusiasts, was introduced to wider society by the mainstream media in 1983,[8] even those in the computer community referred to computer intrusion as ""hacking"", although not as the exclusive definition of the word. In reaction to the increasing media use of the term exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began to differentiate their terminology. Alternative terms such as ""cracker"" were coined in an effort to maintain the distinction between ""hackers"" within the legitimate programmer community and those performing computer break-ins. Further terms such as ""black hat"", ""white hat"" and ""gray hat"" developed when laws against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from those activities which were legal.",1686923677,1686923677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

at this point, i'm just going to consider that i have been robbed, cause i would have to risk seizures as a non epileptic, cause the flickering is so bad, that it gives me a headache after a few minutes. and everything flickers when it peaks, even peds.

This game is just amazing and fun and could be a 10/10 in my books if not for poor Ubisoft Launcher issues sometimes. 

Gameplay -> WD2 is a an amazing game which keeps the true spirit of hacking right till the end and it is so satisfying to play with. 

Missions -> Mission design were pretty much similar to each other but, it had nice mix and match of elements. Gameplay felt fresh to me for it's entirety.

Story -> Story was surprisingly interesting for my liking. Dystopian sci-fi tech plot which still connected to reality.

Characters -> No character growth but each of the 4 main characters (+2 rotating) and Main Villain actually had nice and different personality to them. Marcus and Wrench duo is probably the most fun to watch. 

Online -> There are still quite some players in online as of June 2023 and you can see random mission popping for pvp or co-op. Online is also very fun.

Gold Edition had 2 Expansions and few cosmetics =》 DLC missions are about total 7 hours long with 1 new enemy type and 1 old character making his return from WD1. 

My Total PlayTime -> 75 hours (including Ubi)
This is nearly 100% completion + Online.

*edit*

the dev response to this is just a moderator doing damage control, this bug in Watch Dogs 2 makes the game unplayable, and they neither have intent or ability to patch it as the entire studio that made WD2 and WD Legions was laid off/put to other projects, like Ubisoft always works.

From the moment the I got the RC Jumper and the story starts to weave its way through my ears, I'm transported to a different realm where all that exists is the pure, unadulterated emotion of the game. As the gameplay unfold, I find myself drawn deeper and deeper into the story that the game is telling, feeling every word as if it were my own. The rawness and vulnerability of the action, combined with the intricacy and complexity of the story, create a sonic landscape that is both breathtakingly beautiful and emotionally cathartic. It's rare to come across a game that speaks so directly to the human experience, that touches on the universal themes of love, loss, and the search for meaning in this world. But this song does all that and more, reminding me that no matter how lonely or isolated we may feel at times, we are all connected by the power of games and the shared experiences that it brings. The way the game builds and crescendos, the way the action ebb and flow, the way the story paint a picture of hope and longing, all of it comes together to create a truly transcendent experience. It's the kind of game that you want to play to over and over again, each time discovering something new and meaningful that you missed before. So thank you to Ubisoft of this masterpiece for giving us all a gift that will last a lifetime.

The map is a blast to transverse, both by car and by foot because of its highly interactive world filled with cool things to mess with like the traffic lights, other cars or just bully random NPCs. The driving feels pretty good too, even though the cars might feel a little bit floaty. Also the gunplay is great, with pretty varied weapons which might feel a little bit too basic but when combined with the ability to hack the world and the gadgets available is pretty satisfying. And the side activities are pretty varied and fun too, ranging from invasions in other player’s worlds to kart racing.

The only cons is that the story extremely cringe and feels written by an amateur out of touch millennial writer who thinks that trends from 20-15 years ago still hold up, surprisingly the characters are pretty likable. And the missions might feel repetitive too, since they tend to be an infiltration in some random building, hack something there and leave, but there are some surprises.",1686335535,1686335535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Watch Dogs 2 received generally positive reviews from critics and players. It was praised for its lively and detailed open-world environment, improved gameplay mechanics, and a more likable protagonist compared to the first game. The game offers various hacking abilities and tools, allowing players to manipulate the city's infrastructure and devices to achieve their goals.

Additionally, Watch Dogs 2 introduced a cooperative multiplayer mode, enabling players to collaborate with friends and participate in various online activities. The game also incorporates social commentary on issues such as privacy, surveillance, and the power of technology.

However, Watch Dogs 2 also includes mature content, violence, and themes that may not be suitable for all players. As with any game, individual preferences can vary, so it's recommended to research and consider personal preferences before playing.

Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a fun and engaging game for those who appreciate open-world gameplay, hacking mechanics, and socially conscious narratives.",1685992387,1685992387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment within the first 10 minutes of gameplay. I encountered an overwhelming amount of bugs that made the game virtually unplayable. This is the first time I've ever uninstalled a game after such a short period of time.

From the moment I started playing, it felt like the game was determined to frustrate me. Bodies were inexplicably flying through the air, and main character was performing strange sprint strafes.

I had heard rumors about bugs plaguing the game after its release, but I couldn't fathom just how bad it would be. If my experience within the first few minutes is any indication, I can only imagine the nightmare players must have faced post-launch.

Watch Dogs 2 had the potential to be a great sequel, but the abundance of bugs and glitches completely destroyed any enjoyment I could have had. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment by avoiding this game altogether. There are plenty of other titles out there that offer a polished and enjoyable experience, and Watch Dogs 2 simply doesn't belong among them.",1685965481,1685965481,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I quit the game and turn back on the Stack Protection.
Restart my system.
Try launching the game again and it will not run with that protection on. EasyAntiCheat will not let me.
Unacceptable. I'm not turning that off just to run this game and possibly compromise my system protection.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
Ahhh... Ubisoft. Their games typically checks all technical boxes (large open worlds, good mechanics, nice graphics, a ton of content, loads of player options) - but feels so generic after a short while. They lack real storytelling enthusiasm. They feel too much like polished consumer products.

And one could say the same about this game. But I think this game holds more than that.

Sure, there's a generic ""hacker"" story. The game do not ONCE head outside of the very standard ""computer nerd/hacker community"" stereotypes. Instead the story itself is essentially just ALL the cliches stacked in one giant set of missions.
There's also ZERO character development during the course of the campaign. None. The characters are the same throughout the entire campaign. Also typically Ubisoft.

But... There's still an atmosphere in this game. There's a soul to be found. There are moments where it feels like the developers here actually cares for the characters and this universe.

Or, at least I do. Maybe it is because I am a computer nerd myself. Maybe because I know people that are more or less exactly like the characters found here. But I have a jolly good time in this game.

I particularly like how the hacker gang we get to know here, are not ""superheroes"" in any other way than their hacker skills (who, in true Hollywood fashion, has next to zero to do with real life hacking, but let's just accept that). So we need to use our heads when solving these missions.
Sure, there's guns, but it's usually very stupid to use them.

As of their games currently available on Steam, I dare say that Ubisofts best open world game is not found among the Assassins Creeds or Far Cries:

The map is a blast to transverse, both by car and by foot because of its highly interactive world filled with cool things to mess with like the traffic lights, other cars or just bully random NPCs. The driving feels pretty good too, even though the cars might feel a little bit floaty. Also the gunplay is great, with pretty varied weapons which might feel a little bit too basic but when combined with the ability to hack the world and the gadgets available is pretty satisfying. And the side activities are pretty varied and fun too, ranging from invasions in other player’s worlds to kart racing. 

The only cons is that the story extremely cringe and feels written by an amateur out of touch millennial writer who thinks that trends from 20-15 years ago still hold up, surprisingly the characters are pretty likable. And the missions might feel repetitive too, since they tend to be an infiltration in some random building, hack something there and leave, but there are some surprises.",1683933846,1685042262,True,21,0,0.682195067405700684,0,True,False,False

Ubi creates good games from time to time and then puts piles of shit around it like Uplay to make anyone buying a game from to think twice. ACU doesn't even load due to this. 

So if you're ready to potentially sacrifice some hours trying to put up with Ubi's bullshit get this game.

The game is really good, this is before Ubi started to ctrl+c and ctrl+v each and every game with a different era. everything just feels good, kinda like GTA V but with it's own pros and cons.

I finally played the first Watch Dogs and found it really good, like, shockingly fun and engaging! And in the first two hours, I wasn't quite sold on Watch Dogs 2. But it clicked quickly after that and I had just as much fun with that game as I did with the first.

Watch Dogs 2 is, in my eyes at least, a Jedi Academy-esque sequel in the sense it vastly improves on it's predecessor's gameplay with no (!) downsides. These improvements include:

- noticeable smoother movement
- better cover (the cover jank from the first game is GONE)
- better driving
- better radio controls with actual dedicated radio stations
- better police (you can no longer escape even the highest wanted levels just by stepping on a boat)
- different clothing stores and more clothing customization
- improved graphics (Watch Dogs looks great, but Watch Dogs 2 has notably better reflections, character models and the indoor areas, Nudle campus being my favorite, are a highlight)
- new gadgets that are actually really useful!
- more gangs (though with less significance)
- gang warfare and police gang fights, with great fun to be had with related hacking abilities
- sailboats!!!!!
- better and actually useful sightseeing
- better car app
- VASTLY expanded hacking

and so on

All that while retaining the great sandbox levels the series is known for. Now, of course, there are a few small things that aren't improved. The finance system is improved from Watch Dogs, in particular, weapons are more expensive and hacking bank accounts nets way less money. But it still is kinda broken and before you know it, you're swimming in cash with not that many ways to spend it, in particular since your ammo still gets magically filled up around missions. Gunplay is slightly worse than Watch Dogs, didn't find it that notable though, and I REALLY liked the now-removed gang hideouts.

But overall, I was just amazed by how many improvements and additions the developers came up with. In the $911 mission, during the refinery section, I took out only the mandatory targets, snuck away undetected to the nearby pier and escaped via sailboat into the sun – that was PEAK Watch Dogs!

Aside from the gameplay, it get's less exciting. As for setting and style, it's at least cohesive, though in my personal taste, I prefer gloomy autunm Chicago any day of the week over sunny SF. Ubisoft Connect is also awful, but you know that already. The story?

The Story is, well, kinda bad. Part of this might be that I played the game in German. The german dub of WD1 is actually okay, I actually prefer german Aidan Pearce as the English dub is way to deep and raspy, perhaps further alienating players from him. The German version of WD2 is super cringe at times, in particular I cringed when they word-for-word translated things like ""insulting sb intelligence"" or ""plausible deniability"" - it just doesn't work! 

That being said there still is some cringe, in particular when they use internet/nerd slang. It feels tacked on. The story has the overarching problem that it's clearly written in reaction to Aidan Pearce's unpopularity, undeserved in my opinion. Marcus and the crew are happy, colorful people with literally zero edges to them. They also take themselves way too seriously. A small revenge subplot falls flat almost immediately and another ""can I trust Ray?"" does too. A good character doesn't have to be likeable, he has to be interesting. I loved WD1's story because it was interesting, cohesive (WD1's world wasn't fun or colorful, it was dark, disgusting etc. and so was Pearce's mood), atmospheric and it was serious. 

There is a real lack of cohesion and disconnect from this since as Marcus you will inevitably shoot and kill people whereas the other parts of the crew seem like peaceful college hacktivist kids. This isn't helped by the fact that the reputation system from WD1 was removed. This is porbably a good thing because it limited player freedom more than it was an interesting mechanic but it makes the disconnect even more apparent as Marcus can punch hoardes of civilians with zero impact. Marcus himself is a blank slate and until an audiolog right before the last mission, there is almost no background to him! Perhaps more importantly, the missions barely tie togehter. 

Yes, WD1 does feel strechted quite a lot but every mission was connected to the ultimate goal of bringing Lena's murders to justice. In WD2, only a few missions tie in to the overarching ""defeat Blume""-goal. In short: WD2' story is LACKING.

Overall, still a clear A-tier game!",1683801472,1683803347,True,79,1,0.852867782115936279,0,True,False,False

* The enemy AI always knows exactly where you are. If you are in hiding, they always walk towards your position for no reason. Once they spot your RC car on the other side of the building everyone magically converges around you.
* The police/gang car chase system is way too annoying and aggressive, with unlimited cops spawning from all directions every few seconds.

Gameplay is awful for the most part, except when you are put in just ridiculously outnumbered firefights of one to a hundred. Makes little sense, but that part is fun I admit.

Some quests are funny, but the questing system is obnoxious, which is the reason as to why I did not finish the game. After the first few forced story missions you have enough money to buy everything you could ever need too... best guns, best vehicle(s), favorite clothes. You unlock some of the best perks in the game in the first ten hours or so.

TL;DR
+ Tons of enemies on some missions
+ High difficulty
+ The few weapons in the game are rather fun
- Very few outfit pieces
- Mission system is awful
- Run out of things to spend the abundant money on in the first 5-10 hours or less
- Pushes ideals in your face non-stop
- Cutscenes consist of a poor quality voice over when compared to Watch Dogs 1's voice overs, and flashes early 2000's memes during them instead of... anything better
- (Edit) Another major con is that you never get to learn the NPCs really, up to where I have played, the story element in the first major chunk of the game is non-existent and I don't see it improving",1595472546,1682896064,False,1,0,0.484995424747467041,0,True,False,False

- Story was ok but it had no complexity to it... no edge of your seat intensity, nothing too dramatic or explosive with action, etc. Each mission felt like it was it's own story separate from the others.
- Gameplay was pretty good overall, but there was a large amount of quality of life issues in which they really should have fixed, but that's typical of AAA titles I guess. Get the money and move on. The missions were often a bit too similar to each other, get to a few terminals and get out, rinse and repeat. Enemy was often spongy and required several bullets to the face to kill them and always outnumbered you making loud entry very difficult and sometimes even impossible given the limited actions available and QoL controls. Enemy can wear armor but you cannot, making you an easy target... luckily, you heal fast. There's no drawbacks to killing anyone at all and no benefit to using a taser, so why bother other than immersion? Police are a joke in the game (the only thing that triggers them are if you ram your vehicle into them, be caught in a restricted area or kill someone while around them).
- Music was the worst part of this game. There wasn't a single decent song in the entire game and yet there was a lot of focus around it for some reason.
- Game also crashed to desktop several times during the last few missions (completely random).

I ran the game on max settings at 1080p with fps cap to a stable 120.

As Marcus Holloway, a young hacker with a rebellious streak, you will fight against the system and big corporations with the help of a rag-tag group of hacktivists known as DedSec.

The game takes place in the sunny and colorful San Francisco Bay Area, where you can explore every inch of the city while causing chaos with your hacking skills. Want to cause a massive traffic jam during rush hour? Hack the traffic lights. Want to take down a corrupt CEO? Hack into his personal data and expose him to the world.

The real star of the show is the pink pony underwear. As Marcus, you can proudly wear your quirky undies while taking down the bad guys.

With the ability to customize your character's appearance, you can make your digital self truly stand out. I went with a bold and unforgettable look - pony underwear, red and green sandals, a garden gnome hat, and a rainbow hippie t-shirt.

Examples:
1. Crane control, in the game you can take over cranes. But when you are in a gondola controlled by the crane and it smashes you to the ground or throws you of the platform multiple times. it becomes extremely frustrating and this is part of the main story so i wanted to finish it. Which after many tries it worked
2. Sudden jumping on to objects, but you wanted to go straight under. or stuck behind things.
3. Rag dolling when you kill bad people, they can fly everywhere

The first Watch Dogs has a bit more of a sorrowful, bitter story, interesting and colorful characters, but it was nicely refined, and I initially thought it was a bummer some of the features were dead because of Ubisoft terminating online servers for it, but it is very much playable and completed without issue. It was a charming game with character, and fun to be had, while not being overwhelming.

This Watch Dogs game, well, it's definitely a Watch Dogs game. The story so far is engaging, it has interesting and colorful characters (Nevermind my obvious Wrench simping), and it's got more content, as any sequel does. But, on the contrary, these online servers are still up. Cool, right? Until me, a small noob of a player seeing the game encourage me to rob a bank trunk. Sure, I'll steal it.

 [ENEMY PLAYER JOINED EVENT] 

""What?"" Before I knew it a sports car was headed for me, I jacked the bank truck and began hauling out of there, fighting this very much real player off with a slow, big truck. Police were closing in, he got the best of me, and killed me, stole the package, and somehow left, leaving the package behind. I steal the package from the street, still pursued by cops. Turns out I need to flee while the package's tracker is being hacked to disable it, so I disable the tracker, now I need to escape the cops.

 [ENEMY PLAYER JOINED EVENT] 
 [ENEMY PLAYER JOINED EVENT] 

Now TWO fools are chasing a mere beginner, mind you, I have nothing more than a stun gun and pistol, I drove a van I stole into the water by accident, going so fast. I jacked a boat and fled as the- still very real players- were entering the pier I just drove off, stole a police boat and escaped the two. Made it back on land, died, respawned, collected the package

 [ENEMY PLAYER JOINED EVENT] 

FFS a fourth player come to steal my effort! I steal a car, and since a police helicopter is following, I do the classic Watch Dogs move and hack a garage door and drive into it. It's a dead end. Cops jam the exit, kill me, the fourth player rolls in, not wanted by the cops, picks up the package, and by default wins it since he has a package with a disabled tracker and no wanted level.

Now it makes me wanna go back to Watch Dogs 1 and enjoy the fact that no random player is just gonna roll up and ruin my day. There's still missions you can do alone or co-op, but I was expecting the usual formula of 'single player unless I open a lobby to multiplayer, or join a dedicated multiplayer mode', but nah, just walking around and someone can just drive right past you. One thing's for sure, I ain't robbing another bank truck, at least until I'm loaded",1680323205,1680323205,True,0,0,0.479704797267913818,0,True,False,False

One of the standout features of Watch Dogs 2 is its hacking mechanics, which allow players to use their smartphone to hack into various devices and systems throughout the game world. The game's hacking abilities add a unique twist to traditional open-world gameplay mechanics, allowing players to take control of the environment and use it to their advantage.

The game's storyline and characters are also noteworthy, as they explore themes of corporate greed, government surveillance, and the power of technology. The game's protagonist, Marcus Holloway, is a likeable and relatable character, and the game's supporting cast adds to the game's overall charm and humour.

The game's open-world environment is also well-crafted, with a vast and diverse city to explore, each with its unique landmarks, neighbourhoods, and activities. Players can engage in various side missions, such as hacking into corporations, solving puzzles, and participating in mini-games.

One downside of Watch Dogs 2 is that the driving mechanics can sometimes feel clunky, and the shooting mechanics are not as polished as some other action games. However, the game's hacking abilities make up for these shortcomings and provide players with a unique and engaging gameplay experience.

Watch Dogs 2 is a fun and exciting open-world action game with a unique hacking gameplay mechanic, an engaging storyline, and well-crafted characters. While it may have some minor flaws, the game's strengths make it a must-play for fans of the genre.",1680126188,1680126188,True,5,0,0.581784367561340332,0,True,False,False

Watch_Dogs 2 is the ultimate video game for anyone who's ever dreamed of being a hacker superhero. Seriously, I felt like a total badass from start to finish.

The game's open-world environment is nothing short of breathtaking. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore the vibrant, tech-savvy city of San Francisco from the comfort of their couch? And the attention to detail is so impressive that I found myself getting lost in the world for hours on end.

But the real highlight of Watch_Dogs 2 is the hacking mechanics. Whether you're infiltrating a secure facility, hacking into a rival gang's network, or causing chaos in the streets, the possibilities are endless. And the fact that you can do it all with just a few keystrokes and a smartphone is nothing short of empowering.

And then there are the characters. From the lovable goofball that is Marcus to the sarcastic and tech-savvy Wrench, the game's cast is as diverse and charming as they come. I found myself rooting for them from start to finish, and their banter never failed to make me laugh.

But let's not forget about the mini-games. Who knew that drone racing and noodle-eating contests could be so addictive? I found myself spending hours perfecting my racing skills and scarfing down ramen just to unlock all the achievements.

Overall, Watch_Dogs 2 is a game that truly has it all. Stunning graphics, exhilarating gameplay, and a cast of characters that you can't help but love. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like a hacker superhero for a day (or a few hundred).",1617237548,1679610878,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

- [b] Improved hacking[/b]. In the original Watch_Dogs the developers decided to boil down the hacking abilities to a single button, WD2 takes the exact opposite mentality, basically every hack has multiple options that let you vary up your approach (for example turning generators into non lethal shock traps or instant lethal detonations), and you can also now use social engineering hacks to bypass combat entirely, calling in gangsters or police to pit NPCs against each other.
- [b] Dramatically improved factions[/b]. The factions in Watch_Dogs 1 almost never interacted with each other in gameplay and all felt like clones of each other, using the same enemy templates, 2 completely fixes this by having factions look visually very different from each other, and by having them infight properly, with police forces pursuing arrests or getting involved in gunfights with gangs, and using the social engineering hacks you can instigate this too to basically outsource combat, one of the best strategies to deal with criminal enemies now is to just call the police.
- [b] Fun side missions[/b]. Each of the game’s side missions has its own mini story backed up by dialogue between DedSec, making each one feel interesting enough to be worthwhile, a massive step up from Watch_Dogs 1’s generic races and gang shootouts.
- [b] Improved controls[/b]. The player can climb objects much more freely than in the first WD, (which only allowed the player to vault or jump over obstacles when specifically prompted, even if a gap was climbable, if the devs didn’t add a climb prompt, you couldn’t do it) and you can also use your melee attack whenever you want (rather than only against enemies when the game gives you a takedown prompt as in WD1).
- [b] Expanded toolset[/b]. Not only does the RC Car from the first game’s Bad Blood DLC come back, but you can also get a quadcopter too, the game also improves the player’s non lethal toolset by adding an infinite ammo stun gun that can knock out enemies.
- [b] Immersive design[/b]. Features like the world map and radio are presented as actual apps that you install on your phone, the landmark collectibles now involve taking pictures on your in-game phone camera, and even the skill tree is explained with in-game backstory (where DedSec supporters give the group their computing power, which allows them to utilise more complex hacks and training tools).
- [b] Much better character customisation[/b]. In the original Watch_Dogs Aiden only had one style and all of the other outfits you could buy were just recolours of it, in 2 you have way more variety and each individual piece of clothing can be customised, different stores will also sell different clothes as well based on theme.
- [b] Fantastic story[/b]. All of the DedSec members are genuinely likeable, well developed and worth rooting for. The game also manages to touch on real world political issues with nuance, not just on privacy rights but on other topics like police brutality and police reform, racism and out of touch corporations.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- [b] Item Cooldowns[/b]. The crafting system of Watch_Dogs 1 was removed, now gadgets like frag grenades, shock grenades, the RC and the Quadcopter run on cooldowns, once you use up your stock of grenades, or your RC/Quadcopter is destroyed, you simply have to wait for the cooldown until you can use them again, it’s nice to know you’ll never be stuck without these things for a mission, but having to sit around waiting for them to come back is just boring. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Watch_Dogs 2 is the ideal benchmark for what a sequel should look like, it improves on the original game by pretty much every metric and makes for a really fun, immersive experience.

The social engineering hacks, long distance tools like the RC and Copter and decreased emphasis on combat (with the focus more going to stealth and non lethal play) make the game feel a little closer to what hacking looks like in real life, rather than a standard open world shooter with the hacking as an extra gimmick on top.

San Francisco is a gorgeous city that feels alive, with a great variety of NPC behaviour, Marcus is a likeable protagonist, the soundtrack is fun, the gameplay has depth, I really couldn’t ask for much more.

I recommend you get the Gold Edition if you can afford it, the extra DLC missions are quality additions to the game and extra gear like the Paintball Gun is great for finding new playstyles.

This is honestly the best, most immersive open world game I’ve played in years, it deserves really high praise for building off of the first game and making something far more expansive and enjoyable, just go buy it, that’s all I can say really!",1679356090,1679356211,True,13,0,0.684303879737854004,0,True,False,False

447040,28646693,76561198100181808,298,45,2619,0,,1703685727,"amazing game that still holds up. The best game in the watch dogs franchise, I highly recommend picking it up. It goes on sale pretty often, too. I recommend playing the game on ""hard"" for your first attempt, ""normal"" if you've never played a stealth game or ""ubisoft open world""-type game before.

Pros:
-It's genuinely so freeing playing this game, since you can go basically anywhere you want. The parkour isn't exactly assassin's creed tier, but it's so smooth and moving around the map feels good in and of itself.
-It's an ubisoft open world, so a lot of it is going around completing tasks around the map, but that formula works so good for this game. Each location is tackled differently, and they can be tackled in a million different ways.
-hacking is easily the best in the series. You can tackle every single objective in (and this is not an exaggeration) hundreds of different ways. From calling an APB on a guy to get him arrested, to calling their cellphone and making them distracted so you can slip past.
-The quickhacks like city blackouts are very fun, and change up how you enter an area.
-Figuring out how to get the hidden stashes and skill points throughout the map is gratifying, and you genuinely have to think about how to do some of them.


Cons:
-the game can be cheesed easily
-vehicle hacking is really rudimentary, I would love it if I could fully remote control them instead of the 4 options of forward, backward, and turn left and right.
-no reason to get in a police chase, and getting out of them is easy as hell.
-vehicle handling is pretty boring, it feels like driving an RC car with how snappy it is. It's almost impossible to lose grip and driving on highways is just boring. On the plus side, you're usually moving on foot all the time anyways since fast travel points are extremely generous.
-switching to the hacking view just makes everything blue, and destroys all of the map design that ubisoft worked so hard on. Making it so that it's on a timer, and having everything available without it would make the game look a lot better than being a giant blue polygon city all the time. It could even be done like like hitman where it functions more like an overlay where you can still see everything just fine, it just turns up the gray filter and lets you see your goals through walls.
-Lethal options in this game aren't very fun, it's way more fun to be doing melee and stun gun only runs. Which is upsetting, because there is no penalty for ignoring hacking entirely and killing everyone. It feels so good to work within the limits of nonlethal options, and it feels like the game was only designed with those options in mind, as the happy-go-lucky story doesn't match up with mass murder.
-speaking of the story, it's decent, but it doesn't really hold me all that well. There are definitely better ones out there.


Overall, I highly recommend it. There is no good comparison point I can think of, as watch_dogs is kind of unique as a series. If you like stealth games and puzzle games, this is definitely for you.",1482697718,1679349151,True,0,0,0,5,True,False,False

Set in San Francisco, the game puts you in the shoes of a young hacker named Marcus Holloway, who is trying to take down a corrupt technology corporation.

The gameplay is a real highlight of Watch_Dogs 2, with an enormous range of tools and techniques at your disposal to hack into devices, manipulate systems, and wreak havoc on your enemies. The missions are varied and exciting, with a great balance between stealth, combat, and puzzle-solving.

What sets Watch_Dogs 2 apart, however, is its fantastic story and characters. The game has a great sense of humor and a real personality, with memorable and likable characters that you'll root for throughout the story. And the storyline itself is gripping and well-written, with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end.

The graphics and sound design are also top-notch, with a stunningly rendered city that really feels alive and bustling with activity. And the multiplayer mode is an absolute blast, allowing you to team up with friends or strangers to take on challenges and missions together.

The game has potential, but for me it's just insulting. 
Any time the story tries to pull me into the fantasy, the gameplay pulls me out. There's too many mechanics that work against you, but you're meant to be this master hacker in a master hacker super secret group but the game constantly throws seemingly simple tasks at you that the lack, or intentional addition of mechanics make frustratingly convoluted. Getting a money cache in an area with 3 guards can be a 15 minute chore. Unbelievable.

Oh, and enjoy spending 20 minutes hacking for skill points but at the end find out you're missing the drone, or gunning down endlessly respawning guards to loot a clothing piece, but realize you can't access it because you need a forklift, that requires a hacking skill you need to unlock. This game doesn't tell you anything, and shows you missions/side content that you can't complete, I even had to google what certain operation intel was cause the map icons pointed me to the area, but nothing was there.. Did I find out in the end? No! There's no freaking info about anything online either.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

With a cast of lovable misfits and a satirical take on the tech industry, the game doesn't take itself too seriously and invites players to let their inner hackers run wild.

Playing as the young hacker Marcus Holloway, you'll explore the vibrant and colorful city of San Francisco, using your hacking skills to take down corrupt corporations and expose shady government agencies. The game's open-world design allows for endless possibilities, whether you're hacking into a rival gang's security system or simply enjoying the scenery on your customizable skateboard.

But what really sets Watch Dogs 2 apart is its sense of humor. The game is filled with wacky gadgets, pop culture references, and hilarious one-liners that will have you laughing out loud. From a drone that shoots fireworks to a car that can drive itself, the game's gadgets are both useful and ridiculous in equal measure.

Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a fun and creative take on the open-world genre, with its irreverent humor and inventive gameplay making for an enjoyable and entertaining experience. Whether you're a fan of hacking, vigilante justice, or just good old-fashioned silliness, this game has something for everyone.",1553552491,1676827702,True,104,9,0.844205737113952637,0,True,False,False

Watch Dogs 2[/h1]
Open World and NPCs: The open world is vibrant and colourful and NPCs have their own lifes. They have picnic at parks, vent out their anger by smashing cars along the road and have conversations and get angry at each other. You can send gangs to police and vice versa and will result in a firefight. I really enjoyed seeing the gunfights but then it gets repetitive quite quickly.

Things to do: You can do side and main story missions, taxi services with requirements, sailboat and motorcross race and go around the world taking pictures of attractive landmarks. I have no complaints about the activities except for the sailboat races. I fucking hate them because they are fustrating to play and get first place for.

Progression: You progress by gaining followers, which is earned by doing all of the activities above. As you level up, you gain research points which can be invested into your hacking skills to make it more powerful and versatile. Eventually you will have to find the rest of the research points by picking them up or hacking them in places scattered throughout the world, which I don't really like. Overall, the progression system in WD2 is quite good.

Combat: There are guns in the game but it is very limited and there are lethal and non-lethal options to play the game. You also have explosives and non-lethal versions of it. Gunplay in the game is mediocre at best. You can also melee NPCs when you are near them. Stealth is an option when playing the game as you create distractions and can possibly take them out without ever getting near them by hacking environmental objects.

Hacking: Your hacking skills ranges from ability to control forklifts and cranes to mass hacking individuals to distract a whole of them, cars to force them to move away from you and infrastructures to disable them. You can send cars flying off bridges or force police cars chasing you to smash into buildings or activate steam pipes to explode.

DLCs: Buying the season pass nets you 3 major DLCs. The first one gives a modified school bus that can wreak havoc in the world, and the second and third DLCs gives you new story missions to do. Each DLC also offers other side content.

Multiplayer: 3 basic modes. The basic co-op mode, the bounty hunter mode, where you enter someone's world who is currently on a level 3 wanted level or higher and try to neutralise them, and a hacking invasion mode, where you hack a player and try to not get detected while the hacking gets done. Buying the DLCs gets you a new difficulty for coop and a new enemy type.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game (except for the sailboat races). Definitely buy it on sale. Also, the fucking police is a pain in the fucking arse which keeps appearing when I don’t need them to.

*I have 66 hours spend on the uplay version of the game in my uPlay account, but it is not reflected here.

It definitely delivered with the fun banter, but I can also see that the type of humor in the game may not be to everyones tastes. I went in looking for a stupid lighthearted experience so I knew what I was getting into, and it was a lot of fun.

The story was alright at best, the characters' personalities do a lot of the heavy lifting to make it somewhat interesting. It had a couple emotional moments but they don't overstay their welcome, or really stay at all- what I'm trying to say is that the tone of the game has a bit of an identity crisis during some of the later missions.

Stealth mechanics and enemy AI felt very inconsistent, sometimes the enemy knows your exact pinpoint location from two miles away with no line of sight needed, and other times it won't notice you whacking someone to death 10ft in front of them. The hacking skills were fun to play around with and gave nice variety of options for approaching a mission. 

[i]PS. Ubisoft Connect forcing itself open every time I launch the game makes me feel like someone is about to launch a car right through my window Devil May Cry -style. I swear there wasn't a single time that the launcher or game opened without some weird hiccup.[/i]",1676652703,1676652703,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1676506131,1676506131,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1. Enemies spawn out of nowhere, so you can't be strategic when you're going in heavy John Wick style. Absolutely infuriating.

2. No suppressors on the sniper. They did the same thing in Watch Dogs 1. This seems deliberate and it's so obnoxious. Why? I can 3D print weapons but not an attachment that's available on my rifle and pistol?

3. I can't 3D print armor? Why was this skipped?

4. You're unable to run armored enemies over with forklifts. Those things weigh hundreds/thousands of pounds. Why?

5. Armored enemies can survive .50 cal sniper shots to the face, point blank.... fuck off. In what universe does that happen?

6. Armor enemies can survive headshots with a rifle at point blank. IRL, those helmets stop pistols at most. Again, fuck off.

7. Multi zoom on scopes..... really? 1x?

8. They removed the grenade launcher that was in WD1. That was so fun and we can't have that.

This game, (imo) is the best third person open world game I have EVER played, and I mean ever. I LOVE THIS GAME.

This would be a great opportunity for showing when the group broke up (hopefully for a good reason) and allowing for a great story to be laid out instead of just ""Oh watch dogs 2 but its more missions!11!"".

The graphics are also impressive, and the game's soundtrack is fantastic.

On the downside, some of the missions can feel repetitive and the character control can feel clunky at times. Additionally, the AI can be quite inconsistent, with enemies sometimes acting overly aggressive or too passive. The story can also be a bit underwhelming, with some of the characters and subplots not fully fleshed out.

Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a solid open-world game that is definitely worth playing for fans of the genre. While it has its flaws, the fun hacking mechanics and the beautiful open world make it a good choice for those looking for a fun and engaging game experience.

	[td]
- Solid open-world gameplay with a detailed and well-designed environment

- Improved hacking system that allows players to interact with the environment in new and creative ways

- Engaging story (maybe not well written) that deals with themes of surveillance, privacy, and the power of technology, social justice, racism, and civil rights

- Variety of activities and side missions, offering players a lot of content to explore

- The game's soundtrack is well-curated and fits the game's atmosphere and theme

- A good sense of humour, with various Easter eggs and references

- The game's improved driving mechanics and improved parkour system, making the gameplay more fluid
	[/td]
	[td]
- The game's stealth mechanics for being inconsistent, making it difficult to complete missions without being detected

- The DLC is bad. It doesn't add much to the overall game

- [b]Steam achievements are no longer available for this game[/b]

- The structure of the main missions is too repetitive

- Some glitches and technical issues

- The multiplayer is just a joke, as it doesn't add anything new

[/table]	

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
The gameplay in Watch Dogs 2 is decent for a Ubisoft game. The game's improved hacking system is one of its strongest features, allowing players to interact with the environment in new and creative ways, from controlling traffic lights to hacking cameras and drones. The stealth mechanics were inconsistent, making it difficult to complete missions without being detected.

[h3] Story [/h3]
The game's story is engaging but not well-written, dealing with themes of surveillance, privacy, the power of technology, social justice, racism, and civil rights. Through Marcus's story, the game explores the impact of surveillance on individuals and marginalised communities and how the abuse of technology can be used to control and manipulate the population. 

However, the game's story is inconsistent, the game's themes and messages are not always well-integrated into the story, the game's narrative is often disjointed, and the game's characters and motivations are not always clear. The game's story does not always align with the gameplay mechanics, and the game's missions and side activities can feel disconnected from the main story.

[h3] Art Style [/h3]
The game's visuals on PC are generally considered to be very good (similar to the infamous E3 trailer for Watch_Dogs 1), with the game's open-world environment looking particularly impressive. The open-world environment is detailed and well-designed, allowing players to freely explore the city of San Francisco

[h3] DLC [/h3]
The DLC for Watch Dogs 2, which includes additional missions, weapons, and vehicles, has received mixed reviews. The DLC isn't worth the price, even though it adds new content to the game and expands upon the game's story. 

[h3] Steam Achievements [/h3]
Steam achievements are no longer available for this game due to Ubisoft's decision to remove the game's integration with the Steamworks API, which is a greedy way to force users to buy games on their platform to ""unlock"" more features. Features that should not be exclusive.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a good game with many negatives. Players that enjoy open-world action-adventure games with a strong emphasis on hacking and social justice themes might enjoy it, but players that are looking for a more consistent storyline may be disappointed.",1674388501,1674988723,True,16,3,0.662939310073852539,0,True,False,False

The game takes place in the city of San Francisco, and players take on the role of Marcus Holloway, a young hacker who joins the hacking group DedSec to take down the corrupt corporate and government forces that control the city.

One of the biggest improvements in Watch Dogs 2 is the open-world environment. The city of San Francisco is beautifully rendered and feels alive, with a bustling population of NPCs going about their daily routines. The city is also much larger than the one in the first game, with a variety of neighborhoods to explore, each with their own distinct personalities. The game also features a variety of vehicles, from cars and motorcycles to boats and drones, that players can use to explore the city.

Another major improvement in Watch Dogs 2 is the gameplay. The game is more open-ended, allowing players to choose how they want to approach missions and objectives. Players can use stealth to infiltrate buildings and take down enemies, or they can use a more aggressive approach, using weapons and gadgets to take down enemies head-on. The game also features a variety of side missions and activities, such as races and mini-games, that add to the overall experience.

The hacking mechanics in Watch Dogs 2 are also a significant step up from the first game. Players can hack into various devices and systems in the city, such as cameras and traffic lights, to gain an advantage in combat or to complete objectives. The game also introduces a new feature called ""profiler,"" which allows players to hack into the personal lives of NPCs to gather information and complete missions.

The story of Watch Dogs 2 is also much better than the first game. The game follows Marcus and DedSec as they take on the corrupt corporate and government forces that control the city. The game features a variety of missions and objectives that are both exciting and engaging, and the characters are likable and relatable.

In conclusion, Watch Dogs 2 is an excellent sequel that surpasses the original game in every way. The open-world environment, gameplay, hacking mechanics, and story are all top-notch, and the game is a joy to play. If you're a fan of the first game or open-world action games in general, then Watch Dogs 2 is a game that you don't want to miss.",1480413994,1674973106,True,1,0,0.505783975124359131,0,True,False,False

It isn't necessarily bad in the way that you might think, it's not brutally hard for no reason, it doesn't have the worst of developers out there, nor is does it have some kind of rage inducing story line. But what it does have is a lack luster story, annoying characters, and sometimes frustrating controls.

I'll start off with the story line and what I personally disliked about it. Firstly, there isn't exactly the deepest of stories that you need to follow, it more or less just boils down to ""There be Evil Corporation, we must destroy said Corporation."" This is indeed a format that can work greatly, but we the players are never truly given a reason to really fear or resent that corporation on a personal level. The only time you ever see the dastardly doings of the overlords is just looking at CCTV footage of a handful crooked cops or by being framed of various crimes, and that's really it. There is no kidnapping or torture of other characters, there is nothing really besides false accusations thrown against you, and your only ever told about their evil actions. 
However, if we look at the first Watch_Dogs game, there is a story to follow with the devilish CEO's as a backdrop for the setting, but I will admit that the story in the first game isn't the greatest. Since the corporation is the back drop, the main antagonists is the mafia, and what I liked about these bad guys is that you are given a reason for not liking them beyond just the idea that they're bad.  Another thing that set the original and the sequel is the fact that you would be punished for being a bad person yourself, with a bad ending as punishment for being an asshole. While in the sequel, I went on several murder streaks, killing dozens of civilians and law enforcement alike, but in the end I was still a ""crime fighting hacker that only has the interests of the people in mind"", even though I most likely caused more deaths than the CEO's you're supposed to be fighting against. The last grievance I'll touch on is the over all tone of Watch_Dogs 2, which felt way more bubbly and bright than it should've been, showing that the whole Bay Area was supposed to be under the iron fists of corporate fat cats. While the tone of the first game was a bit more darker and muted, it felt like it fit with the setting and story, with that setting being a decrepit Chicago that's being ruled over by a faceless system and organised crime syndicates, and the story being a broken man seeking revenge for the death of a loved one while simultaneously keeping his still living loved ones safe from the wake of his own actions. 

Secondly, there is the obnoxious characters. The main gripe that I had with these characters is mostly the fact that they don't mesh with the story that well. With the fact that they are literally just a bunch of kids going up against one of the most powerful forces in the entire world, and only coming out on top because they are the main characters. For example, these characters take over and destroy a massive corporation that is on the verge of taking over the world, where other people have been killed trying to only put a dent in the gigantic monopoly that this corporation has built, and five random people topple its entire regime in only a couple of weeks; with the only sort of loss that this group sustained being one of their friends being humiliated with a slap on the wrist before you come in and undo all that just happened to that character. Another thing that I didn't really like was the lack of screen time with other characters. With the best example I've found being that of Horatio. He is one of the founding members of DedSec (the hacker group you're a part of) and you have barely any interaction with him before he is killed off. Where you spend one mission with him and get a small amount of information about his character, and to only have him be killed a handful of missions later. The part that made this fact sting the most (for me at least) was the fact that he is my favorite character out of the entire cast you meet, and the sole reason he is my favorite is only because he is the most normal out of the cast. While there are three other characters who are just a bunch of weirdos with horrible fashion sense, who were either bullied too much or too little while growing up.

All in all, it definitely isn't the worst game I've played by far, it has some good music, an incredibly detailed and stunning map, and a large degree of customization. But with the lack of a solid connection between the story of the original and sequel, a boring story of its own, obnoxious characters, and odd controls has made the experience not the greatest for me. In my opinion until I play the third game, just stick with the original.",1672702880,1672702880,False,3,2,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

The city is fun to explore and like with most Ubi games, the world feels alive with AI pedestrians going about their ways. There are many areas to explore and items to collect. Aside from the slight pandering, what makes the game feel off though are just minor annoyances that stack up.

The story is not half bad, but I would definitely prefer the first game over this one. The first game felt like it had more purpose, where this one not so much.

The controls are decent but you can tell Ubi still hasn't gottent eh refinement down as it still feels clunky, most noticeable when turning the character. The game is ""always"" online and if you wish to not have people jump you in game, you can turn it off in the settings menu, or you can forego installing the anti cheat in the game and it will automatically turn online mode off.

Music is eh.. Doesn't have the strongest soundtrack compared to games that are similar. Driving is so so. Its decent and handleing feels stiff but in a good way. What sucks though is there is really no consequences for crashing, even on a bike. Speed in the game is arbitrary and the screen shakes to signify you are going fast. The police will always catch up to you and are brutally relentless.

I got stuck in walls and railings at times and had to reload a save or fast travel to a safe house when I could. The sky always has a slight flicker to it. It flickers black when the screen is at a certain angle and almost always when in cutscenes. While not tooooo bad, it is noticeable. I only had 1 crash.

Decent game overall, but repetitive and I got bored of the missions a little over half way through. If there was a neutral rating on steam, I'd give it that. The game does go on sale at a rather deep discount at times. The first game vs the 2nd game though, I'd suggest going with the first as they are basically the same thing....It's Ubisoft we are talking about here.",1672529285,1672577216,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game has a vast and open world to explore, with a variety of activities and missions to complete. The controls are tight and responsive, and the game has a good difficulty curve that keeps things challenging but not frustrating.
One of the standout features of Watch Dogs 2 is its hacking mechanics. The game lets you hack into various systems and devices to complete missions and gather information. It's a fun and innovative gameplay mechanic that adds a lot of depth to the game.
The graphics in Watch Dogs 2 are excellent, with detailed character models and environments. The game's music and sound effects are also top-notch, adding to the atmosphere.
One downside to Watch Dogs 2 is that the game can be a bit repetitive. You'll be doing a lot of the same actions over and over again, and the missions can start to feel a bit samey after a while. That being said, the game has a high replay value, and you'll probably find yourself coming back to it again and again.
Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is an excellent open-world action-adventure game that's a lot of fun to play. Its hacking mechanics and vast open world make it a game that's worth checking out. The occasional repetitive gameplay can be a bit of an issue, but it doesn't really impact the overall enjoyment of the game. If you're a fan of open-world action-adventure games, you should definitely give Watch Dogs 2 a try.",1672542495,1672542495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not a perfect recreation of course but it's definately got the vibe and it's fairly faithful to what the Bay Area actually looks like.

Marcus is a way better character than Aiden ever was, and having some black representation with an interesting character in a Big Name title is actually super legit. I pretty much like most of the crew in the SF DeadSec team, I thought I would hate Wrench at first but he grew on me pretty fast, they're all just kinda lovable dorks. The only one that seems kinda like a dead fish is Horatio, he doesn't seem to serve much purpose and is just kinda boring. 

The game is pretty much your standard open world fair, run around SF pick up collectibles, do meaningless side missions, engage with the main story when you feel like it. I tend to like these kinds of games cause they can be pretty zen when the collectibles aren't too tedious to find. That said it doesn't really hold a candle to something like the Witcher 3 which is pretty much what I consider to be the gold standard for Open World games.

I've also started to not really like games that give the option of being Non-Lethal or Lethal without any moral ramifications for either choice. Narratively it doesn't really make sense for Marcus or Deadsec to be carrying around lethal weaponry, you're not really like hardened criminals and it doesn't really make much of a statement as people fighting for Societal Freedoms to kill anyone, it just makes you into another sort of police force. I'd much rather all the weapons either be non-lethal or just go the complete opposite direction and make it clear that Deadsec aren't good people and lean into the lethal weapons.

Game runs fine, it's pretty enough. Looks good for something that released 6 years ago. I do have gripes with Ubisoft wrapping their fingers so tightly around all their games, I hate the Ubisoft overlay, it's pointless bloat and a poor anti-piracy measure, I turned it off but I know it's still running in the background. The lack of a dedicated pause button without going into the map or the settings is kind of annoying too.

No major spoilers but the original game had a story that actually got you involved with you accidentally revealing disgusting sinister activities of elites, had characters that were well made, likeable and it was funny from time to time when it mattered. The sequel? It's just a mess, it has boring stereotypical characters who act childish as hell, while in the meantime killing people and then going ""yasss look at us we're so cool and hip and we're totally the good guys"". The sequel has no character, it tries to sell you bringing down an oppressive system while you yourself or anyone around you is seemingly not actually being oppressed, but having a great time, much contrary to original game which had a much simpler goal which then kept spiralling out of control as the character dug in deeper and deeper.

It's a mix of amazing design and asthetics, an open world devoid of life, a ""parkour"" mechanic that while fun to use faces the same pathing problem as other UBISOFT properties, a story that goes from interesting to absolute cringe in the span of 5 minutes (looking at some of the ""join us"" cutscene segments), uninteresting antagonists with good voice actors in deadpan characters, and a hacking system that while an improvment from WD1, becomes easily obsulete half way the game.

And here's my biggest grievences. 

1. Because the ""hacking"" fails to trigger the intended actions, you'll easily resort to a more agressive play, to wich the game designers force you to revert into the former;

2. The enemy a.i. are a pure comedy of awfull design as certain ""traits"" were implemented for you not to notice, making them go from extremely idiotic, to ""I can see behind walls and trigger everyone in the map to your position!"";

3. The collecting is easy puzzles made difficult. It's an easy hack or grab an item, almost always on rooftops, but the ways to access them is literally stopping every and any pacing or momentum in your playthrough to widly and very boringly search for the same exact solution for every single ""puzzle"". It's a sub-par design, made by someone that fails to comprehend the line between doing something fun and working and whomever was the cursed soul that decided this needs to be excluded from future projects.

4. Hacking sequences were always fairly easy, to wich they implemented useless timed triggers for a sense of urgency.

5. The game is litered with useless minigames, that with the limited control scheme, become a slog of doing the same over and over.

6. Forget the Online. Almost no one grasps the intended objectives and wants to troll, or you'll face easy invasions against people that lack the comprehension of what hiding or searching means. 

So in sum. The game is easy, the collecting is made extremelly and awfully tedious, the enemy a.i. is definitly broken with ungodly superpowers at points and you'll leave the main component (hacking) in the sidelines a LOT of time.

It's a huge improvment from the first one, but don't hold a candle for the sequel, as in Legion managed to be worse then both WD1 and WD2.

UBISOFT has the right idea in this entry, and it shows much promise and talent from everyone that worked in it, BUT if you're going to play this one, buy it a discount. It gets fairly repetitive around the 7 hours mark.

Id recommend to ask someone else for DLC opinion but from what ive seen, you aren't losing anything interesting as WD1 dlc.",1671765450,1671765450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original was a decent, if dull and kinda forgettable experience. It had some good ideas, but all in all it was ripe for expansion in a sequel. Watch Dogs 2 does make minor improvements all over the game, but its still not the knock-out it could've been.

That being said, Watch Dogs 2 is still an enjoyable experience and the devs at least gave it a good shot.

Visually, the game still looks pretty good for the most part and the new San Francisco location combined with the brighter art style allows for a more vibrant look. In general its just a good looking game. It is a shame though that its not optimised all that well. Despite having a pretty damn amazing system, regardless of settings the frames would vary hugely depending mostly on environment, which is a shame.

The story and writing is more engaging this time around, however its still overly safe and inconsistent. There are plenty of moments which will leave you scratching your head and the dialogue in particular can be pretty cringe worthy on occasion. But, the new main character Marcus is pretty likeable and the DedSec group dynamic setup here is really believable. Its miles away from award winning, but its far from bad.

The gameplay here is definitely better than the previous title, however there were some changes made which may cause issues for some people. For one, there's no manual save, which combined with the harsh checkpoints can lead to some very frustrating deaths. The driving is improved across the board and doesn't feel as floaty anymore. The game has a much bigger focus on the hacking/stealth aspects this time around. In fact, I'd argue combat is straight up discouraged this time around. Marcus dies insanely fast, even on the normal difficulty setting and the armoured enemies in particular can be super spongey, leading to loud combat that's far less enjoyable. This does fit with the games tone seeing as Marcus is very much displayed as a pacifist, but considering this is the case, I wonder why guns were even kept in if they were gonna get nerfed into the ground? Who knows.

My only proper issue with Watch Dogs 2 is the state of polish. Despite how long this game has been out for, I experienced a pretty common amount of jank. The game crashed 4 times on me in the 16 hours it took me to finish it. On top of this, I got mission soft locked more than once, the physics broke a few times and audio got desynced in one of my cutscene's. None of this is insanely game breaking, however it is pretty annoying. Obviously your mileage may vary, but from my experience it wasn't exactly smooth sailing.

Overall, if you just want to play a light, enjoyable open world shooter, I'd recommend it. It's not high art, but its a firm improvement over the original, and that's good enough for me.",1670412248,1671139460,True,37,0,0.743441283702850342,0,True,False,False

You play missions and get a couple thousand, maybe up to 100k in big missions. It's just a tedious grind to get to the interesting part. Not to mention how weak the characters are. You basically play as a Terrorist running around the city killing people over the smallest little things. For example, there is a mission where you break into a movie studio to steal a car that is being used in a ""Hacker Thriller"". During this mission you can, and probably will murder ~15 guards in the duration of the mission. How am I suppose to feel good about stealing some prop car that holds up production of a bad movie that isn't hurting anyone, when I just killed 15 people. The characters are shallow and have no moralities.

In the first watch_dogs you played as Aiden Pearce, a man who's niece was killed during an assassination attempt on his life. Because of this he becomes the hacker vigilante. This game has a strong moral compass and your actions have consequences, however minor. When you kill a cop, your reputation goes down into criminal menace. And when you do good things, like prevent murders or steal something back for someone. You get positive points, making you a publicly adored vigilante.

This lack of morality is what absolutely kills my immersion and interest in the second installment of watch_dogs.",1514614011,1671117178,False,141,29,0.641892731189727783,27,True,False,False

The majority of it was spent either alt-tabbed or shift-tabbed looking for threads on how to fix these issues. Eventually I'd decide to skip it because the game was running, and see if it got better after the intro. It got far, far worse. Everytime I decided to skip fixing a problem I would experience a much worse problem literally no more than 5 minutes later.

Stutters constantly, audio desyncs because of this during gameplay and cutscenes. The framerate doesn't reach 60 at any point no matter which graphics settings I use, in fact the lower I set the settings, the worse my framerate becomes, usually sits at about a solid 20 with constant dips into the single digits. Attempting to find a fix online yeilded no help because there are so many people with this issue and all of them have different solutions. Every single thread about the stuttering and framerates had at least 7 seperate possible fixes with the majority of users replying that none worked, I'd have tried more but I wanted to make sure I didn't go over the 2 hour refund limit which I just requested after only 40 minutes. The cutscenes seemingly play overtop of each other with audio from one drowning out the audio from another, and then after one finishes, the other cutscene begins to play again.

My specs are as follows:
AMD FX8350 Black Edition clocked @ 4.0Ghz
MSI GTX 970 100ME 4GB VRAM
8GB DDR3 RAM
Asrock Extreme 3 Moboard
Intel 120GB SSD
Seagate 1TB HDD 64MB Cache 6.0Gb/s

This is an absolutley horrid PC port of a potentially fantastic game that I've been looking forward to for a few months. The fact that they released this game in this state is just spitting the face of gamers everywhere, but then again; isn't that what Ubisoft is known for?

Sincerely hope Uplay doesn't fuck up my ability to get a refund, if so I'm contacting Ubisoft directly and bitching up a storm until I get all $40.18 back.

-Marcus Holloway

[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]
Ubisoft has had a bad reputation over the years in terms of its game building strategy. There are times when they create amazing games and there are other times when they basically “milk” an already used concept. Having played Watch Dogs 1 in the past, my expectations were quite low since the promises made in 2012 E3 were not fulfilled. I have never said Watch Dogs 1 is a bad game (don’t get me wrong) but the franchise had so much potential that thankfully, I was able to see it with my own eyes in its current sequel.

[h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1]
[h3] Summary [/h3]
Having failed to manage Chicago’s city-wide infrastructure, due to the influence of our beloved Aiden Pierce, the CTOS (Central Operating System) which connects everyone and everything has been installed in San Francisco. This time under new management called [b] Blume. [/b] Even though the system has been upgraded to its newest version CTOS 2.0, it covertly brings harm to many innocent citizens of the city, including our protagonist. Marcus Holloway an intelligent hacker from Oakland, having been accused of a crime he did not commit, decides to work with the hacking group called [b] DedSec. [/b] Filled with ambition and pride his new purpose is to take down Blume’s influence over the city. 

[h3] Characters [/h3]
Watch Dogs 2 lets us embark on a thrilling adventure. The plot revolves around a group of outlaws whose actions and thoughts can be very relatable to our own. A big comparison to the “vigilantly arc” experienced in the previous game. The cast has a funny (sometimes goofy) personality, with clear motivations and an intriguing character progression. The conversations can indeed get a little bit “nerdy” and “cringe-worthy”, but it's those features that make the interactions unique and thus more memorable. The dialogue ranges from happy moments to very dark ones (depending on the circumstances) giving us plenty of material to reflect upon. The only downside in my opinion is the main “villain” of the story. 

[b] Lesser Evil? [/b]
As you will see for yourself during your playthroughs, there will be times when you going to question both sides of the coin. Many arguments reflected upon the “villains” have a very valid point. Of course, they engage in illegal activities (the same goes for DedSec) which is considered an evil approach. However, their cause (for me at least) is far more justifiable than the one which DedSec stands for. A feeling that seems out of place, since the game in my opinion has no intention to offer. Overall, the writing is enjoyable but not perfect. There are flaws and plot holes, which to be honest was expected because the game relies almost completely on its gameplay aspect.

[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]
Watch Dogs 2 gameplay-wise truly outdid itself for many reasons:

[h3] Hacking [/h3]
[b] Toolkit [/b]
The hacking feature of the game, the soul and core of the franchise, is challenged to its fullest potential. You can hack cars, lights, robots, phones etc. in many different ways, something that the Watch Dogs 1 experience lacked. Furthermore, the many newly added features such as drones, provide an amazing toolkit for stealth lovers. Most of the missions can be completed without even having to engage in any combat!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2896420429
[b] Limitations [/b]
The clever touch that Ubisoft added was the battery system. You have limited use of the hacking ability, a smart way which keeps in check the ending [b] god mode [/b] feeling. This way, you are forced to follow a more strategic approach during your missions, by focusing more on your upgrades, ability tree as well as stealth and hacking. The bar can be replenished though, so no worries.

[h3] Movement [/h3]
[b] Parkour [/b]
The parkour aspect and the fighting style, in general, feel dynamic and fresh, with newly added animations that left me speechless. Marcus does flips, tricks and many more moves that bring a smooth feeling when free-roaming.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2896419740
[b] Combat [/b]
During combat, you can notice many details that both the protagonist and the NPCs share. For example, when different gangs were fighting each other, 3 SWAT trucks came in immediately to protect the citizens. The wanted system in my humble opinion is very well made. The above-mentioned incident proves this statement.

[h3] Exploration [/h3]
[b] World [/b]
San Francisco is beautiful and vast with a colourful, warm aesthetic that pleases the eye even in the most extreme situations like police chases. Driving is smooth and fun, which can prove handy on many occasions with special tweaks that I won’t spoil. There is a variety of vehicles from the faster to the more humble ones, all easily obtainable on every corner of the map.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2896419293
[b] Interaction [/b]
The way the world is expressed in this game, compared to its predecessor is one of the biggest ways Watch Dogs 2 improved from the original. The NPCs finally feel alive and have a purpose. You even can pet [b] dogs [/b] for god’s sake! The freedom of choice is not negligible, as customization offers a variety of options that can please even the most demanding players. 

[h3] Difficulty [/h3]
The game introduced the newly added [b] Realistic mode. [/b] In other words, enemies become [b] smarter [/b] and more [b] accurate [/b] with aim. Their health is slightly raised but they take the same amount of damage as before. It raises the stakes, which will ultimately prove useful if you ever play online against other players!

[h1] 👁‍🗨 Visuals: [/h1]
Watch Dogs 2 has amazing graphics. For a game that's almost 5 years old, they hold up pretty well. Details such as the fog that occurs during a rainy day, create an atmospheric feeling that I enjoy watching. The only downside here is the character models. In my opinion, they could dedicate more time polishing the product, as cutscenes sometimes prove to be disturbing.

[h1] 🎧 Audio: [/h1]
The music provides a neat touch to the game. I still remember the time when the [b] Fortunate Son [/b] soundtrack was playing in the background, as I was heading guns blazing into the fight. Of course, there are some [b] skippable [/b] songs here and there, but the missions become more [b] fun [/b] and more [b] memorable [/b] with such additions as the one mentioned above.

[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]
Co-op remains among its least approachable and yet most buggy features, but let it not discourage you from giving it a try. There are the familiar invasions, bounty hunter modes as well as many online activities, where you can bring havoc either with friends or random people you meet online. Lately, the Epic Store has offered the game for [b] free [/b] to many players. As a result, online became relevant and thus more enjoyable!

The DLCs are good yet short. I advise you to wait for the [b] Steam sales [/b] before buying the whole package since the prize can be considered a little spicy.

[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]
Watchdogs 2 deserves the title of [b] the [/b] perfect [b] sequel [/b] as it improves whatever came before it. The writing can be considered a delicate topic; however, the gameplay redeems the whole concept.",1601932395,1670885972,True,62,2,0.833361685276031494,5,True,False,False

The gameplay is smooth, the gadgets and hacking mechanics are well thought-out and interesting enough to keep you entertained. The game emphasizes stealth and rewards planning when tackling missions but also leaves it open to go in guns blazing.

I love the fact that you can upgrade specific areas of hacking to improve vehicle hacking, gadgetry, social engineering and even City-level hacking which feels really cool and powerful.

The graphics are great, I loved walking through the radiant, vibrant streets of San Francisco, the Oakland suburbs where each area of the map has interesting features. Weapon handling and vehicle driving physicals are tight and predictable which make the game so much fun to play.
The story entities Blume, Gallelei, Nudle are social commentaries on Facebook, Google and even SpaceX which I though was brave and pretty eye-opening as the subjects/topics about data privacy, moral dilemmas  and ethics with an information-driven economy and socially very relevant to today. Pretty Impressive for a game made back in 2016.


The characters are satirical typical nerds, isolates, outcasts and flamboyant, egotistical techies which exist in the tech industry, so I don't take offense.lol.

Some may find the characters too bright and obnoxious and too try-hard but Watchdogs 2 is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously.

I would recommend this game.

It's not worth paying for the game and then having to deal with Ubisoft Connect's incessant BS just to play the game. I've given the app admin permission HUNDREDS of times throughout the years, and I'm already sick and tired of dealing with the company in general. Hiding sexual abusers in their corporate ladder, all the while acting like they care about inclusivity and diversity. They can't even fix massive issues that make their older games unplayable. WD2 doesn't have many serious issues, but the game will randomly switch monitors for no reason whatsoever and tabbing out causes the game to minimize, once again, for no reason whatsoever. F**k Ubisoft's corporate leaders for their greedy company policies.

WD2 is a solid game overall. Better than its predecessor and its sequel imo. The tone is best looked at through a parody lens, most of the humor is more cringey than it is funny but the characters do come across as realistic if you're familiar with average hipster-rebel Millenials. The plot makes enough sense if you're familiar with the fundamentals of cyber security, a lot of people seem to fail to realize exactly what a botnet is and how it can be used when reviewing this game.

I WILL proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man to whom all things were known; this
was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things, he
brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a long journey, was weary, worn-out with labour,
returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the whole story.

When the gods created Gilgamesh they gave him a perfect body. Shamash the glorious sun endowed him with
beauty, Adad the god of the storm endowed him with courage, the great gods made his beauty perfect, surpassing all
others, terrifying like a great wild bull. Two thirds they made him god and one third man.

In Uruk he built walls, a great rampart, and the temple of blessed Eanna for the god of the firmament Anu, and
for Ishtar the goddess of love. Look at it still today: the outer wall where the cornice runs, it shines with the
brilliance of copper; and the inner wall, it has no equal. Touch the threshold, it is ancient. Approach Eanna the
dwelling of Ishtar, our lady of love and war, the like of which no latter-day king, no man alive can equal. Climb
upon the wall of Uruk; walk along it, I say; regard the foundation terrace and examine the. masonry: is it not burnt

Yeah, I can tell a ton of money and dev time was put into this game (its a ubisoft game that isnt falling apart at the seams, which is incredible) but every single droplet of a good story is evaporated with the sequel. The best development the characters can be honored with is getting killed off, and the game can't set up a decent conflict without shoving a character in your face and screaming in your ear ""THIS IS THE BAD GUY. THIS IS THE ANTAGONIST. DO NOT LIKE HIM. HE IS BAD."" You can argue that Damien also filled this role in the first game, but he had some actual connection with our protagonist and came off more as a zealot that oversteps his boundaries, and wasn't instantly shoved in your face like Douche Badguy (they literally name this guy douche and thought that was a good decision huh.) The game is also Packed with token characters. I'm not about to go on a Gamer Rant about the evils of forced diversity, but it's absolutely insulting when a solid majority of the characters are insanely flat and are obviously there just to fill corporate check boxes. I think the most absurd example of these characters is the trans government official (i cant even remember her name or actual position, call it a testament to my shit memory or the shit writing) who we just, talk to? about videos of her surgeries getting leaked? and her possible information on a cult, I think. It ends with her giving us the info and going ""idrc about the videos. lol."" This is just, stupid. The entire conflict of her character is obviously written by what a cis person Thinks would be upsetting to a trans person and, like. Are we just gonna fucking gloss over that we have connections to The Government??? She is never brought up again, and I think a vigilante hacker group having an in with The Actual Government would be a big fucking deal? Obviously this can't happen because having a trans woman have any actual significance in the story would make the gamers angry, according to focus group session #49. The game also somehow has a huge disconnect with memes and internet culture that was not in the first game. I'll just sum it up with: this game is filled with trollfaces and 1337speak and other shit that wasn't even ironically funny in 2016, and the first game was pretty toned down, with the most obvious examples of memes being things like being able to hack billboards and None Pizza With Left Beef showing up. I'm rambling at this point, so I'll finish with.

Watch_dogs 2 is an incredibly meh game overall, but is outright terrible when compared to its predecessor, shitting all over the concept of any sort of coherent and compelling story. The gameplay is pretty good, but the only improvements that were made over the first game are a decent amount of feature streamlining, which is entirely negated by Ubisoft Brand Feature Bloat.

The graphics are really amazing, the missions are fun to play and it's also fun exploring off-limits areas and messing with the guards. I'm missing the crime fighting side missions / aspects of part 1 though, being told where crimes occur and having the chance to intervene was part of what made WD1 such fun (I spent more time on WD1 than WD2).
Overall, I would recommend the game, but there are some major flaws. The protagonists are too youthful and wannabe-""cool"", they're very annoying and not likeable at all.
The biggest flaw are the hidden research points though, which are hard to find even if you search areas with ""6th sense"" enabled (which is only possible on foot, making a full search of the entire map an unreasonable proposition).
I completed the game and all DLC missions and collected all the research points I could locate, but still I don't have the skill tree complete, which is a real shame.
If the game wouldn't stop awarding research points beyond level 20, I would at least have gotten a full skill tree by the time I finished the DLC (after story mode), which is far too late anyway given how much gameplay quality depends on having skills unlocked (by the time you receive certain skills, you can no longer do anything meaningful with them as you already plundered all restricted areas and completed all missions).
I'd say it deserves a 7/10, one point deducted for unlikeable characters, and two for the research point issue (near impossible to get them all, especially while still playing missions).",1585951967,1665003887,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It is a little like checking the spam folder after some years, you get heaps of stuff, missions and messages on your screen at once. It is proper hard to find you way around the interface and on top of that everytime you get into a car, some random music starts playing. 
The storyline is lacking in depth as well, while the firsst one may not have been the most sophisticated, the second part offers a cool gang (which doesn't miss a single minute telling you about their hippness), which tries to go after corrupt and law-violating people and gangs.
For me this was a clear downgrade, however some new features are heading in the right track, more hacking options and a small remotely controlled cart are good additions. The graphics are also quite nice, while also stressing your hardware.

Finished the game on the most difficult setting. Sometimes unforgiving but once you start using ""police arrest"" exploits, it starts to be much easier. Some clever puzzle games though.

Worth a purchase, on deep deep sale. Rated 6/10... OK

I was already a little bit saturated with that type of game and the drastic change of setting and tone kinda put me off. That was a few years ago. 

I never played it again until recently. Now I can truly appreciate it. The graphics and sounds are beautiful. San Francisco is an amazing place to explore and the characters are really charming once you get to know them. You exchange the grim determination of Aidan Pierce for the playful idealism of Marcus and his friends, young hackers bent on changing the world and having as much fun as they can doing it. Made me remember what it was like to be that age, when I was free and everything seemed possible. :P Anyway, I think that change of setting and tone was actually a better fit for the gameplay. They added a lot of cool stuff and gameplay options (the RC buggy and drone add so many possibilities during missions).

Anyway, long story short, if you liked the first game, you'll like this one too. It builds up on what the first one did right and added several great features, like a good sequel should. But perhaps you should not play it right after the first one. Or maybe it won't bother you. And if you didn't play the first one, that's fine too. The story is lightyears away from the first one, so you won't feel like parts of the plot are missing because you don't know the story of the first one.

A story you get invested in, lovable characters, comedy, action, a surprisingly accurate depiction of San Francisco, decent graphics, advanced NPC interaction to the player and to each other and yet again highly underrated multiplayer modes. This game is quite extraordinary with realistic characters with real seeming emotions unlike other game characters. This game also features much diversity as two of the main characters are black, there is another main character with autism, a transgender character and there are LGBTIQ+ flags hanging everywhere. Watch dogs 2 is a huge improvement on the first game with updated graphics, a less dark tone, more charisma in the main character and in all the characters for that matter, a more enveloping story line and many MANY more hacking abilities.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character, and started playing but I was stuck on what I was supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

- Fun hacking/combat gameplay (when hacking into living spaces and doing main story hacking, there are some amusing results)

- Plenty of cars and weapons
- great graphics and mostly smooth gameplay (just an occasional glitch)

- tons of abilities to unlock
- fairly interactive world with tons of things and people's devices to hack into. 

Cons:
- Gameplay can be repetitive unless you deliberately attempt to approach hacking/combat in different ways.
- Wish different aspects of the game had more customization - like the HQ spots and more ways to tweak the vehicles
- While the side quests are necessary obtaining new abilities, i wish they had more to them- like more variety in the activities, or if they affected the main story/experience somehow. They are an rpg chore than anything.

Overall, the games main story is alot of fun, side operations are okay when you are bored, and free roam can be a good time-killer, especially when hacking into traffic lights or when you get the ability to call cops/gang members on unsuspecting npc's. 8/10",1661726777,1661726777,True,1,0,0.510548532009124756,0,True,False,False

Well now those punk rebel kids and their weird grandpa are super ""cool"" hackers and they're gonna be really annoying about it. All they have to do to save the world from evil mega corp is plug the plorbus into the blumbis and the whole network is going to crack open for them to schmorgle the shmaegle. But there's gonna be a ton of guards in the way. Rinse and Repeat.

Originally gave a thumbs up, but after writing this switched to a thumbs down. Overall I give it a well deserved ""meh.""

It's leagues better than the first one and manages to not be as cringey for maybe a few hours. While the premise is good, and the gameplay overall enjoyable, Watchdogs 2 has some major holes in it. The whole ""punk rock"" hacker group trope starts off interesting but quickly becomes very stale. Gameplay wise Watchdogs 2 suffers from what most of these GTA type open world RPGs do, repetition, and superficiality. There is never really much going on in the world around you, and the world doesn't react to the things that you do in a very meaningful way. Apart from sending really annoying cops at you. The other enemies did NOT age well, I don't really understand what Ubisoft was thinking when they decided that the gangs were all going to be racial/ethnic stereotypes. 

There are so many immersion breaking aspects to the game and the story. Having a hypnotic screen break before every mission fragmented the game up in a really detrimental way. Despite all of this I felt that the biggest thing about Watchdogs 2 is that it is almost intentionally annoying. It felt like every character was trying way too hard to be this ""i'm so edgy punk, screw society but I'm actually really cool about it"" type. But that's also their whole personality. I guess what I'm trying to say is that all of the characters were really one dimensional. While playing I quickly became tired that there were these awkward moments where someone was having an angsty breakdown because ""society is so screwed."" No one's backstory is ever explored or explained in the main story and I frequently questioned how some characters even knew each other. 

The narrative also never acknowledges the gameplay. Ok, so I run in and shoot a bunch of people and blow up stuff. Well, why does no one outside the group ever start to say: ""hey, this hacker group is literally killing people""? Why does no one inside the group say anything about that.... by the end of the game I was essentially also a mass murderer but that's ok as long as I was sticking it to the man? I felt that the game needed some kind of morality system for the narrative to work. Even though I took down evil mega corp at the end of the game, I still overall felt like the main character was more of a villain. But the whole time the story was trying to convince me that I was some sort of social hero. It didn't translate. 

By far the most aggravating aspect about Watchdogs 2 is that it NEVER stops explaining itself. In some ways it needs to. Tech is not a language everyone speaks, myself included. Even in this fantasy sense (because obviously all the tech/hacking techniques in watchdogs are made up to some extent) all the tech speak got very confusing. Sometimes it was like listening to someone say ""Oh all we have to do is plug the plorbus into the blumbis and the whole network is going to crack open for us to schmorgle the shmaegle. But there's gonna be a ton of guards in the way."" EVERY chance it gets, Watchdogs 2 makes a concerted effort to explain itself over and over and over. ""What is this, why are we doing this, why is evil mega corp evil, and on and on and on, but make sure we never address these major plot holes and continuity errors"".  Couple that with the repetitive missions that I mentioned earlier and it quickly turns into an absolute slog several hours in.",1661446773,1661447258,False,2,1,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

Went for the 100% completion on my one and only save game, took some time. Found all the research points somehow and searched every nook and crevice of San Francisco. Once you've thoroughly combed through the world of WD2, you come to realize how much there is. Endless NPC dialogue, and loads of choices.

Great game if you love detailed world exploration and extremely interactive environments. Definitely play WD1, I enjoyed the Chicago ending more but DedSec has its own flavor that never really matched Aiden's style. Sitara, Wrench, Horatio, Ray, and...that one dude, all compelling characters that make it feel like you're in a ragtag group of friends not entirely sure where they're going rather than the all-knowing persona they portray themselves to be (oh, the duality!). DedSec is a fun dynamic! Wrench is the cherry on top.

If I could sum up what to expect from the two games:
[b]DedSec's version of the ""vigilante"" is the whistle-blowing shepherd.
Aiden's version of the ""vigilante"" is one that sought revenge under the guise of justice.[/b]
The story from either game very much reflects these differences.

Personally, I enjoyed WD1's story more; but WD2's game mechanics are, of course, better (having built upon its prequel). Overall, awesome underrated experience. Tons of fun with multiplayer.

Important notes and tips. If these don't sound fun, or sound tedious, you might want to skip this game.
-Its a ubisoft sandbox without the towers but a lot of collectibles. This includes sightseeing and photography. The sightseeing has an ingame assistant to make this easier however. Most harder unlockables will have hints or story requirements that will point you to them directly.
-Stealth and your unlockable skills are the name of the game, not your weapons. Dedsec weapons have stealth options but better to use skills and traps than go loud.
-There is also a lot of driving and some very GTA style chase sequences that you need to pay attention to the map to find good spots to break sight gain distance, and lay low. You may be able to cheese it, but i haven't learned it yet. Overall i enjoy the driving mechanics, despite me playing on a keyboard with all the crashing into things that involves
-Use your drones. You can use them from inside of vehicles for additional protection to yourself if needed. Your jumper can even access some physical hacking locations without you needing to enter hostile zones.
-You are fragile, use every tool possible to avoid direct combat. Whether it be stealth, drones, environmental hazards, trap devices, or summoning police against gangs/gangs against police and security (it doesn't work very well the other way around and wastes botnet energy) to draw fire. Heck, you can hack cars to ram them into hostiles with great effect, just be sure to take out the ones that call reinforcements first.

I originally burned out on this game and gave a bad review, but that was due to external circumstances. This game may not be for everyone, as you cannot go in guns blazing without getting hard punished. Its not the most puzzling of games, but it does requires patience and will get tedious if you don't enjoy its play style.

Sadly, as I continued playing the game I became less and less interested. I began noticing small mechanics that would begin annoying me, which ultimately impacted my gameplay experience. I got the game on sale (very happy I did), but I'm not sure I'll be finishing this one.

Watch Dogs 2 [b]gameplay[/b] is mediocre at best. It's weird that Ubisoft made series like Splinter Cell (which felt extremely smooth) then made something like this. Watch Dogs 2 feels like it has Assassins Creed movement, but if it was a lot more... block-ey. The movements are a little slow, the animations are okay but also slow the movement process down; the movements seem limited. Essential movements are included such as running, sneaking, jumping, and climbing. However, the finer movements aren't quite there. The selling point of Watch Dogs 2 is the ability to hack into systems and use them to the player's advantage. This is a really fun aspect of the game and does require some skill to balance hacking and remaining undetected. Some hacking skills include overloading systems, unlocking systems, surveillance systems, and moving systems (such as driving a car remotely into something... or someone). The hacking mini-games are also a nice break away from the main game and test the player's reflexes and problem-solving abilities. As great as this is, it becomes a little cumbersome as the game goes on. Missions begin to feel repetitive and challenges begin to feel the same. The appeal of the game declines the more I drive. The driving is probably the worst part of the game (which the player will do a lot of).

The [b]graphics and visuals[/b] are actually well done. The approach they took between using CMD prompts, hacker-esque themes, and the overall layout of the UI is rock solid. I would argue this is one of the best parts of the game. Tied in with a riveting [b]story[/b], it delivers a very effective moral. The animations are okay, but I believe they could've been a little smoother. The damage to the vehicles (for example) seems to do general damage rather than specific damage. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are appropriate to the game. Sounds register where need be and the voice acting was done particularly well.

Overall, this game is worth a sale if you're really curious. Otherwise, I would recommend staying away from it. I was expecting something different, but got GTA mixed with some hacking features. I feel the most unique part of the game (hacking) wasn't properly utilized. The story is definitely worth watching, as for the rest of the game, not so much.

long story short: if watch dogs is just GTA with added hacking elements, then watch dogs 2 is the environment hacking game that we all wanted watch dogs to be with GTA stuff slapped onto it.
WD 1 and WD 2 are very, VERY different games. they differ wildly in tone, visual style, progression, and
most of all, gameplay.
watch dogs 2’s hacking isnt a tagline. it IS the game. no longer can you just silenced pistol your way through encounters. enemies are much more alert. they get alerted by missed gunshots, they spot you in seconds, they call backups much faster. in watch dogs 2, bullets hurt. like, they really hurt. you cant just hop up above cover, take a few shots, and then duck back down and regen your health to full. you go down nearly instantly. you dont have time to run away, you dont have time to melee an enemy when out in the open. and, the biggest kicker, is that theres no focus anymore. you cant just gun your way through bases anymore, slowing down time if it gets too hard. you need to think outisde the box. you need to be smart.
how? well, watch dogs 2 gives you much more tricks and tools to get your jobs done. well, its more like it gives you a few new tools, but those tools incredibly change up the game, and then they recontextualize alot of the existing ones. the RC jumper and quadcopter make all the difference, and can let you complete a mission without ever even setting foot on the restricted area. the crafting system and most of the gadgets from WD 1 have been combined and replaced, leaving only 2 throwable items: IEDs and Electro Shock grenades. no more Lures, because now EVERYTHING can lure enemies. no more Proximity Mines, because now EVERYTHING can be triggered by enemy proximity. no more Frag Grenades, because honestly did you ever use the frag grenades?
Vehicle combat in WD1 was, to be blunt, bad. Vehicle combat in WD2 is much better with 1 simple addition: you can now use guns while driving. you can shoot the driver, shoot the tires, shoot the engine, shoot anything.
the visual style of the game is fine. its a tiny bit of a downgrade, but it’s necessary for the upgrade in tone the game gets.
the games tone is much better than WD1. that game takes itself WAYYY too seriously. the characters in this game have actual personality and arent just cold, emotionless killers.
the graphics are like kinda better i guess. i dont really care.
the music is fine. the best thing i can say is it really fits the games tone, and it doesn’t sound terrible.
online functionality is improved alot.
all in all, i would say that WD2 is better, but like half life 1 and 2, it really isnt fair to compare them, and both are good in their own way.",1659207794,1659207794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the franchise's reputation, this game is very enjoyable; the story doesn't take itself too seriously, and hacking has vastly improved since the first game. The game certainly does have its faults -- the vehicle handling is a bit lackluster, and stealth becomes comically easy once you unlock the ability to distract people -- but this is heavily made up for by the game's setting. [i]Watch_Dogs 2[/i]'s San Francisco is, to this day, one of the most astonishingly busy game cities I've seen. It really makes you feel like a [i]part[/i] of this city, not the center of it.
     The NPC interactions are really a highlight here. Not only do people believably interact with one another, but the player as well. Wealthier people in the city will quickly identify you and pester you to leave them alone, making your infamy as a member of DedSec more believable. If you kill a member of a gang, that faction will start a conflict with you until you escape. If you use the [i]APB: Wanted Criminal[/i] ability to make some cops kill a gang member, that faction will start a conflict with the police. Factions go at each other without player interference, as well. I've spent tens of hours just running around and doing fuck all in this game -- I really cannot stress how entertaining (and bountiful) the different NPC interactions are.
     I can't conclude this review without mentioning the world itself, either. The environment is impressively well-constructed, and collectibles are (mostly) cleverly dotted all around the map. That aside, though... damn. This game is beautiful. Maybe it has something to do with that signature San Francisco fog, but the views at night are nothing short of incredible. Some of my favorite moments playing this game came from just driving around and sightseeing.
     This game is, unequivocally, the best in the franchise. It isn't perfect, of course -- the gunplay is just passable, the vehicle controls aren't nearly as robust as its contemporaries, and the story has its issues. The world is, in my opinion, the selling point here. I'd recommend buying the game for that reason alone. A lot of my love for this game is nostalgia-driven, but [i]Watch_Dogs 2[/i] really is a great title that I'd heavily recommend to anyone curious about the series.",1612909623,1658622166,True,32,0,0.751212835311889648,0,True,False,False

I had heard positive buzz for the last six years about how it was better than Watch Underscore Dogs 1 (although it would be more impressive if it somehow managed to be worse than that game), and how the writing was actually decent. In particular, I remembered Austin Walker talking about how natural the code switching was between the game's black protagonist and the other black character on the team (which is true) and thought that sounded interesting and promising. I came in expecting not something especially great, but at least goofy dumb fun and enjoyable gameplay.

Well, I got at least... some of that. Mostly, it's just dumb. Very, very dumb. The first tutorial mission is genuinely great fun, opening with a charming and likable protagonist in a massive upgrade from the first game and having you do a heist that involves breaking in to a heavily secure evil corporation facility. It's great, it feels like Metal Gear Solid with phones, and beating it on Realistic with no deaths was hugely satisfying.

But then you get introduced to the OTHER main characters, who are either extremely bland and forgettable (can't remember their names for the life of me) or extremely unfunny and annoying (Wrench). Then you get to the first real open world mission, and it's about Marcus hacking an extraordinarily hamfisted and dated Martin Shkreli parody, one they were so worried you wouldn't understand that three separate characters explain the joke to you for five straight minutes. This carries all the way to the end of the mission, which is not as outright bizarre as WD1's sense of ""humor"" but is just as cringe-inducingly unfunny and difficult to watch.

OK, so, well, the game's fun isn't it? Well, it's really up and down. The side missions are when the game is at its best, letting you do arcade-y nonsense with little or no narrative while the charming protagonist cracks a few cute chuckle-worthy jokes (like calling himself ""Will Smith"" to an influencer whose gimmick is that she livestreams her drivers driving off sick-ass ramps). The game is often at its worst when it's Ubisoft Ubisoft-ing with thousands of pointless collectibles that are rarely any fun to actually get and mostly just means aggravating Donkey Kong 64 levels of pointless collectathon gameplay.

And then the online. Oh boy. Where do I start? It's fortunate that you can turn it off, and you should, because it's a terrible idea and terribly executed. As soon as your first open world mission, the ""seamless multiplayer"" kicks in, where in the middle of exploring the open world map you can get dropped into multiplayer matches with random players. If you've EVER played a multiplayer open world game, i.e. GTA4 or Just Cause 2 Online, you immediately might recognize this as a recipe for disaster. First of all, it happens completely randomly with very little warning or ability to stop it outside of disabling the ""feature,"" so you can be in the middle of escaping a police chase when a random player spawns, starts trying to hack you, and then for some reason starts trying to hit you with a car (this happened to me.)

But the other thing is that you're severely underequipped and unexperienced compared to everyone else playing online, especially in 2022. The players who ""invade"" your game have more unlocked skills, better cars, and better guns, but they also have considerably more knowledge of the game and practice with the controls. If you're playing pacifist and using non-lethal weapons, which are considerably fewer and worse, you're even more screwed since you're literally outgunned. Since for some reason the online unlocks almost immediately rather than being locked until a certain point in the story, this has the effect of the game randomly becoming frustrating and confusing, if not nearly unplayable.

The game does look very nice despite being buggy (it sets the aspect ratio to your highest *possible* resolution which is baffling) and unoptimized (six years later and you simply can't hit 60FPS on max settings even with a new PC), and I would definitely argue it's more worth your money than WD1 or even something like RDR2 which has writing that's even more atrocious and characters even more unlikable but also restricts your ability to do anything outside the box at all... but there are definitely better games and better open world games. Driver San Francisco, Burnout Paradise, the more recent Assassin's Creed games, are all far better worth your time.

Also Ubisoft forcing you to use their horrible launcher and put up with their awful DRM is both enough for a negative review by itself and absolutely comical for a game about anarchist anti-capitalist rebel hackers.",1658390058,1658390974,False,3,0,0.534642457962036133,11,True,False,False

If anyone were to want to understand what game design elements distinguish stealth games from cover-shooter games, I can think of three games that would suit that study perfectly: any Metal Gear Solid game, any Uncharted game, and Watch Dogs 2. Why the latter, you ask? Because while MGS mostly lacks combat sequences and Uncharted sneaking sequences, Watch Dogs 2 plays the two systems entirely… halfway. It wants to be a sneaking game where you can accomplish objectives totally remotely and, thus, undetected, using RC drones, but it also wants to be a shooter game where you mow down waves of enemies using insanely powerful weapons while some upbeat licensed song plays in the background just to make sure you really feel as invincible as your character.

And, while I understand that this might be an unpopular perspective, I would argue that it is this unwillingness to commit to either being a sneaking game or a cover-shooter that makes me feel that, for all of the gameplay and presentation improvements made over its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 ultimately falls short as a complete package. But we'll get there; it’s time to sing some well-earned praises.

Watch Dogs 2 is a lavishly animated, lushly designed visual experience that showcases some exceptional skill and talent by the development team. Colors are bright and vibrant, some truly outstanding and evocative lighting can be found in a few select areas, and animations are fantastically smooth, especially with regard to characters and how they emote. The amount of polish poured over the look of the game absolutely deserves respect and is far-and-away one of its strongest aspects, the polish easily outshining the rather rough-looking first game.

Additionally, in spite of my remarking on the halfway-ness of some game mechanics, the wider array of usable hacks is definitely a highlight. There are so many ways to mess with enemies, either by making a nearby car suddenly speed backwards into a wall, blacking out a building, or (easily the most useful) distracting them with a text message so you can walk right past them undetected. The number of different hacks far exceeds what was seen in the previous game, which took its core selling point of “hacking stuff” and ultimately undercut it by favoring straight gunplay instead. That said, one could interpret this reserve to employing what basically amounts to a magic trick as an attempt to maintain at least the slightest bit of realism in the first game. 

Watch Dogs 2 completely throws all of that out the window; you can cause as much mayhem as you like or do all manner of stupid hijinks and there will be absolutely no repercussions; maybe police will be called and they might kill you eventually, and then… nothing, as if it never happened. It could be argued that Watch Dogs has a similar problem, but that game at least had a reputation meter which dictates whether or not NPCs will call the cops on you; it’s not a major aspect of the game at all, but it does make it just a tiny bit deeper. The sequel has this almost nihilistic element baked into it that is completely incongruous with the game’s characters and plot; if nothing you do in the world has even the slightest effect on the state of affairs, what’s the point of being a part of this vigilante hacker group?

It’s this lack of any semblance of realism and an underlying unwillingness to take any of the gameplay seriously that causes the game to start to lose me. This is especially true when one factors in that the actual plot is played very straight; the villain is painted to be extremely sinister and a side character even dies halfway through. Actually, let’s talk about those points for a moment. To address the latter one first, [spoiler]Horatio is killed off for no plot-related reason at all; it seems that someone decided that because Marcus, the playable character/main hero, is also black, some kind of misguided diversity quota was satisfied so Horatio is expendable? I mean, just… what [i]the f*ck?[/i][/spoiler] In fairness, Watch Dogs also killed off a character rather needlessly near the end, too, but such a fate was basically set in stone for that character given prior plot developments. As for the villain, his nickname being “The Douche” should clue you in to the fact that he’d be more at home as a villain in The Big Lebowski instead, but alas, here we are with this guy who has a man-bun, way too much facial hair, the attitude of a class bully, and (count ‘em) FOUR fit-bits.

I’m going to ask that you indulge me a little bit as I rant about my subjective dislike of Watch Dogs 2’s aesthetic. To paint an image of how inescapable the coating of ridiculousness was, here is a personal anecdote: I was fast-travelling from clothing store to clothing store, running from clothing item to clothing item, looking for some kind of serious wardrobe to wear (preferably a coat of sorts), but all I could find were plain hoodies, leather kuttes that were way too revealing, sagging pants, and preppy button-ups with (I kid you not) bowties. The one long coat to be found in Watch Dogs 2 was Aiden’s original one from the previous game, clearly more for purposes of parody than homage when you consider they didn’t even bother to make available a fedora that matches it in color. And the wardrobe issues are not even at the top of the list; the main characters act like idiots because, well, they’re stupid kids, but it’s kind of difficult to see these vigilante hackers as capable professionals if they behave unprofessionally damn near all the time. If I can’t even take my playable character, my proxy, the way in which I interface with this vast simulation, let alone any of the supporting cast, remotely seriously, how am I supposed to consider anything that happens in the plot that the game demands be taken seriously with any measure of dramatic weight? 

And in spite of all my ranting about aesthetic choices in Watch Dogs 2, it’s the absent character drama that is easily the problem most pertinent to me. To be fair, it does have a couple emotional moments, but these mainly exist in a vacuum. Watch Dogs has serious dramatic roots that fit with its gritty, crime-noir elements; it stands on its own as a genre piece about mobsters and corporations, injustice and vengeance, but it also functions as a neat character piece showing just how tortured the majority of the characters are. It’s dark and not at all funny. It’s deeply sad and steeped in a world of crime simultaneously unseen yet tolerated and abused by those in power. It’s brimming with rage at the unfairness of a broken city said to be a utopia and gateway to the future.

What happened to all those emotions? Where did all that anger go?

One may counter with the following question: “I’m here to play a game. If the gameplay itself is actually decent, why bother caring about things like story or emotion?” And that’s a fair point; if there’s one thing I learned in all of this, it’s that I probably enjoy films more than games, and, like all games, Watch Dogs 2 should be considered a game first. But I would argue that Watch Dogs 2 does not commit to this prioritization either; just the (very strong) possibility that one could play lethally in a game where dumb kids do dumb things in a dumb world to thwart dumb plans and nobody would ever care about the human cost involved in their actions goes to show that this is a game that is very confused about what it wants to be. Part of me wishes that Watch Dogs 2 was a dramatic tale about actually confused kids trying to find their way in the world while also working up the courage to stop a corrupt corporation. If the game had stuck to that creative vision, it would have (ironically) been less confused about what it is and how it would play.",1657852329,1657852329,False,3,0,0.527681350708007813,0,True,False,False

I was not nearly as big of a critic of the first Watch Dogs game as most seemed to be. I thought the city was beautiful to walk around in (""BUT THE GRAPHICS WEREN'T AS GOOD AS THEY PROMISE"" shut up, they were fine.) and I enjoyed the story. Now I know that's where a lot of people took issue with the original Watch Dogs. They think that Aiden talked too much about getting revenge for his niece, that he wouldn't lighten up. I mean, I think it's reasonable to be a bit vindictive after someone kills your young niece, but whatever.

Although apparently the directors for Watch Dogs 2 took that message to heart. Seeing as how in Watch Dogs 2 you play as this nerdy but supposedly funny psuedo-justice warrior that, inbetween getting wasted on the beach, going to burning man to cheer up, and nerding out over a new cheesy movie with his friends, likes to solve the social problems of our world by playing ""sick pranks"" on the evil corporate masterminds. That includes tricking a Pharma CEO into spending a million dollars on a new rap album that doesn't exist, or stealing the prop car for a new movie that is making fun of hackers and taking it on a joy ride around San Fransisco. And the most bewildering part of these pranks is that you are murdering between 1-10 security guards and cops just so you can pull off your dope pranks. It makes no sense! They aren't some gang bangers who are selling crack to the youth of SF, they're just some blue color employee who get gunned down by a meme slinging hacker who is just looking to have fun. It completely ruins any sort of immersion for me. 

And here I can say one positive thing about the game, the map is also very pretty, but that's about it... The game has the same subpar gunplay and driving mechanics that were in the first Watch Dogs game, and aside from the addition of some gimmicky remote controlled cars and helicopters, the hacking mechanics are pretty much the same.

Like it said, I just want my perspective out there, I know this game is receiving much higher reviews than its predecessor, but for those out there that enjoyed the original Watch Dogs, be wary about this purchase.",1486022217,1657596716,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Copy paste this on review on every ubisoft game you can find. Regardless of the game, this is a relevant reason to AVOID ALL UBISOFT GAMES:

Starting September 2022, Assassin's Creed Liberation will not only be removed from the Steam store, but inaccessible to play for players who have already bought it.

This comes in light of a series of announcements from Ubisoft who announced that they have decided to shut down multiplayer servers for many of their older games. Most notably in addition to this they have decided, regarding the DLC for many of these games, instead of treating them as abandonware they are making them inaccessible to the players who have already bought them. Welcome to modern gaming, everyone, and happy 15th anniversary to Assassin's Creed.

It's a shame, too. Because I think this is the best of the Watch Dogs games, but how can I recommend this to anyone when I dont know if they'll shut it down tomorrow.

Where this game specifically differs is in how the mediocrity is achieved - not through everything being in itself mediocre, but with the game not knowing what it's supposed to be, as the parts are great, but the sum is lesser than them.

Before even starting the game, there is one big problem that plagues Watch_Dogs 2. I hate Uplay, and I suspect most people do, but the bigger problem with this game specifically and many other games that came out post-2016 from Ubisoft is that it's region-locked, and so if you've bought the game from China or a CIS country, the language is specifically locked to either Chinese or Russian, including the voice acting (I've only heard this, and haven't experienced a locking to Chinese or Russian voice acting myself, so don't quote me on this), which is notably worse than the English performances. This disregards the fact that many people in CIS countries do not speak Russian or do not speak it to a reasonable extent so as to play the game. Foreigners living in CIS countries and China will also be at a disadvantage. There is a workaround, but while it's pretty easy to do, this shouldn't be a problem in the first place.

Watch_Dogs 2 does look good, though. It's a technically impressive game with a whole load of graphical options, and that's kind of what Ubisoft is known for, making good-looking games that are more tech demos than anything. San Francisco is an absolute joy to look at, and the city's landmarks are all there, gorgeously modeled and textured. The animation is also great in cutscenes, and the art direction is good at capturing the more lighthearted tone of the narrative as well as the more sunny city of San Francisco. The performances are also top-notch, with great voice actors given bad material to work with. The design in terms of sound and art hits the mark exactly, creating an atmosphere that sufficiently fits what the game's going for.

The same really cannot be said about the gameplay, seeing as it tries to do something interesting by including dynamic and systemic gameplay, but doesn't really go far enough. You'll see seamless transitions from singleplayer to multiplayer, as well as nice dynamic shootouts between different factions that you can actually influence, but nothing goes far enough as to actually make the systems affect the gameplay in an extremely meaningful way. The multiplayer missions are pretty bad, and with the game effectively being dead in terms of multiplayer - you'll see people around but they won't really play with you - the multiplayer missions are pretty useless. The systems of faction wars also don't work as well - the gangs don't even expand or take territory, and there's not much change going on in them. At one point, I spent a long time calling gangs and police into a mission area that left a whole lot of people lying on the floor, and yet they never stopped coming - every few minutes, someone from the faction that held the mission area would call for reinforcements, and since I didn't really bother to care about reinforcements, the entire manpower of that faction must have been completely sucked out of them. The game does give you a lot of gadgets like the Quadcopter or Jumper, two drones you can remote control, and that's great, and there's a whole lot of environmental objects that you can interact with, but eventually, the missions they're used in just bog down to scoping out the area through cameras or drones, hacking a key, hacking physically through sending the Jumper in, and then getting out. Combat as a gameplay style is also very much disincentivized through your health being really low - a few shots and you're going to have to go back to the last checkpoint. The challenge presented by the game can also be easily worked around - there's an ability you can get pretty early that simply allows you to disable security features like motion-sensors or bots, and there are get-out-of-jail-free cards like Mass Distract, which distracts everyone for a generous time window, or the fact that you can get out of a police chase by just going off-road for a bit and hiding in your car. While the level design is good for the main missions, you won't really get that out of the side missions, and some of the missions are so laughably easy or hard given your abilities.

Open-world design is, however, significantly better here than in other Ubisoft games. By removing the entire thing going on about radio towers and liberating areas, the entirety of San Francisco is open to you at the start, allowing you to explore. The side quests are also much better than in other Ubisoft games, and most of them you come across organically. There are also a few restricted areas in the open world that do not have any impact in the story and instead have money or tech tree points in them, and the fact that Ubisoft doesn't guide you to any of these is also great, in contrast to camp design in their other games. In this I feel like Ubisoft has really hit something - diverting from its standard open-world formula for something not too radically different, but still interesting. My main problem with the open world is that it feels absolutely soulless while walking through the streets - it's San Francisco, but it feels like a small town in a way because of the lack of population, and what population is there doesn't do much besides react to your actions and maybe serving as an easy way to get botnet, the ""mana"" used for hacking. The driving is also horrible, and the cars feel like they're lighter than a sack of feathers as they glide around while driving.

The writing is the only other part of the game that I feel is unequivocally mediocre at best. There are absolutely no consequences whatsoever to anything in the game - you take down megacorporations and they don't even bat an eye, you're made public enemy #1 and no one comes after you. One of the characters even dies at some point, and even that is disconnected from the main story and you don't even feel anything for them. The characters are hollow, their personalities only there to be vehicles for terrible jokes that differ in tone from what's actually going on in the game with corporate greed. Watch_Dogs 2 seems to have an addiction to joking around even when it doesn't fit with what's going on. These characters are insanely one-dimensional - Marcus is just the protagonist, a blank slate with no motivation pr backstory other than the fact that he hates Silicon Valley. Wrench, despite having the potential for a character arc through his lack of self-confidence towards women, can be summed up as just ""a weird guy who likes to make references"". Josh is just ""the autistic guy"", Sitara is ""the video-maker and also kind-of the de-facto leader?"", Horatio is pretty much nonexistent as a character, and Ray, who you might recognize as T-Bone in the first game, is just ""the old guy who incidentally also likes to make bad jokes"". The main villain is also surprisingly absent and doesn't really affect the story that much besides one encounter with him in the mid-game as well as the ending - he's just the quintessential Ubisoft villain, with a charismatic and ruthless charm. I will admit that the performances are great, and that the voice actors deserve serious props - otherwise, the story is very much hollow.

Because Steam has to have you make your review either a positive or a negative one, I'll lean towards the negative here. Watch_Dogs 2 has a lot of charm, yes, and it is fun, but it is essentially a hollow game. This isn't helped at all by the price tag, which even now, many years after release, is still high.",1656753864,1657453816,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

End Remarks: The experience was amazing. The environment, ambience, and everything made San Francisco feel like the real thing, it felt really alive. With the NPC dialogue to the buildings, it very nicely depicts the Bay Area. The gameplay is really addictive but sometimes challenging (good). The parkour is really really really neat and the best of the Watch Dogs series. There are 2 cons: Ubisoft and the story. As Ubisoft, there is the weird online feature (which I do not like) where random people join your singleplayer game and can mess around and kill you. The second is the story. The story is meh. It's average at best. I feel like it is too comedic at times and is very predictable. But overall, it's an excellent game and definitely worth buying.",1656353501,1656353501,True,2,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

It's more of an empty husk of a game, with cool hacking mechanics, a very sad sack, poor man's version of GTA.
The story is basically non-existent
The game objectives are arbitrary in that it's mostly a matter of going from point a to point b and holding E.
and why make all of these non-lethal weapons? I can't see any point to that other than a cheap attempt at mimicry of other games for the sake of mimicry. I can't help but suspect some californian liberal idiots came into the room and demanded the the devs make the game become lethal ""because guns are bad"" ...stupid.
The characters and dialog are shallow and empty
The movement and combat mechanics outside of the hacking and tool usage are just badly designed, especially compared to the first game.

This game would have been infinitely better if it was just a sequel to the Aiden Pearce experience in Chicago, but instead they had to very badly reinvent the wheel retaining none of the quality.
Do NOT buy this game. GTA is much better if you're into that kind of thing.",1655749391,1655749391,False,1,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The more lighthearted and comedic tone is a weird direction to go after the first game, but I think it works. It features a pretty likable cast of characters. Both the main protagonists and main antagonists are interesting and fun to interact with and have managed to keep me captivated with the story. My main problem is it's a Ubisoft game. As always with Ubisoft games, they become huge slogs to go through. I couldn't finish the game because it became way too tedious to play. While I think the gameplay isn't that bad, I can't really recommend the game and I will probably never go back to it.

Graphics - 5 - I'm not a picky person when it comes to graphics. This game looks great to me and has aged well so far.

Gameplay - 3 - I find the mechanics pretty good and have had fun using them. Although the drones can be a bit irritating to use and the hacking sequences have camera problems which can also be annoying. This game tries to be a stealth game, however it seems like the best option most of the time is to just cap motherfuckers with your high-powered weapons. The multiplayer is very fun and enjoyable to play and the missions are pretty decent if a bit repetitive. The later story missions are downright infuriating and is the main reason I stopped playing however.

Enjoyment - 3.5 - I quite enjoyed my time in multiplayer and singleplayer before it was just a chore to play. If I didn't play with friends, this score would be even lower.

Total - 11.5/15

Pros:

Game looks beautiful, particularly when driving.

Hacking skills and tactics are cool, bamboozling the enemy is satisfying.

Genuinely profound commentary on corporate interference, privacy violations, and big tech abuse. 

Wrench.

Cons:

The story is so... nothing. Villain is generic, several plot elements end without warning or are never pursued. Several mechanics just have zero purpose (why have lethal and nonlethal weapons when there is no morality or karma system?) Strange, cringeworthy dialog... you aren't playing this for the story.

World is empty and meaningless. None of the many restaurants, pawn shops or clothing stores have unique items or services. All the world does is take up space between you and various interactive objectives.

Boring, repetitive quests. Go here, hold ""e"" on this object. That's 60% of the game. 

This is just me personally, but I hate Key Data. Essentially, if you want to unlock certain skills in the skill tree, you have to find key data in certain locations throughout the map. The placement of these items are totally arbitrary. There was no reason to add key data other than to pad the game out and make unlocking skills a slow, grindy experience. 

Most weapons aside from the grenade launchers and shotguns lack impact. 

This is such a nothing game. A really cool, stylish first 20 hours and a fun last 5 hours, and the most boring, meaningless 30+ hours in between. Play Orwell, Metal Gear, Hitman, any of those.

Pros:
- Goldilocks map size (not too big, not too small)
- Hacking civilians was less of a chore ( i hated the random missions you got on WD1, just tedious)
- The game ran great for me and loaded quickly (3070ti / 5600x)
- Unobtrusive multiplayer elements
- Decent gun play, controls are responsive, some of the mapping is a little weird
- GREAT music. Decent graphics.
- Voice acting, characters and storing all held their own IMO.
- Many of the side quest lines are unique and enjoyable.
- The collectibles are worth doing for the skill unlocks and cosmetics.
- The cosmetics are WAAAAAYYYY better than WD1, you can actually dress your character.
- The RC drone / car add some nice puzzle elements and variety to fights / secure areas.

Cons:
- I actually would have preferred they picked a path with the main character. If he's a good guy that doesn't do violence, why do I have a grenade launcher? Would liked to have seen more development on the non- lethal side of combat. 
- The RC stuff was kinda shallow.
- AI is still so DUMB. Holy cow they are so bad times its funny. No challenge really.
- The animation for the take down is ridiculous with how long it takes.
- No car mods / upgrades. Too many of the cars feel samey. Also you're almost immortal in vehicles.
- With no fail states for most missions, some of them still just devolve into killing everybody so I can just leave. 
- Not enough missions w/ cars and boats
- A little buggy here and there (my phone menu disappeared after I beat the main story and I had to Alt F4 out)
- Some of the node hacking is comically spread out and it starts to feel tedious.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this game, especially over WD1 (just an opinion). If you can, get the bundle and play both.

Story
It's definitely fun, the story is cool although I would have liked to see the original lead. I relate heavily to the whole ""Down with the man"" killing corporate greed vibes. The art is sick and has it's own punk style.

Mechanics
Tons of fun, however slightly easier than regular GTA-like games because of the addition of hacking. Often I just wouldn't use it if I am mucking about but getting rid of cops while doing story is very easy and when you catch the cutscene just right, it is satisfying to see a cop headbutt a pole or get T-boned in traffic.

I was laughing at the start of this game, just like the last installment, but this time it was because of the actions of Marcus. After the tutorial mission, Marcus gets plastered drunk, throws his phone into the ocean, then wakes up the next morning hungover, without pants, in someone else's house, and somehow he got a new phone in the process despite throwing it into the ocean the night before. Marcus then meets the members of DedSec, all of which bring their own special ingredient to the table.
Wrench: Comic relief. Love him and the mask.
Sitara: Branding artist. For some reason has beef with another character.
Horatio: I enjoyed the interactions between Marcus and Horatio. Both of them being black, they naturally get along quickly.

If you're curious about the Watch Dogs series but short on time, I recommend just playing this one. It's unfairly forgotten because it's bookended by more controversial games (WD1 and WD Legion), but I think it's the best of the bunch for a lot of reasons. Rather than a true review I'll just try to convince you why WD2 is the one worth playing, since this is a well-known series anyway.

This game doesn't get enough credit for subverting a lot of the typical Ubisoft tropes and cliches. For example, the entire game's map is available to you from the start with nothing held back -- no tower climbing or busywork needed. You can just jump straight into the game and enjoy it. And your mileage may vary on the characters and dialogue, but I personally think it's better than the majority of Ubisoft games. It's lighthearted, funny, and weirdly self aware. Even among the trio of Watch Dogs games, WD2 stands out with regards to both of these things: the gameplay and writing are really good.

I think the fun of the Watch Dogs series is the ""puzzle box"" design of the missions and open-ended gameplay, and WD2 is where this is at its best. Scouting out a mission with the quadcopter and buggy and then sneaking around for non-lethal stun gun takedowns is gratifying and awesome. Aiden Pearce's toolkit in WD1 is much more limited, and you're pretty much forced to hide and get pistol headshots; WD2 is where the fun of using your gadgets and hacking/manipulating the environment really comes into play. To top this off, in WD Legion, the follow up to this game, a lot of these hacking abilities were removed or simplified, which is a real letdown.

Lastly to comment on WD2's aesthetic, it's a colorful parody of Silicon Valley culture. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think that's to the game's benefit. Also, you can call a SWAT team on an NPC for making of your shirt if you want to. What's not to love about that?",1653937390,1653937469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't
-Gameplay is amazing. I love the hacking mechanic, you feel so bad-ass when your in a police chase and you take out a cop car with press of a button or you clear an entire hostile area with just your drone.
-Movement, driving mechanics are solid, aswell as enemy AI. They are all feel finely tuned and seem all round well implemented.
-The controls are well thought out and not anything like other games where your throwing up gang signs pressing keys just to open a door. Instead all the keys you need are easy to press and remember, start playing and soon hacking will be second nature.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich guy
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
-On low settings a low spec pc can run it, but dont take my word, look at the min requirements to run the game on the store page (i watched the entirety of the credits, alot of work went in to finding those min specs)
---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
-Difficulty is very hard to assess since there are so many ways you can complete missions. For example, i prefer being stealthy and completing a task undetected (which can be quite challenging), but if you wanted to go into a mission all gung-ho without silenced weapons and with no care for being detected, you can. This also being very challenging and arguably more challenging than stealth since you have to worry about enemies calling back up and them shooting at you.
---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
-The only grind there really is, is for cash. Its not a big grind and will only require the player to visit say a few locations throughout the city to raise the funds for say a new weapon, but if you want a nice shiny new car to drive around in on your hacktivist escapades, then you will need to grind.
---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☑ Very Good *chefs kiss*
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
-I personally love the story. You follow a hacker who has just joined the infamous hacktivist group Dedsec, your mission, to bring down a corrupt CTO, and that's just the main story line... multiple side story lines watch the protagonist expose other corrupt organisations and public figures, throughout raising a boat load of questions about the ethical use of computers.
---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
-Pretty long. In the story there are multiple main story missions which progress the story (these will take about an hour), then you have side missions which take slightly less time to complete. Additionally there are other side quests/missions which are not vital to the story that you can complete.
---{ Bugs }--- 
☑ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ They're features
-Never really experienced any bugs except one time i got stuck on a physics object, but that was easily escapable.

Almost everything that was good about the first game makes a comeback here; smash-and-grab joyrides, duck-and-cover tactical missions, parkouring all over a major city looking for collectibles. The online community is here, too, with PvP hacking missions, co-op play, and even online vehicle and drone racing. Ubisoft has also added to the mix, giving players weird side missions like Instagraming at San Francisco's many points of interest or Ubering people around.
Much like DI:R, this game should be just as good, if not better, than its predecessor, since it keeps all the good things and adds to them. And yet, something is missing. It's all enjoyable but it feels stunted somehow. And then it hits you; it's all about the story. Watch_Dogs had a fairly interesting main story about the interconnections of modern hackers, old-school mobsters, and corrupt politics, all riding on the back of a giant tech corporation that makes operating systems. The sequel tries to do the same, this time with all of Silicon Valley being entangled with street gangs, corrupt politicians, dirty cops, and even more hackers working with or for the various ""bad guys"". Aiden Pierce was an tragic character who was stumbled across a dirty secret and was pulled into a fight with conspiring forces and being aided by hackers who open up his mind; Marcus Holloway is just some dude who wanted to join a group of woke hackers and anarchists and stick it to the man. It's not horrible, it's just....the most basic form of rehash without the emotional depth that helps someone connect to the main character.
Mind you, if you like GTA-style games, you'll have a good time playing the game. It's smooth, it's pretty, it's got some cool gadgets (namely a drone and a tiny RC bot on wheels that both offer creative alternatives to shooting everything to complete a mission), extensive unlockable outfit, car, and weapon customisation options, and, obviously, just as much hacking as the first game. The apparently repeatable online missions might even keep you playing the game for a few hours after completing the main story, side-missions, and collectibles. This is a game I definitely recommend, just with a note that it's marginally not better than its predecessor.",1652860572,1652860572,True,6,0,0.529380440711975098,0,True,False,False

I think this game probably defines a £10 AAA game if there ever was such a thing.

A stealth hacking game with fun hacking mechanics on paper.
Devolved into a game where
There's no dedicated crouch button, only most objects have been designated to hide behind, meaning for some objects you cant hide against.
There's no jump button also, only dedicated objects that allow you to jump
AI that means you can win any mission by walking in, shooting 1 enemy, having the cops get called on you, escaping from them, and walking in to an empty baron level.
Infiltration missions where you have to infiltrate with a little robot with nothing unique of risky going on for it. Other than the 60s you will have to wait doing nothing as they have a respawn timer if you get spotted controlling the robot

I have two 100% runs on PS4 and Xbox, so don't get distracted by my Playtime on here.

First off: The Music
W_D2 has a nice score made for the Game itself, but the Copyrighted music just stands out. I am so glad that this Game has a Mediaplayer so I can make a banger Playlist of the Ingame songs. Songs like ""San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)"" or ""I want a new Dr*g"" are just soooo good. 

The Graphics are pretty Standard. I mean it's a 2016 game, it's nothing we haven't seen before but it sure ain't ugly either. Especially now that I am on PC, I can embrace the Vibe of SF even more with Ultra Settings and 100+ FPS.

The Movement and the animations are beautiful, they're definitely the best in the Series. I mean, even the backflips off of random power boxes are so satisfying.

The Story ain't special by itself, but the setting and the characters that are involved make me like it so much. I mean, one of the first missions is to [spoiler] drive a Vehicle like K.I.T.T from Knight Rider around the City while listening to Turbo Lover by Judas Priest and being chased by Police [/spoiler] how cool is that??

The Characters are stereotypes, I have to admit that, but they're just so damn likeable? Like, Wrench is [spoiler] your typical  Anarchist that pretends to be cool, mysterious and untouchable, but in the end he's just as vulnerable as anyone else. A scared kid that doesn't really know his place in the world. [/spoiler] . Josh is [spoiler] the classic introvert that slowly becomes more confident as the story progresses [/spoiler] etc. etc.

The Customization is really good, but sadly it lacks the possibility to change your hair or beard. Besides that, there are many, many clothing options which you can try out. 

The Missions are fun. I can't think of one single Mission that I don't like tbh. Even the sidemissions are good! 
I can't really complain about variety of playstyle, since most missions can be played however you like to play.

The driving. I mean, it's Ubisoft. Do I have to say more? I guess so.
They were never good at making a decent Driving Experience. Wether it's Watch Dogs or Ghost Recon, the driving is whacky af. One of the only negative points that I have to aknowledge. Maybe even the only major one.

The Drone and Jumper features are a great addition to the game. They make Stealth even more approachable for new players that aren't skilled in Sneaky playstyles, but also give you a chance to execute a perfectly thought out Plan.

The Weapons all kinda feel the same, but there is a good amount to choose from. From Designs to the weapons themselves, everyone should find something that suits the personal taste. 

I might be a little biased, I have to admit, since it's my Fav game for years now. But, I deeply recommend Watch Dogs 2 with all of my heart. If you didn't like the first one because of the tone, the lack of Variety in Hacking or whatever it was, I promise you that W_D2 is at least worth a try. Like Titanfall 2, it flew underneath the Radar in 2016 and that's such a shame.

That being said you have to install Ubisoft Connect and jump through all of their hoops in order to play.
Is Ubisoft Connect down? Can't sign in and you can't play.
Did you set up 2fa? No? They say you did and won't let you sign in unless you input the 2fa code or recovery code they never sent you.
The fact Ubisoft makes you jump through pointless hoops just to launch a game you already payed for and installed is atrocious, stupid, short-sighted, etc.
I have already payed you and installed the game but now I have to install another separate piece of software and sign in through that every time just to play?
IDK what Ubisoft gets out of it but it must be worth it considering they are a constant annoyance everytime you launch the game and they don't care at all.

in short: Watchdogs 2 = Decent Game UbiSoft Connect = Terrible, annoying gatekeeper that serves no purpose other than to take up space and get in you way.

Almost everything that was good about the first game makes a comeback here; smash-and-grab joyrides, duck-and-cover tactical missions, parkouring all over a major city looking for collectibles. The online community is here, too, with PvP hacking missions, co-op play, and even online vehicle and drone racing. Ubisoft has also added to the mix, giving players weird side missions like Instagraming at San Francisco's many points of interest or Ubering people around.
Much like DI:R, this game should be just as good, if not better, than its predecessor, since it keeps all the good things and adds to them. And yet, something is missing. It's all enjoyable but it feels stunted somehow. And then it hits you; it's all about the story. Watch_Dogs had a fairly interesting main story about the interconnections of modern hackers, old-school mobsters, and corrupt politics, all riding on the back of a giant tech corporation that makes operating systems. The sequel tries to do the same, this time with all of Silicon Valley being entangled with street gangs, corrupt politicians, dirty cops, and even more hackers working with or for the various ""bad guys"". Aiden Pierce was an tragic character who was stumbled across a dirty secret and was pulled into a fight with conspiring forces and being aided by hackers who open up his mind; Marcus Holloway is just some dude who wanted to join a group of woke hackers and anarchists and stick it to the man. It's not horrible, it's just....the most basic form of rehash without the emotional depth that helps someone connect to the main character.
Mind you, if you like GTA-style games, you'll have a good time playing the game. It's smooth, it's pretty, it's got some cool gadgets (namely a drone and a tiny RC bot on wheels that both offer creative alternatives to shooting everything to complete a mission), extensive unlockable outfit, car, and weapon customisation options, and, obviously, just as much hacking as the first game. The apparently repeatable online missions might even keep you playing the game for a few hours after completing the main story, side-missions, and collectibles.

San Francisco is the new setting of the game, and it serves as one of the best open world maps in any game I ever played. The city is just full of life and seems like every NPC in it walking the streets has a purpose. People are working out, walking dogs, doing martial arts at the park, they do yoga, they greet each other on the streets, they sit around under a tree chatting, they talk on the phone, get into car crashes, play guitar, go shopping and the list just goes on and on. There is never a boring scene anywhere, and I often just spend time walking around doing parkour, and exploring all the sights and sounds. There are side missions but they dont feel like side mission and if you do them all you will find your time was not wasted. I could write about this game for hours, but I rather go back and play it now. All in all, it is an amazing sandbox experience with great action, smooth driving, cool parkour and an excellent story.

It is an open world Ubisoft game, so you should know what you're getting into. And for the most part it does function quite well. The driving is still as good as the first one, and it does enough different to make it a sequel rather than ""Watch Dogs 1 but a bit more"". The RC Jumper and the Drone really do put a spin on things and tickles some Puzzle Solving jolts in a different way. I never found it too hard, and it does allow you to play your own way. Though 'Stealth' did seem to suffer during the transition from the first game, whereas enemies detect you significantly faster. And sometimes killing someone with a (silenced) headshot alerts the entire base.

It's the Theme, story, and main character that really start throwing me off though:

The Theme - I never really cared for Dedsec in WD1. The deep voice, the videos, the graffiti style, it all didn't appeal to me. The fact that your ""Experience"" bar is replaced by (Online) Followers... I mean, it's kinda clever for a game and it does make sense in a story/lore standpoint. So Kudos on them for that. Honestly? I think I'm either just too old for this theme, or it's just not for me. It's not terrible nor does it make the game unplayable, but I was getting vibes of ""Looking back at your teenage/high school years and what you thought was COOL back then, then groaning as result."" If you're fine with the cheese, go for it. To each their own, but I'm not a cheesy person.

The Story - A lot more light-hearted this time around, often enough your missions are ""let's stick it to the man!"" style of teen rebellion. Overall the story itself is fine, it does have its flaws, but I easily put it below WD1's more serious story/warning of the dangers of technology. Sure, WD2 does touch on it as well, but... It didn't feel quite the same. I'm having a hard time placing a claw on exactly what it is.

Characters - I didn't like them at first, but they grew on me. It got to the point where I was playing the story/side stories to see what they would say or do- especially Wrench. Wrench was just the best by far. But I even grew to care for Josh and some of the other side characters, having a bit of a soft spot for the Autistic and Transgender. I honestly felt like they did them well.

But Marcus/Retr0/your main character... Don't get me wrong, his VA did a great job. But the guy is suuuuuch a Gary Sue: I never spotted a weakness in him through the entire game. He was good at everything, friendly to everyone, capable in any situation, remained cool under pressure- the list goes on. There was no flaw to be found anywhere. It's nice to have the very wholesome moments with the other members of Dedsec, but Marcus never seemed to have his down moments. Aiden was a lot more of a complex character dealing with a lot of heavy weight, he may not have been everyone's cup of tea but... Marcus just kinda felt like a generic flavor to please everyone. ""The Safe Option."" Not bad, and several thousand times better than a silent protagonist, but they could've put a little bit more into his side of the story.

That final mission was pretty cool though (no spoiling). WD1's still felt more satisfying, but WD2's final one was a good idea.

Overall, I do recommend the game for sure. Just... Know what you're getting into.

Also: if you're like me and just want to play the game 100% on single player/offline; look into mods. Just getting any mod (like ""skip the intro bumpers"") is enough to keep your game offline and not have to worry about people suddenly joining in. Seriously Devs: ALWAYS give the player the option to turn this jazz off.",1651600554,1651600554,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay has had definite improvements over the first one, and that's the main reason for why it's worth buying.
The story is completely forgettable.
It's unoptimized for whatever reason, using any sign of anti aliasing makes the framerate drop way more than it should on a 1080.
It still lags on a 3060ti, and the cpu usage is constantly at 100% on a 6700k, when the recommended one is a i5 3470. It must be one of the least optimized games I've ever seen (especially since I saw how ""well"" it runs on a 3090).

But I'll be damned if ""Watch Dogs 2"" is not an incredible game. I think I like it more than ""GTA V"" (I definitely like the characters better).

When I first played this game, I didn't love it so much, for I felt it was a little too grindy: the missions felt all the same. Go to a place, kill people, retrieve data, repeat. The story was strong, and so were the characters and the writing. The gameplay was fabulous, but the missions themselves were repetitive. Once I concluded the game, I moved on to other interests... but I couldn't help but to remember the game every once in a while. The characters, the dialogues, the moments... it was a lasting experience in that regard.

So, I decided to play the game again. And let me tell you, it becomes much better when you approach it for what it is: a stealth game. A game where you have to use all of the resources at your disposal before going for the gun. Because once you grab the gun... the game becomes boring.

Now, just to clarify, I've never actually played the infamous first game. There was so much bad publicity around it... I felt it wasn't worthy of my money (maybe I'll give it a go during a sale; maybe it's not that bad). But anyway, what I mean with this is that I'll be judging this game for what it is, without holding it to what its predecessor did.

As a stealth game, you have to think your next moves very carefully. And that sense of staying out of the sight of your enemies is what makes the game more gripping: the point of all your tools is to help you stay hidden and distract guards. And each mission becomes more challenging that way.

Unfortunately, the game seems to be always online, and I can't enjoy it for too long before someone jumps into my session and starts hacking me. The game also has this thing of designating the Esc button as a be-all, end-all key: it doesn't just pause the game. It also closes gadgets and skips dialogues. This may have been a way the developers found to make for more intuitive commands... but sometimes I forget about it and I end up skipping a dialogue or quitting a gadget just when I wanted to pause the game.

But otherwise, the game is great: it's beautiful looking, decently optimised (nothing like ""GTA V"", however) and its world is very immersive and realistic. The game also felt to me as a love letter to San Francisco itself: it really goes for broke in replicating the city's culture, history and architecture. And even if it's not as sprawling as other open world maps, the city has enough activities to keep you busy for a time.

Some of its puzzles are actually quite fun to complete, while others can be frustrating - you may need to have the proper tools before tackling them, but the game wouldn't tell you.

Last but certainly not least, there's the soundtrack. It's just one of the greatest game soundtracks I've heard in these last years - because the game is about computing and hacking, the original soundtrack goes for electronic music, which suits the game very well. Right from the start, you'll be mesmerised by the game's menu/pause theme.

Also, the radio music selection is great, with some very original choices. The game even allows players to do playlists, but it has this rather strange mechanic in which you can only carry songs with you once you ""unlock"" them with this Shazam-like app. I bet this sounded cool among the developers, but it's a nuisance.

It's very much a flawed gem of a game, that is rough around the edges, but that shines brightly nonetheless. I know that Ubisoft today may not deserve our consideration, but this game surely does, so get it on a sale. The game could have done what ""Dishonored"" did, by giving gamers different endings depending on their playstyle - that would really encourage them to go for stealth, rather than gunfire.",1572056142,1648428493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautiful open world that is just the correct size so that it doesn't feel too big or too small. 
Driving is okay. Its arcadey but thats fine.

Story is the worst aspect of this game. It seems to be just a bunch of loose ""hacking"" scenarios stiched up together to make something of a plot. I can't tell who is worse-the protagonists or the antagonists. Both are equally terrible and think they're some sort of messiahs that have come to save the common man but in the process just ruins everyone's lives anyway. Bad guys are forgettable and seem to exist only to move forward the plot and has no real connection to the protagonists. The hackers are just walking, talking personalities who do their best to get on your nerves. 

TL;DR : Don't play this game for the story or characters. Play it if you think the hacking mechanics are cool because they definitely are even though they are unrealistic.

There were some minor bugs and occasionally some mechanics don't really click and the game forces you to use the intended solution, straight out blocking you from any ""creative"" attempts (usually not even that creative. Many missions could be completed just by the remote drone, but the game insists Marcus goes there personally.) The main characters are painted as a group of geeky hackers trying to expose lies and crimes of big corporations, but in reality, they are a terrorist organization with a huge body count, fighting the big corpo. More pacifist options would be nice.

The Good:
- Acceptable gunplay with a surprisingly nuanced cover system.
- Multiplayer can be fun when it works.
- A couple cute character moments.

The Bad:
- Awful, inconsistent stealth and detection systems.
- Multiplayer frequently doesn't work and is plagued by cheaters when it does
- Token/pointless progression systems
- Tons of bugs
- No difficulty
- No room for creativity or skill expression in gameplay
- Boring open world objectives and collectathons
- Mission design that is at best lazy, and more often terrible
- Lame, stereotypical characters with little to no depth
- Poor story with poor pacing
- Such an intense obsession with political correctness that the game circles back around into bigotry with outright sexism, racism, and mocking views of the disabled in its attempts to be diverse.
- Hypocritical messages, and inconsistent morality.",1546288613,1646980750,False,11,1,0.18639037013053894,0,True,False,False

-only 3 weapons can be equipped instead of always having whatever weapon you picked up or bought

-very small crashes from traffic lights compared to the first watch dogs

-blackout is now blockout

-no more crafting for different special items

-no enemies icons to display what specialty they are

-way too many enemies can call for reinforcements and you cant disable them like you could in the first game. You either have to kill them or jam their comms to stun them

-non lethal traps that are a worse option over lethal in every way

-police are now GTA and teleport in front of you, which makes road hacking pretty pointless. Speaking of which, there less things on the road to hack. No underground garages, less road barriers, no spike traps and the ground transformers aren't on the road. And the traffic light crashes are so small I could never, and I do mean never, use it to stop the police. Compared to the first watch dogs, the traffic lights were so good at stopping the police cars, that at almost every stoplight, the game would give you a prompt to perfectly time a stoplight crash that would cause the cop cars to crash into other cars. You could even just cause one while passing through without timing perfectly and it would still be enough to slow the police down thanks to the car pile-up.",1630928470,1646522867,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I felt the need to start the review with a Retro (pun intended) quote from a very known famous hacker movie from the 90s. How else i was supposed to start this otherwise?

Damn, for the last few days i played this continuosly whenever i had time, it really glued onto me, i feel like a zombie because i decided that sleep is for pitiful mortals.
It's a scarily addictive game, with a very big open world with so much cool stuff to do, you never get bored. 
Ubisoft (I will have a rant at the beginning) always does manage to get really talented and creative people to work on their games, despite their awful treatment towards their customers.

If you played the first game and were unhappy with movement, car driving/handling, you will be very pleasantly surprised to know they really improved these things in WD2.
I honestly didn't expect it, but they fixed all that was wrong in the first game. Driving is a pure and smooth joy to do.

There's a lot to explore in the beautiful city of San Francisco, even if you got tired from seeing it in like 90% of Netflix's series and movies, exploring it in WD2 will be a delight.

All of that combined with lots of new gameplay features and elements create a very good gameplay experience that cannot possibily bore you out.

Difficulty is balanced, the leveling system is balanced, and one thing i loved about the game is that you can absolutely play it however you want, you can go guns blazing if that's your thing, although it will be hard, the game won't punish you, and the other characters in the game won't judge you.
If you decide to be a ghost, it will feel pretty rewarding, and as someone that loves anarchy and chaos, i was impressed by this aspect.

At times you will have to think out of the box, and figure things out. While it might be a bit frustrating, it will be worth it afterwards.

I really had a lot of fun in this game, there's simply a ton of fun activities to do besides the main mission, side missions and DLCs (Which i did all of 'em).

It has some really cool multiplayer features too, which you can disable if you really aren't into that, but before you do, give them a try. It's not a scary multiplayer system like in most games. It keeps things to a minimum, without much interaction, and it's perfect the way it is. I even found people randomly that helped me when i was stuck. And there's no chat either, so no griefing :)

Characters are well written (Love you, Wrench!), and while dialogues and some lines are a bit cringey and stupid, they're fun and feel pretty authentic.

Music is also very nice, you'll encounter good stuff from great names such as Culture Club, M|O|O|N, Prodigy, Naughty by Nature, Judas Priest, but also classics such as Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, if you're into that, and many other great artists and groups. They really did try to cover as many styles as possible.

Overall, story/gameplay, i absolutely recommend this game. It's tons of fun, with some interesting challenges, but properly balanced.

Now, the bad.

- Optimization is so bad, which, in my personal experience is like Ubi's artist signature. Game came out in 2016, and it's a lot worse optimized than Cyberpunk 2077
- Ubi has horrible practices when it comes to selling the game, basically a big middle finger to all the gamers and loyal customers. If you buy the game in CIS region, you only get Russian and Chinese languages. Trust me, almost nobody in Russia or CIS wants the localized version. These kinds of localizations are never good for an infinite numbers of reasons. It feels like a bootleg game. You can patch it, but it will take you a bit of time. But it's just awful to force people to use a BROKEN localization. If you are interested about this subject, Google around, people have been complaining about this ugly and bad business model of Ubi for years and years. Not to mention not everyone in the CIS region knows Russian (Although, the majority does).
- A ton of expensive DLCs, and they aren't really worth it. Feels like they wanted to milk the cow until she passed out and then they beat her with golf clubs.

Ubisoft hires amazing talent for writing, designing, and all the artistic stuff, but when it comes to coding or marketing, i swear to God, i think they hire people from Craigslist or something.
So, Ubi better make sure their artistic part of the company is treated properly, because if they'll walk away, Ubi will ultimately go down. They'll fall like the cow i mentioned above being thrown from a plane. 

Enough with cow analogies and random ramblings. 

Short version - Game is amazing, worth getting, everything that was awful and clunky in the first one is now fixed and things are smooth as butter.

Of course, the tone of the game was much more dreary (much like Chicago), but that doesn't take away from the fact that I had much more fun with this game. The little interactions between Marcus and anyone else was the absolute best. The voice actors in this game did a FANTASTIC job! 

If there's one gripe I have about the campaign, it would be about a major character's death halfway through the game. For me, they were my favorite character, so to have them be killed in such a way was nothing short of tragic and heartbreaking. Of course, it's not like I don't want the punishment of death to exist in the story. So for one mission, we track down their killers and dispose them, but after this mission, WE DON'T EVER MUTTER THEIR NAME EVER AGAIN!? They were such a homie, and the fact that no one in the story so much as mentions their name after the fact just makes me sadder. I would have thought that they would have at least had a statement like ""I wish xxx was here to see this"" tossed their way at the end of the game. But nope. They are just lost to the winds of time, never to be talked about again. Actually tragic.
