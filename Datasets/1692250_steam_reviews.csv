No DLC, nothing. I would of bought a DLC with all the circuits. 
I don't need updated driver names, teams etc. I just want to be able to drive on all the circuits in the F1 calendar.
I'm very dissapointed with EA for letting us down. Their greed is just huge, for selling a completely new game just to add 1-2 circuits. 
If they will launch a future F1 game with all the circuits, old and new, I'll buy it but the rating for this F1 22 will not change. It is a good game, but without updates is as good as dead now, only 2 years later.",1697911512,1709036556,False,0,0,0.635661125183105469,0,True,False,False

I play on 96 difficulty and I have been replaying this full race at Mexico over and over. The race starts off dry and goes to Intermediate, then full wets.  
I started 6th and got to P3 n about 25 laps. When the rains came I was dropping laptimes gradually and P1 and P2 (Max and Perez) were gaping me over a second a lap. 
The field closed up on two safety cars and by the second start my tyres were cold( 60c), even though i was frantically trying to get heat in them.
When the restart finally happened i was 20 seconds behind after 3 laps and illegally fending off the rest.
I had to replay the full length race 4 times now and each time the same. I have to forfeit the race and lose any hope of winning the championship. Hours of game play wasted. 
The Ai's tyres do not change at all no heat no wear, nothing. This is something i would expect from a game made in the 90's.
Will i be massive fool and by the next game and pray they fix this dumass game? yeah, probably.
Update; 
I didn't end up buying the new games (so far). Now that I have a Fanatec wheel and base I ended up playing mostly Asetta Corsa. Now that I am back, another observation is the long wait times for ""communicating with server"" over and over. Total pain in the butt when you want a quick race. 
As it is, I wont consider buying another F1 game until 2025, which is a shame, because I don't like F1, I love it. ",1685861192,1708237301,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tyres feel completely unconnected to the road and will randomly understeer or oversteer with zero warning. As others have mentioned the throttle input is completely oversensitive, and you'll spin out on corner exit constantly - again, with no warning. FP1 will have a 'green' track with no rubber down, which is realistic for real life, but unfortunately nobody told the other competitors, whose lap times don't suffer in any way.

The main problem for me is that it runs poorly. It does progress the series but not exactly in the right direction. F1 23 is 70% off as of writing this and I imagine will get cheaper with time; just go for that (Alonso is in a better car anyway).,1703811381,1703811381,False,9,0,0.633774876594543457,0,True,False,False

The game also doesn't run amazing I had a lot of fps issues but this may of been ironed out now, crashing and stuttering.

Also the controls weren't great, the feedback wasn't as responsive as other games, not sure if they changed anything or it's just I'm not a fan of this game. It's the same old F1 formula however so even if I'm being a bit harsh on this game, just buy F1 21 or F1 23 instead

This is the first F1 game I've played. I had so much fun racing and competing with other players also the AI was good for racing 🏎️.
I think the  terrible idea when they included a pointless mode in a racing game called F1 Life where you had to coordinate your room, i never used this section at all.

Here are some features that were present in the last two games (either in one of them or in both), but went extinct here: Real-season start, classic cars, story mode (braking point).
Instead of these we got some supercars, which we can only show off to our imaginary friends in F1 life and drive them in challenges and in time trial only. Meaning: we can't race them, which could be fun, but EA says no... Oh yeah, F1 life. This breathtaking new feature is absolutely pointless packed with microtransactions (to make your living quarters or what they're called look better, but you only see that in the menu when you boot up the game, that's it...)

Overall, for its current price it is absolutely not worth it, I bought it on a discount too, and I wouldn't recommend it if I wasn't a huge F1 fan. I can still play my team, which is the best gamemode, I can play online where an extremely high rate of races turn into a crash-fest immediately and I can play co-op career with my friend and absolutely bully the whole field and cause the funniest crashes ever.

Now I just used flashback cause I messed up and if the game is just going to mess me up after the flashback it basically screws you over. 
Now this is extra frustrating cause I play on full races.
Nothing like a range quit after the flashback screws you out of a 2nd place win after 73 laps!!!!!!",1702208690,1702208690,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Ladies and gentlemen, start your consoles! If you’ve ever dreamt of being a speed demon without leaving your comfy couch, the 2022 Official Formula 1 Game is your ticket to adrenaline-fueled, tire-squealing joyrides. Buckle up and read on for a review that might just make Lewis Hamilton reconsider retirement (okay, maybe not).

Graphics:
I mean, wow! The visuals are so crisp that I almost spilled my virtual energy drink thinking a tire was about to roll out of the screen. The cars look so shiny; I could practically see my reflection in them—though, that might just be the leftover pizza on my shirt.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is smoother than a freshly paved racetrack. It’s so immersive that I accidentally tried to change gears with my TV remote during a particularly intense race. The thrill of overtaking rivals at 300 km/h is almost as satisfying as finding extra fries at the bottom of the takeout bag.

Realism:
They weren’t kidding about realism! The developers must have borrowed some magic from the F1 engineers because the handling and physics feel spot-on. But let’s be real; I’d probably spin out on a straight road in real life, so kudos to the game for not letting me embarrass myself.

Career Mode:
Becoming an F1 legend is within reach—well, virtually at least. The career mode lets you rise from rookie driver to championship contender faster than it takes me to finish a tub of ice cream. Plus, negotiating contracts and managing team relationships is almost as tricky as explaining to my mom why I spent the whole weekend gaming.

Multiplayer:
If racing against AI isn’t thrilling enough, dive into multiplayer. But beware, it’s like entering a lion’s den full of competitive gamers who drive like they're being chased by a swarm of bees. You might win or end up using more expletives than the number of laps completed. It's all part of the fun, right?

Soundtrack:
The soundtrack is a symphony of engine roars and screeching tires. It's like Beethoven for petrolheads. I almost forgot I was sitting in my living room and not in the grandstands at Monza. Just remember to turn it down if you live in an apartment unless you want your neighbors to think there's an actual F1 race happening in your living room.

Overall, the 2022 Official Formula 1 Game is a must-have for racing enthusiasts and couch potatoes alike. It’s as addictive as grandma’s secret cookie recipe and as thrilling as bungee jumping—without the risk of a faceplant. Just remember to take breaks, hydrate, and occasionally venture into the real world. Who knows, maybe one day you'll graduate to racing actual cars. But until then, happy virtual racing, folks!

Graphics tend to improve with each iteration, aiming for a more realistic portrayal of the sport. This wasn't the case for the Drivers, they did them dirty to be honest, they don't look how they do in real like, Also it would been better to seen more animation when you win, not the same 3 animations and then you are showering the other on champagne their clothes doesn't get wet, and so on, the animations doesn't look well worked into. 

Gameplay and Controls: These games usually offer a balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for experienced players. The handling of cars, nuances of different tracks, and the overall feel of racing are significant aspects. Even tho I got issues while trying to connect my steering wheel and never got it to work, F1® 22 is very enjoyable with a controller but it would it been SO MUCH BETTER WITH A STEERING WHEEL!, when playing It would it been nicer to see the IA crash with the walls of the track or even with other drivers which this would make to pull out the safety car into the race, not go to a side of the race and disappear like nothing happen, I would love to see it more the track more ""alive"".

Career Mode and Features: F1® 22 includes a career mode where players can start as a rookie driver and progress through seasons, signing contracts, developing cars, and managing the team, The issue is that if you want to start on F2 there's no a lot to do, it will be less than 10 races and most likely after that you go to F1 races, so there's isn't much to do in F2. Also I would love to have a deeper customization while creating your own driver, like being able to create them from zero like how you do in other EA games (an example would be UFC), not having already pre-fabricated drivers which you can't customize other than the clothes, helmet, gloves, and car.

If you would like to a F1® game, don't end up wasting your money on F1® 22, just go and buy the F1® 23 which includes newer drivers and tracks or even just wait for F1® 24 and wait to see if they don't mess it up like they did with F1® 22",1669426859,1700573650,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know this got Mixed to Mostly Positive (recent) reviews (and yes does have some bugs somewhere, as they always do), but I honestly think this game is quite good. I only play single player, career mode, and granted nothing has changed from last year in career mode but overall I prefer it to 21. Personally I prefer the way the cars feel and handle, and the FFB has improved from 21. Furthermore, whilst the AI can have their moments of madness (as they do in all sims), but overall the AI is pretty damn good in this game - I've had some absolutely fantastic races and battles against the AI. I've come to realise that across most sims, the AI is never perfect, each has their flaws in some places (for me, RaceRoom is my favourite sim and even the AI there, which is very good, do have some mad moments) and then you consider the AI of the likes of AMS2, ACC etc and you realise none is perfect. But anyway I digress, overall I think the AI is pretty good and provides for some very good battles in F1 22. 
As an aside, I have no interest in the EA add-ons like F1 life and the supercars, but I just choose to ignore that. Overall, I have enjoyed playing this game a lot.

F1 2021 was a great game that got many things right, providing a solid springboard forwards. Some things from F1 2020 were missing or changed for the worse, and I felt like 22 was the opportunity to correct those. With the new F1 regulations, new cars, it gave Codemasters the chance to make the best F1 game to date.

Unfortunately that's not what happened.

[b]The Handling:[/b] Changed to reflect the new cars, which is fine, but not in the right ways. Feedback from losing grip is almost non-existent, making pushing to the limits incredibly hard. I get this game is trying to cater to Sim and Arcade racers, but this middle-ground should be better. When real F1 drivers like Lando Norris are saying the Medium Traction Control option feels more realistic, something is not right. Wheel or controller, it's tough to enjoy the physics of the game with this limitation.

[b]Game Modes:[/b] The Driving Point mode is gone, which is a shame as it provided a Drive-To-Survive style story mode, perfect to get casual users and those wanting to try something different with unique stakes. [u]There's nothing new this year really, though, bit of a shame[/u]. The remaining modes are great though. Even online functions pretty well, as I've raced in several different leagues with few troubles (only issue here is the inconsistent automatic penalty system, but it's one of those things that's impossible to get perfected).

[b]The AI:[/b] I feel like Codies AI is... an illusion. Yes they make mistakes, but they are very obviously scripted. Watching an AI wheel-spin on a hairpin is hilarious, it doesn't look realistic at all. Restart a race multiple times, and the same drivers will retire each time, at the same time. This is compounded by how the AI difficulty can vary track-to-track, and it even varies through qualifying and the race. You'll see popular YouTubers constantly altering the AI level between tracks and sessions to balance it. Further proof was the early game bug, where the AI would gain insane traction out of slow corners, making them almost impossible to race. This bug still hasn't been fully fixed in my opinion, with AI being crazy fast in both wet and changing conditions. The AI is a lot more aggressive this year however, a huge positive change in my mind, as far too often they'd yield, letting human drivers get away with silly moves.

[b]Authenticity[/b]: One thing Codies are fantastic at, making you feel like an F1 driver with all the bells and whistles. Having F2 back again is great, and starting a career mode in F2 is honestly a wonderful option. The new cars and liveries look amazing, and while some tracks have not been fully updated, those that are here do look fairly good, even if not perfect. The new addition of lining up on your grid slot is great, through the timing of your pit-stop turn-in is very minor. Very little wrong here.

[b]""F1 Life"":[/b] A huge waste of time really. The addition of SuperCars would be acceptable, but you cannot race them against other; just silly time trial style events. They added ridiculous amounts of filler too, like decorating an apartment, casualwear clothes, which are obviously meant to extract more monetisation. Surely the time and resources spent on this, could have been spent on updating the existing tracks like Spa to 2022 standards? Also irritating is how this is rendered in the background of most menus, maxing out GPU usage almost constantly.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
[b]Not bad, but not great either. Could have been so much better. Might be worth a punt if it's your first F1 game, but 2021 and 2020 offer much more compelling handling and modes,[/b]",1675195229,1698089041,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most significant letdown in this iteration is the handling model, which feels like a step down from its predecessors, making it hard to recommend to long-time fans of the series.

The handling of the cars in F1 2022 is a key aspect that's taken a step in the wrong direction. Previous games in the series had achieved a level of realism and precision that made you feel like you were truly in control of a high-performance racing machine. In F1 2022, however, the handling model falls short. The cars feel less responsive and more unpredictable, making it challenging to maintain a sense of control, especially when pushing the limits on the track.

The lackluster handling isn't the only concern. While F1 2022 offers a visually stunning racing experience with impressive graphics and a good selection of classic cars, it falls short in other areas. The career mode, which has been a highlight in previous games, feels somewhat lackluster, lacking the depth and immersion that fans have come to expect.

The introduction of the new ""Real-Season Start"" feature is a promising addition, allowing players to join a current season in progress. However, it doesn't fully compensate for the disappointment in other areas of the game.

On the bright side, the multiplayer experience in F1 2022 remains a fun and competitive element for those looking to race against others online. The game's online modes offer a chance to go head-to-head with players from around the world, delivering the excitement of wheel-to-wheel battles on iconic tracks.

In summary, F1 2022 had the potential to build upon the success of its predecessors, offering an even more immersive and realistic Formula 1 racing experience. However, the disappointing handling model makes it hard to overlook its shortcomings. For long-time fans of the series who've enjoyed the precise and exhilarating racing of previous titles, F1 2022 may feel like a step in the wrong direction. While it's not a complete failure and still delivers some enjoyable moments, it falls short of its predecessors and, as such, might not be worth the investment for those seeking the pinnacle of Formula 1 racing on the virtual track.",1697789574,1697789574,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I think the F1 22 and F1 21 games suffer a lot from the yearly release schedule.

The only attraction of F1 22 was the long awaited introduction of VR which works well, but this is also available in 23 which has much better character models and improved car physics - and the VR should be a staple in future F1 mainline games. 

If you're going to buy an F1 game, you better buy F1 23 (as 2020 is not for sale anymore, which would be my recommendation)

These F1 games go on sale a few months after release and become heavily discounted by the time the next one rolls around so just wait and get 23.",1695354035,1697116483,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

F1 22 has left me in a state of conflicting emotions. While undeniably a good game that offers a thrilling racing experience, it falls short in certain aspects compared to its predecessor, making it a clear downgrade from F1 2021.

[h1] Part 1: Visual Fidelity [/h1]

One area where F1 22 truly shines is in its graphics and visuals. The game boasts stunning attention to detail, with meticulously recreated car models, realistic weather effects, and immersive track environments. The visuals create a sense of immersion that truly captures the essence of Formula 1 racing. The upgraded graphics engine showcases improved lighting and shading, making the overall experience visually impressive.

[h1] Part 2: Gameplay and Mechanics [/h1]

The core gameplay mechanics in F1 22 remain solid, providing an authentic racing experience. The handling and physics model have been refined, resulting in more responsive controls and a heightened sense of realism. The game offers a comprehensive range of modes, including the career mode, multiplayer, and time trials, allowing players to engage in various racing challenges. The inclusion of new features, such as expanded team management options, adds depth and complexity to the gameplay experience.

However, despite these improvements, F1 22 also introduces a few frustrating elements. The AI behavior during races feels erratic at times, with opponents making questionable moves that can lead to unnecessary collisions. Additionally, certain aspects of the game's mechanics, such as tire wear and fuel consumption, seem unbalanced and can make the gameplay feel overly challenging and less enjoyable.

[h1] Part 3: Content [/h1]

F1 22 delivers an abundance of content, featuring all the teams, drivers, and circuits from the 2022 Formula 1 season. The inclusion of the new tracks, along with the updated liveries and driver lineups, adds an authentic touch to the game. The career mode provides a deep and immersive experience, allowing players to manage their team, make strategic decisions, and compete for championships.

Despite the extensive content, some players might feel that the game lacks innovation and fails to introduce significant new features compared to the previous installment. The absence of a meaningful upgrade in this aspect leaves a sense of disappointment, as fans had hoped for more groundbreaking additions to enhance their racing experience.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

In conclusion, F1 22 is undoubtedly a good game that delivers an enjoyable racing experience. The upgraded graphics, refined gameplay mechanics, and extensive content offer plenty of reasons to immerse oneself in the world of Formula 1. However, it is important to acknowledge that the game falls short when compared to its predecessor, lacking the innovation and significant improvements that would have elevated it to the next level. Despite its shortcomings, F1 22 remains a solid choice for Formula 1 enthusiasts, albeit with the knowledge that it represents a clear downgrade from the previous year's iteration.",1683646738,1693526179,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aerodynamics - There are only 2 items in this category and they refer to changes to the front and rear wings of the car. You can increase the pitch of the wings to improve both downforce and traction, or you can choose to reduce aerodynamic drag and improve top speed at the expense of less downforce.

Transmission - This tab contains Differential Adjustment. This can affect the way power is transferred to the car's rear wheels. Choosing a more open differential setting reduces tire wear, while choosing a more closed setting improves the car's grip.

Suspension Geometry - In this group of options, you can modify the Toe and Camber. Selecting a more negative camber value improves grip on long turns. However, a too negative camber can lead to increased tire wear.

Suspension - The tab here allows you to adjust the stiffness of the suspension and ride height. Going for a stiffer suspension may improve the stability of the car, but it will wear out the tires more and make the car drive unstable on uneven surfaces (you will feel it on tracks like the one in Singapore). Choosing a soft suspension will improve performance on uneven ground, but the car can tilt when you brake or accelerate suddenly.

Brakes - In this category, you can set the Brake Pressure and Brake Bias. The default pressure is 100%, but with ABS turned off, this can cause them to lock up frequently with more sudden braking. Balance modifications allow you to better match the operation of the brakes to the specifics of the track.

Tires - This tab allows you to select individual pressure for each tire. Choosing soft tires improves traction at the expense of steering sensitivity, while choosing higher tire pressure improves speed on straights but makes tires heat up faster.",1679788652,1693248593,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[h1] Positives [/h1]

There are not many positives from F1 22 - but here we go! The first improvement is in the wings. No longer does the car handle differently at Singapore than what it does at Melbourne. You have the full aero range from 0 to 50, which means that 0-0 at Monaco is entirely possible and so is 50-50 at Monza and Miami. 

Tire wear is more pronounced at every track, but this has its negatives.

The final positive is the kerbs. No longer are they going to murder you for the slightest offence like they did on F1 2021. 

That's it for the good. Now we move onto the bad, and holy crap there is a lot to talk about.

[h1] Negatives [/h1]

We're here. F1 22 is notorious for having the traction levels of black ice. It is possible to lose the car through wheelspin in the following scenarios:

- 4th gear at about 80-90 km/h
- 7th gear with all the aero on tap
- 5th / 6th gear at about half throttle

This makes for a frustrating handling model where you had zero clue what the car would do. Pushing over the limit meant an instant spin which you couldn't feel due to the god-awful FFB.

F1 Life is a joke. Who actually used the supercars after the first month?

The AI are professional punters. They also have twice the grip, which just makes them embarrassingly slow without this extra grip. They are not any faster or slower than F1 21's AI, just worse as it's significantly less fair. 

Online was plagued with issues right from the off and crossplay only made those worse. 

[h1] Verdict and Rating [/h1]
F1 22 was a major letdown for the F1 game franchise due to its horrid handling, poor AI and a dearth of content.

Every year, release the same game, halfway through the season, with slight physics and UI tweaks, and call it a day. This game is essentially the exact same game as F1 18, with updated teams and track selections. And let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is EA's fault, because Codemasters has been pulling this same garbage for at least 5 years now.
I originally said that the adaptive triggers were better than they were in 21, but that's not true at all. In 21, the throttle trigger would stiffen up as you approached the limit, and pushing up to the limit required actual physical effort. Now the triggers don't really stiffen up until you're already spinning. Especially after having put dozens of hours into 21, and combined with the handling changes they've made this year, it's incredibly frustrating to suddenly spin with no warning through the triggers. They feel sooo much less useful than they did in 21.
""F1 Life"" is an absolute joke, purely and obviously there exclusively to give you multiple ways to spend money or trigger FOMO (so that you spend money)
Whoever made the choice to put a significant emphasis on ""supercars"" in an F1 game should be fired. It is one of the most baffling decisions I've ever seen. If I wanted to drive supercars, there are dozens of other games I could, and would, be playing. I play the F1 games to, you know, RACE F1 CARS. Maybe if the F1 experience were perfect, I would be happy to see supercars in my game. But the F1 experience is not perfect, not by a long shot. 
I don't want to level up a podium pass. I don't want to drive supercars. I don't want to dress my driver up in absurd outfits and have him dance fortnite dances on the podium. I haven't spent a cent on a single in-game purchase in the years that they've been in the game. I just want to race my god damn F1 cars around the track and play through a realistic season/career. I would pay $60 a year, easily, if the game actually gave me what I wanted. But maybe 30% of the game is what I want, so I have no reason to ever pay full price for this game, and I encourage others to do the same.",1680461657,1691693753,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Early nonsense[/h1]
The ""3 days early access"" (expensive version) meant that friends would get split up, as some had early access, and some didn't (just because of the greed of the publisher, although the launch was delayed). The ""Pre-Purchase - Limited Time Bonus"" was a horrid mixture of fear-of-missing-out (FOMO), [i]and[/i] you'd miss out on content if you didn't pre-order the even more expensive version [i]early enough[/i]. They'll write up lines like: ""Don't miss out on the time-limited Miami content!"" - but why make it limited then? Why can't they just make a good product for the customers? Money that could have been spent fixing the horrid penalty system instead went to making movie style advertising instead. 

[h1]As a product[/h1]
Steering degrees are 360, which is an important detail for wheel users (which was left out). They learnt absolutely nothing from the mistakes of previous games - there's a forced introduction to the game, and it'll forget that you've gone through it before. All the intro does is just force you to look at their driver avatar system where they added microtransactions for avatar clothing. They're trying to treat it like Second Life, but in reality it's a racing game that has a maximum shelf life of 1 year.

Again, there's no mouse input, and the F buttons are used for navigation, so you might be taking unwanted screenshots just to get around the menu. The input sometimes doesn't work. The wheel buttons are a mess, as is the menu (made more irritating when flashing alerts won't go away, and the microtransactions). Trying it with a wheel - the default T300 settings are wrong.

You can get stuck trying to reach the menu because ""failed to connect to online services"" with no way to quit, being left with a retry button and a useless cancel button. Trying cancel, and [i]then[/i] retry takes you to the menu for a second, before being booted to the retry/cancel screen again.

Sometimes I can barely even navigate the menu without the microtransaction screens popping up, saying things like ""dont miss out!"" or being glitched out blank windows. I had three ads for pitcoin and tokens within seconds of eachother [i]after[/i] I'd selected ""don't show this again"". There's menu advertising for EA play. The invasive microtransactions make this expensive game feel like a free-to-play game.

The framerate feels pretty bad, and there's micro stuttering even after turning the graphics down (even on a good PC), and game crashes. The game was not compatible with shadowplay when I tried it. A lot of the time the game won't minimize, and the Steam overlay sometimes doesn't work in it. Frustratingly the race settings don't save (save issues have been in this series since F1 2010, which is why I don't bother with singleplayer championships). The selected control scheme can confusingly be hidden off-screen when looking through settings.

They added a lot of hit and miss pop music, but they don't fit the theme like F1 2000's [i]Phat Planet[/i] did. You can hear music sometimes while on-track, which means that uploading videos of gameplay would run into copyright issues (if FOM didn't outright pull your video down).

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Time trial sometimes doesn't show the lap timing gap (or even the timing at all), and doesn't always upload times when it claims that it did. Rank percentages are missing in TT, and it's awkward to even reach the leaderboards. TT laps sometimes show as invalidated when the lead up and full lap were clean. The leaderboards feel meaningless when you have a lap that said it was invalidated, but it still uploaded itself onto the leaderboard like it was a clean lap.

Multiplayer involves a lot of waiting around, and you can't quit while waiting for another player to finish loading (which sometimes gets stuck, or throws you an error). There's a race mode with collisions disabled, but it never worked for me. In every other mode you consistently encounter dirty drivers (again, the penalty system has failed to be a positive addition). You can tell it's a console port, because the mics are open by default.

The cars can snap - suddenly losing all grip, and when you do have grip they aren't as fun to drive compared to the smoothness of the Race07 Formula Masters car, or the beautiful hint of oversteer of the Simraceway Formula Renault 3.5 car (both released over a decade ago). Something about tokens pops up while driving, which is distracting. Awkwardly you turn into the pit box by pressing a button, and I couldn't get the pit limiter to work, and found no indication for when to move on pit release.

Cars spin worse and worse as the race goes on, and can't be saved - apparently you need to lower the tyre pressure, but this level of engineering conflicts heavily with the playability of the console market, so it feels more like a frustrating oversight than a feature, and splits the league playerbase (some want to combat the tyre pressure issue, some want to disable it). Organizing leagues on Steam is considered ""advertising"", so it's all pointless anyway.

Supercars were added, which is not a unique selling point - many other games have them, and they clearly didn't belong in an F1 game - judging by the leaderboards, few players were interested in how they handled. They felt as horrible as their interiors look - like PS1 graphics on launch. There was no dashboard or HUD information. Their inclusion just bloated the game's download size to 47 GB. If anything - they should have added classic F1 cars (which some of the earlier games used to have, but the older games no longer work). Supercars steering degrees are 360, but this didn't seem to match the F1 cars, despite the F1 cars also being 360. For some reason the look behind button doubled as the handbrake.

[h1]VR[/h1]
Trying the game with a Valve Index - the menus are in your face, so you have to move your head around to see anything, but this leads to the angle of your default VR position to change, and frustratingly the offset conflicts with the reset. The menus are also blindingly bright (it feels like they didn't make any changes after testing VR mode, as if they just wanted it to be functional so they could advertise it as being VR capable). Stuttering is worse in VR, and the visuals are blurry, so I wouldn't take it seriously. Only the cockpit view is allowed - I couldn't even switch to the T-cam. The only HUD element appeared to be the front brake bias option (which was stuck on screen). As soon as the race ends it switches to 2D mode.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Few players got achievements (and they look mundane), which speaks to the overcooked design and the raw issues that were never addressed. The whole thing felt disappointing. They just use the news section on the Steam library to spam nonsense like [i]""Your time to race!""[/i] and advertise the next game. How long will it be until the game is axed? F1 2019 crashes when I try to launch it, and I couldn't even see it on Steam store.

Essentially - every year you lose your trophies, and have to re-do all the broken controls, re-do the customisation, and have to pay more (often for less features, such as the cutting of classic cars and additional track layouts) while the file sizes becomes more bloated, and the microtransactions become more invasive.

It's difficult to recommend an expensive product (at £49.99, which isn't even the complete edition) when it's already obsolete because they want to make an entirely new one, instead of make a base game with yearly DLC (which could centralize the community). Listening to esports commentators trying to talk around the glitches in live broadcasts was amusing, but F1 was supposed to be the best, and this just isn't it.",1686939330,1689794831,False,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

As an avid sim racing enthusiast, I had high hopes for F1 22 by EA. However, after spending countless hours with the game, I have come to the unfortunate conclusion that it is an absolute disaster, especially when it comes to handling. In fact, it has been so frustrating and disappointing that I have seriously contemplated selling my entire sim racing rig.

The handling in F1 22 is abysmal, to say the least. It feels completely disconnected from reality, lacking any semblance of the precision and responsiveness one would expect from a racing simulator. The cars feel floaty, as if they are gliding on ice rather than gripping the track. This lack of grip is exaggerated to such an extent that it becomes virtually impossible to maintain control, even under normal racing conditions.

Cornering, which is a fundamental aspect of Formula 1 racing, is a nightmare in F1 22. The cars inexplicably lose traction at the slightest provocation, resulting in frustrating spins and crashes that feel entirely out of the player's control. It's as if the laws of physics have been completely disregarded, making each corner a gamble rather than a calculated maneuver.

Moreover, the force feedback, which is crucial for providing the player with vital information about the car's behavior, is shockingly inadequate. The feedback is vague, lacking the necessary nuances to communicate the subtleties of the car's movements. This further exacerbates the handling issues and contributes to the overall sense of frustration and detachment from the driving experience.

The AI drivers in F1 22 are equally disappointing. They lack any form of intelligence or realism, often exhibiting nonsensical behavior on the track. They seem oblivious to their surroundings, frequently causing unnecessary collisions and impeding the player's progress. Racing against these mindless bots only adds to the frustration and undermines any sense of competitiveness or immersion.

Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of F1 22 is the fact that it was developed by EA, a company known for its history of producing quality games. I expected much more from a franchise that carries the prestigious F1 license. Unfortunately, EA has failed to deliver a game that captures the essence of Formula 1 racing and satisfies the needs of sim racing enthusiasts.

In conclusion, F1 22 by EA is a colossal disappointment, primarily due to its horrendous handling. The lack of grip, unrealistic physics, and inadequate force feedback make for an infuriating and detached driving experience. Combined with the subpar AI drivers, this game has managed to sour my passion for sim racing to the point where I contemplated selling my entire rig.

[h1] Positives [/h1]

- The handling is a lot better than F1 2021, and I enjoy it very much. Only issue has been spinning but you have to be more careful on the throttle to prevent it.
(Since the update to the handling at the start, I have found it better and enjoyed it more, so I'm glad this happened)

- F1 Life is actually a cool mode. There have been memes on the furniture stuff, and people don't like it because EA, but to make it how you like is cool. You can also visit other players F1 Life place, and after an online session it also shows people you recently played with in that part.

- The engine sounds have changed and they are all really nice, they did a good job on that.

- The soundtrack is really good again, could even be better than 2021's soundtrack. I'm talking about the main theme, not the music that EA put in there.

- Some tracks have been updated and also more have been laser-scanned, which is good to see, there were complaints about inaccurate tracks last year and those updates are pretty good now.

- The features of lining up on the grid and pitting manually are good to have, it makes the game more immersive and realistic.

[h1] Negatives [/h1]

- The AI have been fun to race with when it's clean, but their biggest flaw is that they are absolute terrorists. They dive you a lot and go for moves in unrealistic situations.

- The supercars are pretty useless and were not needed tbh. For an F1 game I don't think they are needed.

- Unnecessary bugs like tyre temps resetting after the formation lap.

- Crossplay is massive for the F1 games, it's never been a feature until now, but I had a lot of issues with it involving desync and other things, it was during the beta though so it can be fixed, but it just made it unraceable for me. Hopefully it's improved over time.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Overall F1 22 is a really good game and I definitely would recommend. 
An extremely underrated game imo, I feel that it's better than a few other F1 games that I personally didn't enjoy. It doesn't deserve the negative ratings, hopefully the good run continues :)",1657618003,1687762059,True,7,1,0.578853845596313477,0,True,False,False

Here are my issues I've had in this years game:
- Disconnects from the server
- MINUS DEGREE Celcius tyres after rejoining!
- AI pitting with 1 lap old medium tyres for new medium tyres after I got disconnected
- SC ended in the last corner once. Due to the limiter for the driver in front I rear ended him (front wing damage) + I got rear ended as well which sent me off track and I was able to spectate the SC restart from the gravel trap. Thank you EA
- My broken front wing doesn't get changed
- The weather forecast doesn't work in this game. One of the most important things for a race.
- You can't unlap yourself which destroys your race completely if the SC is getting deployed
- The grip/handling is so bad and random. If you have oversteer, most of the times you're not able to catch it for some reason.

To drive on this game was just pain. From the very first second until now.

The Base of the game is solid, not going to lie. It's fun. But some of the buggs are just so dumb that they want you to stop playing the game entirely. 
We are talking you are on the second to last lap of a race, and drove Soft + Medium Tires but get a warning, that you have to put on ""Soft or Hard"" Tires or you get Disqualified. YOU DRIVE INTO the pits to change to hard tires, AND YOU STILL get disqualified for it. 

WHAT?! Not only is that dumb and annoying, but also can cost you 30 Minutes or more time of your Life. 
At the moment I would just recommend buying the old Codemaster games without EA influence. They are by far not as bugged. - This happend in a Crossplay-COOP- Career.

By the way: It does not matter if you pit when you get the warning. I have had this bugg happen to me TWICE within 49 hours of playtime, the first time I drove 3 tires (Soft, Medium, Soft) and ignored the warning to change (to Soft or Medium) and got disqualified. The SECOND time I mentioned in this Review I pitted for Hards and STILL GOT DISQUALIFIED. - So when ever this happens to you, you are F'ed because you WILL be disqualified no matter what you do.

3/10 - Rating Buggs like this should not exist in a released game.

UPDATE: MONTHS later maybe even a Year, and this Tire Compound bugg still isn't fixed, for the AI yes, but not for the player. This is a Carrear ENDING bugg in singleplayer campaigns. I CANNOT BELIEVE that this is still not fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I expect this to be the issue in F1 23 too, or atleast that there are buggs of similar graditude. Codemasters and EA do NOT fix any buggs it seems. Thanks EA, for also ruining the F1 Games.
They even added another Issue, after 10 minutes in a race you can get frame drops down to 14-15 fps for a couple seconds. Which can send you into a wall quickly. this then continues to happen every 1 to 1 and a half minutes. None of the fixes I tried helped me in any way. By now this Game is pretty much unplayable.

1/10 - still looks good though but other than that...",1667952214,1687384994,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know a lot of people complain about it, but I find it's great. Just as good as F1 2020.
I agree about the physics a bit - but I find if you turn traction control on, it all works fine, but it is annoying that with it off the physics aren't that great (eg can't counter steer out of a slide....).

But otherwise, I like all aspects of the game, the progression, the AI competitors and find it lots of fun, and not buggy at all.",1687033411,1687380742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tracks are the most boring things I have ever seen in my 16 years on this planet, and I watched  the Spanish Grand Prix in 2022 and 2023, just for a comparison to how boring the tracks are.

The cars are shit, liveries are shit, they added a fucking battle pass (Get a grip you fat money hungry cunts), there was nothing for anyone to do except a career mode since they added fuck all. And for the entire year, people were left to wonder, 'When is F1 23 coming out?', 'When will EA update this shit handling model?'

First of all, the AI. It drives ridiculously aggressive, with no regard for crashes or anything. Second of all, the physics. You're basically driving on ice, as you spin really quickly if you hit the gas a little with TC disabled. And once you lose the rear end, there is no way to recover. A lost rear end is pretty much always a spin. Last, the game just lacks content. There are no classic cars or anything similar to drive.

Sadly, it is safe to say this is also my last game for the now literally EA-stamped codemasters. The greedy EA overlords(and codies themselves) have certainly aligned their direction to milk this franchise til it becomes a bone dry dead cow.

Physics is decent, has proper pronunciation of understeer and lame low speed oversteer thats found in the new era 22 cars, shame no porpoises tho. Features that are welcome: Driving supercars via Pirelli hotlaps is a good breather before the GP weekend, and VR FINALLY! F1 LIFE: This is a lame direction, this is purposely induced by EA to flaunt petty prestige. The rest is still the same graphics wise, but it seems they have polished DLSS a bit oh well...OH wait no more derpy aiden good riddance!

From 2010 to 22(except the worst of them all: 2014), we the f1 enthusiasts have raised them into a distinguished f1 game maker, we had great memories that will forever cherish and appreciate, but all good things should come into conclusion...but i feel this is going with a bang considering Ian Livingstone is raking his nostalgic masterpiece soundtrack leitmotifs all-out.

We'll let it sink in with the Miami sunset; a proper retirement package~

edit: With the F1 23 early access, I made the biggest lie regarding retirement. F1 22 is a decent game that I still enjoyed, but at the same time gave me a feeling of unbelievable dissatisfaction. Just like the anticlimactic recall of Felipe Massa during my personal fave 2017(coincidence?)

-The game has  yet to crash
NEGATIVES
-I'd much rather have classic cars than supercars
-Some menus remain the same since F1 2020 which is tragic 
-F1 life in general seems out of place in an F1 game 
-On grand prix mode i encountered rain in saudi arabia and abu dhabi, which doesnt seem that realistic to me
- There is a very big number of glitches in the game

My positives:
+Latifi

My negatives:
-Unrealistic and terrible traction out of corners and drivability itself like massive understeer and random oversteer. F1 22 has made me hate the new regulation of cars and i though the new cars were terrible until i tried them out on a different sim and actually found out the cars were drivable without assists.
-F1 World. Supercars, Houses, Clothing. Sounded pretty cool but old f1 cars like in F1 2020 and prior itself would have been better. You could only drive the supercars on tracks and not do races or something like a freeroam city. The houses which i was hyping about is just a little menu where you can like change a lamp and furniture + the wall and you couldnt actually see your multi million dollar villa as an F1 driver. I think it would have been cool being able to walk around and see your supercars and rooms of your villa. Clothing.... in an F1 game..... bro i just want to vroom vroom with car ok?
-AI were also an interesting one. The AI were i will say honestly..... diabolical. They would go for massive lunges, divebombs, or would just proceed to turn into you. Terrible.
-Game bugs. I only have 200 hours but i have encountered some from my sessions. Safety car deployed and never came in, Randomly disconnected, Thankfully i didnt do any leagues on this game, And just many bugs i cant be bothered to list here.

My conclusion for anyone who is reading this and is thinking of buying this:
My conclusion: I dont want to launch this game ever again

Should you get it?: No..... definetly not....

I played F1 2019-2021 at least 100 hours each. Each pro and con will be in comparison to 2021.

Pros:
~ Visuals are slightly better
~ FFB is more responsive
~ Audio is a lot better
~ Variety of localization 

Cons:
~ Clear monetization efforts. Pay real money for Pitcoins to unlock cosmetics for things that don't matter like clothes and furniture. This is an F1 game, not Sims.
~ Clothing and furniture! Who asked for this? It's an F1 game, not Sims.
~ Removed classic cars and other modes. Why? 
~ There's no anticheat in Multiplayer, exemplified by the Esports community.
~ AI is extremely unpredictable. Others may say this makes racing more exciting, but the AI is overly aggressive, will try to kill you like Osama Bin Russell, and they seem to have traction control. I'm no Esports driver though.
~ VR lacks the depth perception of other VR racing games and is still extremely resource intensive.
~ Pirelli Hot Laps with the supercars are awful. The supercars are not enjoyable and are awkward to drive. Skip these as much as you can. Again, it's an F1 game. Focus on the open wheel cars.
~ Soundtrack isn't as good as 2021. 
~ Tsunoda still looks wack. Poor guy.

Watching the dev videos before launch, it seemed the devs had the best intentions in mind and wanted to improve on 2021, but somehow some pointless features made it into the game, probably forced in by some bald executive (EA) who thought it was a good idea.

Eventually, I decided to try it on my buddy’s Origin account with EA Play and experienced no bugs and my Fanatec wheel (CSL DD w/ McLaren GT3 rim) and Heusinkveld Sprints worked perfect, so I decided to buy the game on Steam.

First off, there’s a learning curve if you’re one to not use traction control. I was getting so frustrated by constantly spinning the car as well as getting major underwater in slow corners. This is an issue in real life with the new regulations as well, so I worked to adapt to it. Just be easy on that throttle and trail brake into corners. Practice, practice, practice, and it’ll come to you.

Overall, the game runs well on my system (2060, i7 8700, 16gb ddr4) and I don’t regret my purchase. The AI is harder than last year, but they race well and race hard. 

As for the micro transactions and such, it’s EA so they definitely shove them down your throat every chance they get, but I couldn’t care less about that BS and just click through it. 

The game exceeded my expectations so far and provides a great virtual F1 experience. It’s very similar to last years game in terms of features, but for the new cars, new and updated tracks, and small features such as pit stop errors, I don’t mind spending the 60 bucks on it.",1657085989,1685352174,False,0,0,0.719539463520050049,0,True,False,False

From the jaw-dropping graphics that make you question if you're watching a race or live-action footage, to the gameplay that gives you a taste of what it's like to be behind the wheel of a screaming F1 machine, this game has it all. I felt like I was right there on the grid, smelling the burning rubber and hearing the engines roar to life. It's a proper thrill, my friends!

The attention to detail is commendable, capturing the essence of the sport with realistic car handling and lifelike tracks that'll make you feel like you're at Silverstone on race day. The career mode, in particular, is a fantastic addition, allowing you to experience the ups and downs of a driver's journey, from battling for that first podium finish to negotiating contracts that could make or break your career. It's a captivating experience that keeps you coming back for more, just like a gripping battle for a championship title!

Now, let's address the elephant in the virtual room: the bugs. Unfortunately, like a pesky fly on your visor, F1 22 does have its fair share of gremlins on track. From occasional AI mishaps that make you wonder if they've mistaken the brake pedal for the accelerator, to minor visual glitches that might have you scratching your head in confusion, there are moments where you'll have to navigate through some virtual potholes. However, I'm confident that the developers will be in the pit lane, working tirelessly to iron out these issues and deliver a smoother race experience.

But fear not, my fellow racers, because despite these hiccups, F1 22 still manages to provide an adrenaline rush like no other. Whether you're engaging in fierce multiplayer battles with your friends or going solo in the career mode, there's no denying the excitement that comes with every lap. Just like a thrilling overtaking maneuver, the highs of this game outweigh the lows, and it's these moments that make F1 22 a worthy addition to any racing fan's collection.

In conclusion, F1 22 is a joyride that'll get your heart pumping and your inner racing driver revving. With stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and a career mode that puts you in the driver's seat of your dreams, it's a fantastic representation of the sport we all love. Yes, there are some pesky bugs to contend with, but like a determined driver pushing through adversity, I'm confident that the developers will fine-tune the game to deliver an even better experience.

So, my friends, get yourself a copy of F1 22, fasten your seatbelts, and prepare for a wild journey that'll have you shouting, ""Banzai!"" with every hairpin turn. Remember, in the world of F1, it's not just about the finish line; it's about the thrills, the spills, and the memories that last a lifetime.

Don't get me wrong, the game would be a masterpiece if it weren't for game breaking bugs, glitches and design. VR is pointless because the programmers messed up the power output of the engines, so you hit a straight and lose 2 seconds off of your lap time because you can't even get into eighth gear on most tracks. 

Super aggressive ai that literally drives like you are not on the track with them. They have ""patched"" this and turned ai aggression down but it is still crazy. 

Too many issues to list here to be frank but you get the gist. 

The item shop is POINTLESS, unless all you want to do is buy lamp shades and rugs for your equally pointless lounge area!!! Really EA, you took away helmet and car liveries for this rubbish?

Sound issues in game that can only be fixed by disabling every last audio device attached to your PC. Yes, really. I have to disable my VR headset to have sound that isn't juttery ffs. 

Yeah the list goes on. I enjoy F1 2018 and 2020 way more than this. I'm never buying another F1 title with an EA stamp on it.

Edit:

In the run up to F1 23 launch, I thought I'd re-download this hot garbage (yes I deleted it when I made the initial review) only to find that all of the issues I left the game over are still standing. What a joke of a game. However, I am pleased I did because the timely reminder of how EA/CM have ruined this franchise settled my decision not to pre-order, or in fact even consider, F1 23. 

I learned my lesson with Activision and the COD franchise; Dead as a Dodo. I gave Activision rope and they hung me with it in the form of MW2 2022. Got my refund on that hot mess too. This is not about COD obviously but EA are doing the same with the F1 franchise now, taking away what we love about F1 games and implementing utter BS and a ton of game breaking problems and glitches. 

On top of that, I swear there is some kind of SBMM or boosting/Nerfing going on because when I play with my friends, I am clearly the fast, more experienced racer yet I get beaten 9/10 times. Why? because I have witnessed sooo many times where I'll be taking huge chunk of lap time, as I'd expect, to all of a sudden having no grip in corners for a lap or two until I lose touch with the race. Every time my fastest laps are 0.8 secs (ave) faster but I get crippled in the race at various points and it feels like it is to stop me stomping on my friends. 

Anyway, needless to say, don't buy this rubbish title and if you're smart you'll stay away from F1 23. Don't say I didn't warn you...

Career is quite fun. I always play full 2 hour races and its cool it allows me to save midway in case I can’t finish it in one sitting. I really like the parts improvement in this game due to it being so much detailed than the usual parts in other racing games. It just lacks in the tuning department tho. The game does provide a good level of difficulty, but since as you get better parts it becomes easier, I up the level of difficulty to make races more challenging.
I do like multiplayer but I always end up creating my own race for people to join, mainly because I like to race around 15 laps with pit stops, other people’s races are always like 3 laps.

Vibration on controller is broken and doesn't work half the lobbies when 'on' is selected. Auto trigger rumble just makes the controller vibrate nonstop even on straights. 

Upshift tone doesn't work half the time or you can't hear it depending on the loud ass tinnie car noises

Don't even know whos taken when picking a driver cause its all greyed out especially when needing to pick fast also I can click on the driver I want and nothing happens for 5 seconds until it registers.. Talk about lag or whatever it is. Why change shit that's not broken? Useless company. 

Just like sifting through 20 sub menus and categories to see lobby settings.. Why change that from 2020?..

Handling is trash, medium traction control is unplayable in 90 percent of corners as you just spin even giving it 25 percent throttle.. zero downforce and always going wide for instance on the twisties in USA...also can lose the back end any time. Extremely unpredictable and steering sensitivity seems to change. Giving it a little input in a straight it's sensitive af then mashing the stick left and right in a straight and the car takes forever to turn.. Why so sensitive for little adjustments.. 

 Broken red front wing and can still drive almost normal.. 

Strict corner cutting is too strict and regular to to leniant just like the last 10 copy and paste versions of this game.

F1 life is useless and a big way to monetize micro transactions. Typical EA way.

Beginner friendly lobby settings are useless where collisions are off by default which is a terrible way to race.. 

Multiple little bugs at release still aren't fixed.

Doesn't show flags in lobby before a race for whatever reason..

Can't leave lobby if joined too late and your spectating before race.. Have to wait till everyone loads in.. Little things like this why fckn change.. Everything is more annoying to use and do. 

No audio f1 logo loading screen when going into qualy and race.. 

Can't ride kerbs to save your life..let alone brake on them..

Turning radius is wack too. Full speed in a corner like many in Britain and its going crazy wide and can't hug the corner even with good custom setups.. Same with 2021..has grip but cars are so damn heavy it can't to save its life. 

Can't see when you lock up cause the smoke is only in the rear for whatever reason..

Bahrain turn 8 is impossible on controller half the time even a quarter throttle still losing the back end..

Could go on and on but games dogshit and doesn't compare to 2020. 2021 was trash too.

Overall the game sucks. Cars feel like unpredictable bricks going around the circuit, menus are trash, sub menus everywhere, etc..",1656656832,1683855264,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game is welcoming to newcomers, and despite its flaws, provides a bearable experience for those newly passionate for the series. It works well with a controller, and if I had a friend that was getting into the sport, I would tell them to snag the game on sale.

For those who are not newly passionate, the game is a shambles. Various bugs, development decisions, and blatantly incompetent physics quirks have built one of the most intolerable games in the series.

To qualify myself, since most criticism of this game is brushed off as a skill issue: I am extremely passionate for Formula 1, and have been playing the games since F1 2011. I have transitioned from console to PC, and from the controller to a full sim setup. I am consistently within the top 1-5% of the leaderboards, and love improving my skill behind the wheel.

The positives:

- F1 22 is the most beautiful game in the series, bar none. The graphics evolution took a very large step since F1 2021, and during long race stints it is quite common to look around and appreciate the work that went into the looks of the game.
- The audio is also a plus, with engine samples taken directly from the on-track cars this year. Though, the Red Bull’s engine still needs some work.
- The game, without context from the other games (especially F1 2020,) is very, very satisfying. For those who don’t mind the semi-arcade, semi-simulation “simcade” nature of the game, it provides a unique experience for those wanting to experience Formula 1 race weekends.

The negatives:

- F1 22 is plagued by bugs, server issues, and odd data errors that significantly degrade the experience. Some examples include, but by no means create an exhaustive list: 
    - Consistent server problems absolutely destroy online play, kicking players and sometimes permanently locking them out of online play. The multiplayer co-op has improved over the previous entry to the series, but the server issues and other odd quirks that impede gameplay destroy the experience.
    - Time Trial begins to be bugged for some players, and will remain bugged throughout the rest of the game’s life cycle. This leaves players without the ability to access some Time Trials, top setups, and will actively spread to other places in the game like a virus. This issue still has not been addressed, or fixed.
    - The multiplayer connection is laughable, at its best. Since the introduction of crossplay, online lobbies have been unbearable, with cars teleporting off the track, wiggling so violently that getting close to them is impossible, and a bizarre bug where any player in the lobby can tab out of the game and completely ruin the synchronization between players.
- F1 22’s physics are, at best, a lazy approach to the new era of Formula 1 machinery. Some positives have been made with the physics engine - namely, the introduction of a sharp peak when the tyres begin to slip, making “the knife’s edge” feel like one. The positives stop there. The cars are not anywhere near the handling characteristics of their real-life counterparts. These cars are allergic to any type of kerbs, save for the ones painted on the track, where their real-life counterparts sail over them due to the emphasis on ground effect with the new chassis. These cars are horrendously prone to understeer, and the term “boat” does not come close to describing the handling characteristics. Even when the cars are fully upgraded at the end of My Team or Driver Career, the cars’ understeer only worsens. Grip, oddly, seems to be connected directly to RPM, meaning shortshifting is currently the best way to drive. These problems become extreme if you have the ability to play the game above 60fps. For some reason, whatever it might be, traction loss over 60fps becomes a violent, unrecoverable spin. Kerbs, at 60fps, are generally annoying, but they become exceedingly violent and dangerous above that framerate.
- F1 22’s AI was, at launch, a step above F1 2021’s own. Somewhere along the line, though, AI meant to replicate professional racing drivers began to resort to dangerous divebombing, consistent lockups in braking zones that result in damage, and blatantly ignoring the player to the point of awkwardly pushing the player off over an extended amount of time.
- For being sponsored by FANATEC, the game not recognizing the CSL DD is quite odd. Nitpick, sure, but the game not recognizing wheelbases and other peripherals is worrying.
- The force feedback has taken a step back for controller players, and has not improved to the standard of games like Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, or even rFactor and iRacing. On controller, the trigger rumbles for most controller types was removed, or was dumbed down. On the wheel, the force feedback is inconsistent, unhelpful, and most of it is noise (not generated from events the car experiences, just made to be filler for the experience.) The car has almost no force feedback on tracks like Miami, and on Portugal and Belgium, feels like the wheel noise will rip the wheel off its mounting.

At the end of it all, the game is a mess for those who want to play consistently, and at a level above sitting on your couch using every assist included in the game. The result of wherever this mismanagement of the game comes from has finally trickled down into the product, and its effects unfortunately have shown their ugly collective face. On the surface, the game looks to be well-polished, but anywhere deeper than the fresh coat of paint that is applied to the game every year in the form of features like F1 Life to desperately attract ultra-casuals, the guts of the game prove rotten with years of neglect.

I want to see F1 23 do better. As passionate as I am for the series and the sport, I have clocked 1/4 of the hours on this entry due to the game’s state. If I had to rate this game out of 10, a 5/10 would be generous.

This years game has introduced F1 Life and supercars. Two very unnecessary additions... I've had a few hours of fun in the supercars but in the end it still feels extremely weird driving a supercar while playing an F1 game. I'd just prefer classic cars which I feel like would be way more fitting for an F1 game. But thats not everything... The handling model feels worse than in all F1 games the last couple of years. It often feels unpredictable with a lack of feel for the car and grip. The A.I. is more aggressive now and it feels like you can actually have a nice fight with them... until you are in the gravel because the A.I. either didn't see you or just didn't care that you were there. 

BUT even with all those negative aspects I still had a lot of fun in this game. No F1 game ever had this much content and there are also additions that I love because you can now choose between broadcast and immersion options. I can't tell you how much I loved the idea of driving to the grid positions myself before this game came out. And now I can just do that. 
Yes, F1 22 wasn't the greatest F1 game but you can still have a lot of fun, especially with friends. And now I'm excited to see if F1 23 makes a step in the right direction again.",1683244790,1683244897,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

F1 22 is a  new F1 title developed by Codemasters and for the second time since published by EA since Codemasters has become a part of EA since its purchase. F1 22 offers a unique feature which has not been in the previous F1 games. Compared to F1 2015 and F1 2020 which I previously played, F1 22 allows you to drive a number of super cars around all tracks, but you are only allowed to drive the cars in time attack mode. Despite offering a unique and refreshing feature as aforementioned, you will not find any F1 classic cars as in its 2020 counterpart and any previous edition of F1 annually released, personally speaking the absence of this feature is one of the most significant flaws in the game, as the presence of the classic cars will allow players to immerse themselves fully in the F1 world. In addition to the fact mentioned earlier, F1 22 is a great game, which offers an unforgettable racing experience in which players have to prioritize the utilized strategy during the race in order to be able to come out as a victor, as in every F1 game, not to mentioned this game also includes My Team feature which will allow players to create their own team to compete in the Grand Prix of the F1 series. The AI is quite aggressive so be aware when you play the game that the AI will try to shake you off-track. Compared to F1 2021, which was the first time that the F1 game series has its own story mode, F1 22 does not have this kind of mode. The series could have been better if the developers had included the sequel to the story presented in F1 2021. F1 22 also releases new features such as F1 Live which will allow player to customize their own private space consisting of  super cars, which they can purchase in-game, using the credits earned during the race, create and customize their own preferred decoration and ornament and even place the trophies of every single Grand Prix they have already won which I find as an unnecessary addition to the series.

God help you if you're in the way of their racing line as you'll just get shoved out the way or piled through like you're not even there, and they take ZERO damage from it. But leave you with no wing or just totally wipe you out so you DNF. Unless you manage to get pole and escape the first lap madness you'll be frustrated every time you play the game.

Pros (there are a few somehow)
- New features like lining your car up at the start are nice little additions 
- Miami is a cool street circuit 
- Co-op re added 
- Aesthetic of the menus and ui very well done

Cons
- Pretty much f1 2016. 
- Cars are fucking boats. Dunno how they botched the handling that hard 
- Still classic cars haven't been re added 
- Driver career has been the same since 2019 
- So many physics bugs its a joke
- Online servers are still slow as and the drivers are still brain dead 
- Ai doesn't care for your existence still
- Not me but i heard countless people talk about corrupted saves 
- Wheel only works on a good day. Ffb also randomly stops working
- Ea's push of micro transactions is ridiculous, like the main selling point of this game was f1 life (no-one asked for this btw) and its pretty much just cosmetics 

Maybe i wouldn't be so hard on this game if previous titles weren't better in every way.  F1 2020 is a flawless experience. Though surprise surprise ea delisted them

2/10 find an f1 2020 steam key

I'm a huge F1 fan including the games there big negatives but also positives. Starting with the POSITIVES  the graphics are beautiful and although some people complain about I like the A.I being good it makes it an actual challenge. The tracks are great and the race day gameplay is great. A small thing but the addition of music in the menu is nice and some the new mechanics are cool.

 Now for NEGATIVES . A lot of people we're concerned when ea was taking a bigger role in this game and for good reason. The classic staple of release the game early with ungodly bugs and issues ""but don't worry we will just fix it"" is very apparent with game. The french grand prix pit lane is so broken that the car will turn into wall early for no reason this happened four different times in a row and at one point i entered at 30kpm still didn't work properly. Don't worry because when my car did stop trying to imitate lance stroll in baku the car just missed my pit crew and reset on to the track without replacing my broken front wing (caused by the continuing wall slamming) nor my tires. Some other notable bugs the audio when booting up the game might just constantly cut in and out over and over again. Also for vr players if you're expecting something like Iracing lower your expectations its not great. There are too many compatability issues with the wheels but I've seen a lot of reviews on just those alone so check them out because there probably all valid. The sector colours don't show up. F1 life is just an excuse to get people to buy more currency because as we know ea is trustworthy and would never want to get a cash grab off of a sports game. 

All in all if you have F1 2021 and your okay with outdated designs just play that because there is nothing really new with this one and I'm being dead serious when I say that not only is this pretty much a re-skin but they straight re-used the clip of will buxton at the beginning of his intro for a new career mode. If you do not on any F1 games and want to try one I would wait a bit before they fix all the bugs then I would say try it out because it does have some upside.",1657037980,1682875458,True,0,0,0.505649745464324951,0,True,False,False

I only have two critiques:

1: The AI are too fast on straights. A Williams out running a red bull on a straight is just not realistic.

2: The feel of the car just feels off. It doesn't feel like you're driving a super fast formula 1 car. I hope that gets worked on in the next game.

Overall I've really enjoyed this game. I would recommend to only purchase this game when its on sale.

Bought this game on sale 85% off! Bargain.

I have recently gained a lot of interest in Formula One so I thought id try out the games on PC.

The game-play feels fine for the most, settings are critical to set right for optimal gameplay. Undeveloped cars did seem very hard to turn in, and lots of understeer but when you get along with research/dev this fixes a lot of this issue. Ive heard this SIM wise isn't nearly as good as F121 but I have not played it to compare
The sound studdering issue is very frustrating as I heavily rely on audio for gearing and braking and accelerating out of corners. There is no fix, no matter how many settings or 'fixes' are tried.
Other downsides are that the games graphics are a little behind, but ok (Ultra settings, 1440P is decent)
AI is also very 'dive bomb' at times, and I blame the devs using real life behaviour as Max and other drivers are terrible at pushing when there is no gap at all and causing damage or running drivers off the track or wall (poor sportsmanship) - sometimes they can clean overtake, but even when I drive along side and give room, AI does not.
I highly suggest playing 'my team' mode on full season 22 tracks with most of the simulation settings on. (I use TCS and ABS because I want to enjoy the game without rage quitting)
Score: 7/10

Pros:

- Online mode is fun when you're in a lobby full of players that knows how to actually race.
- VR mode is excellent.
- Nice visuals with Ray Tracing.
- F1 and F2 cars feel great to drive on controller.

Cons:

- Career mode is a huge step back from F1 21.
- ""My F1 life"" is pointless and just a cheap cash in via micro transactions. You can tell EA had their grubby mits all over the game
-  Classic cars replaced by regular sports car that feels awful to drive.
- AI is inconsistent. One race, they can be dumb as a box of rocks. Next, they can be too over-aggressive such as not giving you room when taking a racing line. I can't explain how many times I've had to AI trying to ""defend"" when I am trying to complete a practice program and affecting my results.
- No punishment for the AI if they hit you or knock you off track. They simply drive like you're not there.
- No red/blue/black & blue flag system.

One where they advertise gold and give you a turd painted with gold spray paint. If you love F1 don't let this game series take advantage of that. Get iRacing or Assetto Corsa Competizione and wait until someone else gets the rights to make a REAL F1 game.

Its super easy to acquire and use free cheats in online now takes like 2 mins, such a disappointment because after playing F12021 2020 and 2018 again I realise now how much of a mess F122 truly is, F1 Life and Supercars over hyped and have no purpose at all the handling model is unforgiving and not realistic. It is bearable at most and I hope F123 is a lot better than whatever this hell hole of F122 has become. It is quite telling when compared to last year the games population has decreased by over 50% I think according to some statistics and also when a sport like F1 is becoming way more popular why is the games popularity evermore decreasing? It dosen't make sense.

Morale of the story dont let EA acquire the rights to your game they will glamour everything up and then produce a subpar product and completely kill your hype and expectations like when the game released for early access they didn't even apologise for it, we got 5 levels of XP which expired if you didn't claim within a week? What so we could get a sofa to put in our apartment???? Nice going EA love spending time looking in my virtual house where half the levels I got I need to pay for to even unlock!  Speaking of, the champions edition was such a let down too with some people not even receiving the items they PAYED for. Not to mention the frequent audio cutouts makes the game unbearable and is distracting when I am trying to set a fast lap. Even with low audio quality it still does it every single time.

If your looking for a simple racing game to play to immerse yourself in your favourite sport, buy standard edition but dont expect much for now as the game is broken and in dis-repute.

The AI is the only good thing to this game and they tend to be extremely erratic and make insane moves that push you millions of miles to the next planet.

More freezes/Crashes then Nicholas Latifi and Nikita Mazepin,
I've had 2 MyTeam Saves and a Driver Career Save Corrupt/Crash when I try to load them.

There is no Classic Cars,
No new DLC tracks only re-added Portimao and China. They even removed the short layout tracks permanently .

Cheaters in every corner of multiplayer even at the highest Levels.

The only thing holding this game together is the community who have made mods to significantly improve your experience.
They haven't even given the player the ability to choose when you want races to happen in the season.
Instead the player community has added that for them.

Overall I would honestly say this is the worst experience i've had with an F1 game since F1 2014/15

- The online matchmaking is crap. Countless times I've been dropped into a lobby that says Qualis are about to finish, so presumably I can join and start the race at the back of the grid. Nope, after sitting through the quali lap and the loading screens, the race starts and you have to spectate the entire thing and wait for the grid to get back into the lobby. And if you dare leave a session, the game punishes you by forcing you back into that same session when you try to find another lobby. Crap.

- The VR is crap. I'm surprised I haven't had a seizure yet with how shaky and glitchy it is. I can't play in VR for more than 10 minutes without a headache. Crap.

- The AI is crap. No matter the game nor the sport, leave it to EA to create AI that absolutely ruins your experience. The AI drivers are unpredictable at best, and will straight up plow you off the track at worst. I can't decide if EA's AI are worse at driving or playing hockey. Crap.

- The supercars are crap. And who asked for them? The models are unfinished and they're not even fun to drive. People buy an F1 game to drive F1 cars, not a cheap Wish version of countless other racing games. $20 says the first promotional video for F1 23 will have EA bragging about how you can drive the DHL moving trucks from one race weekend to the next. I bet you'll have to pay for it too.

Even on medium difficulty, AI are able to make passes and braking maneuvers that aren't possible as a player. On long straights, they always seem to have 50 more HP. 

Brake early in traffic to actually make the corner? AI will fly up the inside, lock up their tires, and play bumper cars. They make attempts at passing that no logical person would ever attempt. There are corners on all F1 circuit where overtaking isn't possible. This won't stop them from forcing you off the track despite never being wheel to wheel or even close to ahead in the braking zone. 

Another strange nuance is resource generation. It seems unless you increase the rate manually your team is always behind on R&D. Almost as if the AI gain them faster than you. Really makes it difficult when you want the full F1 experience and start as a back marker team. You stay as a back marker team forever without manually increasing resource generation. 

Gave this an honest try through several seasons in simulation mode while gradually upping difficulty into Hard range. This just makes it more ridiculous. You may become more comfortable driving and even get steadily quicker at each track. This doesn't matter with this games AI.",1681077365,1681077365,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has so many basic bugs that break the game its hard to believe. They fucked up things that have been working for years in previous titles. You name it and it probably happened. Shit I dont even need to write any specific bugs down when I can say "" go watch Yarno Opmeers newest my team/co-op video and I can garantee you that you will see him run into a game bug. Yarno likes to do last to first and logically you think ""might as well race with fresh engines every race"" right? well i hope you like DNFing because a bug in the game (it works properly for some people and they NEVER have issue and other it never does) makes it so that when all fresh components are put into the car it WILL get an engine failure regardless of the chance(meaning if engine failures are turned on). The AI drive through you and are beyond fast in some areas and seconds off the pase in others. Now for the big issue, cheating is everywhere. Its so bad that we see evidance of pros cheating in esports and leagues and whats better is that there is 0 anticheat in this game... Youre telling me that a multibillion dollar company like EA couldnt throw them a bone and give codemasters access to EAs anticheat? Shit even Rocket League has epic games easy anticheat and its not even possible to cheat in rocket league. I mean the cheating is so bad that leagues like WOR and PSGL have already ended the league for this game while on f1 21 there were league races uptil 2-3 weeks before the release of f1 22. Do you now see how incompitent the devs were this year? and to make things 10x worse, as the f1 23 IRL cars were being shown codemasters 'collaborated' with alpha romeo to add the 2023  alpha romeo's F1 car to f1 22 for the players to 'enjoy'... You want to know what it was? A reskinned alpha romeo 2022 car... So you have the time to not only release a livery that no one asked for and released it in a manner that made people think that we would get to see what the f1 23 cars would feel like( at least beta version) but you add this useless thing that can only be used offline not only that, you ignore all the issues above. BUT HEY AT LEAST WE HAVE F1 LIFE RIGHT?

I can deal with a bug here or there, shit i think fallout 76 was BAD and i still played for a long while but wow this game pushed me to look for alternitives. I got into iracing and ACC, Id rather learn a new class of motorsport than play f1 22. I am not buing f1 23 until at least 2 months after it releases and if i watch youtube videos and see same shit different game im done with it.

From the moment you launch the game, the attention to detail is astounding. The graphics are stunning and the attention to detail in the tracks, cars, and weather conditions is simply remarkable.

The gameplay itself is top-notch, providing a true-to-life racing experience that puts you right in the driver's seat. The controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing you to push your car to the limit and make split-second decisions that can make or break your race.

What I particularly appreciate about F1 22 is the level of customization it offers. You can fine-tune your car to your heart's content, tweaking everything from the engine performance to the tire pressure. This level of customization adds an extra layer of depth to the game, allowing you to tailor your driving experience to your preferences.

The multiplayer mode is also a standout feature, with seamless matchmaking and a vibrant online community. Racing against real people adds an extra level of excitement to the game, and the competitive nature of online play is sure to keep you coming back for more.

Overall, I would highly recommend F1 22 to anyone who loves racing games, or anyone looking for a challenging and immersive gaming experience.

If not for this I'd be fine with the game however as it stands it seems to be a dice roll for some.

I'm not sure what is causing the issue but as far as I have seen codemaster and EA haven't acknowledged it as a bug even though there are multiple posts regarding this on both the steam forum and EA's. Unfortunately none of the fixes found by others have worked for me. I'll put my PC spec below in case this is caused by a certain hardware combo but I doubt that.

Went and watched Lando Norris and the Quadrant guys on YouTube and they've got dozens of ""We had our own <country name> grand prix"" and they looked like they had fun, no-one was complaining about bugs/gameplay/handling. Figured they wouldn't make those videos with something that's unplayable, so gave it the ol' 2 hour try and it's great! There's lots of settings to customise difficulty, including AI on a big sliding scale, and you can reasonably quickly find your level of difficulty and desired challenge.

There are some things that do annoy - F1 Life, super cars and PitCoin transactions - but they're easily skipped/ignored and you can just move into career mode/time trials/whatever floats your boat. There's enough challenge there to keep you coming back for more.

EA.
The influence of EA is clear in the games, with the addition of F1 LIFE and Supercars, soundtracks, and a very ""EA"" menu. Microtransactions come in the form of PitCoin. But moving on to the gameplay itself, that's where I really like this game.

The graphics are spot on, nice shadows and backgrounds. Unlike any other game, there isn't a blurry image found if you look closely into the background, instead, the scenery remains clean as ever. However, the car itself looks too animated in my opinion.

The gameplay has drastically changed due to 2022's new regulations and cars. As soon as you start driving, you can feel how understeery and heavy the new cars are, and the devs did an amazing job of implementing that.

F1 LIFE feels a bit unnecessary, and I don't think F1 fans were expecting that, including me. I was hoping for a new feature for racing itself. MyTeam and Career are pretty much the same other than department events and starting points. I haven't tried VR yet.

Overall, with new tracks and menus, F1 22 seems like a definete improvement and fun to play, just like F1 2021. However, nothing drastic has changed, and I think people were wanting a big change. I would reccommend to those who want to have new cars and have fun with updated content, but those who only want to spend money on a huge and rebuilt game, wait for a sale.

AI is overly aggressive in corners and tends to outright ignore you if you aren't the host of a session.
F1 Life. It's pointless and no fun. Not adding it to F1 23 would already be a big plus point.
Gamebreaking bugs because of bad rule execution (such as all AI getting disqualified or overtaking a DNF car counting as illegal overtake that you can't undo)

As a casual player who plays on a controller mostly with medium AI or Co-op the experience was quite straightforward and fun. The game is superbly optimised and runs well even on older hardware. DLSS and FSR are also present which is appreciated. The handling is quite different from previous installments which is the major reason for the bad ratings, it is a lot stiffer and takes a while to get used to. Personally after tweaking the handling saturation and linearity settings it doesn't feel that bad anymore, but again I'm not the one who tries to set lap world records or something.


The additional My Life stuff though seems typical EA crap, could have been implemented well like say Test Drive Unlimited did in the past but it's pointless here. Same with the supercar hotlap stuff which is obviously half assed and feels like a mobile game feature. Haven't faced any major bugs yet except one- the menu overlay gets stuck if you change some graphics settings which may require force closing the game.

For me it is the ONLY way to play this game.  (Even though yeah, the implementation of VR here is buggy, a bit jittery, and feels like an afterthought.  The ability to see the track with both eyes, judge distances and apexes, glance at the VR wheel to see what gear you're in, and with a decent force-feedback wheel feel when the tires start to break away from the pavement when you push things just a bit too hard... wow.  In a word... wow!)

So I thought why not buy it on sale...

And boy was I glad I did. I have DD steering wheel (the Logitech G Pro one), and WOW, the feedback feels amazing. I can't remember driving trials for ages just because I enjoyed it so much. This is a driving game for drivers. I love the fact that it's a bit more on the sim side (the back can slip out if you gas it too much). I also have VR, and while I haven't tried it yet, I will do  sometime soon.

I haven't played a lot of simulators, but this game is the most realistic that I have ever experienced. The amount of details that affect the game is huuge; The tyre's pressure, the height of the floor, the pressure on the wings and etc. 

Also, it is a lot of fun to play and go through the tracks where the real f1 championships take place. I started to watch the real f1 races with more interest and deeper understanding and because of the game I became able to recognize the tracks on different videos in a few seconds and it gives me chills. 

However, the game is not without the issues. I have different cases with bugs that really annoys the gaming process. For example the issue with tyres; sometimes the tyre compound that you have chosen before the pit stop doesn't want to change, the game instead gives you the compound that it wanted itself. Another issue with the right compounds is that sometimes the game doesn't give you an access to dry compounds even though there is no rain on the track. You can fix it if its the single company by just rebooting the game, but if it's an online cooperative, you just need to put up with it and carry on playing. Also, I had a case where Ricciardo with McLaren didn't start after the green lights and the safety car wasn't going out at all. I had a case where I couldn't change the crazy recommended strategy with like 5 pit stops. 

Also, I didn't understand why they took out the opportunity to control the fuel compound during the race as it was in f1 20.

However, I would still recomend the game, especially for those who love real f1.",1680382401,1680382401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

37 hours in, I found racing in Assetto corsa to be really helpful in getting better for F1 22. I recommend going for both games and appreciate F1 incredible grip even more.

PROS:
-Awesome graphics (if you have the muscle for them)
-Car control is just what you would expect/want from a SIM
-Every 2022 track and a bit more

CONS:
-Game AI it's complete junk. They ram you over, push you out of the track, I've even been overtaken during safety car...
- Ruling AI is garbage. Don't expect accuracy to the 2022 rule book regarding brake zones, space, corner cutting, etc cause that is gone
- You can just tune ""1 to 5 downforce/top speed"" slider. No more fine tuning for hardcore fans.

Overall, it's just an arcade racer with SIM controls. If you play with friends (more than 3) you can totally enjoy this game.

That's because its the same exact game.  Everything is basically copy pasted from old game with different car models and different graphics and colors. F1 life is something new sure, but who tf actually cares. It's more for EA to charge you for cosmetics than something that anyone likes. 

What I was really hoping for that could actually make this game a lot better was VR support. While VR works, there are a lot of game crashes that occur with high graphics settings. I know I could probably just lower all my graphics settings to the minimum, but this shouldn't be a thing for a game this big backed by a company so big. Don't come at me with ""your pc s***"" because I have a 3080 and i9 intel cpu, 32 gb ram, and a lot of storage on an nvme ssd. And yes I made sure my drivers were always up to date. 

One thing that was actually good about this game was cross play compatibility. I didn't play on it much so I cannot attest to  its reliability but it exists. I only have 28 hours on this game, but that's because I had over 700 hours on F1 2021 and wanted more out of this game. I am writing this review after a long period of not playing so the game crashes might be fixed, but I doubt it after reading other reviews.

Overall F1 is a good game to play if you really enjoy F1, but it really sucks when the same game keeps getting released and you have to pay $60 every year for nothing new.

This is the first Codemasters F1 game I am not recommending in my entire life. There is a lot of work needed for Codemasters to do to make F1 23 a product worth buying. I am not keeping my hopes up though considering EA's reputation of ruining content of gamestudios they acquire.

I'll start with the positive features. The warm-up lap is the best feature they've added in the game. It feels more immersive and allow you to properly warm your tires for the start. The pitstop overhaul also makes me feel in control of the process more. Besides that the co-op career feature is also fantastic if you play with friends. 

Unfortunately the cons are too many for me to recommend this product. Let's start with the features that should never have been in the first place. F1 life is absolutely atrocious and a ploy to enable more microtransaction sales. This smells like EA all over it. If I want to simulate the life of a rich douche I can play GTA online and have way more fun out of it. The supercar addition was also simply bad. They handle way worse than F1 cars in a hotlap and aren't even available for a race. If I want to race in a supercar I can play Assetto Corsa and have way more fun out of it. Classic cars were a great formula. I can't see why they would deviate from this.

AI behaviour was never excellent in F1 games, but it seems way worse than previous installments. The straight line speed of AI is way too quick for some reason. Especially with DRS being less powerfull it is very hard to keep up with AI on straights. Overtake manouvres from AI are downright suicidal. They block space when you're side by side and the risk of being punted is always there. Control of the car has vastly deteriorated. Even with diff on 50% it is way too easy for wheelspin to kick in. It has gone to the point where I hardly can finish a long race without spinning when traction control is off.
The penalty system also needs a major overhaul especially on multiplayer. I have gotten brake checked multiple times by drivers because they couldn't hold me off. They never get a penalty for it. Then again I am suicidal for joining open lobbies in the first place.

I wish I could say that this will get better, but you and I know it not to be true.

No. Its still after almost a year a buggy mess that EA isnt fixing at all, drivers dissapearing from the grid, the game corrupting your save files. Its not a nice experience. If you want too buy a good f1 game: f1 2020 through a key on steam bcs this mess is just completly ridiculous. Okay the My team is funny for a while until you upgrade the brakes, DO NOT UPGRADE THE BRAKES, the car feels forrible for some reason and no one knows why. So conclusion if you LOVE the f1 branche and want too play with the New era cars, sure go ahead and buy this. If you want a nice game: f1 2020 or assetto corsa with mods.

3 seasons down 3 team and drivers titles and just under 400 hours insane for me but to say the least the only issue i have and assists maybe the issue is the difficulty is a little touch on the career side not so much grand prix side but car wise after the first year it gets a bit trickier on where to set it and this is both team and striaght career side issue but it could also be my assists or my setups i dont know at this point but this game is so much better then the previous one by a large margin which in of itself is why i recommend this game
Another 1000 hours in the third consecutive f1 game for me i love this game probably to much but it doesnt bother me because f1 is the only sport i back so yeah im happy with the time ive spent in this game and heres to hopefully a brighter future for the gaame",1658003116,1680209377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2022 is extremely bloated with features nobody who is into racing is interested in (furniture, ambience, lifestyle...).
At the same time, it is very buggy, seemingly no longer maintained. The online experience - the great feature which is strongly advertised - is often frustrating. The servers are at their limits, lagging while having a strong internet connection. Getting times confused during races, get stuck before entering the lobby, after entering the lobby and during races. Very taxing! The fun factor goes down the drain with all these frustrating imperfections of the game. 2018 is the only F1 game that was/is fun and mostly working just fine. Very sad indeed. Can the developers not just go back to the basic needs of a true racing game and, what is even more important, keep improving it by fixing imperfections and providing regular updates. To me, this game was rushed out, cashed in for and forgotten. I expect the next games in this series to be at least as sloppily coded and maintained as the curent version.

I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this game because it's not even close to worth it. it's full of very simple bugs so you experience a bug almost every race.

examples of bugs i experience:
- Not getting resource points while i do make it to the program.
- Not getting the right tires in a practice sesion.
- When i retired from the sesion. the game suddenly said that a friend of mine had quit the session and it 
  became a big mess.
on top of that, a number of small bugs that keep recurring.

conclusion,
save your money and buy the previous game. EA put their name on it and they messed up. If the new game also sucks like that you don't have to wake me up for it.

Holy fuck the music got old real fast. I HATE it. Disregard where I've noted it as a positive selling point. Real people don't listen to this kind of music. Also the game is still the same stuttering piece of shit as it was on release day.
[b][u]THE TAKE-AWAY[/u][/b]: All indicators point to F1 23 being the same piece of shit game as this :(. F1 fans deserve better. Seriously we deserve better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

[b]UPDATE/TL:DR[/b]
Game stutters so much during a medium race--even with the best car on track I am dead last. Fuck microstutters and fuck EA and fuck Codemasters and you know what? Fuck F1 bosses for licensing worst-in-class video games. Will not play this anymore until (if) patch comes. Game's been out for almost a week (3 day EA), and they haven't even acknowledged any major issues they are critically working on. Fuck these thieves and thank [i][b]you[/b][/i] for reading.

[b]Negatives[/b]
-Crashes super fucking often
-Stuttering lots of stuttering on high end system
-Pirelli Hot Laps are bad jokes
-Will Buxton still wears too much jewlery

After two hours I assumed that the GTX1080 was just not up to the job even though I was getting 60-70 fps in everything else I could not manage anything more than 35fps with low settings which made F1 22 unplayable.

Fast forward five months and after an upgrade to an RTX 2080ti (where the performance of the other games jumped to 80-100 fps with high/ultra settings) I noticed this was on sale with an 84% discount - well, long story short its a turd of a game for anyone not running the very latest kit - I could barely get 48 fps and the shocking head movement performance is stuttery and not what I expected.

Even though it was only £7.99 I requested a refund - but the bots at Steam (I don't think they have any real people) decided that as the total play time for the game was over their 2 hours the refund was refused - so warning, unless you have 3080/3090/4080/4090 if you want to run this in VR forget it.

Its a pity as the graphical look and feel of the static stuff is really nice - although I cannot understand why in VR the cut scenes are on a flat screen that you site 10"" from......its VR guys !",1679573281,1679573281,False,1,1,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

The VR is great. Super smooth with no hiccups, which is what I would expect from codemasters as they implemented VR in Dirt Rally 1 & 2 really well, perhaps the only Triple A dev team to achieve this in any game so far(there are other great VR games but rarely made well by larger studios).
On top of that, it works perfectly with my fanatec DD pro. But the game only really accels when combined with my DIY sim using simtools. With the extra movement and feedback (2dof with traction loss) the game really comes into it's own & is quite the experience.

Now I'm sure there are questionable features (f1 life, etc) but I tend to ignore such things and just go for the experience & for me at least, the game is very good.

[b] LETS GET TO THE GOOD PART FIRST [b]
Graphics are amazing everything looks beautiful and so does the car. I would Recommend this game if you are either New to F1 Games or still using assists in throughout F1 BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS ON SALE. The Main Menu Looks amazing and easier to access everything so easily which is great. It is still a racing games you can still have fun alone or with your friends and you can always be faster with every step you take or lap you race. Career modes are still good however there are not much changes ever since the previous title but still good im okay with that


The Bad and the UGLY


This game is really not a fun game for those who have been playing without Traction Control for their years in playing F1. Its easier to spin in slow corners or slow to medium corners and sometimes you its very hard to predict if you are going to loose your rear wheels from that slight difference in racing line or throttle based on the last lap or other laps you have been doing. BTW if you want to be faster, just turn on assists you be more consistent and slow corners dont scare you 

AI Is a Nightmare 
they are still fast in straights and exits, VERY aggressive and yet superbly dumb if they face a problem in front of them and you will never ever be on their level if you ever try to follow their exit speed (closest you can do if you have assist). If you want to play co-op with your friends then you better even lower the AI difficulty as they maybe slow in the corners but you are fighting a straight line speed of 10 level difficulty ahead from the difficulty you choose for the AI 

Online Play
Yeah ...nah dont even bother..... just dont Bugs and everything

EA Play
Yeah you are not going to touch it. Its more like dipping your toes in the water on swimming pool that is only 1cm deep. Its just  THERE WHAT CAN YOU EVEN DO?!?!

Ouh and the Music? 70% of the songs are weird (not to my taste) or just so bad 


Conclusion :
Veterans stay away if you have not bought this game or sim hardcore fans the Bugs alongside the traction in this game are not worth your money and time 

New or returning Players it is fine for you to try out this game as long as you do not try online features so early in the game and immerse yourself into the F1 Game as long as you could handle the Bugs or ruthless AI",1679457729,1679490834,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

When Codemasters was first bought by EA back in February of 2021, people were worried and rightly so.
EA is a company known to prioritise profits over enjoyment of the game. As long as you give them your money, they don't care whether you enjoy the game or not. And now, we have the first game that has been fully developed until the EA umbrella, and it's terrible.

[b]F1 Life[/b]

EA had to add some way to make money using in-game purchases, so they impulsively added F1 life, where you can decorate your own apartment, own super-cars and live the life of a f1 driver when they're not racing. Conveniently enough, you could also buy all of these accessories and supercars using pitcoins, which you can buy on the store. 

Why are there even supercars in a Formula 1 game in the first place, I bought this game to race with Formula 1 cars, not supercars. It is also strange how you removed classic cars, which was one of my favourite features in F1 2020. CODEMASTERS PLEASE ADD BACK CLASSIC CARS

[b]Handling[/b]

The handling of the cars are so unrealistic. Even real formula 1 drivers say that using medium traction control is more realistic to real life than without traction control. Every time you get on the throttle in the lower gears, it's like playing a game of cat and mouse. Are you going to spin or not? Before the patch some time ago, the handling was much better and true to real life, as it wasn't as easy to spin out but now we have to go into fifth gear just to not get wheelspin. COME ON GUYS.

[b]Bugs & Not listening to their community[/b]

Every year, somehow Codemasters makes the same game every year more buggier than the one before. Before EA came into the picture, F1 2020 had beta testing, where avid f1 fans could test out the games for bugs before its public release. However, EA does not do beta tests therefore the game was only given to influencers and esports drivers before release! This resulted in the game being very buggy on release. The AI had some ridiculous straight-line speed which made competing in career mode almost impossible especially in later seasons. Tyre allocation for medium tyres was broken as well, fps affects physics. The colour of the red bull was not even accurate, and there was a prominent audio bug. These issues did not take a few weeks to patch either, these took multiple months. And even their 'patches' had their side affects, as they had to change the handling to fix the AI's speed.

[b]Other issues[/b]

[list]
[*] Codemasters recycles the same game every single year, and only minor changes are added every year (Sometimes they remove features!). The game is getting pricer every year, yet we are getting less features, great.
[*] The Racing isn't fun anymore. The AI on this years game is stupider than it's ever been. Online is still a wreckfest and more than it's ever been. Slipstream and DRS aren't strong enough, so it's harder to overtake on the straights.
[*] Cheating in esports is starting to become more prominent because of the lack of anticheat.
[*] VR is terrible, and they should've focused on other features. They even had the audacity to ask the community to nominate it for VR game of the year, and considering the comments on that post it didn't go down too well.

I wanted to love this game, I preordered it ASAP, and I was avidly watching all of the videos on the game. I had high hopes, and I thought this game would be great. My disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined when I saw F1 Life and the bugs. This game is not worth the £69.99 I paid for it on release. Yeah sure, it may be worth £5 but it's the same game every year, and I'm getting bored and sick of it. The only way to make codemasters and ea change is to not buy the game, which is what I'll be doing until the series noticeably improves. 

If you want a good codemasters f1 game, buy 2020/2021 or find f1 2013 somewhere else, you'll thank me later.",1679451283,1679451283,False,1,0,0.507494628429412842,0,True,False,False

As a top-tier nostalgia(fguy), who holds games like Wipeout, Nascar Thunder, Need for Speed 3, and Rollcage 2 as an untouchable ideal (mistakenly, and foolishly), I have to say this...

Use a wheel. Turn up the volume. Run a race or two. Watch the replay. Understand F1 prior to doing so.

This blows all that nostalgia BS out of the water. All these people whining about glitches don't even understand how good this is, but you have to use a wheel. No controller. Just my opinion, the force feedback and wheel is what makes the F1 2022 experience. I use a G920, cheap Logitech wheel I got secondhand for 80 bucks or something. Worth it. Without it, the controller experience is just not how this is meant to be played imo.

I've played a few sims... Automobilista2, Asseto Corsa, Rfactor2, Asseto Competitione, Dirt 2...Gt7?

This might not be a perfect sim of F1 cars in the current year, but IDK... the pure exhileration of the driving experience feels futuristic to me. Feels almost faster and more heart-pumping than something like Wipeout Remastered or whatever... the entire package you get in this (10 dollar on sale right now) game is actually mindblowing. It's FUN. It's a FUN game that FEELS fast, has incredible replay and general immersion features (announcers, EA style sports game features, etc) and just makes the whole thing amazing. Is it perfect, is it a 400 IQ simulation... no...

Game force opens an EA login in a browser every time you open the game or return to the main menu, even if you only ever want to play single player modes offline.

On first open, the game immediately makes you pick a supercar, despite this being a FORMULA ONE game.

Then it drops you into F1 Life, which is a load of pointless wankery. I'm here to race cars, not design a house.

There's a long, unskippable cut-scene when you start career mode. I watched the entire 2022 season, I don't need it hyped/explained again.

When you finally make it onto the track, the cars handle like absolute garbage. Changing assist settings does absolutely nothing to fix this. Changing car setup does not help either; now you're on ice skates, but slower. Maybe it would be better with a wheel but, considering this game has a supposedly ""casual"" mode, it should work properly with a controller.

not even going to mention the bugs because i cannot believe how they keep coming. a game that has generally been the same gameplay with the same physics parameters from 2019 can be broken more and more every year. its an achievement honestly. in relation to the physics, the car handles like a fidget spinner no matter what kind of setup i try and no matter how gentle i am on the throttle. i am sure even though there has been a huge technical / regulation change, the car does not feel like this in real life -- drivers have said in the past that the cars have way more grip in real life than what it has in the game. there's so much more that i don't even remember from the top of my head because this game has really brought me and my friends more suffering than joy

also, don't get me started on the blatant removal of GOOD and almost ESSENTIAL FEATURES from the game, like showing the delta time from previous lap to the current and the simple ""Join Game"" option to let me join my friends' multiplayer lobbies on the Steam overlay. removing these and Braking Point (something that had a lot of potential tbh), fine, but what the f*** even is F1 Life?? how is that at all related to F1?? can you please spend the time developing all these bs to actually improving the game?

in conclusion, me and my friends never had a simulation game where i can be so frustrated within 10 minutes of gameplay, and further considering the fact that there wasn't much changes in the concept of the game since 5 years ago. if this review blows up and those reading that are considering to buy this game, PLEASE do not. PLEASE buy F1 2021 (i would say 2019 and 2020 as well, because they were genuinely good games WITH, i must emphasise, CLASSIC CARS as well; BUT EA has sneakily removed all of the older games from the Steam store).

The AI is..fine-ish, the handling doesn't feel as good as 2020 (to me at least, on controller,) but it might be better to you. Maybe check out 2021 or 2020 if you can, and maybe try to get one of those two if you don't care about the online public races aspect too much.

The good, though: 
* It is fun to hop in and go nyoom with funni Formula cars
* The graphics are pretty decent, maybe not ground-breaking, but they suit a modern game.
* Soundtrack is pretty solid, it's a vibe. 
* There are lots of settings you can change, so if you're like me and suck at games and don't want to mald because you're being rekt by AI- you can make it so that the AI are basically just high-speed obstacles at worst.
* This doesn't require Origin to play, unlike other EA titles.
*(I guess this is a technical positive) Due to the fact this is obviously the most recent release, there are more lobbies to get into. Just stay in lobbies with ghosting enabled, you will be PIT-maneuvered every other turn otherwise.

The bad:
* The AI, on various difficulties, can sometimes make only ""artificial "" fitting in A.I. By this, I mean they can make very dangerous/dumb moves against a player. Though you could argue that's just called racing, I call it a flashback moment (to a certain extent.)
* The FIA. Okay so maybe I should elaborate- there are times where the game may falsely register an illegal move or contact (should said rules be enabled,) and has happened to me a couple of times. Not the worst thing, but it can happen.
*Public racing lobbies are not that great, even if they are more active. But that's just general online racing outside of more ""sim-racer""-esk communities, I think. Also, it sort of feels awkward with a lot of waiting just trying to actually get into the race, let alone getting into a race and it being so outlandishly jank. In short on this point: I feel like I could find better lobbies for games from 2010 and have an easier, and more fun time playing with whoever I end up with on there.

The..Neutral?:
* The handling. When I wrote my original version of this review, it was based on my experience of having only played this one particular F1 game. Having played F1 2020 now, my take on this is that there is more of a grippy feel (..with full-trac-control), but that it also feels like there's less control- like it is more on-rails than 2020. In 2020 for example, you can take a corner (at least as I perceive it, I'm no game journalist, much less a fully credible reviewer) at a much higher speed, and as long as you can steer appropriately into the turn, you come out mostly unscathed. In this game, you take that same concept- and you will absolutely run off the course if you're going a few kmph too fast. Now, somehow the reverse is true on just medium traction control, where it feels like you can counter-steer loss of traction in 2020, but here you start a spin- and it ends a 180, or 360, no argument to be had. Unfortunately I cannot speak on no traction control as I have very little experience with it (much less in this game, unsurprisingly.)
* The ability to customize a personal penthouse..or whatever. It acts as a showroom for your supercars at most, and is maybe or maybe not new to this game (this part I have not looked into) but it exists. It would be cool if there didn't seem to be clear issues with the game which could've had more focus put onto that, but on the other hand, maybe those got through the crack of testing entirely.
*AI are more likely to make mistakes/take worse lines. While for the most part this counts as a good thing, as battling AI in 2020 becomes a bit of a waiting game on when you can get to a straight, probably with DRS, and make a very basic pass, here AI feel more human-like, they make mistakes. Or at least certainly more noticeable ones that you can capitalize on. Though, they can happen too often according to some people. I'm a bit biased in that the handling in this game compared to 2020 is its own challenge so..eh, I can't complain.

Personally, I don't know if I would suggest buying this game for over..maybe USD$35.
And even that may be a good bit much. 

I hinted earlier I'm new to the F1 racing-scene. Having experience in only one other F1 title, 2020. But, my below recommendations more-so come from a friend who is more-or-less an F1 nerd, and has played more of the game than I. That said, he also recommended 2020 (hence why I have it now,) as well as 2021...as opposed to 2022. Now both 2020 and 2021 have their own benefits, thus I recommend checking them both out and seeing the content/features of each, and choosing from there.

turning wide outside the racing line to avoid contacts.
2 people touch my sidepods and rear but somehow i didnt get any damage.
THESE NEW STEWARDS DECIDED TO GIVE ME A FKIN 5 SECONDS TIME PENALTY FOR CAUSING COLLISION. GREAT i think i shouldve just stay playing rank match on F1 LIFE.

i think this will be my last F1 for now, im going to skip F1 23 i guess. if i get it for 70% off ill take it,
also bring back classic cars like in 2020 and special events to relive the classics.

Not to mention it crashes so often in vr it wouldnt be worth it even if it was smooth. As someone who used to do full length races on f12020, theres no way im investing an hour into a race just to have it crash. 

Even with a high end sim rig its like driving on ice. How many years do the actual F1 drivers have to steer clear of this game before someone with half a brain at codemasters thinks maybe its time to change it up and make it idk... not bad.

Does not have classic cars nor a story campaign like the one in F1 21, which was actually very good in my opinion - story was something that kept me moving forward, but it was the challenge that kept me highly motivated.

I see that F122 has middling reviews, but I don't think it's warranted. The meat and potatoes of the series - the Career mode, as always is still intact, and it's the main game mode for most gamers like myself. 

Controller feedback is amazing. The way the rumble and haptic triggers work (on both Xbox Series and Dual Sense) is supremely well done - you can feel your car reacting to various surfaces. Probably the best implementation of controller feedback in any racing game till date.

Then something between the game and Steam VR pukes and it freeze. And before any of you hard ware trolls, I rock a 3080, so it's not my set up. 

That aside, this game is fun, I just wish the VR worked smoother. Maybe allow Open VR? or Oculus VR? do not' force Steam VR? Not sure if that would make it better or not. I just notices that my other Racing titles that use anything BUT Steam VR fair better. 

A last minor gripe. It's an F1 game. Let it be that. I don't need a story mode, I don't need super cars (those are  handled  a million times better in ACC, RF2 etc). I just want to hop in race in F1 or Build a team without endless side games and dumb pop up for micro transactions.

I have spend the last 3 hours trying to not only get the dang thing to start ( after multiple setting changes and going offline in steam later I got it to start) it wont even connect to my racing wheel set up (Thrustmaster Ts-xw) nor any of my controllers. So what i have got is another worthless EA game that only works on a keyboard. When you purchase a game on sale or not you shouldnt have to make changes to everything just to play the D*** thing. Its ridiculous. Think I'm being a baby or just complain to complain?? Then google search F1 22 problems. Hopefully others have better luck than I did but from what ive read and seen.

No matter if you're a seasoned F1 player sooner or later you will suffer with wheelspin in the 2022 iteration of this game, and im not talking about skill, it is imbeded in the game code that the minimum amount of wheelspin will cause you to loose races, break your car, etc. Overall the game is the same as the 21 but without a complete and compelling history mode, instead you will get to buy couches, rugs, coffee tables, etc.

I started off with disappointment when the game had a release delay, but when I got to play it I had no trouble with racing. Except when the AI drivers drove through me and threw me into the walls on Jeddah and Bahrain.

I was on vacation for a while and when I came back i couldn't even start the game. I had to literally reset my entire PC to only get into the game. When I first started playing it again, I could only play it for 30 minutes before it crashed. I have had that problem since, and it's the most frustrating when I get a perfect practice session, and when I am in the pits again, it crashes and the practice session has to be done all over again.

So now I'm just playing because I love the high speed drives and because I paid almost $80 for this game. I really hope EA fixes all these tiny frustrating bugs and all these big frustrating fucking game-crashes.

Edit after 110 more hours:

Game is still crashing, but not as much as before. I love the tracks and it's one of my favorite games. I recommend this game only if it's on sale. Here's a little review scale:

Whether it's your corner or not it won't matter because they won't leave you a space and won't get penalized. In fact YOU will probably get penalized. Pro tip: Turn off rules and turn on flashbacks. It's a good game tho because the car is way more driveable than iRacing's W13 (iRacing is my go-to sim).

The cars handle like no F1 car would ever handle too much understeer in fast corners and not enough grip when exiting corners F1 cars behave way smoother when going on throttle you can barely drive these cars without traction control. I advise to the developers to play the iRacing Mercedes cars thats how F1 cars handle they are more realistic and also being easier to drive.

Each year there were upgrades to every aspect of the game.  Whether it was in the car handling or the AI, you always had something to look forward to and be rewarded for when codemasters made a new F1 game.  Codemasters somewhat understood that F1 fans wanted to drive a decently realistic recreation of the F1 cars and get a little taste of what life would be like if you were a driver in the sport.  There were updates each year that made the game feel fresh and new, like classic F1 cars.  This all changed when EA bought codemasters.  EA destroys everything they touch, and this is just another franchise they killed.  The game is unfinished even now with game breaking bugs, and a 'VR' mode that will give you a seizure if you dare look anywhere else other than forwards.  When it was first was announced, I was in denial.  I wanted this game to be great.  There were a lot of promises made about the changes to gameplay and career mode, but when I downloaded the game I got F1 21 with couches and a broken VR mechanic.  Instead of classic cars, we got supercars that EA didn't even care to finish the interior models on, and oh they make you pay for all of them but one.  Somehow the supercars feel worse than the F1 cars too, driven them feels like they copied a need-for-speed car and slapped it into the game.  Classic EA story, guy into a sport/entertainment franchise they don't understand (or care to understand) and try and make you pay as much money as possible for day 1 promises that you thought were going to be included with the base game.  This review is only scratching the surface of the game too.  But I've seen enough of this game so far that I know it cannot be fixed, nor are they going to try to fix it, and I believe the game series is now doomed.  Too bad all the 'drive to survive' fans are going to eat this up as a 'fun game' because 'netflix docco exciting'.

Pros:
- Graphically the game did not make any big steps from F1 2021 but it didn´t need to because these games look very pretty. 
- Licenced music in the Menu. The music chosen to be in the main menu ist very nice and I like the fact that you can select which track is in the playlist and which not.
- F1 Live is pretty unnecessary but it was quite nice to try for 10 min
- The Supercars where fun to drive but not very realisitc to drive

Cons:
It came out almost unplayable in Custom Multiplayer Lobbies. There were servere Bugs like Soundbugs, Setting Bugs, Disconnects, Desync, PitStop Bugs and not to mention the bugs that were in the game before for almost 5 years now. 
- At realese the driving model was pretty good imo but was patched to absolute trash. 
- The car does not feel well, the car drives not predictable at all
- bugs mentioned where not patched until now
- The Sound of the cars is ok in the first person but absolute trash in spectator mode. It does not sound like an F1 Car at all.

I've put about 70 hrs in, 20 in career, 50 hrs in online-racing and from that 50 hrs probably 45 hrs was waiting for lobbies, getting kicked out by the game servers, lobby's being bugged - it is an absolute nightmare. And that is just the lobby-search. It cost hours  and nerves of my life I will never get back, I screamed and shouted at this game more times than I can count and I'd say Im a pretty patient person.

The gameplay itself feels horrid. Unrealistic car-behaviour, it doesn't feel like a single-seater at all (i'd recommend iRacing... but even Mario Kart feels more realistic at this point in time). 
AI is just (no matter the AI strenght, Im playing on 90-110 mostly but it happens at 30 as well) faster than you on straights, doesn't matter if you DRS open or you're draining the battery, the AI will beat you on every straight in this game, so you gotta accept it. With that being bad enough, the AI has absolutely unrealistic amounts of grips accelerating out of corners and turns where it's just impossible to keep up in 80% of the races - the 20% where you can keep up it's either cutting corners and turning into you in turns to take you out or even with corner cutting, youre just not quick enough.

Career mode is more than lackluster, but hey, we got a playerhousing mode which no one that cares for a racing-game experience was asking or hoping for and it is exactly one thing - completely useless.

I regret spending any money at all at this game, which can be understood as the underlining of EA games - An absolute failure with the solemn goal to make money and not providing a good experience for players.

No.

dont get me wrong well done ea it looks good but it doesnt hide the game breaking issues this game has.

i shall list issues in the game that i know of:
Bugged tyre strategy and no mandatory tyre in races.
AI will dive bomb from way too far back. (sometimes will hit the player out the way)
AI speed on the straights is just.....
broken sector 1 and sometimes 2 times in multiplayer
dry condition FFB is so bad
saftey car not going back into the pits
servers..... yep the servers... ahhh
random players kicked entering a online race
zandvoort kicking most if not all console players on race loading
you can have too many friends and your list wont load
random save game corruptions
vr just the whole of vr
sometimes my team breaks after contract renewal
later myteam or driver career season quali doesnt work correct resulting in cars like redbul for some reason not setting more laps
in game mail disapears randomly
handling model is so inconsistent
curbs on higher fps is worse
not a bug but why is their chairs in a f1 game
r&d in some seasons will reways fail
audio stuttering
formation laps dont do anything to tyres (aka tyre temp reset between formation and race start
ai get stuck on grid causing everyone dsq
not able to change trye allocation in career modes
cheating
f1 has major graphical bluring and smeering

Career mode,
The AI is broken. The developers couldnt be bothered to train decent AI so they just gave them extra grip. This means that they are quicker out of corners which give them a significant advantage over the player, but the AI's are so terrible that even though they literally have cheats, they still need help to battle players, so the developers gave them insane straight line speed. Even with the fastest car you will struggle to keep up with the AI on the straights. Besides that there is nothing. Career mode hasnt been changed at all since 2020, its just gone backwards.
Multiplayer
Its as bad as its ever been, public lobbies are full of crash prone kids that just want to make you miserable. But the servers have gotten worse since last game. So its not exactly the same. Multiplayer has the same bugs as last game, like freezing lobbies and lagging cars.
Physics
With the new regulations the game's physics model had to change. Had to, but they didnt change it at all. They just gave the cars less front end grip to simulate real life. You can test this out by messing around with the ride height of the car. Changing ride height doesnt affect downforce, despite the fact that the new regulations make the car generate the majority of their downforce by making the car sit low to the ground so ground effect can generate downforce. In game its not like that.

To sum it up: The game is bad. The developers dont change anything and the game just keeps getting worse. I mean seriously how can you mess up something you dont change? The game has been the same for the past 7 years(I'm not kidding you can check the game's files, the folders containing the teams are still dated back to several years. Alpine=renault, Aston=Force india ect) Really unfortunate that the devs exploit our love for F1, they know we will buy whatever dogshit they put in front of us. Because we love F1.

Its first of all, not realistic at all. And yes, its not advertised as a racing sim. Its an arcade after all. But there is a big difference between an F1 arcade and a handling model that is garbage on a next level. This game made long time esporters quit the game because its so bad. Secondly, there are so many stupid bugs. And its missing too many features. There is not option to turn off certain penalties, there is no anti-cheat system, there are no consequences for deliberately crashing into people in online races, there are no classic cars, no option to do reverse track layout races or alternate layouts. And the features it does have are just boring. No one cares about F1 life, no one cares about sports cars, especially not if you buy the game because you want to drive F1 cars. Its literally in the games name. No one wants to drive sport cars, especially not if the handling is even further off than the F1 cars themselves. The game has just been going downhill since EA took over. EA is literally the killer of games. They are too busy with greed, just make a good game for once. And no one cares if that means that there will only be a new game every 3 years or so. Just add updates and cosmetic stuff and you will make the money that way. Keeping a playerbase happy is more important than cashing in every year. And about the playerbase, listen to them for once. You're getting plenty of feedback, even from esporters. And its like you are all ignoring it completely. Create a team dedicated to finding out what the players want and then actually implement it into the game. I would not recommend this game to anyone.

- Every AI driver is Stroll, always trying to be better but essentially just ruining the race for every other driver in the track

If you're a follower of the franchise, you're going to buy it anyways, but as a game, F1 22 doesn't really add up that much on top of F1 2021, funny enough, F1 2020 was better than 2021 too, as an F1 game of course.

I said ""as an F1 game of course"" because F1 franchise pretty much became FIFA. You're going to buy the new game one way or another because that'll be the one everybody's playing as soon as it comes out. It's just in sports games' nature. F1 22 adds things like F1 Life, where you customize your driver's lifestyle with supercars, house decorations, licensed clothing etc. but for an F1 game, these really don't add anything. I'd much prefer the classic F1 cars and the invitation events with them from the older games over any supercars in the game right now. I mean, supercars are not bad, but there are only a few of them anyways and pretty much the only thing they add into the game is the Pirelli Hot Lap challenges for the career mode, which you mostly skip because they're fun for like 3 challenges and become instantly repetitive, challenging and boring in the same time somehow after that. I honestly do them just for the funding of my fantasy BMW M F1 team.

As for the My Team car customization, it's still really fruitless. They should just leave the paid skin system in the history and switch to the free livery editor system much like every other game with cars in it right now. I mean, it's EA. We're going to have paid customization one way or another but don't limit such an important customization aspect of the game behind it. Players should be able to create their one off liveries with free shapes, patterns and characters. Right now, every My Team/Multiplayer car looks like one another and all of them looks like sh*t. Not only that, but also the fake sponsors look like sh*t either. At least make better logos and choose better names for the fantasy sponsors in the game. Maybe even add ""sponsor decal requirements"" for the My Team mode. More than that, we can really use a free sponsor logo placement either. No matter how many sponsors you put on the car, it always looks dull, empty, like an F4 car.

All and all, I'm giving it a positive review because if you're playing F1, play the latest one. It's not unplayable, it just can be much better. It's worth a try as it's in the EA Play program now. Just don't expect the AI to drive sensibly.",1678421044,1678421044,True,2,1,0.523333311080932617,0,True,False,False

I would say compared to F1 2021 at this moment in time its worth playing that until they fix some of the bugs with the game. Some of the biggest bugs ive encountered at the moment is the fact that Flashbacks sometimes black screen so you can't see where your rewinding to. (im not good at racing games so i use these alot) so its hard to prepare for where you're going to be.
AI dnfing themselves during a safety car by overtaking, is funny, makes life easier but also takes the challenge away. One Race I had the safety car out for 18 laps around Monaco, so i only did one racing lap.

Overall, pick it up if you like the new cars and Haas not to be a backmarker.

Otherwise just play 21

Lets start with the negatives. F1 Life is probably the dumbest thing EA could have added to the game and everyone seems to agree that it doesn't add anything nor is it even fun to interact with. Super cars are cool and all but no one asked for them and you cant even race them against friends online. The only time that you can even use them is in time trail or the pirelli tire challenges that also dont really do anything outside of career modes. On top of theses features there have been plenty of bugs and glitches that make it difficult to even join multiplayer lobbies and leagues. For example, at the games launch my friends and I ran into an issue where the mail would not even load so you couldn't accept invites to leagues or even coop games. Then there is the AI, though this is more a minor gripe. The AI can be very aggressive and sometimes just go side by side with you and each other for multiple corners and on top of that, diving bombing you when there is no need. For the most part I do think the AI is a step up from what it was in 2020 and 2021. Something I would really love to see for F1 23 is an improved replay and spectator system. If you download a replay from a league race or an online race you can not switch your view to another persons view. This is absolutely aggravating because if you wanted to see what some else in the game is doing so you can figure what you can do to do better you can't simply look at what they're doing to learn what you maybe doing wrong. However, you can switch to other perspectives when it's singleplayer or career mode replays which doesn't really help anyone. The customization is lacking and hasn't really changed at all in the last few games. Yes they did add the ability to change the type of finish on the car but players have been wanting similar to GT7 or Forza levels of customization. Also EA, please bring back classic cars and tracks.

Now in terms of positives there really isn't too much. Most of the singleplayer modes that you're probably familiar with such as, My Team and the normal Driver Career modes, Grand Prix and Time Trial. The game adds the Miami track and as well as the changes made to the Abu Dhabi track that were made in the 2021 season that were never fixed in the 2021 game. The cars themselves feel pretty good to drive overall and do feel different from F1 2021. Racing wheel to wheel with friends is just as fun as ever and even battling the AI can be quite the challenge at times. The setups can be adjusted more than 2021 with the wings be the most notable change, being able to go from 0 to 50 on the wings.

As a whole package, F1 22 is ok at best and is still probably your best bet if you are looking for a modern F1 experience as whole. Assetto Corsa may have better physics and may even feel better to drive, but out of the box it doesn't have all the cars, teams, drivers, rules, single and coop career modes, and (after some patches) easy to setup lobbies to race against friends. I would recommend getting this game but ONLY on a sale.",1678290491,1678290491,True,160,6,0.918631672859191895,0,True,False,False

I don't recommend anyone buying right now, even if it would be a special deal. For all the casual players and the ones that don't want to sweat too much - the automatic gears have been completely messed up, which causes you to spin out of every acceleration zone and you are loosing up a second or even more per lap. The car simply won't change from 7th to 8th gear. The AI will blast past you on the straight like racing a jet plane against a propellor plane. Absolutely mad. Bugs everywhere. Disqualifications, deleted laps, simulated laps that are 20 seconds faster than you. It's really a shame considering this rant is coming from someone like me who had always defended codemasters in the past, but this game is seriously lawsuit worthy. Comparable to the early days from cyperbunk. Keep in mind I've spent 60 Euros on this mess! 60 Euros is a lot for everyone, but imagine someone younger spending all his pocket money on this game, just to utterly disappointed and be confronted by such a shitshow. Shame on Codemasters and EA. I won't even mention EA in this rant, because everybody knows that EA is one of the worst companies to ever hit the videogame market. 
I will update this if the future patches change anything, until then seriously don't buy this game!

Edit: 1st of September
After various patches, bug fixes and updates the game is now somehow playable. Still not perfect, but compared to the state when I wrote my review it's a million times better. SO I kinda recommend playing the game now, but there will still be bugs.

Edit: March 2023
I haven't touched the game since December last year. Please don't buy it. F1 2020 and 21 are a million times better. The game was and always will be the worst F1 game only outshined in terms of shitness by f1 2015. F1 22 got no anticheat, no grip and the handling is biblical.

First and foremost, cars feel absolutely horrible. The traction model is one of the worst I've ever experienced: grip is non existent which leads to cars not feeling realistic at all, which multiple F1 and actual drivers agree on. Touching a kerb is almost suicidal. The cars always feel like they are on the verge of spinning, it's really hard to actually try and be on the limit when you cannot consistently rely on the feel of the car, which means you will find yourself in a constant struggle for grip, mainly because of the traction model, but also because of the tire model. 

Secondly, the lack of good FFB makes it even harder to feel and judge the grip of car, which subsequently means you can't be on the limit as consistently as you would like to, but I have already addressed that. FFB feels more like wheel-centering than actual FFB, and the lack of laser scanned tracks probably doesn't help either, which in itself is also another problem, but I personally don't mind hand-modelled tracks as much as the lack of proper FFB.

Last but not least, the amount of issues I have faced in the co-op career mode cannot be numbered using our current numerical system. Game doesn't feel like joining the host, getting stuck in loading screens, getting randomly disconnected, etc.

With all of that being said, I cannot deny that I have had a lot of fun in offline career mode whenever everything goes smoothly. The AI is pretty good, attacks well, defends fairly aggressively, is competitive and fast, overall really good in my opinion. You can definitely have good races. Graphics are also pretty good, and ray tracing adds a nice touch that, in all truth, you will never notice when driving.

I'm not even mentioning the fact that classic cars were removed and instead we now have F1 life and useless sofas that nobody wanted, alongside supercars that nobody ever drives, and can't even race in, but I still feel like the cons (excluding the aforementioned) outweight the pros, mainly because offline is the only way I could make any enjoyment out of this game, since public lobbies are catastrophic, as per tradition.

But that's about the only good thing about it really, and the tracks that also exist in AC: Competizione? They look SIGNIFICANTLY better over there.

Based on playing this mostly with a Simucube 2 Pro + Goodies like Buttkicker and HF8 haptic pad.

Handling is quite decent and ""interesting"" ONLY with the right custom profile in the Simucube 2 ""True Drive Paddock"" app... but handling of a top tier formula car still feels better in any other proper sim (rFactor 2, Automobilista 2, RaceRoom, etc.). Now, every single time I load this game, it insists that I have changed my Simucube bindings before I have a chance to progress to the first interactable screen... I can cancel out those phantom changes without it screwing up my presets, so its not a deal breaker, but it is concerning, and it is annoying.

BUT THEN when I finally get into the game and switch rightwards, over to the only real mode of value: Time Trial... I have to pass by the Championship campaign tab, which always informs me of the exact same initial F1 Life garbage earnings... as in the very first earnings/unlocks from when I first fired up the game... and there are other, frequent minor waiting moments for the game to connect to servers, because this game is infested with a season/battle pass for garbage cosmetics. The pass, and the need to constantly be online to verify and ""reward"" you for grinding around the pass... this basically bloats up the game and slows down the loading process of every ""next screen"". Basically the micro/pass and F1 Life are 100% responsible for your time being wasted via loading delays and other clicking-away of absolutely useless notifications.

And the telemetry is STILL backwards. Codemasters still haven't figured out how to allow their games to communicate with multiple telemetry based apps... so if you have Simhub running a custom dashboard display and you're expecting to use a Buttkicker via the Buttkicker app? The Buttkicker will not receive any data at all. Want to use a Buttkicker with the Next Level HF8 pad at the same time? Only one of those devices will work properly with their respective ""official"" settings apps... but don't worry, because the HF8 app is unstable and F1 22 is not supported yet anyway... and if you have a collection of proper sim racing hardware, you need to do the following: use Simhub for everything.

Simhub is an awesome and superior piece of software, and you can actually setup your Buttkicker, HF8, and whatever other custom arduino devices within Simhub... and even though F1 22 may not have intended to support a number of these devices, you can force it to do so with Simhub grabbing ALL the telemetry data coming out of the game, and gives you FULL access to how/what/where to assign it, if you really want to get into the guts of that sort of thing.

Having said that... the haptic feedback that ultimately comes from F1 22 through the Buttkicker and HF8 is... good, They definitely do the job in giving you a grounded connection to the track and your car... but those haptic bits of data, on the exact same setttings/values/activations inside Simhub, do not feel as refined or ""real"" as they do in any of the following: rFactor 2, AM2, ACC. I'm not saying the haptics feel cheap and nasty... but it does reinforce that Codemasters make Simcade games. I imagine there is a specific sweet spot in tweaking every single haptic assignment to make this feel amazing... but you won't care because the amount of effort and enjoyment is tainted by the ""EA effect"" (cheap AI, F1 Life, etc.)


I have also tried this with my old Occulus Rift and it kind of feels... the opposite of immersive. It actually felt like a disadvantage.

And as others have mentioned, the AI is psychotic. Here though, I would suggest this is a genuine ""sim"" dose of reality based on the current era of F1. Pro drivers racing like they're kids in go-karts, smashing into each other? AUTHENTIC! Earn yourself a harsh penalty for a collision or ""something"" that was perpetrated by an AI racer, meanwhile Hamilton goes on to win the race because of an unfair power and ""ignoring the rules"" advantage that goes unpunished? AUTHENTIC!

The only thing missing is Hamilton having a cry on camera about being the biggest pariah in motorsports when he gets caught doing something blatantly aggressive AND dangerous, and has to take a minor penalty.

I am still trying to give this some good runs every now and then with my Simucube 2 setup for the sake of time trials on these pretty, official tracks... but it does not scratch that open wheeler itch quite as well as other games. Even community made historic AND modern F1 mods for rFactor 2 feel profoundly more satisfying and predictable to drive... but the graphics here are pretty, and the track accuracy is superb.

Another thing worth noting is that F1 22 is a bit of an anomaly in the current transition to EA. If you started playing from a client/install from the EA app, the Steam version is a completely different cloud-save platform... so it's just as disconnected and not-crossplay-friendly as trying to carry over progress from an Xbox or Playstation. And unlike every other recent EA published game I have tried, this one does NOT force you to install and use the EA launcher, so it loads and plays like a proper, Steam-only game client, which is an important detail to know if you ever plan on installing this onto a Linux machine (like a Steamdeck) where you don't want to mess around with additional 3rd party DRM launcher beyond Steam to be able ""allowed"" to access your game.

It also seems like Codemasters games are starting to move into a strange world of confused market appeal, and F1 22 is a perfect example... built for gamepads? Absolutely! Anyone with a proper wheel wanting to drive with little to no assists on, you can expect an extremely unpleasant and unforgiving experience unless you tweak your settings JUST right... and even then when you can get the game feeling good, it still feels WAY off the mark when compared to racing the same F1 tier type vehicles using your exact same wheel setup in a proper sim (AM2, rF2, etc.)


All in all, a loud and proud statement of the future of Codemasters and the F1 franchise in the EA Sports portolio.",1677862811,1677896287,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

One more thing: a reason why this game feels and looks more underdeveloped than the past games could be because of the amounts of upgrading they had to do. These were BRAND NEW CARS that were totally different than the past 4 games, so they basically had to start over, but still wanted the game to release in July. But that's just a theory.

These games just have not been good for a long time now. Garbage AI, awful handling physics, trash online functionality. These things have been in all the F1 games I can remember playing. Codemasters promised fixes for all of these things, but almost a year into the game it just hasn't happened. The AI flip flops between being a wet noodle and being the most overly aggressive thing known to man. It took codemasters ages to fix the straight line speed of AI that was present at launch, but we're still left with an AI that is just not rewarding in the slightest to race against. The physics are a complete fraud. If you watch F1, you get a bit of an idea of what driving these cars is like. I'm not saying you'll know exactly how, but you get an idea. This game just does not match that in the slightest. I can see drivers are able to exit corners at basically 100% throttle in second gear while still maintaining grip. That's not possible in this game. You must gradually apply throttle in no lower than 4th gear to prevent violent spins. Drivers who have played the game have complained about this, and yet it has never been addressed. Beyond this, in general it just feels like you are driving the cars on ice, especially on the hard tires. Downforce physics are not calculated accurately at all. I've had problems with multiplayer since launch. I'm rarely able to just join quick matches, I always get errors. As for ranked, the only lobbies that ever fill up are 5 lap races, which are completely pointless. Matchmaking for medium length races is not working correctly, it puts you in a lobby and waits for it to fill, but it never does. 

Today, codemasters announced F1 23. I will not be buying it at launch. Until I can see with my own eyes that the physics have been completely overhauled and brought in line with industry standards, I can not justify what will likely become another $70 game that ships severely broken at launch and hardly improves throughout its life cycle. 

To conclude, don't buy this game unless it is severely discounted or you can get it for free/on ea play. It never has been, and now never will be, worth $60.",1677720466,1677720466,False,2,0,0.528605997562408447,0,True,False,False

The game was better at launch with the good handling and general player-base being happier with everything then than they are now. The changes to the handling in patch 1.06 was devastating to the players, as they made the game so much harder to get traction out of corners, kerb behaviour was worsened and the game was completely different, resetting the learning all the players had done to this point. This game is not and will never be a bang for the buck game as it is far to expensive for it's own good. But if all you want to do is create a career in the world of Formula 1 then I would recommend this game. If not, well there is no reason to buy this. There are many issues with this game, such as 
1) Not being able to swap from Pre-sport update liveries to current sport liveries without mods 
2) You can overtake car's under the Safety Car period (Online and Offline)
3) Formation laps are completely bugged, as referred to in Jarno Opmeer's 2 Player Career with Binham
4) Track limits in Time Trial is mixed with some corners giving that you completely cut, while gaining time not giving you a invalidation, while others give you a double invalidation.

 Online is completely busted with cars glitching all over the place even with perfect connections, general lobby instability issues and many other issue that I know I have not experienced yet.

In short, this game is not worth getting unless you want a good career mode

Update: Yeah, nah, turns out that even with a FFB wheel you can lose traction and have absolutely no feedback. It's impossible to feel where the limit is with some corner, sometimes you can rely on visual cues (which is pathetic considering 2020 had solid FFB implementation) but otherwise you simply have to sink in hours of practice to figure out where the arbitrary limits are.

Livery customisation is terrible, I can't even find how to change my player name (so I'm just ""Player One"" on all leaderboards etc), I have to manually change car setup every time I play every track because it won't let you pick a custom default, qualifying is the most boring part of the game and has none of the excitement you see on TV, when you put AI difficulty down then they just break super early into corners so you end up rear ending them, and AI CONSTANTLY block you in FP/qualy and never seem to get any penalties - I've had someone park it on the apex in Silverstone straight after coming out the pits, right on the racing line so I have to break hard and ruin my lap.

The ""Life"" thing is the most brain dead out of touch thing I've ever seen. Who on earth wants to play an F1 game to unlock a sofa?!

There's so many quick wins they can do in next year's game - I won't be buying another F1 title until they prove it's not just another copy paste money grab.

One huge wish is that they make the race engineer actually useful, giving you updates on the rest of the field, egging you on, giving you actual tips about the laps you're putting in etc.

Its as if its made by people who dont watch F1 but play alot of Need for Speed lol (yes, i know) because the AI is still stupid as it gets out the way but sometimes not till the last second, usually in the braking zones lol.  they try to over take, but usually dont care where you are and end up with damage, you try to over take on a circuit like jedda on a high speed part and , yup your gonna get squashed into a wall.  According to this game F1 engineers are the most stupid engineers in the world, its shocking how much stuff fails quality control for you to waste more silly resource points to wait another few races to finally get them. It has silly pointless decisions to make which are meant to shape how your team grown but all it really does in reality is, either give you 10 per cent discount on something or a few hundred more resource points, which you wouldn't need in the first place if things didn't quality control so often lol seriously F1 teams, have you engineers even got any qualifications. lol  Then there is the music some of it is pretty good some of it is just weird noises but you can switch it off or just selected songs so its not too bad. its all stuff you would find in a very loud trendy place at night with lots of drunks teenagers lol.  Then there is the engineers on the radio during races, still as useless as ever, only giving you info that is already on the screen like your 5 seconds ahead, yes i no i can see it in massive numbers in the corner. Or in my game i am driving for Aston Martin, yes i just like the car but we all know its a rubbish team, this is where its a kick in the balls, i managed to get the car to a reasonable position of around top tenish  and i was told by radio engineer that it was useless and hopefully we can do better next time lol.   Way to motivate me.  its as if they only done radio stuff for the front teams and couldn't be bothered with the rest so when you do get a good placement with a back team your still told you done a crap job and hopefully next week will be better. its shocking  ALSO (lol) my engine was about 77% screwed going in to the Spanish GP i thought i would chance it lol, it lasted just about to the end of the race but for the last  10 races there was smoke, and i mean alot of white smoke coming from the back of the car like a destruction derby car lol. This wouldn't be allowed in real like, Either stewards would tell you to get your arse off the track or your team would call you in or the car would actually break down not drive at 200mph for another 10 laps lol.  Also speaking of stewards, its still the same as games from years ago, the AI do not get penalties of any kind.  they crash in to you and you get a warning,  they are obsessed with racing lines and no matter what you do you get in trouble so it ends up being super caution all the time coz you end up being scared of the un predictable and unrealistic actions of others.  

Anyway ive only been on it for 4 hours and ive came from f1 2020, i have played 21 on game pass on xbox but didnt see much of a difference in that to get it on pc here.  It was 20 quid so thought i would give it a go. as you can tell, im having a great time. lol

EDIT UPDATE:::  Just had another race, red bulll ring, safety car came out, was near the front, soft tires went on, the back markers didnt go in which were alphas  and williams and a macca, so when the race continued it was a race, how ever when everyone pitted it didnt register the back markers as a lap behind so my self russel and max was battling away for about 7th or something and half a minute off the lead because of the glitch of the game not relaising after the safety car had ended the back markers were a lap behind, They all went in the pits for hard tires etc and came out still at the front lol, it is a shambles of a game.  
Also the AI is now offically the most aggressive of any racing game i have played, its bonkers how many crashes there were. 
Also the year where merc finally wasnt at the front, well guess what, lewis is still at the front lol yet on alot of the races up untill near the end of the races they were only just in the top 10 lol. its like a copy and paste on certain parts of the game and the things that needed changing they didnt do and it looks like they spend most of their time messing with the menus and making the RnD screens more mixed up. what happened to the day where it was all on one screen? now its spread over loads of screens and not really utilising screen space, text is still small and lots of empty space.  if it aint broke dont try and fix it EA and if it is dont copy and past from NFS lol
Also its got for some reasons a racing mode which isnt F1 cars as if the devs are determined to make us play need for speed lol. you have to use these silly tokens to unlock super cars and then race them, it also forces this in your face even before you get to see a f1 car, its stupid, irrelevant and pointless. WE WANT F1! lol
Game files are from years ago too there is nothing much new. shiny new graphics and some different handling models but everything else is just edited and not from new, which considering how expensive these games are is a complete insult to us all.  They should update this for those of us who has bought a half arsed f1 experience with our hard earned money instead of giving free gifts like helmets and decals for them or what ever else lol.

ALSO, done some more hours on it on create your own team mode...
Well isnt this interesting LOL
Difficulty of the game is just as i need it, all the car is full upgraded so literally nothing else to do there.  Got michael schumacher as a team mate which is cool racing in my colours and my team.   It was good fun having him as a team mate as his states are high like LH... HOWEVER and this is a major HOWEVER... when you upgrade your team mates equipment so they can do better in the simulator etc it adds stats to their stats and if you have someone like Shumacher then his stats go basically 100 on everything and an awful lot of laps by him are fastest laps of the race...  my team has the most upgraded car out of all teams and am always battling at the front but MS is always about 10 seconds up the road at least, even damaged him during a sprint race LOL so he would have to pit and start last... GUESS WHAT within about 9 laps he was in the top 6 after pit stops he was 1st LOL with sooooo many fastest laps.  SOOOO here is a tip. unless you hire a rookie DO NOT i repeat DO NOT upgrade anything to do with your team mates as when you turn up the difficulty on this game they are simply rocket ships anyway and after any facility upgrades they are out of reach in every race so it becomes pointless. 

F1 has gone so down hill and they are such expensive games.  It is now basically NFS but with some F1 cars added on as a DLC lol. 
am done for a couple years worth at least of these now. rinse repeat an forget they are making an actual F1 game and not NFS lol",1671904444,1676218807,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
- Cars feel good (I use no assists)
- Crossplay
- Game Crashing less abundant
- VR ig

Cons
- AI is absolutely a shit show, the AI blasts away on starts no matter the difficulty. AI is very good on straights as well, this was supposed to be fixed but it’s still going on in career mode.
- AI is aggressive which can be good if the devs didn't take it too far, the AI will do things so bad I wouldn't even expect it from the average open lobby pleb. Completely throw away my race.
- F1 life is the biggest letdown of all time. The only thing that would’ve been good about it is if we could drive the super cars online… but that’s not even a thing.
- Bugs… so many bugs. Bugs will make you retire races but it’s never the same thing.

Das Spiel hat leider im Vergleich zum Vorgänger keine Neuerung bezüglich dem Spielspaß gebracht. F1-Life ist größtenteils nutzlos und verschwendete Entwicklungszeit. Die Supercars sind zwar eine nette Neuerung sind aber sehr schlecht zu fahren und wären besser durch die Wiedereinführung von Classic-Cars (siehe F12020 zb) ersetzt worden.
2.	Fahrphysik
In der Fahrphysik ist positiv hervorzuheben, dass sich die Autos deutlich weniger untersteuernder fahren als in 2021. Ebenfalls verlieren die Autos nicht komplett aus dem nichts in Hochgeschwindigkeitskurven das Heck. Ein starker Negativpunkt ist die fehlende Traktion, die sich besonders beim Rennstart auswirkt. Ohne Fahrhilfen ist es nahezu unmöglich mit der KI zu konkurrieren. Vergleichbar ist die Traktion in Trockenbedingungen ungefähr mit Nassbedingungen in F12020. Auch mit der neuen Generation an Autos ist dieser Grip nicht ausreichend und mindert den Spielspaß deutlich.
3.	KI
Die KI ist im generell sehr (oft auch über das Limit hinaus) aggressiv. In manchen Kurven hat der Spieler keine Daseinsberechtigung und wird von der KI einfach ignoriert. Resultat die KI kann munter weiterfahren und das Rennen des Spielers ist kaputt. Jede Strecke hat Kurven wo das zutrifft mit Extrembeispiel Imola. Dort kann der Spieler nicht überholen, ohne entweder schon auf der Geraden zu überholen oder von der KI abgeschossen zu werden. Ein Positionskampf mit mehr als 2 Autos ist ebenfalls kaum möglich ohne dass zumindest ein Auto im Kies steckt. Muss die KI von der Ideallinie abweichen ist das oftmals zu viel für sie und sie macht Fehler die bei einem Wheel-to-Wheel battle in einem wheelbanging enden (wobei wie erwähnt die KI nichts spürt). Weiters ist die Schwierigkeit der KI noch schlimmer als bei früheren Ablegern sehr schwankend. Wo man auf manchen Strecken um Siege fährt, kann man auf anderen Strecken auf der gleichen Schwierigkeit hoffen nicht letzter zu werden. Die Reifentemperatursimulation ist nur etwas für Masochisten. Die KI hat diese einfach nicht und so ist man zu Beginn des Stints zu langsam weil die Temperaturen zu niedrig und während des Stints zu hoch sind. Positiv ist herauszuheben dass sich die KI bei blauen Flaggen und im Qualifying meist deutlich besser verhält wie zum Ende von F12021. Sie bremsen nicht mehr die ganze Zeit um dich vorbeizulassen, wobei du sie vorbeilassen möchtest.
4.	Bugs
Das Spiel leidet leider mehr als jedes andere Vorgängerspiel an Bugs. Es sind jedoch keine kleinen Bugs die einen schmunzeln lassen, sondern Bugs die einem komplett den Spielspaß nehmen. Zweispielerkarrieren werden zerstört durch das falsche Implementieren von Sprintrennen oder gleichem Wetter in jeder Saison. Ersteres macht die Karriere wirklich kaputt, da der zweite Spieler in jedem Rennen disqualifiziert wird. Weitere kleinere Bugs wie das Neustarten des Spiels um einer Lobby joinen zu können nerven zwar sehr sind aber noch überschaubar.
Fazit:
Das Spiel kann an einem guten Tag sehr viel Spaß machen. Jedoch ist der Frustfaktor deutlich höher als in F12021, da sehr gute Erlebnisse einhergehen mit sehr schlechten.
Tips:
Wenn noch nicht angewöhnt fahren mit mittlerer Traktionskontrolle und immer viel Zeit für ein Rennen einplanen.",1675890088,1675890088,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was extremely excited for this entry into the F1 game francise but it just feels off to me.

1.the handling:
It feels like you have next to no grip in these cars + randome snaps in the middle of corners. I just cant get a feel for it even after 200 houres on the game. At launch it felt just horrible and after the handling patch it was a bit better put still very weired.

2.BUGS:
Dear lord, what happend during playtesting for this game? An absulutly unholly amount of bugs in this game. Multyplayer sometimes feels like its unplayable (when you even get into a lobby). Two player career is basically just copy paste of F1 2021 including all the bugs in it.

3.F1 life:
Why? I touched it twice since launch

The game is great fun with friens (when it works) but overall a big downgrade from F1 2021 and that was already a bit worse than F1 2020 imo. I really hope F1 2023 can be better because I think codies can make a way better game than this. But we will have to wait a little more to find out where this francise is going.

I want to enjoy this year's version too, but as it is now it's not worth it. To be honest, after EA bought Codemasters I thought there were good and new features, but my dreams were way off the mark. A feature brought back from old games but kept very minimal is that you have to actively press 1 or 2 more buttons during the pit stop. In 2010 the pit lane QTEs were much better. F1 21 was a very good game and I can't understand how they managed to screw up F1 22 so much.

The bad thing about this game:
- The AI ​​is way too aggressive. They drive right into you, either from behind or from the side. They're a lot worse than last year. They often destroy your car or cause it to spin.
- The risk of penalties for the AI ​​is far too small if not non-existent, making it unrealistic, especially when it's their fault.
- In my personal opinion, the graphics are generally worse than last year.
- The characters in the game should look more realistic.
- There are far too many bugs and glitches in this game that won't be fixed
- There are no updates for the game, only the podium pass always has a new season, but nothing more.
- F1 Live is a superfluous feature that you don't have to worry about.
- You lose interest very quickly
- Same game as F1 2021 only worse and some ""new"" little things.

The good points of the game:
- I like the new menu and background, although this is part of F1 Live and redundant, it still looks better than the basic menu over the years.
- Damage is much better visually and also more realistic when it comes to how to get it. Underbody damage can now occur when driving over high curbs. That's great.


It's sad to see how this game has gotten a lot worse (and more expensive).
I can only recommend the game conditionally, even if it is disappointing. In my opinion there is a lot of room for improvement, but nothing will change. Collectors and fans will still buy it.
The purchase price is way too high, so if you want to buy it, I recommend waiting for the next sale.

Unfortunately I have to give the game a thumbs down, although as a fan I wouldn't. The series deserves better.

*Edit*
Since writing of my review and now, we are 200 playing hours further.
Well i most definitely have rn some more experience. 
My biggest problem what has developed are there Online Servers. The servers are a disaster. Also the ranking system needs a big ""Update"". It happens to often that i need to play against pepole who are toxic/ not sirious ranked players. 
Also the not leaveble black screens in multiplayer lobbys has make my game crash an X amount of times. The reason for this is that the host is for example, Alt F4 out of the game while being in that black screen. The game tries to make someone else the host which is not everytime possible. Which makes the game crash, and sometimes it doesen't give u the rewards what u have earnt before the crash.
For the rest i'll stay with my opinion, the game is overall pretty decent and worth the money WHEN IN DISCOUNT. For €60 the game is to expensive, Personal i'll would say the max price for the game would be €30/max€40.

NOTE: After an update some time ago, the interviews with Clare have been removed. Which is for me an big oof..  I've always liked the interviews and it gave an extra ""realisim"" feel to it. 
Without it it's just an good F1 Racing game. With Clair being there the game is a little bit more like a F1 simulator?

compared to the other games in the franchise it sucks ass. the traction model is unrealistically difficult and a huge change from last years game. personally im a huge fan of my team and would love to see the option to choose your own chasis instead of being stuck with the goofy ahhh one that looks like a dick for a front wing. i do like how they included manual parking and more realistic pit stops, but thats all the new positive features i can say. f1 life and podium pass is a disaster and clearly a cash grab, as well as the physics in game being so unrealistic,  also a damage model that hasnt changed since what feels like 2016. the game isn't as bad as im making it out as, but it's a huge step down from f1 2020 or even f1 2021.",1675491029,1675491029,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall F1 22 is a amazing game I like everything except graphics since my computer is weak but what i seen they improved graphics (If you own a strong PC) I like the career mode and my personal favourite is the background Menu with the cars

Instead of serious attention to the quality of the RACING experience, we got a SIMS house we can decorate and a 'Demolition Derby'.  If the time and development costs for these silly, nonsensical additions had been put into making a top quality F1 sim, I am sure that F2 22 would be one of the best racing games available.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  

I also race Assetto Corsa.  The driving experience is infinitely better than F1 22.  The mods and upgrades allowed me to race the new cars, teams and tracks at the start of the F1 22 season rather than waiting until it was half over to get an up-to-date version.

Lack of open lobby options allowing experienced players to join together (Their ranked lobbies are disappointing, can't even add players of the same experience). Driving has so much under-steer, can barely mitigate it with the car setups. 

Each game of the series only gets worse under EA ownership.

Instead of fixing what is broken, EA adds dumb 'filler' content such as Super Cars, ""F1 Life"", a large library of liveries, etc. 
Instead of this dumb filler content, it would be nice if they added things such as historical tracks or retaining previous year cars to provide a variety of f1 generations to play.

Single player I've done a career, it's good fun, you can find yourself generating storylines as you go, but a lot of people (myself included) will pick this up for the multiplayer gameplay.

The game itself is a blocker to having a race online. Quite often I'll look for a race and find broken lobbies that are perpetually stuck in race results, empty lobbies and the functionality for jumping into a race is often so poor that you'll continually be connected to the same broken lobby over and over. Ranked races, you'll rarely find one.

If you do get into a race, there's often a bit of a lottery as to whether you'll spawn as a car or a spectator, and I've waited 15 minutes for a race to finish, joined the next lobby, selected a driver and found myself stuck as a spectator again, which is a huge waste of time.

As for the actual races, should you find one? Woefully inconsistent to the point of being negligently developed for such a big-name title. Safety cars are bugged to the point where less-sporting players are able to advance through the field behind a safety car, without punishment (by either ping abusing, or taking advantage of the horrendously inconsistent collision system, barging you off the track and claiming your place without warning or time penalty.) I've had numerous circumstances where I am driving behind someone and they have started to judder and warp left, right, forwards and backwards without ghosting. I've been binned into a side fence numerous times as a result of poor netcode, not even driver negligence.

Even if you manage to find a lobby, even if you manage to connect and get in-game and even if you get a good launch off at lights out, some b***end in an AM will still pull a Kvyat and wipe you out. The community and playerbase really doesn't help itself in terms of making online racing bearable. The amount of people who will escalate a little bit of elbows or accidental contact in Lap 1 into a torpedo/divebomb moment Lap 2 is unreal.

When you get a good race (once in a blue moon, where there's no idiots on the server), this game is utterly golden and shines. There is few experiences in gaming that I've had that are better than side-by-side with someone for turn after turn, really battling.

Before i start with the review, i‘d like to be clear about the fact that i‘m only interested in private multiplayer sessions with a few of my RL friends and that i‘m running a realy good PC for the time beeing. Also i haven‘t played the game too much so far. So pls take my statements about performance and the overall review with a grain of salt.

Since i’m a pure VR player when it comes to racing or flight sims, one thing i was primarily worried about were the reports about the horrible VR performance. My secondary concern were the reports about the bug of pedals not working when being plugged in via USB separately from the wheel base. Well, i‘m happy to say that these issues have been fixed so far. My VR performance (HP Reverb G2) is great and my pedals do perfectly work with F1 22. However, the game does have pros and cons as well as some bugs wich should be named. I will start with the cons / bugs i have experienced and will then move to the pros. Again, keep in mind i‘m only doing private MP and can‘t tell much about SP playability nor will i ever make use of that F1 Life nonsense.

Cons:

- The price. 60€ is simply way too much for a racing game, wich is more or less nothing more than a upgraded DLC of F1 2021. Yes, a few new totally worthless features like F1 Life, new cars, VR support and as i‘ve read, more polished physics and tyre model. People may argue that this is just how it is, but since several research studies have prooven that cutting the price in half triples the sales for PC-/Video-games, taking 60€ for a game like this is just stupid.

- User Interface. Why in gods holy name do we have no mouse support? Even in VR, this is annoying like hell. We‘re in the 21st century and there are still devs beeing too lazy to implement mouse support in a PC version of a game. This may be ok for console players, but for PC this an absolute no-go.

- Pit Stops. I do understand that F1 22 is not a hardcore sim like ACC or iRacing, but the automatic pit stops are totally arcade, making the manual pit limiter pretty much useless. At least an option to switch between automatic and manual pit lane control, like we have in AMS2, would be great.

- F1 Life. Although i won‘t ever make use of it, this is propably the biggest gripe i have with F1 22. Not only that it is close to scam trying to grab more money from customers by offering stupid nonsense items via mtx, it also eats a lot of development resources wich results in we‘re not getting mouse support, lots of bugs in the release version, missing realism options (automatic pit lane control) etc, etc. This clearly shows where EAs priorities are. Not in offering a great game, but ripping off their customers.

- VR accessability. While the graphics and the performance in VR is realy nice, the fact that i have to recenter my VR headset each time i enter the cockpit is very annoying. Jumping into the cockpit in the box -> recenter VR headset. Then open the car setup and get back into the cockpit, the headset is out of center and needs again to be recentered. Then starting the race, again recenter VR headset. Every other VR game or game with VR support i own is doing this better. And i realy do have a few of them.(edit: fixed)

-AI balancing. While the behavior of the AI is acceptable / good overall, they still seem to be slightly OP on the straights and pretty slow in the corners. Even while this is said to be a lot better now than it was after release. This will most likely be enhanced with future patches and is nothing i‘m too worried about.

Pros:

- VR immersion. This is just amazing. Besides the VR headset needs to be recentered each time entering the cockpit, Codemasters realy did a great job implementing VR. Graphics (set on high for me, 100% Steam SS, running a 12th gen i9, 64GB DDR5 and RTX3090) and performance are great. Not a average system in 2022 so again, take that with a grain of salt. But for me it is absolutely stunning. Nothing more to say here.

- Sounds. These are also very good imo. I like the option to switch between TV and driver layout, making the car sound like they do during a F1 TV broadcast or having them sound like they do for the driver itself, including wind sounds and different engine sound due to the different position and wearing a helmet compared to a TV camera. I also like the option to choose the language of the engineer radio separately to the language of the game and the broadcast narrator. I do have the narrator set to my native language (german in my case) and the radio voice to english. This highly enhances the immersion. Good idea, i realy like this option. Well done!

- General AI behavior. Besides the bots beeing slightly OP on the straights and UP in the corners, as mentioned under cons, the overall AI behavior is realy good. They fight for positions, defend and also doing mistakes on the track and with the strategy. This resulting in great races and a lot of fun during the sessions. I haven’t played too much yet, but so far me and my friends already had great times racing against each other together with AI on the track. They are sometimes a bit too agressive for openwheelers imo, but nothing to realy worry about.

- Graphics. I’m not too focused about graphics in general and there are definately games with better graphics, as well as the diffence to F1 2021 isn’t that huge, but imo the graphics of F1 22 are top notch in the racing genre. In 2D the graphics are great but, as already mentioned, also stunning in VR. The VR graphics are definately better than with ACC and at least on par with AMS2, if not better. The image is crisp and the steering wheel display is perfectly readable without leaning forward, making the HUD completely obsolete in VR. I have deactivated the complete HUD wich also adds a lot of immersion.

- Option to create your own online MP league. This is genius IMO, especially when you´re doing private MP. This option allows you set up a MP championship with (almost) all of the settings you have access to in a SP championship. Number of races, race length, flag rules, AI strength... whatever you wish to adjust.

- Physics and tyre model. Even while F1 22 is not a hardcore racing sim, the tyre model is great. I do not have a comparison tbh, but it feels accurate and realistic. Same for the driving physics. Without driving aids, controlling the cars is realy a challenge and exactly what i would expect from a F1 car, not having traction control nor anti-lock brakes. Realy good.

- Accessability. While the game is a real challenge without any driving aids, you can also make it almost arcade and therefore making it easy to enter for beginners. Overall you can say that F1 22 is easy to learn, but hard to master. Definately a better entry for beginners than the hardcore sims. These are difficult to learn and extremely hard to master for beginners, even with driving aids activated.

So overall F1 22 is a good racing game and a perfect mix of simulation and game, providing amazing Formula 1 action and great fun, especially together with some friends. If you are looking for a hardcore sim without compromise, F1 22 is not for you. But for those who want to have a semi-simulation as i would call it, F1 22 is highly recommended imo. The price is definately debatable, but once it is on sale for like 50% off, it is definately worth the money. Just one thing about that F1 Life nonsense. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THERE. We customers do have power. If EA does not get enough money out of it, they will hopefully skip this bs next year and instead focus on the realy important part: racing!",1662045651,1674898263,True,30,1,0.716485798358917236,0,True,False,False

Modding is also completely impossible, because you get kicked for cheating, if you dare change the livery or engine sounds. Meanwhile leaderboards are filled with 3rd party software cheaters.

Frustrating part is these things have been the same the past 6 years and instead of focusing their attention and time on these fundamental issues, they add roadcars and sofas.

However... the penalty system could use a bit of work. Outside of bogus penalties as a result of other users on-track, Codemasters seems to be hit-or-miss with track limits. At times, I question whether Codemasters understands the concept of track limits.

The handling model is worse than ever before. The cars are heavy, slow, and aren't a lot of fun to drive. They oversteer like crazy and turn in extremly slow. They feel like a boat. 

Generally, this series is similar to that of Fifa, you pay the full price every year for virtually the same game except that the cars change, and this year it got worse.

If you own F1 2021, it's a far better game than this in my opinion. Online lobbies on PC also seem to have gone quiet, I find maximum 2 lobbies under browsing, and Ranked has virtually no players in the long race format, with typically 3-4 players in the Short sprint format.

If you see the game on sale: Don't buy it.
My recommendation: If you really want to play F1 games, stick to the 20 & 21 game OR wait until F1 23 releases and pray for a hotfixed 22 version in the next game.

It's by far the worst optimized and bugged game we've had in years. The general handling of cars is absolutly unenjoyable, many wheels don't function properly,
I don't play online, yet I only heard really negative things about it.
I own a Logitech G920 which is by far not a good wheel (as all Logitech wheels) but it's just frustrating to use in this years game. The Force Feedback resets completly every 15 minutes or when tabbing out or steering too much or pausing the game, which forces me to completely reconnect the wheel and restart the game. Not enjoyable at all!
As I mentioned before, the handling is terrible. You don't have any control or feeling over your car and it's mostly random if your car spins unless you're a e-sport driver.
The AI is also for some reason worse than last years one which I can't understand at all.

I played F1 2020 today and it's such a huge difference. Driving without TC in F1 2020 feels 10x more stable than medium TC in F1 22 which is so far away from a real formula 1 cars handling. Curbs actually punish you hard and not cut every single apex with half your car as you unrealistically do in F1 22.
You steer to the left or right and your car really goes into the direction instantly and doesn't feel like you're driving on ice with 2s input delay..

- The gameplay is boring, which shouldnt happen in a racing game. It feels less intense than F1 2020, for example, where the camera moves, as if you're getting thrown around with the Gs. You feel quick in that game, you feel bored in this one,
- The AI drive their racing line, regardless of whether you're on it or not. Expect to be driven into.
- F1 Life and Supercars are a colossal waste of time. There's no point even trying them out. 
- Multiplayer is riddled with bugs, and errors.

I pre-purchased the Champions Edition to support and experience the VR integration. I couldn't play the game in VR for more than 15 minutes without the game crashing to desktop with the infamous EGO Dumper message. After several weeks of tinkering, forum posts, and waiting for patches, I gave up, and decided to shelve it for a few months and see if they would clean it up.

I tried playing yesterday for the first time since and, to my absolute f#@%ing astonishment, the game won't even launch. And this isn't even in VR mode, just regular display. I click Play in Steam, get a black screen, and an EGO Dumper crash message. After all this time, it's actually gotten *worse*. So I essentially gave EA/Codemasters $70 for nothing, and I can't get a refund from Steam. Turns out I'm not the only one having this issue, but EA/CM have been absolutely silent. 

I have a more than capable rig (i9 10900K, 32GB RAM, RTX 3080), and have no issues with any other games, not even past F1 titles. But ever since EA took this over, it's been a frustrating, rage-inducing headache. 

I'm going back to ACC, and writing this series off. Everything EA touches turns to $#!+, and F1 is no exception.

Just look at the reviews here, or the Discussions. There are a lot of bugs, a lot of issues, a lot of bull$#!+, and a lot of dissatisfied customers. I've been buying Codemasters products since TOCA, almost 20 years ago. No more. I'm done. There's only so much abuse I can take.

Llets go back to the beginning,

When the game boots it goes online, doesnt tell you why but you cannot load the configuration to setup sound or display,

It then displays a EULA you cannot read as the letters are less than a mm tall, It doesnt go full screen instead it windows itself, until you have agreed to the EULA and another agreement (no idea what as you cant read it) or get to the settings of the game to change the settings so you can SEE the writing,

On top of this it maxes out the sound so dont start this game with your speakers on unless you want to cause yourself some pain,

Once you have got passed the above it asks you to pick a car, no idea why it does this but again no menus for you until you pick a car, Once you pick a car you get the main menu? none of this makes any sense in a racing game,

If you have friends drop in for a few laps and have a laugh WRONG! If you are playing against mates that have played the game before and setup there cars there's might and I say might go round corners yours will act like it has a rocket attacked to it regardless of the speed you are going just go straight. For me I found the handling so stupid no granularity no form of control just stop and go, The same controller goes through the menus without issue and works in other games

Do NOT buy this game if you want a simple racer with formula 1 this game is not for you, I also can see this is why no one returns the game as to setup the car and then to race it would take over an hour let alone 2.",1672424785,1672424785,False,7,0,0.560916781425476074,0,True,False,False

In this aspect, F1 22 succeeds, providing a satisfyingly difficult method to maneuver these extreme racing cars across every Formula 1 circuit on the season. F1 22 falls short due to its exclusions and mediocre additions, with less content than last year's edition and a battle pass-like subscription system that locks away numerous cosmetic things behind a barrier. There are a few odd failures for a series that has been consistently terrific for so long, but happily it delivers where it counts most: in the high-octane action on the track.",1672340565,1672340565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is the thirteenth entry in the F1 series by Codemasters. The game holds an official license of the 2022 Formula One and Formula 2 championships. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 1 July 2022. It would also make its debut on EA's Origin platform as their main platform, which is also playable in the EA Desktop app, as well as the Epic Games Store. In previous entries, Steam was the only platform available for PC players. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, with most criticism aimed at the lack of innovation compared to previous titles and the new ""F1 Life"" mode.


Due to new technical regulations for the 2022 Formula One World Championship, F1 22 features new car models with updated physics.[1] The game also features an updated track list, including the revised layouts of Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for the Spanish Grand Prix, Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Albert Park Circuit for the Australian Grand Prix, as well as adding the new Miami International Autodrome for the new Miami Grand Prix.[2] The Algarve International Circuit, home of the Portuguese Grand Prix, along with the Shanghai International Circuit, hosting the Chinese Grand Prix, was subsequently added to the game with an update.[3]

Formula One sprints, a new addition to the sport, are also included in the game.[4] F1 22 features adaptive AI, which would adjust the pace of AI cars according to the performance of players to ensure players are competitive from race-to-race. The game also introduces a customisable hub mode called F1 Life to allow players to collect supercars, clothing and accessories.[5] The game is also confirmed to support virtual reality for PC via Oculus Rift, or HTC Vive, virtual reality headsets.[6] F1 22 also features immersive broadcast options, designed after televised Formula One broadcasts, as well as interactive pit stops.[7]

EA and Codemasters also added Supercars to F1 with ""Pirelli Hot Laps"", which is accessible through the new ""F1 Life"" mode.

F1 22 was revealed on 21 April 2022, with both Codemasters and EA Sports returning to work on the game.[8] It is an official video game of the 2022 Formula One and Formula 2 championships,[9] alongside F1 Manager 2022 of Frontier Developments.[10] The game was launched on 1 July 2022, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S platforms via Steam, Epic Games Store and Origin, which is on the weekend of the 2022 British Grand Prix.[11] The Champions Edition of the game was released three days earlier, on 28 June 2022.[12]

F1 22 received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[13][14][15]

Eurogamer praised Codemasters' implementation of simulation elements such as dynamic weather and wrote in favor of their exclusion of porpoising but called the game ""overly familiar"" and ""overly bloated"", writing that ""there's a feeling 2022's regulations have introduced as many problems as they have fixed, and that the positive impact of the new ruleset will not really be seen for some years to come.""[16] GameSpot praised the increased level of player agency, host of assist settings, and the authentic recreation of the new era of Formula One but criticized the lack of iteration, hollow F1 Life mode, and the inclusion of microtransactions.[17] IGN liked the inclusion of the Formula One sprint race format, virtual reality support, and the game's rejuvenation of the franchise's stagnating elements but panned the ""vapid"" F1 Life mode's replacement of the predecessors' Braking Point mode. Regarding its monetization, the site wrote, ""It's probably a sad sign of the times that while previous Formula One games featured iconic cars from the sport's history, F1 22 features an extensive set of ... designer rugs, lounges, and lamps.""[20] PC Gamer praised the inclusion of real-world standings updates, sprint races, the skill tree system, damage models, and wealth of player choice but criticized the aging graphics, inconsistent AI, console controls, and lackluster addition of super cars, while noting that ""the annual release has not felt this unnecessary since F1 2014.""[22]

PCGamesN found itself ""dulled to [F1 22's] charms"" and lamented the ""cumulative fatigue of having been through this experience so many times before in previous iterations, and having so little meaningful new content in F1 22 to relieve it.""[23] Polygon stated that ""F1 22 is not [a transformative work], but it did not need to be one — creating new cars, and the organic challenge of learning how to drive them on the limit, was transformation enough.""[29] Push Square gave praise to the quality handling, good visuals, deep career modes, novel supercars, and robust customization while criticizing the numerous bugs, crashes, and screen tearing, as well as the aging game engine and insubstantial F1 Life mode.[24] Shacknews lauded the overhauled racetracks, new circuits, remixed audio, new commentary, VR support, and the integration of new regulations and car designs but disliked the ""terrible"" feel of the supercars, difficult AI, and persistent series issues.[25] The Guardian gave the game a score of 3/5 stars and wrote, ""F1 22 is technically stunning, and that, combined with the chance to drive this year’s cars on this year’s tracks, should make it irresistible to Formula One fans. As long as they manage to ignore the egregious F1 Life.""

The AI at least somewhat behaves in single player. In multiplayer (two player career and custom lobbies with friends. Public lobbies are a s***show and out of the question when i could literally play any other game and have a better experience), the AI will maintain their line at their pace, no matter what. They overbrake when in front of you, and try to outbrake you if they're behind. At any remotely challenging AI diff, you have to be in the fastest car on the grid to ensure you aren't pit maneuvered. Simply no incentive to ""rags to riches"" in a back marker. 

F1 life is stupid and hollow, and I would rather crap into my hands and clap than drive the supercars. They handle like a yacht, and...oh yeah this is AN F1 GAME. The community wouldn't be so pissed about it if it weren't at the expense of dev time for the reason anyone plays the game in the first place. EA/Codies could at least do a better job at disguising their greed.

Even as a sim-cade there is no glimpse of reality in the game, like many who bought this on pc we have played many other hard core sims and for me I have hundreds of hours racked on those too. I find it harder to push limits and drive on F1-22 than in any other sim I own, as a seasoned driver by now I can get used to a track in any sim with a decent five laps, with f1-22 I need to have the racing line on. Not only that but i feel like the game limits styles and creative driving, the way the physics is set up is extremely basic in how you spin so trying new things can punish you harder than even realistic sims. I honestly think ea needs to hire a team that can actually produce a decent F1 physics model for these games. I find it almost impossible to push beyond my limits other than becoming more robotic with my racing. And that's only the physics side of things, the ai are ok sometimes but tend to glitch out mid corner or on entry when you try and make a move, they won't evade sometimes and continue to turn in on you. The f1 life options and accessories are completely useless and wastes of money and development time for the team. The online servers suck, they just do, i have ethernet connection with perfect wifi and I never seem to be able to connect decently to a server. There is nothing new, not even a story or more historic cars and tracks, the my team is stale as always. My team gets boring because it is just a grind for championships and i play long form races so each takes about an hour and a half each weekend, no upgraded visuals for when you upgrade the car, no real choices and options for building a car, and my biggest problem with my team is not being able to form your own teammates strategy. The ai formulates its own strategy on what it thinks is best when us as the player should be able to take control.

Too many more problems to say like the audio and visual bugs and loading  bugs but hey who's complaining, not me.",1671865440,1671865440,False,2,0,0.529837250709533691,0,True,False,False

The EA influence was hard on this game. Useless features like supercars, F1Life and vr which doesnt even work properly. Development was obviously rushed and marketing made a priority. EA finally got their greasy, money grabbing little hands on this game sadly. I had high hopes being that this is the new generation F1 car that promotes closer racing. F1 22 is a step down from the previous title F1 2021 in every aspect, even with the desync problem that raked havoc across the online and league racing community. Grip in this game has been changed recently. Before the handling change there was somewhat of an indication when the tyre was reaching its maximum grip and was starting to slip. Its was much easier to tell where the limit of grip was. Now however you find the limit of grip when you spin out. There is either grip or no grip, no middle ground where you can feel the tyre stressing. You just switch ends. Catching the slide is possible in some circumstances, but coming out of a high speed corner in a high gear such as 5th, 6th or even 7th, you need a miracle to not go round. Kerbs seem to be made of ice. Even 1 tyre just on a kerb is enough to go round. Every F1 game i can remember has had some bugs. 2020 with is ""online services"" screen stuck on during a race and 2021's dsync. F1 22 has some interesting ones. If the host of an online session disconnects or crashes, there is a very good chance the lobby is done for. Cars appear dync'd to each other and safety car deltas go instantly to -20 seconds. Also formation lap tyre temps were broken just until the last patch.

There was loads of potential for this game but it just wasnt meant to be sadly.

I'll probably gonna play this mess again, because i'm weak, but the frustration get's worse and worse.

They also appear to have removed the ability to split the engineers audio to a different audio device from the main game sound like you could in the older games, and HDR just seems broken (when enabled everything looks very dark).

The AI are super aggressive and don't seem to care about smashing into you to defend which also seems pretty unrealistic, although in the past this franchise has had the opposite problem where they'd just jump out of the way as soon as you got anywhere near them. Grand Prix 4 had more believable AI behaviour that F1 22 in my opinion.

Now lets get into the details, the handling (physics) overall has been a improvement over last years F1 2021 game the aero system is a bit more predictable  (but still needs a overhaul, traction is inconsistent and sometimes aero can be unpredictable), slight graphics bump (the only difference with the graphics this year and last year is that F1 22 has got slightly better lighting effects), but those are probably the only improvements well yeah there is VR but apparently optimization isnt very good (i wont comment on VR since i dont have a VR headset). This is where things start to fall off, once again codemasters adding useless features and not actually fixing the game for example F1 life is just a waste of development time, what the hell is the point of adding supercars and furniture, if i wanna drive supercars ill play assetto or forza, not the OFFICIALLY licensed F1 game, they should just add back classic F1 cars or add F3 cars. Once again, year after year, multiplayer hasnt been touched, its still broken as hell, it takes 5 years to join a server, 5 years to enter a race, then your just gonna be taken out by a dirty driver, the contact system in multiplayer is wayy to sensitive (you tap a car and they are sent to mars). Also the ranked system in this game has not been touched for a long time, and it has potential but has been done poorly, if they add a system more like iRacing (safety rating (i know its already there but needs improving), some sort of iRating system, and put lower rated driver in F2 or F3 (if they add F3)). Once again the customisation in this game is very bad (F1 mobile has a better customisation system for god sake?!?!) I dont wanna have to mod the game to have awesome liverys this game was not intended for modding (they block you from multiplayer (i know there is modular mods but still...)) also console players are stuck with the bad liverys in the game, the only good on is the Audi livery but of course you need VIP pass to get that. Career/Myteam dont get me wrong career/myteam can be really fun but i havent really been playing it this year due to being the same for the last few years (it just got a bit boring) they need to add more variety to driver market (more drivers), they need visual physical car upgrades (only for the FOM car because due to the licensing of the real cars), a fully customisation calendar (asking this for years). Finally the last part, they need to use a new game engine (they have been using the current one since 2015) some bugs have been in this game for atleast 6-7 years, the game is starting to show its age now, if F1 23 doesnt have a new game engine, ill probably give it a miss for next year. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who wants a officially licensed experience but other than those group of people, I would recommend assetto corsa with the Race Sim Studio Formula Hybrid 2022 or the VRC equivalent. But if you have the money get iRacing and buy the W13.",1670894949,1671118959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They may have fixed the AI speed problem but now it just seems like the AI ignore my existence and ram me out of their way damaging my car and ruining my race. Good luck exiting certain corners if you're using automatic gearbox because the game goes to the rev limit before shifting. This causes you to be slow out of some corners and just makes some of them a drift corner. This game will also throw a hissy fit when I lead a race and does everything in its power to keep me from winning. If you wanna play online, have fun spending half an hour looking for a server that will let you race and not force you to spectate, or the game will crash when loading in. Once you do though you'll either get taken out on lap one by someone else or the game will just disable your car for no reason. There's also a glitch where game audio will only go through one side of your headphones. Save your money and never buy one of these games pre-release. I swear they never actually actually worked on this game.

They have also added a cool new 'elimination' mode for multiplayer which is really good to just have an arcade-esque mode for an otherwise realistic simcade. The handling is the main issue for me and a lot of others, but I believe its due to because its the first year of new regs, the handling can't exactly be perfect. I would imagine that it'll be a lot more refined in the next iteration.

Another good thing is the game is explicitly not pay to win, with only the Podium Pass and the Champions edition existing which neither do you need at all to get further or benefit compared to others who don't bring their wallets out for games. 

Personally, this is my favourite F1 game out the 2 others I've played so far (F1 2020 and F1 2021 on console). I think the realism and graphics have been perfectly refined, and the game runs like a dream without needing a beast of a PC. I can play on max graphics with a GTX 1060 and i7 7700k and average 80 FPS which is incredible.

The game is still a bit buggy, but it varies from mode to mode. They bring out a patch every 2-4 weeks which is a lot better than most devs, so I'm hopeful all or most of the major bugs will be remedied at some point in the near future.

Overall, the mixed reviews on the game were at one point deserved, but a few months after release I think the game has definitely turned itself around and put itself on the right foot. It can only go up or down from here.

It's nice that they tweaked the career practice programs. They were getting really boring. But the level of difficulty changes enormously. Most of the time it's completely impossible to pass them, even if you go full beans. So you expect to do bad in the following race. None of that. You can drive a perfectly fine race and finish way ahead of the position the car should be in. The correlation between those practice programs and the race is way off.

Also the AI keeps ramming you and the handling model seems to give you 0% rear end grip. And that F1 life part is very superficial. It does not add anything to the game. It feels like they had to add something new to sell to you.

Overall it's just not a enjoyable experience.

F1 Life seems to be a fair waste of time but yet another attempt for EA to conduct their micro-transaction model.  I would like to see the game bring back the ""Braking Point"" mode as that gave a short story line to differ from the usual career/multiplayer modes.  The introduction of VR has been fantastic if you have a graphics card to suit.  I have had the occasional crash whilst using SteamVR on Oculus Quest 2 via Link Cable.  Multiplayer modes are fun but I feel to separate casual players from the more experienced the server ranked lobbies should have defined assist sets.  The weekly events are the best game mode as it provides either a ranking of time trial or puts you in a situation to overcome and can be quite challenging.  You're really pushing the limits of the car and it's heaps of fun.  **Side  note to developers:  Data needs to be reviewed during online multiplayer/weekly event play as I've noticed a fair amount of players just holding rev limited as they go around the track and are exponentially faster than most of the lobby.  Not sure if this is just a glitch that someone has figured out to gain lap-time but it is quite noticeable in the weekly event as there is always easily a few that are 10-15 seconds faster than those at the top of the leaderboard**  Overall 100/10 game and I thoroughly endorse the games this franchise has produced and look forward to the future.

the monthly update bring more issues than they fix, and when they list some issues as ''fixed'' its most of the time still there, but some other ''feature'' (bug) has been added to the game instead to cover that issue.
developers arent fixing anything as they allready raked in their cash, and they are working on copying all files over to F1 23. dont waste your money on this F1 games, untill a different developer starts developing it. this is purely a Scam,.

As always, it's just the updated version of the year before and settings in the car are less again. 
FFB is still like any arcade game.

One would buy it for VR, true.
However: it's not nice in VR. Jittering/stuttering and an overall weird feeling.
No problem if it's going to be fixed, but look at the forums: it's full of people complaining and -as usual- ""they"" don't fix it.
Big company: they sell anyway seems to be their train of thought.

1692250,118248001,76561198078420605,0,9,4797,0,966,1686339013,"Overall - DO NOT BUY this joke of a game. The AI is utterly and beyond broken ( NFS AI is ages ahead of it in terms of how it acts and actually detecting you ) - get a real life like time in terms of qualifying on 70% AI, the AI is 2 seconds faster. The control of the car - tyres in the green operating window, the car slides and is all over the place like on ice. 

Final REVIEW - the game is a 3/10 due to core features being beyond broken and unbalanced by the developers. The only reason it is a 3 - the likeness and how the tracks are in the game, realistic enough. Only for AI, how the driving feels overall - 0/10. 
                      - will not buy future installments even tho i have previous games. This is a joke towards players and enthusiasts.


AI :

- AI is unbalanced and chaotic, dive bombing when they are 0.5s+ behind you and almost ending their and your race or session. 
- AI corner exits regardless of difficulty its beyond perfect on new or used set of tires. 
- AI completely disregards the player existence - in online or single player
- AI cars on equal performance run laps around player with DRS and overtake ERS regardless of how you take the corner or engine manufacturer(not that it would matter in equal performance grand prix session). This was at 75% difficulty and on a track i'm confortable with.  

Career ( My Team / Single career ): 
- Practice programmes after patching have sky rocketed into impossible season regardless of upgrades or the car performance ( playing in a back end car for passing the program i'm asked P15 and P12 for perfect program in a back marker- second to last car performance wise ). Thats simply put thats an awful change in patching.
- Wear - 25% races and 30 minutes sessions, you go to Quick Practice to do the programs as you cannot complete them due to the reason above, starting with fresh components and going into practice with at least 20% wear on upgraded reliability. Sim is still broken, it has passed from F1 2021 to F1 22, the issue is still not solved.

Controller feeling:
- Default settings seem inconsistent, not taking inputs sometimes. Tried different setting for controller, this was not fixed. 

Conclusion: After 16.5 hours of playing, i do not recommend the game on controller. Wait for it to be patched especially the AI behaviour and speed, but as well the overall career practice programs.

Edited on 07/07/2022 after 1.1GB patch. 

AI: 

- Seems to have nerfed the AI out of corners,but its still a bit unrealistic top speeds and acceleration for realistic performance for AI - around 50% reduction from previous patches.

Career:

- Practice programs seem to have the same amount of nerfs for the time, from getting +1sec on qualy program on a track i performed well, to consistently repeating the session and program at around 0.4sec at 65% difficulty. Wear after quick practice seems lower than previous races. 

Controller:

- Input seems better now and much more responsive ( Day 0 was decent, patch 1.05 did change it for worse, now seems better than day 0 ). 

Performance: 

- Low to almost no ""mini freezes"" that were present in F1 2021 and F1 22 at launch. It seems mostly fixed. 

Conclusion: Changed to recommend the game as the AI difficulty and practice programs is just a fine tune thing, the overall performance of the game and responsiveness even when having other windows eating resources from pc is MUCH better ( on medium and on high settings it was a steady over 100fps).

Edits:
* post 1.06 patch : - car controls better, but overall the changes have made the AI even more broken... waiting for a fix as this made the game unplayable. 
* post 1.07 patch - AI performance is more balanced, they dont blitz into the distance as they exit the corner. 
                           - handling seems a bit floaty, not as planted as before ( on controller ) and the gears seem odd. Besides this the game seems overall balanced and playable, but wait for discounts.

Overall the experience is good with friends, but the AI issues need to be addressed as thats the major part of the game.",1657012670,1669897896,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But then the updates started coming in and now there's a big issue with the traction in some places; its far too edgy. The car is constantly on edge in corners where it shouldn't be, where real life drivers are mashing the throttle out of corners and we must be so cautious on it.

There's an issue when an F1 driver can come play this game and say its more difficult than driving the real car, and say the traction is not representative of an F1 car at all. And keep in mind this is all before we address the suicidal AI they've coded.....

But at least we got cross platform so I'll give them a thumbs up there.

""gIt GuD"" Yeah, but AI with unrealistic traction sucks no matter your skill. And whenever there's a tap, I'm the one that spins. You can try a PIT maneuver, they won't spin. The AI are way too aggressive and go for gaps that don't exist. And funny enough, if they're fighting and I approach, they suddenly stop caring about that battle and only want to defend against me.

Extra money to unlock two safety cars? I'll pass. They finally added VR...that's nice. Except it wasn't playable at first and now you have to figure out if it's Microsoft or EA's fault when it glitches. 

Honestly, it's not a bad game. I just hate how reckless the AI is in racing games now and how it's never an even playing field. I mean, F1 isn't even, but when you have a full battery, DRS, and you're blowing by them on the straights only for them to catch back up. And it's not all the time. But it's enough to be annoying.

The game is what you would expect from an F1 game ánd more... But that 'more' is basically useless clutter and the game itself has its fair share of issues that dont help with the enjoyment of the entire game. I will put some of my findings below.

The Campaign, the ability to do this in coöp and the way you upgrade YOUR car/team throughout the campaign is amazing. You want to be Gunther Steiner ánd be able to drive your piece of sh*t car and upgrade it? This game allows you to do so! Alone or with a friend! It's amazing fun.

The handling of the cars is also done amazingly well. Curbs punish you greatly now, low speeds can cause the car to lose traction quickly when applied to much gas and
Love the 2 player coöp and the way the new cars handle. It's different than before, should be different than before and you do notice it.

The graphics look amazing and you can run it from a low spec PC all the way to a high spec PC without issues. I mean, its Codemasters' ancient old same race engine, so dont be too worried about that.

But those were the positive parts of the game...

... now for the negatives parts and oh boy... There are a lot at the moment.

Starting with connectivity issues. For some reason, even when you're just playing coöp, you can sometimes get desync'd out of nowhere. Why? Dont no, no reason given. The game blames your connection of course, but no matter what you do or test, you will see that the problem is not your connection, but is with EA's servers. Will they ever fix this? We dont know. Did they acknowledge it? We dont know, probably not. After many months in, I can not say for certain it's fixed. Sometimes you get a night without any issues, the next day it could be constant desyncs.

AI is horrid? Or not? Or are? There's no telling what the AI will do and/or behave like per race. In one race they feel nearly real, some are more agressive, some are more passive, they try to outbrake you, you try to outbrake them, it can be pure bliss. But not even a few laps later, they can be complete idiots. Braking at random spots on the track when you are close behind them, sometimes braking so far before the corner that you can not even anticipate the correct braking point and you punt them from behind or when you slam hard on the brakes very late in to the corner... And the AI still managed to punt you off as if they suddenly know what their braking limits are. It's madness.

Multiplayer is still pure chaos. If you end up in higher ranked matches, you will see that people try to make it less chaotic, but latency issues, connection issues and other small problems keep Multiplayer from becoming anything but a fun ""yeah, lets do a few races multiplayer and play something else after."".

And dont get me started on the whole retarded ""F1 life"" BS they crammed in. It's bad, it's sad, it's completely unecessary to have in the game.",1666645510,1669652955,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Extremely well put together with propper TV-style presentations of each Grand Prix, that really gets you in the mood and makes each race feel like an event. The gorgeous graphics and impressive sound design does a wonderful job of immersing you in the world of Formula 1. 

Unfortunately some of the cool small details seen in F1 2020 are missing in this game. For instance you no longer see leaves being blown by the wind of the cars hurling past you, and the sparks flying from underneath the cars in front of you have been toned down quite a bit. The raindrops on your visor are also no longer being blown to the side by the wind. This is quite disappointing, as these details are what makes these games so immersive. 

Fortunately most of the details remain, such as the marshals waving flags during on-track incidents, your driver occasionally adjusting his grip on the wheel, fireworks going off at the end of night races etc. Another great new feature is the option to choose between different audio mixes to tailor the experience to your liking.

F1 22 also sees the new addition of music being played by the crowd in the grandstands around the tracks, which unfortunately only works in Time Trial. I wish it worked during the race weekends as well. The songs can also be listened to while browsing the menus, but I personally chose to have the traditional theme playing instead, as it is arguably the best in the history of the franchise and just sounds incredible! 

The race engineer has also finally been updated. It has always been one of the best features of these F1 games, but has admittedly been slightly buggy. But for some reason they just re-recorded the exact same voice lines as we had before with no improvement to how the race engineer actually works. They also removed the interview cutscenes, which is a shame as the idea was great, only the execution could’ve been slightly better. 

One very welcome addition is that we can now finally take manual control of the formation lap procedure. Unfortunately we still don’t have manual cooldown laps and the new “manual” pit-stops are also very disappointing, as they aren’t manual at all. The game still takes control of your car with janky and robotic movements. The only difference is that we now have to press a button to turn into the pit-stop, which is ridiculously easy to do and makes the otherwise great addition of pit-crew errors useless, as you always get a perfect stop. We can also no longer change the parameters of a race during the loading screen like in 2020 - and we somehow still don’t have mouse support for the menus... 

The single most baffling decision made for F1 22 however, is the addition of F1 Life. It is as stupid as it sounds… They also replaced the beloved Classic Cars from F1 2020 with modern Super Cars instead of expanding upon it with full Classic Seasons.

This all sounds very negative - so how come I still recommend the game? 

Because we now finally have VR support, which was sorely missing from the previous entries, as VR just matches so perfectly with racing games. The implementation isn’t perfect though, as there are a few small annoyances. For instance there is an annoying bug that causes your vision to ""jitter"" up and down when being parked on the grid waiting for the lights to go out. It disappears once you actually start driving. Then there is how the game insists on resetting your view all the time whenever it loads something.

Thankfully they got rid of the ""please put on your headset"" screen that used to appear when you took off your headset - so you are now able to navigate the menus, watch replays etc. on your regular monitor if you want to. One annoying bug is however how the image is squished when you are parked in your garage watching the live TV feed in the menu screen of your opponents racing around.
 
My final complaint is how the game displays your VR view on your regular monitor. Games like Project Cars show a perfect fullscreen image that fills the whole monitor. This game however only displays a squished circular cutout of what your right eye sees, which doesn't look as good if you want to show your live view to your friends, and means I have to manually crop and stretch the image if I want to record my VR gameplay.

All that being said, the racing itself is just utterly fantastic in VR! The F1 games have always had a great level of detail that combined with the stunning visuals - especially the night races - really makes for one hell of an immersive experience. VR improves every single racing game tenfold - and this is no exception. And while other racing titles do a better job with the physics and VR implementation itself - what we have here is still super fun to play. 
 
The new ground effect cars are significantly more challenging to drive than their predecessors - but extremely satisfying to race once you learn how to drive them right on the limit. They don’t quite handle like a propper simulator, but it’s close enough to be challenging and still intuitive and predictable. It generally works well both when using a gamepad as well as a steering wheel. The only issue is that a stupid “speed sensitive filter” is applied to gamepad users. Whenever you are driving at high speeds, a delay starts to occur from when you physically move the thumbstick on your gamepad until the wheel actually turns in-game. This effectively means you have to turn into corners way before you actually reach them. This makes chicanes and S’s almost impossible to drive, as you need to rapidly change direction in quick succession. If Codemasters would simply remove this filter and give gamepad users 1:1 input just like how it works for steering wheel users, the experience would be near perfect. 
 
The AI didn’t quite work as it should at launch, but now that it has been fixed we are left with the best offline wheel-to-wheel racing this franchise has ever seen. Once you find a difficulty level that suits you, racing against the AI becomes such a phenomenal experience. Especially since they are now able to occasionally make mistakes when you are racing against them, which makes close battles much more realistic and intense - especially in VR. I only wish they would occasionally mess up their race starts as well, since getting a good launch off the line is arguably a bit too difficult in this game. Fortunately we are now also able to tailor our career experience in much greater detail than before by altering the rate of progression for both ourselves and the AI, the rate of mechanical failures, determining how often safety cars will be deployed and so on. This helps to improve the already brilliant offline career mode - that you can now also play in co-op with a friend, which is great. 
 
We now finally also have additional tracks to choose from on top of the scheduled 2022 season. So far only Portimao and Shanghai have been added - but I’m crossing my fingers we will see tracks like Hockenheim and Nurburgring added in the future! But even if we don’t - the current selection of tracks is fantastic! 
 
In conclusion, despite the very frustrating flaws that sour the overall game - the improved wheel-to-wheel racing and the much requested addition of VR support simply makes for one of the most incredibly atmospheric and intense racing experiences to date. No other game immerses you as well as this game in VR in making you feel like you are not just racing a Formula 1 car - but are racing in an actual Formula 1 season.",1664802916,1669569049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the new race engineer, and the feeling of the cars is the best it has ever been.

I don't like the new weekend practice system, it is a downgrade. The view of upgrades is also worse.
F1 Life is absolute waste of time.

The big issue with this game is the AI. It is just not obeying the rules. Whatever the developer did, it also has terrible mapping of the speed of the AI
Example. I can get a great start of the race, and pull away, but on some long straights, they can suddenly, mid straight, gain more speed than me, Even though I got the better start.
And during the race this problem persists. Out of some corners the AI just have enormous speed, can take off like rockets.

I play at a high difficulty level, because I like a challenge, but the ""cheating"" AI, just kills all the fun. I thought I could get one last F1 game, before EA games ruined it, but no.

Codemasters somehow managed to create the most fundamentally broken multiplayer experience I ever had the absolute misfortune of having to experience. It's truly beyond words how immensely non-functional every aspect of multiplayer in this game is. 

Finding a lobby is best described as throwing a dice. 5 times out of 6 one of the following will happen:

* You're thrown into a lobby that's already in a race
* Error: No response from host (the most common one, yay p2p)
* Error: Session already fully
* The session never starts despite everybody being ready and the ""timer"" hitting zero

And the most beautiful thing about this, if you decide to leave one of those broken lobbies and start looking for a new one, there's about an 80% chance you'll just end up in the same, broken or already running lobbies again.

Sorry, did I say that's the most beautiful thing? Actually, this is: Codemasters will __never__ fix any of these bugs or even experiment with dedicated servers. Why? Well firstly because ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE FROM F1 2021 AND F1 2020. And secondly, of course, because dedicated servers would be way too expensive for a yearly release. Lmao. 

WHY ARE THERE HOT MICS BY DEFAULT, I DON'T NEED TO HEAR EVERYBODY'S FUCKING PC FANS OR PARENTS ARGUING IN THE BACKGROUND

WHY ARE THERE FUCKING TIMERS EVERYWHERE IF NOTHING HAPPENS ONCE THEY REACH ZERO

WHY DO I NEED TO GIVE THE POSITION BACK TO SOMEONE WHO LAGGED BEHIND ME BECAUSE PEER TO PEER IS FUCKING AIDS

WHY CANT YOU TELL ME **WHY** VOICE COMMANDS ARENT AVAILABLE

WHY DOES CHANGING HOSTS TAKE 5 MINUTES AND FUCKS UP THE ENTIRE SCOREBOARD AND TURNS EVERYBODY INTO GHOSTS

WHY DO YOU STILL THINK PEER TO PEER IS A VIABLE MULTIPLAYER TECHNOLOGY FOR A TRIPPLE-A GAME IN 2022, GET A FUCKING GRIP

-The AI is partly TERRIBLE. They have a tendency to just ram into you in corners going for gaps that don't exist, just ruining your race. 
Getting to a multiplayer game also seems to be pretty painful, took me at least 10 minutes to find a single lobby where I could drive. 

As of typing this- I've spent probably the last 10 minutes waiting for someone to load into the game with nothing to do as you cannot open any menu when it's ""waiting for players...""  Pretty ridiculous. You also can't really tell me that's it'd be difficult to implement some working system, literally every other game does it fine, but seems like EA struggles with it. Would make it 20 minutes of waiting for a game... Great. 

If the issues are fixed then it's great, but unless you really know and need the F1 22, I wouldn't particularly recommend it in it's current state.

Update: Still lots of occasional bugs such as losing the DRS indicator lights from the steering wheels due to an update which broke it, taken very long to fix it.

i was skeptical about buying this game due to the VR performance being bad. well, perhaps it was bad in the beginning but i can tell you now i love it. holds solid 80. i cant bump it to ultra or high settings but medium looks really good and smooth. occasionally you will get a quick drop but its so fast you can live with it. 

alot of people are complaining but thats probably because they dont know how to tune the graphics correctly then start bashing the devs. the thing just came out and already improvements are happening.

Joining a session fails 50% of the time, when finally joining a session it is bugged and wont start. While trying to find a new one the game puts you back in the previous one which is still bugged.
To make it worse this was already a big problem with F1 2021 and this game has the exact same issues. Also the gameplay is really similair to 2021. Same game modes, same feeling, same bugs. Online also still has the exact same problems, strange penalties and a standard safaty car for 30% of the race.

Jesus the game is buggy af! Locked inside the menu during gameplay, constant crashes you name it. It's really an early access build at this point. Cars are nice to drive, AI is hell of a lot aggressive and some post race cinematics are nice. Apart from that nothing great really.

EDIT:

Tried out multiplayer. Turns out it's worse than single player. A lobby with over 10 players is a recipe for disaster. It gets stuck on the loading screen because of one or two people and rest of the lobby has to wait for them to load in or quit the game. These were last year's issues ported into this game.

Wanted to try out MyTeam. Guess what? The game is stuck at loading screen for FP1.

EDIT 2: Single player Gran Prix mode is also stuck in loading screen and never starts the race. I'm done with this game!

FINAL EDIT: Built a new PC but this time on the Intel platform. Game works as expected. My laptop running an AMD CPU with an RTX 3060 still doesn't load into certain game modes. I'll leave that here.

My choice to recommend the game or not is really hard, because i really love Formula 1, and the technical side of the sport.
My last F1 game what i played was the F1 18, what i really enjoyed and loved it. But the time is going towards, the life is changed. Ea buyed codemasters, and this changed the game someway, this game is with mini transaction, what nobody like, but everyone want, this is the devil side of all. The game is enjoyable, and the My team mode is my first what i played, and i really enjoyed, its better than carrier mode(F1 18 VS F1 22).
This game not preventing the reality, Red Bull engine is more powerfull in real life than in the game, and the mercedes is powerfulled, than irl, i really hope in the near future this will be changed to be like in the reality.
The game has some bugs, and some lags, but not that much what i espected. I really enjoy the game, the new handling module, the new cars are very specially, but i very missing to change your car conception like to Ferrari or to Red Bull, to get the same sidebox.

Okay, let's start with Pros:
[list]
[*]New 2022 cars, New Miami track
[*]Big update for Australia and Abu Dhabi, slightly smaller update for Spain, some small updates to a few other tracks
[*]New handling is challenging at first but good enough when you get at least some hang of it
[*]VR is finally available
[*]You can have F1 Sprint races now
[*]There's a soundtrack now which isn't too bad (general Theme still remains as usual)
[*]Plenty of options for game configuration
[*]You can finally select Tyre allocation again (in a way)
[*]Cross-Play!
[/list]
The Cons though...
[list]
[*]Almost no changes to Career Modes when compared to last year - even more, I think the game potentially went backwards?
[*]Supercars - Enough said.
[*]F1 Life - pointless. Literally there to push microtransactions.
[*]Very few Multiplayer changes
[*]Accessibility Options went BACKWARDS after1.05 update (Voice-to-Chat and backwards options were REMOVED)
[*]AI is still meh (they seem a bit stupid rather often)
[*]A rather high amount of game glitches and bugs, plus usually a good amount of NEW bugs with every patch
[*]Audio has some issues and it looks like they are not going to be fixed
[*]Issues with various control devices (gamepads, wheels)
[*]Graphics seem a bit worse than last year somehow, but that may be just me
[*]Generally high game price on Steam
[*]Cross-play is generally glitchy unfortunately
[*]Maybe something else, if I remember something I'll add later on
[/list]

Honestly, I would like this game. I enjoy the handling much more than in F1 2021 - and I could recommend the game just for that. However it is hard to justify the price for this game when I have already seen everything back in F1 2021, plus there REALLY isn't anything new.

But this year I've lost hope on Ferrari and now FINALLY for EA. WTF is this? I'm used to play around 90-100 AI depending on a game. Now that I used AI 90 they are impossible to follow or race against. I thought that it's because I'm **** at the game but now that I've played this for a while I realize that the AI is overpowered. Take an example quali in Monza. My average grid with Alpine have been around 10-6th. But now without tow I was dead last. Second run with a slipstream from a Merc. 15th... The slipstream is almost non-existent and the DRS doesn't help much. In the race I was stuck behind a Alfa Romeo because it had so much speed on straight even without the DRS. I should have easily passed them since our upgrades on R&D are much higher level.
There are so many glitches I've encountered and many other things that disturb me but I will not go through them.

I like this one more than 21, EA actually did good on this game after having full rights over production for the first year, even on the marketing leading up to this game, it lead me to be so hyped up for the release that I even bought the Champions Edition for 3 days early access. As soon as I loaded into the game I was quite pleased actually, amazing changes in the look of the game, mechanics and even the music. So far EA has actually propelled this franchise in the right direction over the wrong, and I hope that this upward trend continues into the next years of the franchise.

Physic feels weird. Its like drive a car on the rail all the time. Sometime it just understeer for no reason and then suddenly, It just snap oversteer right before my eye. Maybe they need to patch or rework on tyre physic as soon as possible.

The new sound profile ""Driver"" is good. So far I really like it. Heavy bass right on my ear, What a beautiful sound of F1. And the sound of ignition cut when you shift gear in F2 is just amazing! Peww! Peww! Pewww!

Not worth buying now, Maybe wait it for like 6-12 month or get it when you can find a good deals.

Here's my personal thoughts on F1 22, agree to disagree that's fine.

I've played Driver career, MyTeam, Online, Time Trail and played a bit with the F1 life.
I have really enjoyed this game, potentially making this one of the best F1 games for a very long time. For me this beats all other games made by Codemasters, and for me 2020 was the best codemasters game until now. 

Besides a few bugs here and there which by the way is standard for Codemasters to do, just think back to f1 2021's release, the game is amazing. At first I was having crashing problems with VR however this wasn't F1 22's fault it was SteamVR after a quick uninstall of SteamVR to then reinstall all my issues were sorted. Playing this game in VR with the Quest 2 is the best thing in the world. I'm not a huge fan of single player I tend to do Two Player Career mode most, but since launch I've played MyTeam the most. 

Pros - VR is very good
        - AI are more Aggressive 
        - Racing is alot cleaner and nicer
        - Kerbs aren't stupidly harsh
        - Is a lot closer to being a Sim

Cons - Non

Now I might be biased here, but for me there are no cons, yes I'm not a fan of F1 life and the Supercars however that doesn't make them a con, but also I've had little to no problems with the game but that might be due to my insanely overkill computer.

Overall one of the best games Codemasters has made.",1656669518,1669148253,True,0,0,0.512685656547546387,0,True,False,False

The improved handling and supercar challenges are cancelled out by the lack of a story mode and the superfluous new F1 Life mode, making for a game that gives as much as it takes away.

For a number of years now the F1 games have been delivering rock-solid recreations of the sport, meaning anyone expecting an enormous overhaul anytime soon is setting themselves up for disappointment.

This year, however, things are a little different (but only a little). With the real-life F1 seeing some notable changes to its regulations and aerodynamic rules this season, F1 22 has undergone a revamp.

The new car designs mean that instead of ‘flat floors’ there are now aerotunnels on their undersides. This means the car is pulled down more as air flows through it. The result is a game that does handle somewhat differently, though not to the extent that it’s a completely different experience.

There’s more grip on corners and there’s minimal drag on straights, to the extent that players who put a lot of time into F1 2021 will notice a difference, but adjusting to it will take no more time than adjusting to the fact that the title formatting has gone from ‘2021’ to just ‘22’.

There may be minor differences on the track, then, but it’s the new F1 Life mode that EA and Codemasters are trumpeting as the latest big addition to the series.

The most interesting part of the new F1 Life mode is the addition of supercars, which can be driven in time trials or a series of 40 special ‘Pirelli Hot Laps’ challenges.

The unlocking process for these supercars is surprisingly restrained, as players simply earn tokens by racking up mileage. There’s no way to buy them with real money, and there’s a separate mode outside of F1 Life which lets you take on the challenges anyway – the tokens are only used to ‘buy’ the cars for display in your hub.

F1 Life seems fairly throwaway at the moment, then, but thankfully the Career mode remains present and accounted for. It isn’t enormously different to that in F1 2021, meaning players who’ve already thoroughly rinsed that game may get a strong sense of deja vu.

Naturally, there are new additions to fit the F1 2022 season. There’s a new Miami circuit, some circuits have been modified to match their real-life tweaks, and a few events have the new Sprint qualifying rounds which have proved popular with the F1 fanbase. For the most part, though, it’s business as usual.

In fact, our biggest takeaway (for want of a better word) isn’t what’s been added to F1 22, but what’s been removed from it. The ‘Braking Point’ story mode in F1 2021 may have been a bit on the clichéd side, but it was still an interesting way to play through an F1 career.

This time there’s no story mode at all, meaning solo players will have to make do with the existing Career mode, the 40 Pirelli Hot Laps supercar challenges and the regular daily challenges designed to give XP for the Podium Pass unlockables.

The net result of all this is that in a season notable for its attempts to push the sport to the next level, F1 22 feels more like a game in which progress has neither been gained nor lost.

For some titles, this would be potentially catastrophic, but the reality is that F1 22 is still an immensely impressive take on the sport, with Codemasters’ trademark pedigree on full display with some of the most satisfying racing action you’ll find on console or PC.

If you’re the sort who put 100+ hours into the last game you may be underwhelmed at the relative lack of new features, but judged on its own merits F1 22 is the best in the series to date, even though it comes down to a photo finish.",1659885237,1669145311,True,4,0,0.531068980693817139,0,True,False,False

I'm using V3 Pedals and a V2.5 wheel.   Things I don't like are how in time trial mode, what's this ""Fast Lap"" throw us on the track all about?!  Why can't we drive out from the garage and to the track like real drivers?   I also turn off all my assists. I don't want any race line of any kind!  I turn off all assists to the car, but the problem then is that it will bump you up to expert mode from what i can tell, unless there's a way I can have all the assists off, so I can practice reading the track to learn, but then I don't seem to have the ability to turn down the AI separately?  If I turn down the AI then assists are automatically turned on to various degrees of ease from controlling my throttle to painting that race line in front of me!    To me that's not good!   Also, should be able to select amount of other race teams on and off track in Trial mode instead of being deserted.
But I do really enjoy the action the way the car handles and there are some set up options I like.   I like driving in the cockpit using my TrackIR v5 as it adds a nice ability to look around and lean my head while driving. It's not VR but it's better than a fixed position while in the cockpit.  I want to be in the car , not on top of the car.  I think driving on top of the car in TV cam view is sort of like cheating. Or if it's not cheating it's easier to see and drive.
I like what's presented here for the 2022 season, but I wish with the graphics and feedback quality which EA is known for, I wish EA would add DLCs of older classic tracks like Laguna Seca, SPA, Watkins Glenn and more of the classic tracks with the EA quality that exists.    I really wish EA would create an Indy tour circuit for 2023 with all the tracks and circuit features within the North American F1 , basically Indy car with set ups for road course and Oval 500!
But back to F122.  I think there could be some more freedom with cars and pit crew while driving in trial mode, practice pit stops with crew available.  Drive in and out from garage and allow multiple cars out to practice at different AI levels without any assists forced back on so I can practice competing with them in something other than Expert level.
But I really enjoy what we have.",1669010565,1669138240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the core the game is still an awesome racing game. The new cars feel awesome and very different.

BUT they focusing on the wrong elements.

F1 Life:
A feature nobody asked for and is a horrible way to try to sell cosmetic items. The Sims look a like menu with street cars.
This is a F1 game, not Forza or Grand Turismo. There are community mods to replace the Sims menu. I think thats says all.

MyTeam:
so much room for improvement and they done little to nothing in 2022. this is the main mode for the most players and it left behind because of street cars and F1 life. 
Placement of sponsors needs to be in the hand of the player, livery editor or more realistic liverys in the store would make them so much money. no other cosmetics like style your driver with lifestyle cloth needed.

Engine:
still a good engine, but it's time for something new

Sound:
they finally need to step up their game on the motor sounds

Update for cars and tracks:
the core of an offical licensed game. the most realistic copy of all tracks and cars.
still to this point (end of season) there are tracks with no update to replicated real world changes.
car changes and different liverys need more and faster updates.

I hope in 23 they will find their way back on track.",1668974186,1668974186,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My 2080ti overclocked on low settings & game still crashes yet at high to Ultra settings still getting 70 fps & the game still crashes lol the game was optimised by gumby it seams, its a real shame to have this as it looks & feels like a great f1 game hopefully they patch this peice of shit so we can enjoy it funny thing is tho it's had an update or 2 but did they fix the stutter issue oh hell no i mean wtf................Flukn muppet masters at it again ""Piece of shet it's in the game""

After An upgrade in Motherboard & CPU this game runs so much better now I'm getting 90 fps & it looks fantastic you still get the static stutter with head movement a little bit with G2 in the pits but overall the performance boost has made all the difference in the game.
And because of the play-ability in the game & the driving mechanics I will change my review to Positive but it's still hard to be positive as a lot of people won't be able to play in VR due to stutter from hardware.
So that is unfortunate as it's the best handling F1 game I have played also having a series 8 intel CPU prior it seams it's not a very well optimised game for older Gen CPU's & they recommend an Intel Core i3-2130 or AMD FX 4300 So i was over that with older 8th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-8700K Yet For VR: Intel Core i5-9600k so clearly not well optimised at all for VR.",1657475490,1668905304,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Fun game if you like F1 cars and drive on tracks
2. Fun game to play togheter with friends
3. Carrer mode can even been played with friends and alone
4. Something to try to be good on e.g be Fastest on track and get the best time possible
5. Multiplayer is very enjoyable and can even be funnier then carrer mode
6. Things to unlock like Paints to your F1 Car etc.

The game is having huge performance issues atm on PC , when it first came out and even for the first few months it was running smooth as fuck on pretty much max settings and after EA (EnormousAssholes) started releasing their nice little patches all of a sudden a good 60-70FPS randomly dissappeared into nowhere and as we are standing now even if i turn everything to the lowest , altough i still have 150-180 FPS , the screen is tearing , stutters , huge fps drops everywhere , it just runs like a sack of shit after all these ""performance improving"" patches.
I personally didnt have problem with the gameplay i knew it was never gonna be a perfect so i didnt have high expectations but i enjoyed it while it was running fine , now its unplayable...
The things what boils my blood is that EA yet again is ruining a franchise , a company and a game series that had a really bright future ahead...literally everything they touch and they get involved in just turns out to be an absolute fckin disgraceful pile a shit...and i feel like f1 22 is just the beggining of the downfall , codemasters sold its soul and betrayed everyone who supported them by buying their games for the last 12 years...if there is a company that deserves to burn in hell and should be fckin deleted from this world is EA fckin sports....go take your F1LIFE and put it up your fckin ass , hopefully it gives you cancer , like you are giving to the gaming community for the last decade...shame",1657738908,1668898984,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I myself really like the changes that have been made, and feel like it has been a major improvement. The new cars look amazing, and it's very nice that you can even choose the coating of the car (matte, metallic, etc).

The addition of F1 Life and the Supercars is also a neat change. However, when on the topics of these additions, I had higher expectations. 
- The Supercars were quite easily earned, and new supercars never released. I hoped for some more additions in this field as part of updates or even as part of the Podium Pass, but unfortunately.
- F1 Life could have been more... At the moment it's just a customizable field, but there are not a lot of interactive elements. Sure, you can customize your player and your house, as well as show off your earned supercars, but that's about it. Would have liked to see some more interactivity on this addition. Also, most F1 Life earnables can only be bought, with some obtainable in the Podium Pass. Would have liked to see some challenges, making some incentive towards playing.

Support for the game has been good however, and the updates have improved the game even more over time. Nice addition of giving some freebies from time to time. Overall a great game and I love it to bits.",1668865952,1668865952,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

How this franchise has developed since F1 2020 is a joke. EA needs to provide dedicated servers for online play soon, or this franchise will be dead quicker than you can spell F1 23... Really, really disappointed with this game, and I have owned several of the Codemasters F1 editions since 2017, including over 1k hours of gameplay, and this clearly is the worst of them all.

Nov 13th @ 11:24am: Proceed with caution...

Revisiting this old review I gave the game after the first two weeks... and I'm afraid to say it's basically the same thing, but worse. I especially don't rec this game to anyone seriously interested in improving their driving or joining a league.

Bottom line: The game is loaded with bugs that aren't fixed from patch to patch.

Let me explain briefly: Leagues are not cross-platform. In the cross-platform ""league"" I'm currently in, we have to create a custom lobby and invite everyone from there. But here's the kicker: invites to servers only work about 70% of the time. That's extremely disappointing when you practice throughout the week, set aside time once a day to race in the league itself, and then you can't even participate. And even if you get into the game itself, you might get kicked, or your game might crash unexpectedly. 

I'm not sure what the issue is with this release. The last few F1 games have had their fair share of goofy bugs and kinks, but they were never this game-experience breaking before. I sincerely hope CM and EA figure out how to fix this, or else I really see this franchise going in a downward trend.",1657512435,1668360863,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Single player could be fun, if it weren't for the bugs. Apparently some of them have been there in 2020 and 2021 and still not fixed.
For example AI cheating in wet races. they just flat out do not care about conditions when the accelerate (in corners they do, but only there), its like if they are driving on dry tarmac. just not fun, when at start half the grid just flies past you and you have no chance of catching up. Also you cannot adjust the AI to compensate for that, cause thats not allowed on race events, only between them... 

Multiplayer is usualy a pretty bad experience, in every race you get people, that just intentionally try to rear end people, spinn them around or try to crash them if you try to overtake them.
and that is IF you get into a lobby in the first place. this game has some bad netcode. if you try to find a specific lobby that you know exists (like from a streamer) it is a gamble, for it to even show up in the list. also if you try to join, in about 90% of the time you get a time out and error message that the host is not answering. they have a button to cancel the attempt, which is not working, the game just locks up until you get the error message...
before the latest patch the game could be discribed as ""waiting simulator"" in multiplayer lobbies (in between loading screens). they claim to have improved their netcode, which is true, but only marginable.

all of this for 60€? luckily i got it on discount, but 30€ is still too much at this point.

F1 22 should have brought more of the F1 experience only, with the focus on the AI balance, team balance, players balance, physics and mechanics of the F1 cars. The example to point it out, while playing the carrier mode your engine just dies in the second race if you managed to win the first grand-prix, and your, potential rival ended up in the midfield in the second race, you simply have to retire your car due to engine failure.

What went wrong here?

Well, it is still F1 game, it has new cars, it has them tracks.
They patched vibration on controllers.
It is good to play, when it works.
Corrupted saves, constant crashes, new errors with each patch.


Big no, until somebody else than EA gets the license.
------
Update 8th Nov

Tried the game again to see if I was wrong.
Over 40 min attempt:
--- 2x crashes to desktop
--- 1x game chosing different strategy for me than the one I selected
--- 6x gross bad driving - you get overtaken by faster car at the end of straight, car drives tiny in your direction and slams brakes little before braking zone, so their back wheel destroys front wing. I mean, if somebody would be doing that in F1 now, s/he would have been hated, penalized and dropped from F1.

So, not much change. Uninstall.

your game (F1 22) is real sh*t! 
It's really hard to tell my feeling about this game. It's so frustrating when you are compeeting in online race and game crashed. Impossible to reconnect and no one can help me. Peple just can't send me invite and only may watch our YouTube stream where my AI falling down the order and finished last. 

Basics
- The physics and driving model is unreal. Car just spins everytime, everywhere. Throtle goes crazy in the middle od the corner and you spun or out of knowhere.

Multiplayer is maybe the biggest problem.
- Bugs are everywhere. Inviting into the session is amazing. People send 3 invites and I got only one.
- Wet races are ****! Safety car delta is broken! -5 sec. when SC go on the track. Delta -5 sec. when someone goes to the pits. Tyres are useless after SC and it's impossible to drive on it.
- And lots of others... I may write a seminar work about bugs or what is wrong in this game.

It's AMAZING you want for this 70 Euros or how many, when was new. This Game is old like the bugs and thats mean, this game is very old! There are bugs from maybe 2016 and that's a lot of time. Most of it is from 2020 and 2021. You only copying old bugs and you are unable to fix it! And when you copying old things from old games, WHY WE HAVEN'T Hockenheim or Sepang? Just Why?

Go Home! And Think How To FIX THIS GAME! 
Is incredible how is your Rally games good and F1 games BAD!

I said after F1 2020 I wouldn't buy another one until they included VR which they have finally done.  Performance isn't great and you'll have to turn down plenty of the graphics options unless you have HAL9000 sitting next to you.  But the immersion of VR makes up for the detail lost

Everybody is hating on the F1 Life which is completely fair, but you can ignore it completely without consequence as far as I can tell.

I was so hyped for this game because ea somehow managed to market this game so well, but here i am about three months after launch and im speechless, there are so many wrong things with this game that i cant even mention all of them like: AI is horrible and wont move even when being blue flagged or told to in qualifying, the amount of bugs this game has, the amount of times i closed the game but it wont close so i had to restart my pc (i have an RTX3070 and intel i9 pc) and simply the lack of features. so if you are thinking about buying this game just DONT because this game is worse than f1 21 and that game was an absolute disaster.

I've integrated this game into my F1 watching experience; I've been running a race in the game before watching the races on TV which helps me learn the nuances of each track. The previous F1 game that I played was F1 2018, so I've been enjoying the upgraded visuals and driver lineups.

However, there are several bugs that should have been fixed. I'm currently stuck in career mode because the game doesn't remember that I've changed my tires. I'm racing in Imola, and with 2 laps to go my race engineer tells me that I need to use 2 different compounds (despite having gone from soft to medium 5 laps ago). I ignore the warning and get black flagged on the last lap.  I rewind, try to pit, and they replace my mediums with other mediums, and am black flagged again, without the ability to rewind far enough to fix this. So I restart my race, thinking it's a one-off, and it happens again. So I pit again on the last lap for a Soft -  Medium - Hard tire strategy, and I get black flagged on the last lap anyway. So now I've wasted a good 45 minutes trying to complete this race but can't because of this bug.

Like I said, overall it's fun, and I feel like I will get my money's worth, but it occasionally has game-breaking bugs.",1667444067,1667444067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played 160+ hours of F1 20 and 300+ hours on F1 21, and while F1 21 was itself a letdown from 2020 (except for the Braking Point storyline), F1 22 breaks all records on number of bugs a fully finished game from a professional studio can have. If you're a patient person, it will still be a tricky situation as every update somehow makes the game worse than last one. EA developers need to listen to the gaming community on what's working in the game and what's not, but instead they keep messing up every aspect of the game that runs well and leave the bugs intact. 

The handling is worse than the last game, the simulation is pathetic, and don't even go for the online lobbies if that's what you're buying this game for. I have never had as many bugs/glitches in online lobbies as this game. Stick to games like iRacing if you're buying this for online competitive races.

The only aspect I can recommend this game for is that it's unintentionally funny. Weird incidents will keep happening during online Two Player Career mode (which is way worse than F1 21) as well as lobbies, which will make you laugh if you're not seriously racing. For all other purposes, this game will give you more migraine than the latest MCU movies. 

EA needs to stop treating gaming/sports fans with utmost disrespect just to churn out new games every year that don't work. If your developers need more time, it's fine, we can wait. They seem not to care anymore though.

Price - With its current state, it's not worth even a $10 investment (I pre-ordered it for more than $40).

1. F1 22 car's rear is just too unstable to drive without the traction control. Driving with the traction control takes lot of joy out of driving so this is a dilemma.
2. I am using Thrustmaster T300RS Racing Wheel and whenever I pause or start on drive out wheel's feedback pressure is gone for 2~3 seconds  for some reason. (Did not happen in any of previous F1 game series.)
3. You start out with even less clothing and customization options to begin with, compared to any of the previous F1 game series.
4. If you are into just Racing then there are basically no new contents beside new F1 car that have a terrible rear traction.

Much of the game feels like a carry over from the previous titles, although I do like the immersive additions added to pit stops and formation laps. I just wish they had spent more time and effort developing  new ways like this to make the game even more immersive. But no, instead we got an ironically lame ""sims"" F1 life mode with a super cars hot laps facade that tries to rip of Grand Tourisme, but fails. 

Firstly, this is an F1 game, wtf do I want to drive super cars? And secondly those should have been older / vintage F1 cars. F1 has a huuuge heritage, why EA doesn't draw from the sports history, like including a historic F1 campaign mode (driving in the 1970's for eg as Nikki Lauda or James Hunt) is still a mystery to me.

F1 2021, while not being the best F1 game, was still solid and a good amount of fun, Same goes for F1 2020. But Sadly, I don't think I can really say that about this game, it has its moments, but for the most part, I find myself getting bored after just a few laps. My biggest problem with this game is the lack of innovation, and just overall lack of change from F1 2021 & F1 2020. After F1 2020, F1 games have been slowly removing content from the newer games. F1 2021 lacked Classic Cars, which is one of my favorite parts of the F1 games. F1 22 (from what i can remember) didn't remove anything that we had in previous games, but they spent WAY to much time on the new things they added. The Pirelli Hot Laps seemed neat at first, but after about 2 drives in the cars, i didnt care anymore, and anytime i was asked to do them i would just get annoyed. This is an F1 game, not Forza, there is no reason that Supercars should be in the game, but not Classic Cars. Second is F1 Life, which seemed like it could be cool at first, but is just a huge waste of time and money, Im trying to play an F1 Game, not Sims. why is the Item Shop usually littered with all this F1 Life stuff instead of Liveries, Overalls, Helmets, Etc.? For me, the only really cool/good thing they did, was finally adding VR support for PC users. But that in itself isnt very well optimized, its got better since launch, but it still has its fair bit of small problems. And dont even get me started on the lack of ANY changes to My Team, they didnt change anything, other than a UI piece here and there, but other than that, nothing is different between My Team in this game, and in F1 2021. With all that being said, the game is very meh, and i feel no want or desire to play this game, and im pretty disappointed.

First of all, when I try to turn an F1 car using a controller on a game, the car doesn't always turn immediately, but does later and I end up crashing into the AI. Second, there is a ridiculousy large amount of settings on the game, and some always have the same buttons with other settings or controls, and I can't always use a control I want to use, such as a flashback and when I go to 'Instant Replay' in a quick race, there is no setting for a flashback.

First let's talk about the good things about the game. It looks really nice and has a lot of new interesting features. It even played really well in the beginning, and then came the patches....

First thing I noticed are the horrible commercials from EA now that they taken over Codemasters, the obnoxious connection to EA game server on about every screen as well. But hey I could get over this. Then came a patch that changed the AI behaviour and not for the better.

Now the AI is super annoying and difficult, but not because he actually drives better, but because he clearly cheats (I know AIs are supposed to do this a little, but it should not be so obvious). Also the AI is now very idiotic, it even slams in the side of me during start and then takes me with him on the front bumper until the next corner. By that time I have even gotten a penalty for obstruction, even though I have no option to get out of the way.

These things did not happen before and have taken all the joy out of the game for me. I will not stop playing it entirely and check up on the game in the hope it gets fixed. But at the current state I simply would not recommend this game. Just stick with 2021 until this is fixed.",1666809829,1666809829,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hey I’m 65 do I really want to play ‘dressy ups’. If I’ve learned anything in this life one of the BASIC, (I’m even going to say it again) one of the BASIC things I learned was “If it works DON’T FIX IT”, but tell me I’m wrong. Alright, they’ve brought back a few things, but the NEW graphs for tyre wear and battery usage, well!! I’m laughing at the guy(s) who designed that, because they are laughing at us, it’s so cheesy!

So, what were my dreams for this game, 
Let us pick the game we like best, for me as I’ve said 2020, then sell us DLC’s for the new stuff, ie when new tracks, new rules, new cars are developed in real life, sell us that bit, I’m sure even now you could do that.
If there is a 2023 will I buy it, lets hope Steam put it up for a free weekend again, but I’ll never buy it at full price, not even at half price…

1. Return of historic F1 cars
2. New tracks added every so often that don't disappear when the next F1 game comes out (they are doing this to an extent which I respect).
3. Adaptive AI or a way to easily determine your AI level. I constantly struggle with trying to get the right balance so it's actually competitive relative to the car I'm in so I'm not running away with the race in a McLaren but also not feeling uselessly slow.
4. F3 cars
5. Much more advanced livery editor with real sponsors that are on the F1 grid.
6. Custom Helmet Maker
7. More custom race features that let you try unique rules (reversed grid orders, number of required pit stops, etc). 
8. Red Flags

1. Cross platform co-op available (probably the best new feature added)

I wasn't going to bother buying this until it was heavily discounted, but as it was a free weekend, I gave it a try in VR, and then I couldn't resist buying it at half price.

The first thing I notice is, if you already have F1 2021 and no interest in using this in VR, then it's not really worth buying, though I have already noticed one or two differences after the first few hours:
 - the handling is different, not better or worse, just different - possibly it's a bit easier to wheel spin out of corners so I have to be a bit more careful on the throttle, but so far I have no complaints about that.
 - second, if you cause any damage, the repair time is often much longer than previous F1 games, so you can be sitting in the garage for 20 minutes, which is more realistic than the previous 4 minutes I used to regularly see.
 - difficulty is much harder, but that doesn't matter, it just means starting with a lower setting - (I used to play on 85 to 90, but i'm starting my F1 22 career at 65). 
 - the radio engineer sound mix has been adjusted, & Jeff has been replaced with a new voice, and I think it's somehow slightly more realistic sounding.

But my main reason for buying F1 22, and for bothering to review it, is the VR experience. The game runs just fine for me in VR, and after testing it in a few GPs, at Australia and Monaco, I was impressed enough to buy it, and I am definitely planning to run most, if not all of my career in VR. I have the HP Reverb G2 headset, Gigabyte Z390 Gaming X motherboard, i7 4770K, Windows 10 64bit, 32GB ram, Gigabyte 3080ti GPU. 
I do see a very slight amount of 'judder' in my vision during pitstops / when sitting on the start grid before the race / or when sitting in the garage. BUT otherwise, for the entire race, the whole experience is smooth, even at a traditionally power hungry circuit like Monaco.

Of course I have many graphic details turned down to medium or lower, compared to playing on the monitor, but the experience (and graphic appearnace) still easily matches or beats my other race sims in VR (I regularly play AMS1 and Raceroom in VR, & they are great but do not quite match F1 22). I don't know what else to tell you, for me, it just works. I have had VR for a number of years, and this is the first time in a while that I have been 'wowed' by VR, and I'm driving in an F1 car with a permanent grin.

So the bottom line for me is, if you want to try it in VR, then buy it and give it a go. If your system doesn't want to run it smoothly, then you can always refund it, but I'm very happy with it.

As for the non-VR side of things, it's time Codemasters thought of something else to add. It's not worth £50 just to change the car shapes & liveries each season, while copying and pasting everything else, you should be ashamed. Of course, not much changes from year to year, but £50 ? No, it's too much. 
I mean, how about expanding the 'My Team' mode to include a 'Manager mode', so I could control both drivers' strategies and sit back and watch/control them during the race weekend if I want, rather than actually drive every session? That would be better than the pointless 'F1 Life' that someone thought was worth investing time & effort into.

Unfortunately, things are never that simple and once you have the VR headset on, you then get hit with confirming access to your EA account, via emailed code. Take the headset off, go to email, get code, headset back on, try to find a way to input code in VR... blah blah blah. In sort, if you're gonna play in VR, it might be best to play out of VR the first time just to get everything setup. Luckily, despite complaints about supported controller not being available, my Logitech wheel worked fine, as did my mouse and keyboard when required. Once in, the visuals are great, although I still need to find an option to remove the halo strut from my vision. Authentic or not, it's annoying. Gameplay (and this is a game, not a simulator) seems very forgiving and perhaps I need to look for other options to make it more challenging. There seems to be a fashion for countless menu screen these days and they are not always intuitive. Most of the time I just want to jump in and race without all of this window dressing and ""full experience"" nonsense. Maybe the first screen show offer you a UI selection of ""Just Play"" or ""Waste my time with additional content"" options. I should say that I did the weekend free trial of this title and I was 50/50 on whether to buy it but as it was half-price, I decided to pull the trigger. I would have never payed full price.

     After a few updates the game has smoothed out alot. VR finally works and OMG is it an experience!!!! 
     I still think they should add a system to guide new players. If it weren't for my much more knowledgeable friends i still wouldn' know when to use softs vs mediums. I Still dont understand the presets and why i would pick one over the other. 
     Over all I do recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a sim style racing game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly! f1 life is a waste of time, money, and resources. the super cars, not needed. we want this game because we want to race f1. The VR doesn't work at all! multiplayer is not cross play even between Origin and steam. 
  With that out of the way, the actual driving is the game is cool, i haven't seen any game breaking bugs or anything that effect the single player experience. my friends say the cars slide a bit more the F1 21. This is my 1st F1 game so I don't know a whole lot about the ins and outs. I enjoy driving the F1 cars around the tracks, with and without assist. I think they should add stuff to help new players understand the different tire compounds, DRS, and ERS. other than that it is like any other racing sim game. 
   OVERALL I would not buy this game yet. they say cross play is coming and hopefully the VR will be fixed as well, but if your just trying to race some fancy cars, F1 21 might be cheaper now. if you are an F1 super fan and car about the teams and liveries then have fun but i still don't think it is worth the money",1656965784,1666432032,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

With this out of the way, the game overall is quite good. Compared to 2021 it has some nice upgrades in RTX graphics and overall car handeling. However the F1 Life feature seems kind aout of place and doesn't bring anything usefull to the table. Same has to be said about the Pirelli Races. They just take up time and ""supercars"" are really..really bad. I owned cars that were faster and better in ALL regards, that I would not consider supercars at all. Come on...140-150 kmh in a corner...I'm German, those are rookie numbers. Seriously Codemasters, you should try our Autobahn...you'd be surprised.

It's a good game however but you shouldn't expect too much and if you played 2021 it pretty much feels like the same game with different textures (even some...if not most...of the audio queues are the same). 

Would I reccomend it? Well yes and no. Not if you already own 2021 or 2020. You won't get your money's worth. If you're new to the series it's a good start but if you're willing to wait, do so and maybe 2023 will deliver a better experience.",1666220124,1666220124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Three years ago, EA told us ‘take their money, place them into the cockpit and they are still unable to drive the car.’ Three years later, Jarno told us ‘This game is bad, but it's my job, it’s very complicated.’ And codemasters said that during the race – I don’t remember what race – They pressed the wrong button on the server. Question for you both: is F1 22 today too much broken with twenty and more bugs on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the Sims integration programme during the race? Less Sofas, more? Or less and more communication with Ikea?

Lads and ladies DO NOT BUY THIS 5 year old reskin. For those who already have, take a look at the file directory for 2022 teams and ask yourself why is Force India still listed, Why is Lotus still listed?

I might've looked through the house decor and clothing stuff once to see if any of it was cool (it wasn't).

The customization of the liveries and team colors is pretty good, the more you level up it seems the more patterns you can unlock, and you can throw your custom team color into a patterned livery however you see fit. 

This is my first sim racing game, so I'm using a cheap wheel from GameStop. Still, the car responds fairly well and throttle/brake response is good. Once I developed my trail braking (esp for Bahrain T9/10), even my cheap pedals worked well and are very sensitive. Tire deg is super real in this game, you can be throwing it through high speed turns no problem but after a 4-5 laps depending on the conditions you start going wide and feel understeery through most of the lap if you push. 

I started with most of the assists, and was going to wean myself off each assist one by one. But getting rid of one while having the others enabled felt really unnatural, so I turned them all off except for racing line to learn the tracks, and eventually I got the hang of it. I run the full length races with all practice sessions and quali, and I can easily burn 3-5 hours per session just driving and improving. I love getting lost in that flow, and managing my pitstops on the fly. 

The AI are a little dumb, they will allow you to pass for a blue flag and then shoot for a gap. They'll go for any gap. I've left only half a car width on the outside just to have an AI push it and pit me into the barricade. Don't forget to scale up the difficulty as you go, because you'll go to send it through a chicane and a dumbed-down AI that's way too slow will cause an accident real fast. 

My set up is incredibly basic and won't get me close to the professional times, but that's ok. Set the AI and assists the way you need it and you'll be good to go.

Post the patch that fixed my pedal issues, I'm back to re-review it. Look its ok. AI still probably a touch OP on the straights even with patch 1.08, but the biggest issue now is the fact that the AI crash into you when your alongside. You'll be battling side-by-side into a corner, and if your on the inside, the AI will just turn in like you don't exist. It's super annoying when you'll have your nose ahead and then the AI just turn in like your not there, forcing you off the track or into a wall. And of course, it feels like your being hit by a tank, and you can't fight back at all. Yeah overall its an ok game, if the ai get improved more than that would be nice. Also older/COVID year/Classic tracks with the 2022 spec cars would be nice.

*OLD REVIEW*

If you connect your wheel and pedals separately, don't be surprised when this game doesn't work. Documented quite well in the forums, but super frustrating. Bought the game out of FOMO and sort of impulsively, and now I can't even play it.

No way for me to connect my pedals to my base, which seems to be the cause for the game to not work.

AI is really fast on season 2 on my team career. I played 95 AI in season 1 and it was okay. Now I play 80 AI and
I'm still second slower than the AI.
Has alot of bugs.
So don't buy this game until they have fixed the straight line speed of AI's and some bugs.
I think this is the worst F1 game since F1 2015 so go play F1 2012 if you have it. F1 2012 is so much better.

Edit 2: The AI is so fucking irritating that when they try to overtake you into some corner they don't leave any space. They just fucking turn into you and you get front wing damage. 
Or when you try to overtake the AI the same happens they just turn into you still if you are clearly next to  the AI and then you get sidepod and floor damage of it. 
Today when I played my team career in France some fucking AI spun me in the chicane because it just drove into me.
Just wait until its sale.  Go play F1 2012 or 2013 instead. F1 2012 is still the goat and so is 13.

Edit 3: As I play with my wheel (Logitech G29) I need to turn a whole 450 degrees to the point where the car turns only 20 to 40 degrees and I have tried everything in Logitech G hub and in the game, but no it still doesn't work.
Is this a bug or is it my wheel. I don't even know if I explained this ''bug'' good. Why I didn't get refund when I had the chance. Yeah so DO NOT buy this shit. 0/10.

No, unless you really want the updated cars/ team colors and want to experience VR. Or if this is your first F1 game, this is a fine entry point. There's nothing I'd call actually bad, but there's not enough meaningful updates from 2021 to justify buying this for the average gamer. The game is really solid and most importantly, fun to play! There's just not enough separating this game from last year.

The Good:
Pit stop errors are a great, if sometimes frustrating, addition!
VR, at least for my Rift S, is cool, but could do with more HUD options.
The driving feels pretty good for someone who runs with very minimal to no assists.
AI having more mistakes I think was a good call. Makes some races really wild!
My Team and Driver Career are solid as always.
Still one of the most replayable racing games for solo players. Managing your car and/or team throughout multiple seasons, changing your team, changing season lengths and tracks used, all keep me coming back to this series. 

The Bad:
Crashes. I've had every F1 game since 2018 and this is the first time where at launch, the game is frequently crashing during loading screens. I'm sure devs are working on it, but still, it's an issue that should always be noted.

F1 LIFE. Oh boy. Aside from it being a clear EA cash grab, I believe this could have been solid. Showing off/ driving exotic cars and making a personalized living space sound pretty cool. But here's my biggest issue with this mode. Whoever came up with F1 Life is not an F1 fan. Instead of giving us exotic cars that you can play in almost any other racing game, return the classic F1 cars and collect those instead. It probably would have been relatively easy to do since the assets probably still exist in F1 2020. At least then fans get classic cars from various eras of F1. Oh and you could add more classic cars as DLC. I could honestly rant more but I'll end it there. TLDR, F1 life could have been easy fan service.

Car/ player customization. There's still a lot to be desired with changing the look of you and your My Team car. Having preset designs is great, but I'm pretty sure everyone would appreciate more control that games like Forza and Gran Turismo offer.

Like most annual franchises, new F1 games can feel samey, and the same is true now, if maybe a bit more so. Despite the cars handling differently compared to last year, the physics still feels very much the same.

For a game based on a sport where fractions of fractions amount to meaningful performance it's sad to see there is still no support for analysis or training. I would really like to see some training featured to help you understand the inputs and control that is required of an F1 car to really be fast or efficient. 

There's also no telemetry provided back in the game for you to review why your car may have been doing what it was doing. 

You can definitely muscle through all of the bull to find a gameplay loop that is fun in all of this. But for full MSRP it is insane and should be criminal that this is what players are receiving. 


Wait for a steep sale. Currently there are a lot of bugs, and force feedback is intermittently supported.


Pro:
Sound Design
Cars Go Fast
crossplay!

Con:
F1 Life mode a thinly skinned addition to encourage players to put in real money for 'customization' it's absolutely soulless and very in-your-face.
Supercars - what were they thinking?
Not all tracks are laser scanned
No story mode (braking point from previous games) 
Multiplayer does not have any mechanism to penalize bad actors / griefers
Multiplayer will hang for an infinite amount of time if a player fails to load in to the session after lobby. 
VR is broken
Force Feedback is broken, patched, and then broken on the next patch.

It's full of bugs, AI is completely broken, even barriers freak out and send you into orbit. The whole physics and performance of the cars is terrible and unrealistic.

This stupid F1 Life is completely unwanted, same with super cars and whatever you call this podium pass.
Codemasters & EA have really disapponted me beyond belief, I have owned every Codemasters F1 series game and this one makes me want a refund, it's not worth half or even a quarter of the price.
All these updates are bringing barely any fixes to the main gameplay, it's an unfinished game with so many performance issues. I've waited since it's launch and giving them a chance to fix this and it's far from fixed.

A completely broken game and has ruined the franchise, thanks EA for this piece of shit you call a game.

Okay game start with an crash,
Restart the game again and alt tab and another crash, okay classic.
Changed over to windowed borderless, no crashes since then.
Turn off Ray Tracing and Dlss ( use the amd version instead) and u can avoid crashing.
If all set correct the game shud run smooth and flawless.

F1 life is something we really didnt need, supercars is little meh. 
But with traction off and a wheel, supercars acualy got little fun to drive. 

Career mode is nearly same as 2021, not much new or changed, just little.
Most of the interviews are gone.

Then we come to the f1 driving.
At start cars feels very slippery, This year changes to aero and other stuff made the cars somewhat harder to start drive with.
But when u learn it, amazing game.

Using fanatec GT DD pro 8nm with csl pedal (loadcell),
Amd 3900x, nvidia 3070

Fast verdict: if u have f1 2021 i cant really recommend to upgrade, 
but I still recommend it from my own experience, I enjoy 22 more than 21.

Edit: after near 3 weeks playing now, i acualy enjoy this even more.
Recommeded to play with traction off, only with an wheel and pedals.

Edit2: After playing this after an fair amount of hours, over 170h now when i write this edit, i stand for most i wrote above but, when it comes to the AI i cant anymore recommend this game. they had an fix for over aggresive AI in patch 1.10 i beleave, what happen?
Well for me it feels it got more aggresive instead, feels like the AI kinda ignore you on track. 
So im such a person, i always play solo or with 1-2 friends.
Still dont get me wrong, still love this game but cant recommend it anymore untill this been looked over.",1656705132,1664805713,False,0,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

----------------------------
Update at the bottom
----------------------------

The UI is essentially a rip from F1 2021... but the car models are new (obviously), track updates are current, and the new handling is much improved.

They did add a lot of F1 Life crap that you expect now in most major EA games titles, where you can customize your living space and add supercars to your living space. Kind of a cool touch, but honestly, I would rather have the man hours spent in game development, it's really just another honeypot for people to pour money into.

The one thing I will critique - it would seem AI cars physics are much different than the players. Case in point, during a race, someone turned in front of me going into a corner, and I spun out. I then proceeded to test my theory and attempted to spin someone out by hitting one of their back wheels and again I spun somehow. They seem to be the immovable force no matter the situation. Anytime they squeak a wheel up the inside of a corner you're committed to, you spin and they will actually push you down the track as if you're not there.

Otherwise, this is a pretty good F1 game. If the new F1 regulations were not a part of the game, I'd say skip it, but the new cars and track layouts are worth the upgrade. I'm excited to see how VR grows as I think that could be a huge step in the franchise, especially with licensed brands wrapped into the deal.

UPDATE

After playing this game for a bit longer and joining leagues, I have to say that the bones of the game are still what I described above. However, the online functionality is very much broken.

I'll skip mentioning the lobbies and how poor everyone treats each other, and make note of a league I was in.

First, inviting in this game is just broken. You cannot invite from Steam Overlay, it has to be done in game, which would be fine, if it worked half the time. There were issues with invites going crossplay in our league, so we mostly disabled it. Not to mention the very regular server issues and people disconnecting.

Second, we had to recreate our league several times because we could not make changes to the settings of the league after creation. It might not matter for those more experienced with leagues, but we ended up just doing custom matches for the length of our season because it was easier.

Third it would be cool if people could rejoin games they DC from. A DC is obviously not the fault of the player, but they get punished and depending on if the league wants to restart the session, everyone gets punished.",1657500678,1664557809,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are trying to use VR, Quest crashes with it's own software, but if you use SteamVr, well then it crashes in the middle of the race ""SteamVR encountered a serious issue...""

-No updated driver models (same ones used for a couple years now)
-Cannot choose the shape of your My Team car, I feel like this is a missed opportunity
-Many bugs within the game at launch such as my audio cutting in and out (literally doesnt happen with anything else literally just F1 22 audio)
-Graphics are not that different but raytracing actually looks good this year
-Colours and textures are very off on certain cars such as the Redbull in particular, the silver on the Mercedes looks more grey than silver. 
-Supercars are very pointless in this game
-AI is broken at the time of this review, they go for unrealistic divebombs and they have invisible drs and infinite ers meaning they gap you on straights by a second even whilst I would have my drs and ers on
-Bought Champions edition of the game meaning I should've got the game 3 days early when in fact the game was released about halfway through the first day on steam even though it was supposed to be released at 7am BST.
-You can buy clothes and furniture for PitCoins which is absolutely ridiculous, seems to be a very common trend with EA games unfortunately
-I am very confused why there isnt a main menu fps limiter as it makes my gpu go crazy when its not even doing anything.


Overall, it is a good enough improvement and I am genuinely enjoying it. However, the devs (probably just EA) need to stop using the exact same assets from the previous games, it just comes across as very lazy. And no, I will not be spending my irl money on some digital furniture XD

At this current time I will not recommend until these bugs are addressed.

Like a second or so faster than i am. Even my own teammate in the same car. Its just bullsh*t! Thank you for ruining single player racing in this game.

For all who just want to play multiplayer: Go get it. Its way nicer to drive these cars than the ones from the last game.

EDIT: The AI speed is fixed in the newest Patch 1.08......just took them 2 month to fix. So i will take 2 month before changing the review to positive (if no other bug occurs until then)

EDIT 2: Games fine now. Enough time has passed and its all good now. AI speed is ok now. There are improvements to be made, but its good enough for me.

F1 21 was getting close to very good, and I can't understand how they managed to mess this one up so badly.

Bad:
- The AI is way too aggressive. They drive straight into you, either from behind or from the side, they are quite likely to 
   push you off the road or make you spin, and overall, just a lot worse than last year.
- In my personal opinion the graphics in general are worse than last year, at least when you're watching as a spectator. The 
   if you watch the road on a long straight, it doesn't load correctly, and it looks like the cars are just floating around.
- They should be able to make the in-game characters look more realistic. We are in 2022, and some games have 
   cinematic clips where it is almost getting hard to differentiate between the game and a real person. But the drivers look 
   like characters in GTA V, a 10-year-old game. We should be able to get something better.

Good:
- I like the new menu and the background. I don't see why they added the supercars, especially when they seem to have a 
   lot else to improve, but the office thing is a nice feature to look at.
- Damage is visually much better, and maybe also more realistically when it comes to how you get it. Now I get floor 
   damage when I drive over high curbs, which I don't think I got before. That's good.

At his point, my friend and I decided to go back to f1 21, hoping that this game will get fixed one day.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Release was a desaster. It took them weeks to make it semi playable. AI was and is completely broken in MyTeam mode, VR (main reason I bought this game) is utter trash. RTX 3080, I still get massive stuttering and only 70 fps with my G2 while 80% downscaling on lowest settings.
You can get it running by using some mods from racedepartment, but by the next update its unplayable again.

FFB is okay, highspeed sections feel very dull, low speed feels great. (Fanatec DD)

Multiplayer was so awful I havent tried it since patch 1.07 (lobby not even starting, cant exit loading screen because someone had a dc,...)

Supercars are okay, but the historic cars were way more fun. Its a fun gimmick inbetween MyTeam but they get boring pretty fast and the FFB feels terrible. 

BUT if you like spending real money on a fancy couch, lamp or some clothes for your ingame character, this game is great.

For 10-15€ you can give this game a go. (atm) Anything more feels like burning money.
If you want to have fun driving F1 cars, get AMS 2 or Assetto Corsa. Maybe even get F1 2021 or 2020 (No VR)

I played F1 2020 before, skipped 21 and waited specifically for this one. Gutted as certain driver would say. So the hugely game affecting bugs that are still here (1.10 patch as we speak) after 4months of release:

- AI still has unmatched traction out of certain corners in my team career; most noticable in Miami, Monaco, Baku, Bahrain, Monza, Brazil and to lesser extent on other tracks. Lowering the difficulty just makes the game unrealistic (I can gain 1second in 2nd Miami sector just to lose it in 3rd sector)
-related to above, the need to constantly shift difficulty level
-I have not had A SINGLE wet weather session in my teams career (4th season atm, % always say 1-4% rain chance, never more)
-minutes ago I finished 1-2 with my teammate (my team career again) and after crossing the finish line game registered him as DNF'd for absolutely no reason (on replay car appeared to just keep going as if the race never ended)

Not to mention the absolute joke that F1 Life is. Failed attempt at getting some more cash out of players. Failed because nobody cares about that mode. Rather get some F1 scenarios like in previous games than another sofa skin.

Overally, I am very dissapointed in this game and surely not going to buy the next year's edition. Gave this one some time as I believed the bugs will be fixed. Sadly, it does not seem like they will be. Didn't even see the weather problem adressed anywhere, AI traction was claimed to be fixed while it's clearly still a problem.
